https://openalex.org/W2000195190,"Recently, SAMHD1 has come under intense focus as a host anti-HIV factor. SAMHD1 is a dNTP triphosphohydrolase, which leads to the regulation of DNA metabolism in host cells. HIV-2/SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) viral protein x (Vpx) has been shown to promote the degradation of SAMHD1. In this study, we examine the kinetics of SAMHD1 degradation, the increase in the dNTP pool level, and the efficiency of proviral DNA synthesis in Vpx+ virus-like particle (VLP)-treated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Our results indicate a very close temporal link with a reduction in SAMHD1 detected within the first few hours of Vpx+ VLP treatment. This loss of SAMHD1 is followed by a significant increase in cellular dNTP levels by 8 h after Vpx+ VLP addition, ultimately leading to the enhancement of the HIV proviral DNA synthesis rate and HIV infection in MDMs. Finally, the pretreatment of MDMs with the Vpx+ VLPs, which is a widely used protocol, displayed identical proviral DNA synthesis as compared with MDMs co-treated with Vpx+ VLP and HIV vector. These findings further indicate that Vpx degradation of SAMHD1 is sufficiently rapid to enable appropriate progression of reverse transcription in MDMs, even when present at the time of infection. Overall, this study demonstrates a tight interplay between SAMHD1 level, dNTP levels, and HIV proviral DNA synthesis kinetics in MDMs. Recently, SAMHD1 has come under intense focus as a host anti-HIV factor.

It was hypothesized that SAMHD1 may delay the HIV/SIV reverse transcription step by lowering cellular dNTP pools. sterile α motif domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 viral protein x viral protein r virus-like particle monocyte-derived macrophage simian immunodeficiency virus quantitative real-time PCR Tris-buffered saline with Tween ribonucleotide reductase. In 2004, for the first time, we reported that human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) harbor ∼100 times lower cellular dNTP pools (20–40 nm) than activated CD4+ T cells (1–5 μm) (9Diamond T.L.

Collectively, these data suggest that the reduced dNTP pool in MDMs is a biochemical host factor that restricts HIV-1 reverse transcription. Indeed, the series of recent studies indicated above, including our recent study (11Lahouassa H. Daddacha W. Hofmann H. Ayinde D. Logue E.C. Dragin L. Bloch N. Maudet C. Bertrand M. Gramberg T. Pancino G. Priet S. Canard B. Laguette N. Benkirane M. Transy C. Landau N.R. Kim B. Margottin-Goguet F.

Immunol. 2012; 13: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), confirmed that SAMHD1 is responsible for the low dNTP concentrations found in MDMs. However, after our study, we immediately investigated how tightly regulated the three key reported molecular events are: 1) degradation of SAMHD1, 2) increase in dNTP levels, and 3) HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis kinetics influenced by Vpx treatment in MDMs. These events essentially encompass the complete mechanistic parameters of the dNTP-HIV replication landscape in nondividing cells. Our laboratory has the capability to measure dNTP pools in nondividing cells such as MDMs using the HIV-1 RT-based dNTP assay (9Diamond T.L. Roshal M. Jamburuthugoda V.K. Reynolds H.M. Merriam A.R. Lee K.Y. Balakrishnan M. Bambara R.A. Planelles V. Dewhurst S. Kim B. Macrophage tropism of HIV-1 depends on efficient cellular dNTP utilization by reverse transcriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51545-51553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which is sensitive enough to detect the low dNTP levels and not ribonucleoside triphosphates in MDMs. Therefore, we simultaneously monitored these three molecular events after Vpx treatment in MDMs. These experiments used primary human primary monocytes obtained from human buffy coats (New York Blood Services, Long Island, NY). These are preexisting materials that are publicly available, and there is no subject-identifying information associated with the cells. As such, the use of these samples does not represent human subjects research because: 1) materials were not collected specifically for this study, and 2) we are not able to identify the subjects. Primary human monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood buffy coats by positive selection using MACS® CD14+ beads as described previously (12Chugh P. Bradel-Tretheway B. Monteiro-Filho C.M. Planelles V. Maggirwar S.B. Dewhurst S. Kim B. Akt inhibitors as an HIV-1-infected macrophage-specific antiviral therapy.Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Monocytes were maturated into MDMs in the presence of 5 ng/ml human GM-CSF (Miltenyi Biotec) treated at days 0 and 2 of maturation. MDMs were used at day 7 of maturation for experiments. RPMI medium (10% FBS with antibiotics) was replaced before transducing with virus-like particles (VLPs) and D3-HIV GFP vectors. For quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) 2LTR circle copy number analysis, 1 million cells/well (6-well plates) were treated with VLPs (145 ng of p27/well), and total DNA was harvested using a Promega genomic purification kit. Two different VLP conditions were used: 2 h of pretreatment and co-treatment when treating with D3-HIV GFP vector (2.2 × 105 ng of p24/well, roughly a multiplicity of infection 0.1). For Western blot analysis and dNTP analysis, 2 million cells (3-cm dishes) were treated with 290 ng of p27/dish. Due to the requirement for large amounts of VLPs to concomitantly treat samples from the same donor for all the different assays, we subsequently modified the protocol from Berger et al. (8Berger G. Durand S. Goujon C. Nguyen X.N. Cordeil S. Darlix J.L. Cimarelli A. A simple, versatile, and efficient method to genetically modify human monocyte-derived dendritic cells with HIV-1-derived lentiviral vectors.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Six T225 flasks containing 293T cells were transfected with 40 μg of pVpx− VLP or pVpx+ VLP (kindly provided by Drs. Florence Margottin-Goguet and Nathaniel Landau) and 20 μg of pVSVg at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 5 μl of polyethylenimine (1 mg/ml; PEI). The following day, medium were discarded and replaced with fresh DMEM medium (5% FBS and antibiotics). On days 2–4 after transfection, the medium was collected and replaced with fresh medium. On the day of collection, medium was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min to remove cells. Supernatant was subsequently filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane (Corning Inc.). Thirty milliliters of supernatant were overlaid on top of 5 ml of a 25% sucrose cushion (25% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA). VLPs were concentrated at 28,000 rpm for 90 min by ultracentrifugation. Supernatant was aspirated, and pellets were suspended in 700 μl of serum-free DMEM. Aliquots (50 μl) were stored at −80 °C. Each harvest was processed that day. The p27 antigen level was determined using an ELISA kit (Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc., Rockville MD). D3-HIV GFP plasmid encodes the HIV-1 NL4-3 genome with the enhanced GFP gene in place of the HIV-1 nef gene and has a deleted envelope (9Diamond T.L. Roshal M. Jamburuthugoda V.K. Reynolds H.M. Merriam A.R. Lee K.Y. Balakrishnan M. Bambara R.A. Planelles V. Dewhurst S. Kim B. Macrophage tropism of HIV-1 depends on efficient cellular dNTP utilization by reverse transcriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51545-51553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To generate virus, 293T cells in T225 flasks were transfected with 40 μg of pD3-HIV and 20 μg of pVSV-g plasmids using PEI in 37 ml of DMEM medium/flask. At day 1 of HIV-1 production, media were discarded and replaced with fresh DMEM medium. At day 2, medium was harvested and replaced with fresh DMEM medium. The medium was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 7 min to remove cellular debris and then stored at 4 °C in a T75 flask. Day 3 medium was harvested and processed as described for day 2. D3-HIV GFP virus was concentrated using ultracentrifugation (22,000 rpm for 2 h in a SW28 rotor). Viral pellets were DNase I-digested for 1 h at 37 °C. Afterward, debris was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 5 min). Sample aliquots were frozen at −80 °C until used. The level of p24 antigen was determined using an ELISA kit (Advanced BioScience Laboratories Inc.). Samples were analyzed for GFP expression at 24 or 48 h after transduction using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data files were analyzed using the FlowJo software (TreeStar). The nucleotide incorporation assay employs a 19-mer DNA template (3′-CAGGGAGAAGCCCGCGGTN-5′). The template is annealed to a 5′ end 32P-labeled 18-mer DNA primer (5′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA-3′) for the HIV-1 RT-based assay used for this reaction, and the standard curves made with known amounts of dNTPs were used to covert the percentage of primer extension into the dNTP quantity used in each reaction as described previously (13Weiss K.K. Chen R. Skasko M. Reynolds H.M. Lee K. Bambara R.A. Mansky L.M. Kim B. A role for dNTP binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase in viral mutagenesis.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). MDMs were collected and lysed with 60% cold methanol. Samples were incubated at 95 °C for 3 min. Cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Supernatant was dried in a SpeedVac. Pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2). Two microliters of the sample extract were used in the primer extension assay. Reactions were resolved on 14% urea-PAGE. Data were captured using a PMI instrument (Bio-Rad) and then analyzed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The amounts of dNTPs per cell and the macrophage cell volume were used to calculate cellular dNTP concentration as described. Samples were processed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1 μm DTT, 10 μm PMSF, 10 μl/ml phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma), and 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor (Sigma). The cells were sonicated with three 5-s pulses to ensure compete lysis. Cellular debris was removed by 15,000 rpm centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C before use. Cell lysates (20 μg) were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 2% nonfat milk in TBST for 1 h followed by the addition of primary SAMHD1 antibody (Abcam) and incubation overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the membrane was washed (3×, 20 min with TBST) and stained with donkey anti-rabbit HRP for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane was washed (3× with TBST) and developed using the SuperSignal West Femto Kit (Thermo Scientific). The membrane was stripped and reprobed for actin. Images were captured using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Imager. Data were normalized to actin as a loading control. Primary human MDMs from three donors were treated with VLPs with and without Vpx. MDMs were harvested for analysis at the indicated time points: 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h. We chose this intense sampling scheme to investigate the interplay among three key reported molecular events: 1) degradation of SAMHD1, 2) increase in dNTP levels, and 3) HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis kinetics for each donor tested. A representative Western blot for SAMHD1 and actin is displayed (Fig. 1A). As can clearly be observed, Vpx− VLPs did not promote SAMHD1 degradation. However, by 4 h after Vpx+ VLP treatment, a noticeable decrease in SAMHD1 protein level was detected. Data compilations for the three independent donors are shown in Fig. 1B and show significant reduction in SAMHD1 level at 2 h. Moreover, the SAMHD1 level continued to decrease to undetectable levels by 48 h after Vpx+ VLP addition. Next, we examined changes in cellular dNTP levels for MDMs using the highly sensitive HIV RT-based assay (9Diamond T.L. Roshal M. Jamburuthugoda V.K. Reynolds H.M. Merriam A.R. Lee K.Y. Balakrishnan M. Bambara R.A. Planelles V. Dewhurst S. Kim B. Macrophage tropism of HIV-1 depends on efficient cellular dNTP utilization by reverse transcriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51545-51553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A representative gel for the HIV RT-based primer extension assay is shown in Fig. 2A. The top panel shows the controls: no dNTPs and a sample with exogenous dNTPs added to have no extension (Primer) and extension (Primer +1), respectively. MDM extracts from Vpx− VLPs treatment (Fig. 2A, top) show only moderate amounts of extended products over the time course. Importantly, this is in contrast to MDM extracts from Vpx+ VLP treatment (Fig. 2A, bottom), which show much more extended products at 4 h after VLP treatment. The data were quantitated and displayed in Fig. 2B as a graph for the three independent donors. We detected a significant difference (p < 0.05) with the dNTP levels starting 8 h after Vpx+ VLPs treatment. Importantly, the dNTP levels rapidly increased 8–18 h after treatment before reaching a plateau. Moreover, dNTP levels increased concomitantly with SAMHD1 degradation. This supports previous studies indicating that SAMHD1 degradation by Vpx directly results in a subsequent increase in cellular dNTP levels in MDMs (6Hrecka K. Hao C. Gierszewska M. Swanson S.K.

Next, because the dNTP abundance is directly related with DNA polymerization kinetics, we examined the time-dependent proviral DNA synthesis kinetics by measuring 2LTR circle copy numbers using the qPCR technique. 2LTR circles are defective proviral DNA products that have failed to integrate into the host genome. Moreover, they are commonly used as a surrogate to monitor late proviral synthesis steps in the HIV life cycle (15Butler S.L. Johnson E.P. Bushman F.D.

Reinhard C. Luban J. Vpx rescues HIV-1 transduction of dendritic cells from the antiviral state established by type 1 interferon.Retrovirology. 2011; 8: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3A, the pretreatment of MDMs with the Vpx+ VLPs accelerated proviral DNA synthesis tracking with the increase in dNTP levels. The 2-h pretreatment with the VLPs is a commonly used protocol to investigate the impact of Vpx on lentiviral vector transduction. Next, we compared the proviral DNA synthesis kinetics in MDMs with either the co-treatment with both VLPs and HIV vector or the 2-h pretreatment. As depicted in Fig. 3, A and B, both the pretreatment and the co-treatment with Vpx+ VLPs led to enhanced 2LTR circle copy numbers as compared with the MDMs treated with Vpx− VLPs. Both Vpx+ treatment groups were significantly higher than Vpx− treatment groups at 12 h after D3-HIV GFP addition and continuously increased even up to 48 h. Both Vpx+ VLPs treatment groups reached similar 2LTR copy numbers by 48 h. We also examined GFP expression by FACS and found comparable frequency of GFP+ cells in both the pretreated and the co-treated Vpx+ VLP groups (supplemental Fig. 1). Collectively, our data presented in this study strongly support that the accelerated reverse transcription kinetics is induced by the tight interplay between SAMHD1 degradation and dNTP pool increase, which greatly improves the overall success rate of proviral DNA synthesis completion in nondividing cells. Vpx is believed to have arisen from gene duplication from Vpr (18Tristem M. Marshall C. Karpas A. Petrik J. Hill F. Origin of vpx in lentiviruses.Nature. 1990; 347: 341-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although sequence similarities exist between Vpr and Vpx, they have different cellular functions (19Casey L. Wen X. de Noronha C.M.

Recently, Sunseri et al. (27Sunseri N. O'Brien M. Bhardwaj N. Landau N.R. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 modified to package simian immunodeficiency virus Vpx efficiently infects macrophages and dendritic cells.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 6263-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have shown that a modified Vpx can be incorporated into HIV-1 via p6. Although in this system, Vpx competes with Vpr for packaging into the virion, the authors found enhancement of transduction efficiency. Moreover, Vpx proteins from different lentiviruses, SIV versus HIV-2, have different activities in promoting transduction of MDM and dendritic cell populations, with SIV being more effective at enhancing transduction. Alternatively, the amount of Vpx being packaged within the virion could also be the reason for this observation because packaging of HIV-2 Vpx is reduced as compared with SIV of macaque Vpx (27Sunseri N. O'Brien M. Bhardwaj N. Landau N.R. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 modified to package simian immunodeficiency virus Vpx efficiently infects macrophages and dendritic cells.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 6263-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This may be of importance when trying to directly compare SIV versus HIV-2 or HIV-1 infection in animal models and humans. Moreover, Vpr is known to be released by infected cells and may negatively influence bystander cells (28Muthumani K. Montaner L.J. Ayyavoo V. Weiner D.B. Vpr-GFP virion particle identifies HIV-infected targets and preserves HIV-1Vpr function in macrophages and T-cells.DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Vpx may also be released from infected cells and influence bystander cells. However, a putative model would be that Vpx, unlike Vpr, would promote infection of macrophage and dendritic cells, both nondividing cells, by down-regulating SAMHD1 expression at the site of infection. In addition to SAMHD1 degradation by Vpx, we believe that intracellular dNTP biosynthesis is required. Briefly, dNTP biosynthesis occurs through ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the de novo synthesis pathway, and the salvage pathway. In eukaryotes, RNR is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of R1 and either R2 or p53R2 subunits (29Stubbe J. Ribonucleotide reductases: the link between an RNA and a DNA world?.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This heterodimeric complex catalyzes the conversion of ribose nucleoside diphosphates into deoxynucleoside diphosphate (30Herrick J. Sclavi B. Ribonucleotide reductase and the regulation of DNA replication: an old story and an ancient heritage.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and is highly regulated within the cell by the expression of the R2 subunits, cellular localization of subunits, and substrate feedback control mechanisms (31Elledge S.J.

Biol. 2012; 47: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Deoxynucleoside diphosphates require an additional phosphorylation step to become dNTPs, which then serve as a substrate for DNA polymerases and HIV-1 RT. R2 is mainly expressed during the S phase of the cell cycle (35Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Ribonucleotide reductase: regulation, regulation, regulation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), whereas p53R2 is induced upon DNA damage (36Guittet O. Håkansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Gräslund A. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Thelander L. Mammalian p53R2 protein forms an active ribonucleotide reductase in vitro with the R1 protein, which is expressed both in resting cells in response to DNA damage and in proliferating cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40647-40651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have not detected an increase in either R2 or p53R2 levels within the Vpx+ VLP-treated MDMs (data not shown). However, the functional activity of this complex still remains to be measured at this time. We speculate that Vpx may be influencing the RNR and kinase activities concomitantly with promoting SAMHD1 degradation to rapidly increase cellular dNTP levels in nondividing cells.

Yet, to date, there have been few systematic studies that examine how scientists understand the barriers that impede such outreach. Through analysis of 97 semi-structured interviews with academic biologists and physicists at top research universities in the United States, we classify the type and target audiences of scientists’ outreach activities. Finally, we explore the narratives academic scientists have about outreach and its reception in the academy, in particular what they perceive as impediments to these activities. We find that scientists’ outreach activities are stratified by gender and that university and disciplinary rewards as well as scientists’ perceptions of their own skills have an impact on science outreach. Research contributions and recommendations for university policy follow."
https://openalex.org/W2094411298,"Many processes critical to plant growth and development are regulated by the hormone auxin. Auxin responses are initiated through activation of a transcriptional response mediated by the TIR1/AFB family of F-box protein auxin receptors as well as the AUX/IAA and ARF families of transcriptional regulators. However, there is little information on how auxin regulates a specific cellular response. To begin to address this question, we have focused on auxin regulation of cell expansion in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl. We show that auxin-mediated hypocotyl elongation is dependent upon the TIR1/AFB family of auxin receptors and degradation of AUX/IAA repressors. We also use microarray studies of elongating hypocotyls to show that a number of growth-associated processes are activated by auxin including gibberellin biosynthesis, cell wall reorganization and biogenesis, and others. Our studies indicate that GA biosynthesis is required for normal response to auxin in the hypocotyl but that the overall transcriptional auxin output consists of PIF-dependent and -independent genes. We propose that auxin acts independently from and interdependently with PIF and GA pathways to regulate expression of growth-associated genes in cell expansion."

In this context, classic orchestras are a remarkable instance of interaction and communication aimed at a common aesthetic goal: musicians train for years in order to acquire and share a non-linguistic framework for sensorimotor communication. To this end, we recorded violinists' and conductors' movement kinematics during execution of Mozart pieces, searching for causal relationships among musicians by using the Granger Causality method (GC). We show that the increase of conductor-to-musicians influence, together with the reduction of musician-to-musician coordination (an index of successful leadership) goes in parallel with quality of execution, as assessed by musical experts' judgments. Rigorous quantification of sensorimotor communication efficacy has always been complicated and affected by rather vague qualitative methodologies. Here we propose that the analysis of motor behavior provides a potentially interesting tool to approach the rather intangible concept of aesthetic quality of music and visual communication efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2058111671,"Inotilone was isolated from Phellinus linteus. The anti-inflammatory effects of inotilone were studied by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and λ-carrageenan (Carr)-induced hind mouse paw edema model. Inotilone was tested for its ability to reduce nitric oxide (NO) production, and the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Inotilone was tested in the inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38], and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 protein expressions in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. When RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with inotilone together with LPS, a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of NO production was detected. Western blotting revealed that inotilone blocked the protein expression of iNOS, NF-κB, and MMP-9 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages, significantly. Inotilone also inhibited LPS-induced ERK, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation. In in vivo tests, inotilone decreased the paw edema at the 4th and the 5th h after Carr administration, and it increased the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). We also demonstrated that inotilone significantly attenuated the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the edema paw at the 5th h after Carr injection. Inotilone decreased the NO and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) levels on serum at the 5th h after Carr injection. Western blotting revealed that inotilone decreased Carr-induced iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), NF-κB, and MMP-9 expressions at the 5th h in the edema paw. An intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection treatment with inotilone diminished neutrophil infiltration into sites of inflammation, as did indomethacin (Indo). The anti-inflammatory activities of inotilone might be related to decrease the levels of MDA, iNOS, COX-2, NF-κB, and MMP-9 and increase the activities of CAT, SOD, and GPx in the paw edema through the suppression of TNF-α and NO. This study presents the potential utilization of inotilone, as a lead for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2085316561,"An imbalance between overwhelming inflammation and lymphocyte apoptosis is the main cause of high mortality in patients with sepsis. Baicalin, the main active ingredient of the Scutellaria root, exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and even antibacterial properties in inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, the therapeutic effect of baicalin on polymicrobial sepsis remains unknown.Polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were infused with baicalin intraperitoneally at 1 h, 6 h and 12 h after CLP. Survival rates were assessed over the subsequent 8 days. Bacterial burdens in blood and peritoneal cavity were calculated to assess the bacterial clearance. Neutrophil count in peritoneal lavage fluid was also calculated. Injuries to the lung and liver were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Levels of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and IL-17, in blood and peritoneum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Adaptive immune function was assessed by apoptosis of lymphocytes in the thymus and counts of different cell types in the spleen. Baicalin significantly enhanced bacterial clearance and improved survival of septic mice. The number of neutrophils in peritoneal lavage fluid was reduced by baicalin. Less neutrophil infiltration of the lung and liver in baicalin-treated mice was associated with attenuated injuries to these organs. Baicalin significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines but increased the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine in blood and peritoneum. Apoptosis of CD3(+) T cell was inhibited in the thymus. The numbers of CD4(+), CD8(+) T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) were higher, while the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells was lower in the baicalin group compared with the CLP group.Baicalin improves survival of mice with polymicrobial sepsis, and this may be attributed to its antibacterial property as well as its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects."

With regard to the secondary structure elements, these studies revealed that oligomers and protofibrils already exhibit the characteristic two β-strand sections connected by a short loop also present in mature Aβ fibrils. However, there are several significant differences between theses species. For instance, the first β-strand of Aβ oligomers and protofibrils is significantly shorter than that in mature Aβ fibrils and has to elongate during the conversion from protofibrils to mature fibrils (20Scheidt H.A.

Such an arrangement is necessary to form the characteristic cross-β-structure, which is present in all amyloid protein fibrils. Therefore, the structural transition from Aβ oligomers into mature Aβ fibrils necessitates a 90° rotation of the β-strands upon maturation (see Fig. 1). The current model suggests that this switch from intra- to intermolecular hydrogen bonds occurs during the conversion from protofibrils to mature fibrils (14Sandberg A. Luheshi L.M. Söllvander S.

So far, support for this model comes from the observation that double cysteine mutants of Aβ(1–40) and also Aβ(1–42), which are forced to retain the molecular structure of an oligomer by the cysteine bond, can form only protofibrils but not mature fibrils (14Sandberg A. Luheshi L.M. Söllvander S. Pereira de Barros T. Macao B. Knowles T.P. Biverstål H. Lendel C. Ekholm-Petterson F. Dubnovitsky A. Lannfelt L. Dobson C.M. Härd T.

Protein engineering to stabilize soluble amyloid-β protein aggregates for structural and functional studies.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown by IR spectroscopy that, in oligomers and protofibrils, the β-sheets are antiparallel (18Cerf E. Sarroukh R. Tamamizu-Kato S. Breydo L. Derclaye S. Dufrêne Y.F.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19232-19237Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), whereas mature Aβ fibrils exhibit parallel β-sheets as shown by solid-state NMR (25Antzutkin O.N. Amyloidosis of Alzheimer Aβ peptides: solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy studies.Magn. Reson. Chem. 2004; 42: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To obtain more structural data, we used 13C solid-state NMR to investigate the contact between Glu-22 and Ile-31 of Aβ(1–40) protofibrils, which are by stabilized by the B10AP antibody as reported previously (24Habicht G. Haupt C. Friedrich R.P. Hortschansky P. Sachse C. Meinhardt J. Wieligmann K. Gellermann G.P. Brodhun M. Götz J. Halbhuber K.J. Röcken C. Horn U. Fändrich M.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19232-19237Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Glu-22 and Ile-31 and, in particular, the side chains of these residues should become very close in space in the oligomeric structure as illustrated in Fig. 1. From the Protein Data Bank coordinates (15Hoyer W. Grönwall C. Jonsson A. Ståhl S. Härd T. Stabilization of a β-hairpin in monomeric Alzheimer amyloid-β peptide inhibits amyloid formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5099-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), one can calculate a distance of 5.3 Å between the α-carbons of Glu-22 and Ile-31; the side chain carbons show similar close proximities. In contrast, in mature Aβ fibrils (11Bertini I. Gonnelli L. Luchinat C. Mao J. Nesi A. A new structural model of Aβ40 fibrils.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 16013-16022Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), these residues point into different directions out of the cross-β-core of the fibrils, yielding a distance of 12.4 Å between the α-carbons of Glu-22 and Ile-31 and up to ∼18 Å between the side chain carbons. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 using the Protein Data Bank coordinates of these two structures. For protofibrils, no molecular structure with atomic resolution is available so far, but solid-state NMR work revealed that the secondary structure elements of protofibrils are more closely related to oligomers than to mature Aβ fibrils (20Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M. Solid-state NMR spectroscopic investigation of Aβ protofibrils: implication of a β-sheet remodeling upon maturation into terminal amyloid fibrils.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 2837-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, solid-state NMR measurements should reveal the arrangement of the two β-sheets in protofibrils and give insights in their tertiary fold. The Aβ(1–40) peptides were produced by standard solid-phase synthesis according to the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocol using fully 13C/15N-labeled Ser-8, Glu-22, and Ile-31. B10AP-stabilized protofibrils were prepared in 1-ml samples (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 50 mm NaCl) containing 4 mg/ml labeled Aβ(1–40) and B10AP at a 10:1 molar ratio. The samples were incubated for 3 days (37 °C). For mature Aβ(1–40) fibrils, the labeled peptide was solubilized in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 9) at a concentration of 6 mg/ml. The sample was seeded and incubated at 37 °C for 1 week. Seeds consisted of Aβ(1–40) mature fibrils previously grown and seeded under the same conditions (second generation) and were sonicated for 10 min before addition to the sample. It has been shown that, also under these conditions, the structural properties of the mature fibrils agreed well with fibrils grown at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffer (13Scheidt H.A. Morgado I.

In both cases, the peptide aggregates were recovered by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C (TLA-120.2 rotor, Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge). The pellet was lyophilized, rehydrated with 50 weight % H2O, and homogenized by freezing the sample in liquid nitrogen and thawing it at 37 °C. The morphology of the samples was checked by transmission electron microscopy (supplemental Fig. S1). The 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE 750 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at resonance frequencies of 749.7 MHz for 1H and 188.5 MHz for 13C. A 4-mm double-resonance magic angle spinning probe was used. The length of the cross-polarization contact time was 700 μs, and the 90° pulse was 5 μs for 13C and 4 μs for 1H. For heteronuclear two-pulse phase modulation decoupling, a 1H radiofrequency field of 65 kHz was applied. 13C chemical shifts were referenced externally relative to TMS. The peak assignment was taken from the literature (13Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Dynamics of amyloid-β fibrils revealed by solid-state NMR.J. Biol.

Engl. 2011; 50: 2837-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional 13C-13C proton-driven spin exchange spectra were acquired with a mixing time of 600 ms and covariance-processed (26Zhang F. Brüschweiler R. Indirect covariance NMR spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13180-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A total of 64 complex data points were acquired in the indirect dimension at a spectral width of 190 ppm. For the protofibrils, 640 transients per increment were acquired, whereas 2096 scans were acquired for two-dimensional spectra of the mature Aβ fibrils at 58 t1 increments. To measure 13C-1H dipolar couplings, constant time DIPSHIFT experiments with FSLG (frequency-switched Lee-Goldburg) (27Munowitz M.G. Griffin R.G. Bodenhausen G. Huang T.H.

Soc. 1981; 103: 2529-2533Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar) or MREV-8 (28Rhim W.K. Elleman D.D. Vaughan R.W. Enhanced resolution for solid-state NMR.J. Chem. Phys. 1973; 58: 1772-1773Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar) for homonuclear decoupling (80-kHz decoupling field) were performed. The order parameter was derived by dividing the determined coupling by the known rigid limits (29Barre P. Zschornig O. Arnold K. Huster D.

All NMR experiments were carried out at a temperature of 30 °C and a magic angle spinning frequency of 7 or 5 kHz (DIPSHIFT or MREV-8). Fig. 2 shows characteristic 13C-13C proton-driven spin diffusion correlation spectra of Aβ(1–40) protofibrils (panel A) and mature Aβ fibrils (panel B) both with uniformly 13C/15N-labeled Ser-8, Glu-22, and Ile-31. The spectra show all of the trivial intraresidue correlations within the labeled amino acids. As a long mixing time of 600 ms was used, also interresidue correlations can be observed. All magnetization exchange, which gives rise to a cross-peak in the proton-driven spin diffusion spectra, is caused by dipolar interactions with a distance dependence of r−6 (31Schmidt-Rohr K. Spiess H.W. Multidimensional Solid-State NMR and Polymers. Academic Press, London1994: 95-98Google Scholar). In addition, the 13C-13C correlation spectra of Aβ protofibrils clearly show cross-peaks between Glu-22 and Ile-31, especially between the Cα and Cβ signals of Glu-22 at 52.6 and 32.6 ppm and between the Cδ and Cϵ signals of Ile-31 at 16.1 and 12.5 ppm. This means that, in Aβ protofibrils, Ile-31 and Glu-22 are in close proximity (<6–7 Å), which is observable by 13C-13C correlation spectroscopy (32Huster D. Investigations of the structure and dynamics of membrane-associated peptides by magic angle spinning NMR.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2005; 46: 79-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cross-peaks between the other carbons of these two amino acids (including the cross-peak Glu-22 Cα–Ile-31 Cα) are weaker and only sparsely above the noise level, even when using covariance NMR processing, which is known to enhance small cross-peaks (33Masuda Y. Fukuchi M. Yatagawa T. Tada M. Takeda K. Irie K. Akagi K. Monobe Y. Imazawa T. Takegoshi K. Solid-state NMR analysis of interaction sites of curcumin and 42-residue amyloid-β protein fibrils.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2011; 19: 5967-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For comparison, the standard Fourier transform-processed two-dimensional NMR spectrum is shown in supplemental Fig. S2. For comparison, we conducted the same experiment using mature Aβ fibrils grown from Aβ(1–40) peptides using the same amino acid labeling procedure. In the NMR spectrum of this sample (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2B), no cross-peaks between Glu-22 and Ile-31 are visible, as expected from the molecular structure of mature fibrils (Fig. 1B). Please note that there are some differences in the chemical shift values between Aβ protofibrils and mature Aβ fibrils for these amino acids as reported previously (13Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Dynamics of amyloid-β fibrils revealed by solid-state NMR.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 2017-2021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M. Solid-state NMR spectroscopic investigation of Aβ protofibrils: implication of a β-sheet remodeling upon maturation into terminal amyloid fibrils.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 2837-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To confirm that the differences in the NMR spectra are not just the result of the choice of contour levels in the two-dimensional plots, we also extracted slices from the two-dimensional spectra, which are shown in Fig. 3 (see also supplemental Fig. S3 for the standard Fourier transform-processed spectra). Again, the cross-peaks from Glu-22 to the side chain of Ile-31 are only observable for the Aβ protofibrils but not for the mature Aβ fibrils. The structural differences in Aβ protofibrils and mature fibrils are also reflected in the molecular dynamics of the residues investigated. As shown in Fig. 4, the order parameters of the amino acid side chains determined from motionally averaged dipolar couplings show a clear tendency to be lower in mature Aβ fibrils than in Aβ protofibrils. If one assumes a similar structural arrangement of the β-sheets in Aβ oligomers (Fig. 1) and in protofibrils, the interaction of the side chains of Glu-22 and Ile-31 leads to a motional restriction and therefore the higher order parameters in protofibrils. The decreased order parameters of these side chains in mature Aβ fibrils are caused by the additional degrees of motional freedom the side chains can undergo when they are pointing out of the cross-β-core of the fibrils (Fig. 1). It should be noted that binding of the B10 antibody has no significant influence on the order parameters of Glu-22 and Ile-31 (13Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D.

Engl. 2011; 50: 2837-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We conclude that Glu-22 and Ile-31 are in close proximity in Aβ protofibrils but are significantly more distant in mature Aβ fibrils (as suggested by the structural model of both species sketched in Fig. 1B). This means that the Aβ protofibrils share some similarity in tertiary structure with Aβ oligomers, a finding that was already suggested from the analysis of secondary chemical shifts (20Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M. Solid-state NMR spectroscopic investigation of Aβ protofibrils: implication of a β-sheet remodeling upon maturation into terminal amyloid fibrils.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 2837-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Further support for this conclusion comes from a previous experimental finding that Phe-19 and Leu-34 are in close proximity in Aβ protofibrils (20Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M. Solid-state NMR spectroscopic investigation of Aβ protofibrils: implication of a β-sheet remodeling upon maturation into terminal amyloid fibrils.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 2837-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) as well as in oligomers (16Ahmed M. Davis J. Aucoin D. Sato T. Ahuja S. Aimoto S. Elliott J.I. Van Nostrand W.E. Smith S.O. Structural conversion of neurotoxic amyloid-β(1–42) oligomers to fibrils.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), where the distance between the Phe ring and Leu δ-carbons is 3.9 Å. However, contacts between the side chains of these residues have also been observed in mature Aβ fibrils (distance of ∼7 Å) (10Paravastu A.K. Leapman R.D. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Molecular structural basis for polymorphism in Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18349-18354Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 34Tycko R. Molecular structure of amyloid fibrils: insights from solid-state NMR.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 1-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), rendering this pair of residues less indicative of a tertiary structural conversion from protofibrils to mature Aβ fibrils. Our findings suggest that there has to be a rearrangement of the two β-strands of Aβ protofibrils during the conversion to mature Aβ fibrils. Of course, we can only speculate about the nature of the hydrogen bonds in protofibrils, but because the close proximity between Glu-22 and Ile-31 is already known from Aβ oligomers (15Hoyer W. Grönwall C. Jonsson A. Ståhl S. Härd T. Stabilization of a β-hairpin in monomeric Alzheimer amyloid-β peptide inhibits amyloid formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5099-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), one can assume that the β-strands in Aβ protofibrils may also form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This can be comprehended by a closer structural relationship between Aβ oligomers and protofibrils compared with protofibrils and mature fibrils as was suggested on the basis of 13C chemical shift data (20Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M. Solid-state NMR spectroscopic investigation of Aβ protofibrils: implication of a β-sheet remodeling upon maturation into terminal amyloid fibrils.Angew.

Sarroukh R. Tamamizu-Kato S. Breydo L. Derclaye S. Dufrêne Y.F. Narayanaswami V. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Raussens V.

Therefore, it seems possible that the rearrangement of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds takes place in the final structural transition from Aβ protofibrils to mature fibrils. Consequently, our solid-state NMR data would support the model for the aggregation mechanism of Aβ fibrils suggested by Härd and co-workers (15Hoyer W. Grönwall C. Jonsson A. Ståhl S. Härd T.

https://openalex.org/W2021703024,"Commercial whaling decimated many whale populations, including the eastern Pacific gray whale, but little is known about how population dynamics or ecology differed prior to these removals. Of particular interest is the possibility of a large population decline prior to whaling, as such a decline could explain the ∼5-fold difference between genetic estimates of prior abundance and estimates based on historical records. We analyzed genetic (mitochondrial control region) and isotopic information from modern and prehistoric gray whales using serial coalescent simulations and Bayesian skyline analyses to test for a pre-whaling decline and to examine prehistoric genetic diversity, population dynamics and ecology. Simulations demonstrate that significant genetic differences observed between ancient and modern samples could be caused by a large, recent population bottleneck, roughly concurrent with commercial whaling. Stable isotopes show minimal differences between modern and ancient gray whale foraging ecology. Using rejection-based Approximate Bayesian Computation, we estimate the size of the population bottleneck at its minimum abundance and the pre-bottleneck abundance. Our results agree with previous genetic studies suggesting the historical size of the eastern gray whale population was roughly three to five times its current size."

Dormancy shows common physiological features in buds and seeds. A genotype-specific period of chilling is usually required to release dormancy by molecular mechanisms that are still poorly understood. In order to find common transcriptional pathways associated to dormancy release, we analyzed the chilling-dependent expression in embryos of certain genes that were previously found related to dormancy in flower buds of peach. We propose the presence of short and long-term dormancy events affecting respectively the germination rate and seedling development by independent mechanisms. Short periods of chilling seem to improve germination in an abscisic acid-dependent manner, whereas the positive effect of longer cold treatments on physiological dwarfing coincides with the accumulation of phenylpropanoids in the seed."
https://openalex.org/W2059262899,"Background The GIHU004 study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three doses of DermaVir immunization in HIV-infected subjects on fully suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methodology/Principal Findings This first-in-human dose escalation study was conducted with three topical DermaVir doses targeted to epidermal Langerhans cells to express fifteen HIV antigens in draining lymph nodes: 0.1 mg DNA targeted to two, 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg DNA targeted to four lymph nodes. Particularly, in the medium dose cohort 0.1 mg DNA was targeted per draining lymph node via ∼8 million Langerhans cells located in 80 cm2 epidermis area. The 28-days study with 48-week safety follow-up evaluated HIV-specific T cell responses against Gag p17, Gag p24 and Gag p15, Tat and Rev antigens. DermaVir-associated side effects were mild, transient and not dose-dependent. Boosting of HIV-specific effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing IFN-gamma and IL-2 was detected against several antigens in every subject of the medium dose cohort. The striking result was the dose-dependent expansion of HIV-specific precursor/memory T cells with high proliferation capacity. In low, medium and high dose cohorts this HIV-specific T cell population increased by 325-, 136,202 and 50,759 counts after 4 weeks, and by 3,899, 9,878 and 18,382 counts after one year, respectively, compared to baseline. Conclusions/Significance Single immunization with the DermaVir candidate therapeutic vaccine was safe and immunogenic in HIV-infected individuals. Based on the potent induction of Gag, Tat and Rev-specific memory T cells, especially in the medium dose cohort, we speculate that DermaVir boost T cell responses specific to all the 15 HIV antigens expressed from the single DNA. For durable immune reactivity repeated DermaVir immunization might be required since the frequency of DermaVir-boosted HIV-specific memory T cells decreased during the 48-week follow up.

HR is initiated by the recognition of the double strand break by factors such as the MRN complex, that lead to the activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutate (ATM) kinase, which phosphorylates multiple targets within proximity of the damage (3Lukas J.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1161-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of the histone variant H2AX by ATM facilitates the association of the scaffold protein mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) at these sites (4Stucki M.

MDC1 is then phosphorylated on multiple residues, which results in the binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF8, via a selective interaction between the RNF8 forkhead-associated domain and one of three pThr-Gln-Xaa-Phe motifs in MDC1 (5Huen M.S.

RNF8 also contains a RING domain that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme heterodimer, Ubc13/Mms2, to ubiquitylate histones near the lesion (6Mailand N.

It is thought that a second E3 ligase, RNF168, is then recruited to the growing ubiquitin chains via its motifs that interact with ubiquitin (MIUs), and, through an interaction between its RING domain and Ubc13/Mms2, amplifies the ubiquitin chains initiated by RNF8 (9Doil C.

Receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) then specifically binds to the ubiquitin chains through its tandem ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), and through an interaction with the adapter protein Abraxas, BRCA1 is recruited (11Kim H.

Finally, the ubiquitin signal is attenuated by the Ubc13 inhibitory factor, OTU domain ubiquitin binding 1 (OTUB1) (14Nakada S. Tai I. Panier S. Al-Hakim A. Iemura S. Juang Y.C. O'Donnell L.

Noncanonical inhibition of DNA damage-dependent ubiquitination by OTUB1.Nature. 2010; 466: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation catalyzed by Ubc13/Mms2 generates a unique form of polyubiquitin characterized by linkages between Lys-63 of one ubiquitin and the C-terminal carboxylate of the next ubiquitin in the chain, and unlike Lys-48-linked chains, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation does not target the substrate for proteolysis. Ubc13/Mms2 consists of a catalytic E2, Ubc13, which contains an active site cysteine that forms a thioester linkage with the C terminus of ubiquitin, thereby activating it for polyubiquitin chain formation. Mms2 is an E2-like protein that interacts with Ubc13 and facilitates the binding of the acceptor ubiquitin in an orientation to promote isopeptide bond formation between Lys-63 of the acceptor ubiquitin and the C-terminal thioester of the donor ubiquitin (15VanDemark A.P.

The participation of Ubc13/Mms2 in distinct pathways is dependent on its interactions with different E3 partners. For example, interactions with the dimeric RING E3, TRAF6, recruits Ubc13 to the NF-κB signaling pathway, whereas interactions with the U-box E3, CHIP, enables Ubc13 to ubiquitylate chaperone-bound proteins (20Yin Q. Lin S.C. Lamothe B. Lu M. Lo Y.C. Hura G. Zheng L. Rich R.L. Campos A.D. Myszka D.G. Lenardo M.J. Darnay B.G. Wu H. E2 interaction and dimerization in the crystal structure of TRAF6.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Ubc13, as well as related E2s such as UbcH5, are selectively inhibited by OTUB1, a deubiquitylating enzyme, which binds the Ubc13∼Ub conjugate, likely directly inhibiting attack of the acceptor ubiquitin and blocking binding of RING E3 proteins (22Wiener R.

Although both RNF8 and RNF168 are important Ubc13 partners in the HR DNA repair pathway, the structural basis for their distinct functions is unclear. To address the roles of the RING domains of these E3 ligases, we probed their structures and abilities to catalyze Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation. RNF8 adopts a dimeric structure, stabilized by an extended coiled-coil that is novel in the RING protein family, and interacts with Ubc13 through a surface that is conserved in the TRAF6 RING domain as well as the CHIP U-box. The interaction between RNF8 and Ubc13/Mms2 markedly catalyzes polyubiquitylation. RNF168, in contrast, is a monomeric RING domain, and, although the core RING domain adopts a structure similar to RNF8, it does not bind Ubc13 or catalyze polyubiquitylation to the same extent. Our data show that the RING domain of RNF168 alone is not sufficient for its activity and that it is likely dependent on its additional structural moieties. The ability of RNF8 to build de novo Lys-63 ubiquitin chains points to its role in the initiation of ubiquitylation in HR. OpenBiosystems cDNA of RNF8 (MHS4771-99611437) was used as a template to clone RNF8345–485 and RN8392–485 into the vector pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). RNF1681–113 used for structure solution was cloned from an OpenBiosystems cDNA template (MHS1010-7508235) into the pET28a-LIC (GenBank) vector using the In-Fusion CF Dry-Down PCR Cloning kit (Clontech). RNF1681–200 was cloned using the OpenBiosystems cDNA template (MHS1010-7508235) and ligated into pGEX-6P-1. RNF1681–113 used for biochemical assays was also inserted into the vector pGEX-6P-1. Recombinant GST fusion RNF8 and RNF168 constructs and full-length Ubc13 and Mms2 were expressed in the vector pGEX-6P1 after transformation into Escherichia coli BL21 Gold (Invitrogen). Cells were pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 400 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnSO4 and 1 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol) and 1× HALT Protease Inhibitor solution (Pierce). Cells were lysed using sonication and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 rcf for 30 min. GST-RNF8 and GST-RNF168 were separated from the cleared lysate via a glutathione-S-Sepharose column and washed with lysis buffer. Recombinant proteins were cleaved from the GST on column with Precision Protease and further purified by gel filtration chromatography. RNF8, Ubc13, and Mms2 were concentrated in gel filtration buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnSO4, and mm DTT) quantified by a BCA assay, and mixed in a 1:1:1 molar ratio, respectively. The complex was then purified by gel filtration, concentrated in gel filtration buffer, and quantified. Ubc13 and Mms2 were cloned as described previously (19McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. Noncovalent interaction between ubiquitin and the human DNA repair protein Mms2 is required for Ubc13-mediated polyubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), expressed, and purified in a manner identical to RNF8 and RNF168. Mutants of RNF8, Ubc13, and RNF168 were made using PCR mutagenesis and the recombinant pGEX-6P-1 plasmids as a template. Inserts containing point mutants were then religated into pGEX-6P-1 and sequenced. RNF1681–113 used in structure solution was purified alternatively. After resuspension in 30 ml/liter bacterial culture of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor (Sigma)), cells were lysed using sonication. A volume of 2.0 ml of settled Talon resin/40 ml of lysate (Clontech) was rocked with unclarified lysate for 60 min at 4 °C and transferred to a column. Protein was eluted with 30 ml of elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 volumes of dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT). The His6 tag was cut with thrombin, and the resultant protein was further purified by gel filtration and concentrated. The RNF8345–485/Ubc13/Mms2 complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnSO4, and 1 mm DTT). Crystals were grown using vapor diffusion in 0.075 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 1.0 m ammonium phosphate and grew to ∼200 μm after 1 month. Data were collected at beamline 12.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source. The complex structure was solved by Phaser using the Ubc13/Mms2 crystal structure (PDB ID code 1J7D) as a search model (24McCoy A.J. Solving structures of protein complexes by molecular replacement with Phaser.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Two molecules of Ubc13/Mms2 were found initially, and RNF8 was built manually into the positive Fo − Fc density. A homology model made up of multiple RING domains built manually in PyMOL and the zinc positions from an anomalous difference map were used as a guide for model building. The model was refined by rigid body refinement in PHENIX (25Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J.

The RNF8345–485/Ubc13/Mms2 complex structure was used as a search model in Phaser against the Se-Met data, and the resulting pdb file was used to calculate an anomalous difference map and determine the methionine positions.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParameterRNF8345–483/Ubc13/Mms2RNF8345–485/Ubc13/Mms2 Se-MetRNF1681–113Crystal parametersSpace groupP42212P42212P43212Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)205.3, 205.3, 235.4204.0, 234.0, 234.249.7, 49.7, 110.2α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 90Data collectionWavelength (Å)1.115850.979201.54Resolution (Å)123–4.80200–9.0045.3–2.12RsymaRsym = Σ|(Ihkl) − <I>|Σ(Ihkl), where Ihkl is the integrated intensity of a given reflection.6.3 (51.3)13.5 (35.8)12.4 (64.3)I/σI24.3 (2.68)7.2 (2.66)40.1 (5.17)Completeness (%)97.8 (99.4)73.1 (70.3)99.4 (99.7)Redundancy6.8 (5.6)4.3 (4.4)53.4 (54.3)RefinementResolution (Å)123–4.80NAbNA, not applicable.45.3–2.12No. reflections45,858NA8,384Rwork/Rfree30.1/31.7NA18.9/21.5No. atomsProtein10,547NA831Water0NA34Zinc10NA2Overall B-factor (Å2)175NA23.5Root mean square deviationsBond lengths0.009NA0.024Bond angles1.44NA2.42RamachandranPreferred (%)93.2NA96.0Allowed (%)6.8NA4.0Disallowed (%)0NA0a Rsym = Σ|(Ihkl) − <I>|Σ(Ihkl), where Ihkl is the integrated intensity of a given reflection.b NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab RNF1681–113 crystals were grown at 18 °C using the sitting drop method by mixing equal volumes of protein (10 mg/ml) and crystallization buffer (1.5 sodium malonate, pH 7.3). Suitable crystals were cryoprotected by immersion in 2.4 m sodium malonate, pH 7.3, supplemented with 10% trimethylamine oxide (v/v) prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected using a home source (Rigaku FRE SuperBright). All data sets were integrated and scaled using the XDS package (27Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using both molecular replacement and the weak phases derived from a Sulfur-SAD. MOLREP was used for molecular replacement with the model (PDB ID code 3FL2) (28Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). Automated model building using ARP/wARP, combined with iterative model building using the graphics program COOT, was used to build the final model (29Cohen S.X. Ben Jelloul M. Long F. Vagin A.

The Protein Data Bank accession codes for the RNF8345–485/Ubc13/Mms2 complex and RNF1681–113 are 4EPO and 3L11, respectively. All analytical size exclusion chromatography was done using a Superdex 75 10/300 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. Various concentrations of free protein and complex were loaded onto the column with a volume of 100 μl and run at 0.5 ml/min using an Akta Purifier (GE Healthcare). An Amersham Biosciences UV-900 was used to detect protein eluting off the column. Column was standardized by running mixed standards (dextrin, BSA, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen, and RNase A), each at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and brought to an injection volume of 250 μl. Three samples of quantified RNF8345–485 and Ubc13 were brought up to a concentration of 200 μm RNF8345–485 and increasing concentrations of Ubc13 (100, 200, and 400 μm) in gel filtration buffer. The injection volume of the mixed samples was 100 μl. Samples were injected over a Superose 6 column, in line with a Wyatt Systems REX to detect protein elution via refractive index, and a DAWN MALLS. Data were analyzed with ASTRA, and molecular mass predictions were normalized to a BSA standard. 100 nm human E1 and 200 nm Ubc13/Mms2 were incubated with 0.25 μm recombinant E3 (RNF8 or RNF168) and brought up to 50 μl in ubiquitylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 10 μm ZnSO4, 0.1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.6 unit/ml creatine kinase, and 0.6 unit/ml inorganic phosphatase) and incubated at 37 °C. Samples were quenched with SDS-PAGE loading buffer at 2, 15, 60, 300, and 1200 min and resolved on a 15% (v/v) polyacrylamide gel. The protein was transferred to a Immobilon-P PVDF membrane and probed with mouse anti-ubiquitin IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-mouse-linked horseradish peroxidase, and the chemiluminescence reaction was activated using the Super Signal West Hisprobe kit (Pierce). Membranes were imaged by exposure to Kodak Biomax film and scanned. We set out to uncover a minimal, RING-containing domain of RNF8 for detailed structural and functional studies. Secondary structure predictions suggested that large N- and C-terminal helices flank the RING domain (supplemental Fig. S1A). This is consistent with previous reports of a possible coiled-coil N-terminal to the RING domain (32Plans V. Scheper J. Soler M. Loukili N. Okano Y. Thomson T.M. The RING finger protein RNF8 recruits UBC13 for lysine 63-based self- polyubiquitylation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A construct encompassing both of these predicted helices and the RING domain (RNF8345–485) was expressed, purified, and used in an in vitro ubiquitylation assay to test its ability to build Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains in combination with the E2 heterodimer, Ubc13/Mms2. RNF8345–485 catalyzes the formation of ubiquitin chains efficiently in vitro, whereas Ubc13/Mms2 alone catalyzes the formation of only diubiquitin after 20 h at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). Next, we used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to test for stable interactions between RNF8345–485 and Ubc13/Mms2. RNF8345–485/Ubc13 elutes with a lower retention volume compared with free RNF8345–485, indicating a direct interaction between Ubc13 and RNF8 (Fig. 1B). The ternary complex of RNF8345–485/Ubc13/Mms2 forms a complex with a slightly lower retention volume than the RNF8/Ubc13 complex (supplemental Fig. S1B). The presence of all three components in the complex was verified by mass spectrometry. As expected, RNF8345–485 shows no interaction with Mms2 alone, confirming that the ternary complex between RNF8345–485 and Ubc13/Mms2 occurs between RNF8 and Ubc13 (supplemental Fig. S1B). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) titrating increasing Ubc13/Mms2 heterodimer into a constant concentration of RNF8 confirmed complex formation of RNF8345–485 and Ubc13/Mms2 (supplemental Fig. S1C). We crystallized and determined the structure of the RNF8345–485/Ubc13/Mms2 complex to 4.8 Å resolution, with three complexes in the asymmetric unit. The Ubc13/Mms2 heterodimer was used as a search model, and maps phased with two copies of Ubc13/Mms2 revealed clear Fo − Fc difference electron density of a 2-fold symmetric RNF8345–485 dimer (supplemental Fig. S2A). Analysis of an anomalous difference map revealed peaks for the positions of the pairs of zinc atoms coordinated within each of the RING domains, and an anomalous difference map calculated from a crystal containing selenomethionine-substituted RNF8345–485 was used to establish the amino acid sequence register of RNF8 (supplemental Fig. S2B). Immediately evident is a coiled-coil-mediated dimer formed between the helices N-terminal to the RING domain of the two protomers of RNF8 (Fig. 2A, and supplemental Fig. S2A). This is consistent with the observations from SEC, which show that RNF8345–485 is retained in the column and elutes at a much smaller retention volume than that expected for a 16.8-kDa protein, likely because of dimer formation and a larger Rg due to an elongated structure (Fig. 1B). The N termini of the coiled-coil helices form crystal contacts with the Mms2 of a complex related by crystal symmetry. Two of the complexes observed in the crystallographic asymmetric unit contain one RNF8 dimer and one Ubc13/Mms2 heterodimer. In the third complex a single RNF8 protomer lies on a crystallographic 2-fold axis, forming a complex that consists of one RNF8 dimer and two Ubc13/Mms2 heterodimers. In the two complexes that contain only one bound Ubc13 per RNF8 dimer, the Ubc13 binding surface of the unbound RNF8 protomer is not occluded, and based on the relative zinc positions in the two RNF8 RING domains, the structure does not seem to be distorted. Nevertheless, no interaction with Ubc13 is visible in the electron density. Conversely, the third complex that sits on the 2-fold axis is necessarily symmetrical, with both protomers of the RNF8 dimer interacting with a Ubc13/Mms2 heterodimer (supplemental Fig. S2C). In this structure, the coiled-coil is not visible in the electron density. This is likely because the crystal packing is such that the tip of the coiled-coil cannot make contacts with symmetry mates, as is observed in the other two complexes, resulting in increased flexibility. The structural similarity of RNF8 with other RING domains is shown with an alignment of the RING domain of RNF4 (Fig. 2C). The RING domain of RNF8 contains two prominent zinc fingers (ZnF1 and ZnF2) and an α-helix (α2) immediately following an internal two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1 and β2). RNF8 contains an extended N-terminal helix (α1) preceding ZnF1 that forms the coiled-coil, as well as a C-terminal helix (α3), both of which form t"
https://openalex.org/W2108805518,"Background Currently, no standard tool is publicly available that allows researchers or policy-makers to quantify the impact of policies using epidemiological evidence within the causal framework of Health Impact Assessment (HIA). A standard tool should comply with three technical criteria (real-life population, dynamic projection, explicit risk-factor states) and three usability criteria (modest data requirements, rich model output, generally accessible) to be useful in the applied setting of HIA. With DYNAMO-HIA (Dynamic Modeling for Health Impact Assessment), we introduce such a generic software tool specifically designed to facilitate quantification in the assessment of the health impacts of policies. Methods and Results DYNAMO-HIA quantifies the impact of user-specified risk-factor changes on multiple diseases and in turn on overall population health, comparing one reference scenario with one or more intervention scenarios. The Markov-based modeling approach allows for explicit risk-factor states and simulation of a real-life population. A built-in parameter estimation module ensures that only standard population-level epidemiological evidence is required, i.e. data on incidence, prevalence, relative risks, and mortality. DYNAMO-HIA provides a rich output of summary measures – e.g. life expectancy and disease-free life expectancy – and detailed data – e.g. prevalences and mortality/survival rates – by age, sex, and risk-factor status over time. DYNAMO-HIA is controlled via a graphical user interface and is publicly available from the internet, ensuring general accessibility. We illustrate the use of DYNAMO-HIA with two example applications: a policy causing an overall increase in alcohol consumption and quantifying the disease-burden of smoking. Conclusion By combining modest data needs with general accessibility and user friendliness within the causal framework of HIA, DYNAMO-HIA is a potential standard tool for health impact assessment based on epidemiologic evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2151693029,"Anaphylaxis management guidelines recommend the use of intramuscular adrenaline in severe reactions, complemented by antihistamines and corticoids; secondary prevention includes allergen avoidance and provision of self-applicable first aid drugs. Gaps between recommendations and their implementation have been reported, but only in confined settings. Hence, we analysed nation-wide data on the management of anaphylaxis, evaluating the implementation of guidelines.Within the anaphylaxis registry, allergy referral centres across Germany, Austria and Switzerland provided data on severe anaphylaxis cases. Based on patient records, details on reaction circumstances, diagnostic workup and treatment were collected via online questionnaire. Report of anaphylaxis through emergency physicians allowed for validation of registry data.2114 severe anaphylaxis patients from 58 centres were included. 8% received adrenaline intravenously, 4% intramuscularly; 50% antihistamines, and 51% corticoids. Validation data indicated moderate underreporting of first aid drugs in the Registry. 20% received specific instructions at the time of the reaction; 81% were provided with prophylactic first aid drugs at any time.There is a distinct discrepancy between current anaphylaxis management guidelines and their implementation. To improve patient care, a revised approach for medical education and training on the management of severe anaphylaxis is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1986723279,"The protection of key areas for biodiversity at sea is not as widespread as on land and research investment is necessary to identify biodiversity hotspots in the open ocean. Spatially explicit conservation measures such as the creation of representative networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) is a critical step towards the conservation and management of marine ecosystems, as well as to improve public awareness. Conservation efforts in ecologically rich and threatened ecosystems are specially needed. This is particularly urgent for the Mediterranean marine biodiversity, which includes highly mobile marine vertebrates. Here, we studied the at sea distribution of one of the most endangered Mediterranean seabird, the critically endangered Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus. Present knowledge, from vessel-based surveys, suggests that this species has a coastal distribution over the productive Iberian shelf in relation to the distribution of their main prey, small pelagic fish. We used miniaturised satellite transmitters to determine the key marine areas of the southern population of Balearic shearwaters breeding on Eivissa and spot the spatial connections between breeding and key marine areas. Our tracking study indicates that Balearic shearwaters do not only forage along the Iberian continental shelf but also in more distant marine areas along the North African coast, in particular W of Algeria, but also NE coast of Morocco. Birds recurrently visit these shelf areas at the end of the breeding season. Species distribution modelling identified chlorophyll a as the most important environmental variable in defining those oceanographic features characterizing their key habitats in the western Mediterranean. We identified persistent oceanographic features across time series available in the study area and discuss our results within the current conservation scenario in relation to the ecology of the species."
https://openalex.org/W2033477440,"The Grainy head (GRH) family of transcription factors are crucial for the development and repair of epidermal barriers in all animals in which they have been studied. This is a high-level functional conservation, as the known structural and enzymatic genes regulated by GRH proteins differ between species depending on the type of epidermal barrier being formed. Interestingly, members of the CP2 superfamily of transcription factors, which encompasses the GRH and LSF families in animals, are also found in fungi – organisms that lack epidermal tissues. To shed light on CP2 protein function in fungi, we characterized a Neurospora crassa mutant lacking the CP2 member we refer to as grainy head-like (grhl). We show that Neurospora GRHL has a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of animal GRH proteins and dissimilar to that of animal LSF proteins. Neurospora grhl mutants are defective in conidial-spore dispersal due to an inability to remodel the cell wall, and we show that grhl mutants and the long-known conidial separation-2 (csp-2) mutants are allelic. We then characterized the transcriptomes of both Neurospora grhl mutants and Drosophila grh mutant embryos to look for similarities in the affected genes. Neurospora grhl appears to play a role in the development and remodeling of the cell wall, as well as in the activation of genes involved in defense and virulence. Drosophila GRH is required to activate the expression of many genes involved in cuticular/epidermal-barrier formation. We also present evidence that GRH plays a role in adult antimicrobial defense. These results, along with previous studies of animal GRH proteins, suggest the fascinating possibility that the apical extracellular barriers of some animals and fungi might share an evolutionary connection, and that the formation of physical barriers in the last common ancestor was under the control of a transcriptional code that included GRH-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2102575504,"For emotional pictures with fear-, disgust-, or sex-related contents, stimulus size has been shown to increase emotion effects in attention-related event-related potentials (ERPs), presumably reflecting the enhanced biological impact of larger emotion-inducing pictures. If this is true, size should not enhance emotion effects for written words with symbolic and acquired meaning. Here, we investigated ERP effects of font size for emotional and neutral words. While P1 and N1 amplitudes were not affected by emotion, the early posterior negativity started earlier and lasted longer for large relative to small words. These results suggest that emotion-driven facilitation of attention is not necessarily based on biological relevance, but might generalize to stimuli with arbitrary perceptual features. This finding points to the high relevance of written language in today's society as an important source of emotional meaning."

Our results suggest that individual behavior is characterized by a two-step process--the decision to sample and the decision to download a song. Contrary to conventional wisdom, social influence is material to the first step only. The model also identifies the role of placement in mediating social signals, and suggests that in this market with anonymous feedback cues, social influence serves an informational rather than normative role."
https://openalex.org/W2009491495,"The actin cytoskeleton in living cells has many types of crosslinkers. The mechanical interplay between these different crosslinker types is an open issue in cytoskeletal mechanics. We develop a framework to study the cooperativity and redundancy in the mechanics of filamentous networks with two types of crosslinkers: crosslinkers that allow free rotations of filaments and crosslinkers that do not. The framework consists of numerical simulations and an effective medium theory on a percolating triangular lattice. We find that the introduction of angle-constraining crosslinkers significantly lowers the filament concentrations required for these networks to attain mechanical integrity. This cooperative effect also enhances the stiffness of the network and suppresses non-affine deformations at a fixed filament concentration. We further find that semiflexible networks with only freely-rotating crosslinks are mechanically very similar to compositely crosslinked flexible networks with both networks exhibiting the same scaling behavior. We show that the network mechanics can either be redundant or cooperative depending on the relative energy scale of filament bending to the energy stored in the angle-constraining crosslinkers, and the relative concentration of crosslinkers. Our results may have implications for understanding the role of multiple crosslinkers even in a system without bundle formation or other structural motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2042943158,"Phosphorylation of the cardiac β subunit (Ca(v)β(2)) of the Ca(v)1.2 L-type Ca(2+) channel complex has been proposed as a mechanism for regulation of L-type Ca(2+) channels by various protein kinases including PKA, CaMKII, Akt/PKB, and PKG. To test this hypothesis directly in vivo, we generated a knock-in mouse line with targeted mutation of the Ca(v)β(2) gene by insertion of a stop codon after proline 501 in exon 14 (mouse sequence Cacnb2; βStop mouse). This mutation prevented translation of the Ca(v)β(2) C terminus that contains the relevant phosphorylation sites for the above protein kinases. Homozygous cardiac βStop mice were born at Mendelian ratio, had a normal life expectancy, and normal basal L-type I(Ca). The regulation of the L-type current by stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor was unaffected in vivo and in cardiomyocytes (CMs). βStop mice were cross-bred with mice expressing the Ca(v)1.2 gene containing the mutation S1928A (SAβStop) or S1512A and S1570A (SFβStop) in the C terminus of the α(1C) subunit. The β-adrenergic regulation of the cardiac I(Ca) was unaltered in these mouse lines. In contrast, truncation of the Ca(v)1.2 at Asp(1904) abolished β-adrenergic up-regulation of I(Ca) in murine embryonic CMs. We conclude that phosphorylation of the C-terminal sites in Ca(v)β(2), Ser(1928), Ser(1512), and Ser(1570) of the Ca(v)1.2 protein is functionally not involved in the adrenergic regulation of the murine cardiac Ca(v)1.2 channel."
https://openalex.org/W2070342899,"We have recently shown that the immunophilin FKBP5 (also known as FKBP51) is a scaffolding protein that can enhance PHLPP-AKT interaction and facilitate PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt Ser473, negatively regulating Akt activation in vitro. Therefore, FKBP5 might function as a tumor suppressor, and levels of FKBP5 would affect cell response to chemotherapy. In the current study, we have taken a step forward by using a pancreatic cancer xenograft mice model to show that down regulation of FKBP5 in shFKBP5 xenograft mice promotes tumor growth and resistance to gemcitabine, a phenomenon consistent with our previous findings in pancreatic cell lines. In addition, we also found that inhibitors targeting the Akt pathway, including PI3K inhibitor, Akt inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor had a different effect on sensitization to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutic agents in cell lines, with a specific Akt inhibitor, triciribine, having the greatest sensitization effect. We then tested the hypothesis that addition of triciribine can sensitize gemcitabine treatment, especially in shFKBP5 pancreatic cancer xenograft mice. We found that combination treatment with gemcitabine and triciribine has a better effect on tumor inhibition than either drug alone (p<0.005) and that the inhibition effect is more significant in shFKBP5 xenograft mice than wt mice (p<0.05). These effects were correlated with level of Akt 473 phosphorylation as well as proliferation rate, as indicated by Ki67 staining in xenograft tumor tissues. These results provide evidence in support of future clinical trials designed to tailor therapy based on our observations."
https://openalex.org/W2127943304,"Scarcity of essential nutrients has led plants to evolve alternative nutritional strategies, such as myrmecotrophy (ant-waste-derived nutrition) and carnivory (invertebrate predation). The carnivorous plant Nepenthes bicalcarata grows in the Bornean peatswamp forests and is believed to have a mutualistic relationship with its symbiotic ant Camponotus schmitzi. However, the benefits provided by the ant have not been quantified. We tested the hypothesis of a nutritional mutualism, using foliar isotopic and reflectance analyses and by comparing fitness-related traits between ant-inhabited and uninhabited plants. Plants inhabited by C. schmitzi produced more leaves of greater area and nitrogen content than unoccupied plants. The ants were estimated to provide a 200% increase in foliar nitrogen to adult plants. Inhabited plants also produced more and larger pitchers containing higher prey biomass. C. schmitzi-occupied pitchers differed qualitatively in containing C. schmitzi wastes and captured large ants and flying insects. Pitcher abortion rates were lower in inhabited plants partly because of herbivore deterrence as herbivory-aborted buds decreased with ant occupation rate. Lower abortion was also attributed to ant nutritional service. The ants had higher δ15N values than any tested prey, and foliar δ15N increased with ant occupation rate, confirming their predatory behaviour and demonstrating their direct contribution to the plant-recycled N. We estimated that N. bicalcarata derives on average 42% of its foliar N from C. schmitzi wastes, (76% in highly-occupied plants). According to the Structure Independent Pigment Index, plants without C. schmitzi were nutrient stressed compared to both occupied plants, and pitcher-lacking plants. This attests to the physiological cost of pitcher production and poor nutrient assimilation in the absence of the symbiont. Hence C. schmitzi contributes crucially to the nutrition of N. bicalcarata, via protection of assimilatory organs, enhancement of prey capture, and myrmecotrophy. This combination of carnivory and myrmecotrophy represents an outstanding strategy of nutrient sequestration."

HCMV infection is mostly associated with mild pathogenesis in immunocompetent hosts but may cause severe systemic or even life-threatening disease in immunosuppressed hosts and prenatally infected children (1Mocarski Jr., E.S. Shenk T. Pass R.F. Fields Virology. 5 Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2007: 2701-2772Google Scholar). As characteristic for most DNA viruses, HCMV replicates genomes in the host cell nucleus. Thereafter, preformed viral capsids that are packaged with genomic DNA have to be transported to the cytoplasm for final maturation and release of infectious virions. Due to the large size of HCMV capsids (∼130 nm) (2Chen D.H. Jiang H. Lee M. Liu F. Zhou Z.H. Three-dimensional visualization of tegument/capsid interactions in the intact human cytomegalovirus.Virology. 1999; 260: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), these cannot be transported through the nuclear pore complex (∼40 nm) (3Panté N. Kann M. Nuclear pore complex is able to transport macromolecules with diameters of about 39 nm.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The currently accepted model for nuclear egress of HCMV and other herpesviruses is based on a complex envelopment/de-envelopment/re-envelopment process (4Mettenleiter T.C.

Hereby, a transient primary envelopment is achieved by budding through the inner nuclear membrane (INM) (4Mettenleiter T.C.

Before herpesviral capsids gain access to the INM, however, the proteinaceous network of the nuclear lamina provides a major obstacle. Thus, the locally restricted destabilization of the nuclear lamina is a rate-limiting step during the viral replication process (10Buser C. Walther P. Mertens T. Michel D.

N-terminal deletion (i.e. encoded amino acids 5–397, 10–397, or 15–397) and C-terminal deletion mutants of pUL50 (i.e. encoded amino acids 1–181, 1–150, 1–130, 1–100, or 1–70) were generated by cloning of PCR products. Standard PCR amplification was performed using the template pcDNA-UL50-HA (15Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Marschall M.

After cleavage with EcoRI/XhoI or HindIII/BamHI, respectively, PCR products were inserted into the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), resulting in expression constructs coding for N-terminal deletion mutants of pUL50 fused C-terminally to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag or inserted into the vector peGPF-N1 (Clontech) resulting in expression constructs coding for C-terminal deletion mutants of pUL50 fused C-terminally to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). For generating constructs coding for fragments of pUL50 (i.e. encoded amino acids 1–358, 1–205, 236–358, or 10–169) fused to GFP and β-gal, PCR amplification was performed as described above. Subsequently, PCR fragments were cleaved with NheI/XbaI and inserted into pHM830 (Addgene). In addition, expression constructs coding for mutant pUL50 carrying amino acid exchanges to alanine (single mutants D10A, L11A, V12A, Q13A, T15A, I18A, K20A, E56A, Y57A, N76A, G78A, P90A, L116A, K123A, R136A, G152A, and P153A; double mutants D10A/Q13A and L11A/V12A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pcDNA-UL50-HA (15Milbradt J.

Construct pDsRed1-N1, expressing red fluorescent protein, was purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Heidelberg, Germany) and used as a positive control for transfection experiments. Construct pHM830 (Addgene), expressing a GFP-β-gal fusion protein, was used as a vector control for protein-protein interaction experiments by coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP). HeLa cells were cultivated and grown on coverslips for transient transfection by the use of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) under previously described conditions (11Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Sticht H. Marschall M. Cytomegaloviral proteins that associate with the nuclear lamina. Components of a postulated nuclear egress complex.J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were used for combined transfection-infection experiments. First, HFFs were transfected with expression plasmids by the use of FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One day later transfected HFFs were infected with HCMV laboratory strain AD169 at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. At 2 days post-transfection (transfected HeLa cells) or at 3 days post-infection (transfected-infected HFFs) cells were fixed and permeabilized after indirect immunofluorescence staining as described previously (11Milbradt J.

The mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma) and the rabbit polyclonal antiserum (pAb) anti-hemagglutinin (HA.11; Covance Inc.) were used to detect the transiently expressed tagged proteins. The mouse pAb anti-UL53 was used for the detection of pUL53 of HCMV (kindly provided by Dr. P. Dal Monte, Dept. of Haematology, St. Orsola Malpighi General Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy). Secondary antibodies used for double staining were Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L; New England Biolabs GmbH). Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 63× HCX PL APO CS oil immersion objective lens (Leica). Images were analyzed, and signal intensities were quantified using LAS AF software (Leica). 293T cells were cultivated and transfected by the use of polyethylenimine-DNA complexes as described previously (11Milbradt J.

Coimmunoprecipitation samples and expression controls taken before the addition of the CoIP antibody were subjected to standard Western blot analysis using mouse mAbs anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), anti-GFP (clones 7.1/13.1; Roche Applied Science), anti-β-actin (AC-15; Sigma), or rabbit pAb anti-HA (HA.11; Covance Inc.). The N-terminal fragment of pUL50 containing residues 1–181 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as a SUMO fusion protein using the pE-SUMOpro system (LifeSensors Inc.) containing a His tag at the N terminus. Bacterial cells were grown in LB medium in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 28 °C to an optical density A600 of 0.5–0.6 before the temperature was lowered to 20 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The protein was expressed overnight, and bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in His-trap binding buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 3 mm DTT) containing protease inhibitors and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant containing His-SUMO-pUL50(1–181) was purified by affinity chromatography using a His-Trap column (GE Healthcare). After the first His-trap column, the SUMO tag was cleaved using 5 units of SUMO protease/100 μg of fusion protein for 5–7 days at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 3 mm DTT. Both the SUMO tag and SUMO protease were removed via a second His-trap chromatography. pUL50(1–181) was further purified by size exclusion chromatography and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 3 mm DTT. Typically, 1 liter of bacterial culture yielded about 2.5 mg of pure protein. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed at 20 °C using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co.) and a cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length. All experiments were performed in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) at a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Spectra were registered between 185 and 260 nm and corrected for the contributions from the phosphate buffer. Spectra were accumulated eight times with a bandwidth of 1.0 nm and scan speed of 20 nm/min, time response of 1 s, and data pitch 0.1 nm. CD spectra were analyzed using the deconvolution program CDSSTR within the Jasco CDPro program. Heat-induced unfolding transitions were also measured under similar buffer conditions and protein concentration. Ellipticity values were recorded at 222 nm by raising the temperature from 20 to 96 °C using a PTC 423S/15 Peltier element in 1 °C steps, and denaturation analysis was performed using the Jasco Spectra analysis program.

Our previous studies demonstrated a high affinity interaction between HCMV pUL50 and pUL53, both harboring several conserved functional elements and domains (Fig. 1, A and B). To narrow down the domain responsible for pUL53 interaction, C- and N-terminal truncation mutants of pUL50 were generated and fused to a C-terminal coding region of GFP or HA tag, respectively. First, pUL50 truncation mutants were tested for their ability to interact with pUL53 in a CoIP assay (Fig. 2). With C-terminal truncations, specifically the construct comprising amino acids 1–181 of pUL50 was coimmunoprecipitated by pUL53 (Fig. 2A, CoIP, lane 4), whereas further C-terminal deletions of pUL50 abrogated the interaction (lanes 5–8). As an additional important feature, truncation mutants 1–181 and 1–150 of pUL50 were expressed at high levels (Fig. 2A, expression controls, lanes 4 and 5 and lanes 9 and 10), whereas truncations of more than N-terminal 150 amino acids showed decreased expression levels (lanes 6–8 and 11–13). It should be stressed that the interaction-negative mutant 1–150 (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 10) was expressed to similar levels as the interaction-positive mutant 1–181 (lanes 4 and 9), thus illustrating the reliability of this experiment even under variable expression situations (also"

Of the two human mH2A1 isoforms, mH2A1.2, but not mH2A1.1, interacted with HER-2 in human cancer cell lines. Overexpression of mH2A1.2, but not mH2A1.1, in cancer cells significantly increased HER-2 expression and tumorigenicity.

https://openalex.org/W1980806410,"Background Many patients’ and consumers’ organizations accept drug industry funding to support their activities. As drug companies and patient groups move closer, disclosure become essential for transparency, and the internet could be a useful means of making sponsorship information accessible to the public. This survey aims to assess the transparency of a large group of Italian patient and consumer groups and a group of pharmaceutical companies, focusing on their websites. Methodology/Principal Findings Patient and consumer groups were selected from those stated to be sponsored by a group of pharmaceutical companies on their websites. The websites were examined using two forms with principal (name of drug companies providing funds, amount of funding) and secondary indicators of transparency (section where sponsors are disclosed, update of sponsorship). Principal indicators were applied independently by two reviewers to the patient and consumer groups’ websites. Discordances were solved by discussion. One hundred fifty-seven Italian patient and consumer groups and 17 drug companies were considered. Thirteen drug companies (76%) named at least one group funded, on their Italian websites. Of these, four (31%) indicated the activities sponsored and two (15%) the amount of funding. Of the 157 patient and consumer groups, 46 (29%) named at least one pharmaceutical company as providing funds. Three (6%) reported the amount of funding, 25 (54%) the activities funded, none the proportion of income derived from drug companies. Among the groups naming pharmaceutical company sponsors, 15 (33%) declared them in a dedicated section, five (11%) on the home page, the others in the financial report or other sections. Conclusions/Significance Disclosure of funds is scarce on Italian patient and consumer groups’ websites. The levels of transparency need to be improved. Disclosure of patient and consumer groups provided with funds is frequent on Italian pharmaceutical companies’ websites, but information are often not complete."
https://openalex.org/W1985611027,"The characterization and the definition of the complexity of objects is an important but very difficult problem that attracted much interest in many different fields. In this paper we introduce a new measure, called network diversity score (NDS), which allows us to quantify structural properties of networks. We demonstrate numerically that our diversity score is capable of distinguishing ordered, random and complex networks from each other and, hence, allowing us to categorize networks with respect to their structural complexity. We study 16 additional network complexity measures and find that none of these measures has similar good categorization capabilities. In contrast to many other measures suggested so far aiming for a characterization of the structural complexity of networks, our score is different for a variety of reasons. First, our score is multiplicatively composed of four individual scores, each assessing different structural properties of a network. That means our composite score reflects the structural diversity of a network. Second, our score is defined for a population of networks instead of individual networks. We will show that this removes an unwanted ambiguity, inherently present in measures that are based on single networks. In order to apply our measure practically, we provide a statistical estimator for the diversity score, which is based on a finite number of samples."

The TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies: integrating mammalian biology.Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). Type I (IFNα and IFNβ) and type II (IFNγ) IFNs are induced in the innate and adaptive immune responses, respectively and are generally considered to be anti-viral and pro-apoptotic (12Sen G.C. Viruses and interferons.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 14Borden E.C. Sen G.C. Uze G. Silverman R.H. Ransohoff R.M. Foster G.R. Stark G.R.

IFNα, released by leukocyte from inflamed tissues, activates macrophage, which in turn promotes the release of TNFα. Both TNFα and IFNα affect gene transcription in local ECs; however, the molecular networks downstream of TNFα and IFNα in ECs are still not fully elucidated. Angiogenesis is a hallmark of tumor development and chronic inflammatory diseases (15Albini A. Tosetti F. Benelli R. Noonan D.M.

It is believed that cytokines, including TNFα, and IFNα, are important regulators of angiogenesis in local endothelium (13Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J.

Angiogenesis is a complex process and represents a systemic morphological alteration that involves enzymatic degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, migration, apoptosis, and proliferation of ECs (16Bergers G. Benjamin L.E. Tumorigenesis and the angiogenic switch.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). IFNs elicit anti-angiogenic activity (14Borden E.C. Sen G.C. Uze G. Silverman R.H. Ransohoff R.M. Foster G.R. Stark G.R. Interferons at age 50: past, current and future impact on biomedicine.Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery. 2007; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), whereas TNFα has pro- or anti-angiogenic activity probably depending on the dose, duration of treatment, and cell type (19Leibovich S.J. Polverini P.J. Shepard H.M. Wiseman D.M. Shively V. Nuseir N.

Therefore, identification of downstream effectors that mediate TNFα and IFNα activity in ECs will help understand the mechanisms by which these two cytokines regulate physiological and pathological angiogenesis. We have recently demonstrated that TNFα potently induces PML and regulates the expression of the matrix-associated metalloproteinase MMP-10 in ECs (9Gao C. Cheng X. Lam M. Liu Y. Liu Q. Chang K.S.

Our current study supports a model in which STAT1 and PML play a role in TNFα- and IFNα-mediated inhibition of EC network formation and migration. Human TNFα was purchased from Promega (G5241). Human IFNα (11200) and IFNγ (11500) were purchased from R&D systems. IKK inhibitor VII was purchased from EMD Millipore (401486). The Matrigel kit for in vitro EC network formation assays was purchased from Chemicon (ECM625). The commercial antibodies used in this manuscript are from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, α-PML (sc-996, sc-5621), α-STAT1 (sc-346), α-ITGB1 (sc-6622), α-Mouse IgG conjugated with HRP (sc-2005), α-goat IgG conjugated with HRP (sc-2033); from Upstate α-acetyl-histone H3 (α-AcH3, 06-599); from Sigma, α-β-actin (A5441), from Invitrogen, normal goat IgG (10200); Alexa Fluor 488 μm goat anti rabbit (A-11008), Alexa Fluor 594 μm goat anti mouse (A-11005); from Millipore, α-rabbit-IgG conjugated with HRP (12-348). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Lonza, C2519A) were maintained in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM-2, Lonza, CC-4176). Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs, Lonza, CC-2543) were maintained in microvascular endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM-2MV, Lonza, CC-4147). Cells of <5 passages were used in this study. For cytokine treatment, unless otherwise specified, conditions were TNFα (20 ng/ml), IFNα (1000 units/ml), or IFNγ (1000 units/ml) for 16 h. Non-targeting control (D-001810-01), luciferase (D-001210-02), PML (J-006547-05 and J-006547-07), and STAT1 (J-003543-06 and J-003543-08) siRNAs and transfection reagent DharmaFECT1 (T-2001) were purchased from Thermo Scientific. HUVECs were concurrently treated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) in the presence of vehicle, 100 nm, or 200 nm IKK inhibitor VII. Cells were collected, and aliquots of the cells were subjected to whole cell extract preparation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and total RNA preparation. Cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted with a PrepEase kit (USB/Affymetrix), quantified by A260/A280 spectrometry. 2 μg of total RNAs were used for RT-PCR. The cDNA pool was generated from each RNA sample with Superscript3 Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific cDNAs of interest and internal controls were quantified by real-time PCR using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) platform with 2×iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and appropriate primer sets. The PCR program ran for 40 cycles with three steps of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Melting curves were acquired after PCR to ensure the homogeneity of the PCR products. The relative quantities of genes of interest were normalized to an internal control (GAPDH or 18s rRNA) and depicted as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. The primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table S1. To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in 1× PBS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 10% nonfat milk in 1× PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 h and followed by incubation with primary antibodies in PBST for 1 h. The membranes were rinsed and washed in PBST and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBST for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with chemiluminescent substrate for HRP (Thermo Sci. 34080) and exposed on autoradiography film (Denville Sci.). For quantification of band density, films were scanned, and the integrated density of each band was quantified with the “Analyze: Gels” tools in ImageJ software (v1.42a, NIH). The densities of proteins of interest were normalized to that of an internal control, and the first lane was set as 1 to reflect the fold change in the remaining lanes. HUVECs, plated on glass cover slips, were treated with or without TNFα and IFNα for 16 h, and the same protocol was followed for HUVECs transfected with siRNAs. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 1× PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum for 10 min, washed three times with 1× PBS, and blocked in 1× PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibodies for 1 h. After washing, Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were added for 1 h in the dark. Cover slips were mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories), visualized and images captured on a Leica immunofluorescence microscopy. Unless specified, all images were taken under same microscope setting. The assays were performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Lonza ECM625). Under our experimental conditions, we did not observe significant differences in apoptosis or viability of HUVEC transfected with or without siRNAs against PML or a control siRNA (data not shown). Briefly, HUVECs or HMVECs were transfected with control siRNA or siRNAs against PML for 72 h, and followed by a 16–20 h treatment with TNFα (10 ng/ml), IFNα (103 units/ml), or IFNγ (103 units/ml). Subsequently, the cells were trypsinized and counted. Equal numbers of HUVECs were plated on matrix gel (Chemicon ECM625) pre-coated 96-well plate (1 × 105/well) or chamber system (2.5 × 105/chamber, Lab-Tek 4808). A fraction of the cells was plated for Western blotting to examine PML knockdown efficiency. After seeding the cells on the ECM, the images of network formation from randomly chosen fields (plate, n = 12; chamber, n = 8) were taken at 3, 8, and 20 h. The trends of change in network formation are similar for these time points. The images taken at 20 h are presented. The numbers of branch points were quantified and depicted as mean ± S.D.

Crosslinked nuclei were sonicated on a sonic dismembrator (Fisher 550α) with power setting 4 of 120 s total processing time in a 10s-pulse-50s-idle manner to shear the chromatin to around 600 bp. The retrieved DNA was quantified by qPCR. Each ChIP experiment had 2–3 biological repeats. The antibodies used were listed under “Reagents and Antibodies.” The input signal was set to 1, and others were normalized as percentage of input. The primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. The assay was adapted from a previous protocol with modification (23Mottet D. Bellahcène A. Pirotte S. Waltregny D. Deroanne C. Lamour V. Lidereau R. Castronovo V. Histone deacetylase 7 silencing alters endothelial cell migration, a key step in angiogenesis.Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1237-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Confluent HUVECs plated in a 6-well plate, 16–20 h after treatment of TNFα, IFNα, or IFNγ and 72 h post-transfection of siRNA if applied, were scratched with a pipette tip to create wounds. Normal IgG or blocking antibody against integrin β1 (α-ITGB1, 10 μg/ml) was supplemented in media during the assay if specified. Randomly chosen fields (n = 16) were used for imaging, and the images were taken at identical locations at time 0 and overnight. The wound widths were measured by Photoshop (Adobe) software, normalized and represented as the percentage of wound measured at time 0 (mean ± S.D.). All statistics were performed with unpaired two-tailed t test. Boyden chambers with 8 μm pore size were purchased from Corning (3422). HUVECs were transfected with control or PML siRNAs for 72 h. The cells were trypsinized, counted and 1 × 105 cells/well were plated on 6.5 mm diameter inserts in the upper chamber of the apparatus. Migration was allowed to proceed overnight. For migration toward serum (10% FBS), the cells were starved in medium containing 1% FBS for 24 h and migrated toward medium supplemented 10% FBS placed in the lower chamber. For migration toward extracellular matrix (ECM), the bottom of the inserts was coated with ECM (Chemicon, ECM625), and both upper and lower chambers contained normal culture medium. After migration, the cells that had migrated through the inserts and attached to the underneath of the inserts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and stained in crystal violet for 15 min. The inserts were then air dried and subjected to cell counting under light microscopy with 40× magnification. The experiments were done in duplicate, and 8 random fields were counted from each insert. The unpaired two-tail t-tests were used to determine the significance of differences in migration between the different conditions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with control siRNA or two different PML siRNA for 72 h, and total RNA was extracted by a PrepEase Kit (USB/Affymetrix). The total RNAs were sent to the Genomics Core at Cleveland Clinic Foundation for microarray with HumanRef-8_V2_0_R0_11223162_A (Illumina) chip. Each sample had technical duplicates.

To examine the role of PML in EC network formation, we carried out PML knockdown followed by in vitro network formation assay to assess the ability of ECs to undergo angiogenesis. We found that that knocking down PML potentiated the in vitro angiogenesis of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Fig. 1, A and B).

https://openalex.org/W2156212265,"Biosynthesis of the enediyne natural product dynemicin in Micromonospora chersina is initiated by DynE8, a highly reducing iterative type I polyketide synthase that assembles polyketide intermediates from the acetate units derived solely from malonyl-CoA. To understand the substrate specificity and the evolutionary relationship between the acyltransferase (AT) domains of DynE8, fatty acid synthase, and modular polyketide synthases, we overexpressed a 44-kDa fragment of DynE8 (hereafter named AT(DYN10)) encompassing its entire AT domain and the adjacent linker domain. The crystal structure at 1.4 Å resolution unveils a α/β hydrolase and a ferredoxin-like subdomain with the Ser-His catalytic dyad located in the cleft between the two subdomains. The linker domain also adopts a α/β fold abutting the AT catalytic domain. Co-crystallization with malonyl-CoA yielded a malonyl-enzyme covalent complex that most likely represents the acyl-enzyme intermediate. The structure explains the preference for malonyl-CoA with a conserved arginine orienting the carboxylate group of malonate and several nonpolar residues that preclude α-alkyl malonyl-CoA binding. Co-crystallization with acetyl-CoA revealed two noncovalently bound acetates generated by the enzymatic hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA that acts as an inhibitor for DynE8. This suggests that the AT domain can upload the acyl groups from either malonyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA onto the catalytic Ser(651) residue. However, although the malonyl group can be transferred to the acyl carrier protein domain, transfer of the acetyl group to the acyl carrier protein domain is suppressed. Local structural differences may account for the different stability of the acyl-enzyme intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2121130721,"Accurate identification of cell nuclei and their tracking using three dimensional (3D) microscopic images is a demanding task in many biological studies. Manual identification of nuclei centroids from images is an error-prone task, sometimes impossible to accomplish due to low contrast and the presence of noise. Nonetheless, only a few methods are available for 3D bioimaging applications, which sharply contrast with 2D analysis, where many methods already exist. In addition, most methods essentially adopt segmentation for which a reliable solution is still unknown, especially for 3D bio-images having juxtaposed cells. In this work, we propose a new method that can directly extract nuclei centroids from fluorescence microscopy images. This method involves three steps: (i) Pre-processing, (ii) Local enhancement, and (iii) Centroid extraction. The first step includes two variations: first variation (Variant-1) uses the whole 3D pre-processed image, whereas the second one (Variant-2) modifies the preprocessed image to the candidate regions or the candidate hybrid image for further processing. At the second step, a multiscale cube filtering is employed in order to locally enhance the pre-processed image. Centroid extraction in the third step consists of three stages. In Stage-1, we compute a local characteristic ratio at every voxel and extract local maxima regions as candidate centroids using a ratio threshold. Stage-2 processing removes spurious centroids from Stage-1 results by analyzing shapes of intensity profiles from the enhanced image. An iterative procedure based on the nearest neighborhood principle is then proposed to combine if there are fragmented nuclei. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses on a set of 100 images of 3D mouse embryo are performed. Investigations reveal a promising achievement of the technique presented in terms of average sensitivity and precision (i.e., 88.04% and 91.30% for Variant-1; 86.19% and 95.00% for Variant-2), when compared with an existing method (86.06% and 90.11%), originally developed for analyzing C. elegans images."
https://openalex.org/W2044656021,"Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (EC coupling) links the electrical excitation of the cell membrane to the mechanical contractile machinery of the heart. Calcium channels are major players of EC coupling and are regulated by voltage and Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds to the IQ motif located in the C terminus of the Ca(v)1.2 channel and induces Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI) and facilitation (CDF). Mutation of Ile to Glu (Ile1624Glu) in the IQ motif abolished regulation of the channel by CDI and CDF. Here, we addressed the physiological consequences of such a mutation in the heart. Murine hearts expressing the Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) mutation were generated in adult heterozygous mice through inactivation of the floxed WT Ca(v)1.2(L2) allele by tamoxifen-induced cardiac-specific activation of the MerCreMer Cre recombinase. Within 10 days after the first tamoxifen injection these mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) accompanied by apoptosis of cardiac myocytes (CM) and fibrosis. In Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) hearts, the activity of phospho-CaM kinase II and phospho-MAPK was increased. CMs expressed reduced levels of Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) channel protein and I(Ca). The Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) channel showed ""CDI"" kinetics. Despite a lower sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content, cellular contractility and global Ca(2+) transients remained unchanged because the EC coupling gain was up-regulated by an increased neuroendocrine activity. Treatment of mice with metoprolol and captopril reduced DCM in Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) hearts at day 10. We conclude that mutation of the IQ motif to IE leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and death."
https://openalex.org/W2006753194,"CD55 (decay-accelerating factor) is a complement-regulatory protein highly expressed on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). CD55 is also a ligand for CD97, an adhesion-type G protein-coupled receptor abundantly present on leukocytes. Little is known regarding the regulation of CD55 expression in FLS.FLS isolated from arthritis patients were stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Transfection with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and 5'-triphosphate RNA were used to activate the cytoplasmic double-stranded (ds)RNA sensors melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I). CD55 expression, cell viability, and binding of CD97-loaded beads were quantified by flow cytometry.CD55 was expressed at equal levels on FLS isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and spondyloarthritis. CD55 expression in RA FLS was significantly induced by IL-1β and especially by the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C). Activation of MDA5 and RIG-I also enhanced CD55 expression. Notably, activation of MDA5 dose-dependently induced cell death, while triggering of TLR3 or RIG-I had a minor effect on viability. Upregulation of CD55 enhanced the binding capacity of FLS to CD97-loaded beads, which could be blocked by antibodies against CD55.Activation of dsRNA sensors enhances the expression of CD55 in cultured FLS, which increases the binding to CD97. Our findings suggest that dsRNA promotes the interaction between FLS and CD97-expressing leukocytes."

Expression of Anks4b was decreased in both βHNF4α KO islets and HNF4α knockdown MIN6 β-cells, and HNF4α activated Anks4b promoter activity. Anks4b bound to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein, and overexpression of Anks4b enhanced the ER stress response and ER stress-associated apoptosis of MIN6 cells. Conversely, suppression of Anks4b reduced β-cell susceptibility to ER stress-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that Anks4b is a HNF4α target gene that regulates ER stress in β-cells by interacting with GRP78, thus suggesting that HNF4α is involved in maintenance of the ER.Background: Target genes of HNF4α in β-cells are largely unknown.Results: Expression of Anks4b is decreased in the βHNF4α KO islets.

HNF4α has multiple functional domains, including the N-terminal A/B domain associated with the transactivation domain (AF-1), a DNA binding C domain, a functionally complex E domain that forms a ligand binding domain, a dimerization interface and transactivation domain (AF-2), and an F domain with a negative regulatory function (3Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous monogenic disorder that accounts for 2–5% of type 2 diabetes (5Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes mellitus and genetically programmed defects in β-cell function.Nature. 2001; 414: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We discovered that mutations of the human HNF4A gene cause a particular form of MODY known as MODY1 (6Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M.

In addition, it has been shown that targeted disruption of HNF4α in pancreatic β-cells leads to defective insulin secretion in mice (7Miura A. Yamagata K. Kakei M. Hatakeyama H. Takahashi N. Fukui K.

These findings have demonstrated that HNF4α has an important role in β-cells. In the liver, HNF4α plays a critical role in nutrient transport and metabolism by regulating numerous target genes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC), apolipoprotein AII (APOA2), and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) (9Hayhurst G.P.

Previous in vitro studies have suggested that HNF4α regulates the expression of pancreatic β-cell genes involved in glucose metabolism, such as insulin (INS), solute carrier family 2 (SLC2A2), and HNF1A (11Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B.

However, the expression of these genes was unchanged in the islets of β-cell-specific HNF4α knock-out (βHNF4α KO) mice (7Miura A. Yamagata K. Kakei M. Hatakeyama H. Takahashi N. Fukui K. Nammo T.

Invest. 2005; 115: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), indicating that such genes are not targets of HNF4α in vivo, at least in β-cells. In the present study, we investigated the mRNA expression profile of βHNF4α KO mice and found that ankyrin repeat and sterile α motif domain containing 4b/harmonin-interacting, ankyrin repeat-containing protein (Anks4b/Harp) is a target of HNF4α in β-cells. We also demonstrated that Anks4b interacts with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a major chaperone protein that protects cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in vitro and in vivo. Gain- and loss-of-function studies of Anks4b revealed that it regulates sensitivity to thapsigargin (TG)-induced ER stress and apoptosis in MIN6 β-cell line. Our results suggest that HNF4α plays an important role in the regulation of ER stress and apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and allowed free access to food and water. All animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Committee of Kumamoto University. Pancreatic islets were isolated from 45-week-old female βHNF4α KO mice (n = 5) and control flox/flox mice (n = 5) by collagenase digestion (12Sato Y. Endo H. Okuyama H. Takeda T. Iwahashi H.

Total RNA was prepared from the isolated islets with an RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and its quality was confirmed by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). DNA microarray analysis was performed by the Kurabo GeneChip custom analysis service with GeneChip mouse genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). For identification of potential HNF4α binding sites, 5 kb of the promoter sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site was retrieved from the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser, and the sequence was analyzed by using the Transcription Element Search System (TESS) and the HNF4 Motif Finder generated by Sladek and colleagues (38Bolotin E. Liao H. Ta T.C. Yang C. Hwang-Verslues W. Evans J.R. Jiang T. Sladek F.M. Integrated approach for the identification of human hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α target genes using protein binding microarrays.Hepatology. 2010; 51: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy micro kit (catalog number 74004, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or Sepasol-RNA I super reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Then 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA with a PrimeScript RT reagent kit and gDNA Eraser (RR047A, TaKaRa Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (RR820A, TaKaRa) in an ABI 7300 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The specific primers employed are shown in supplemental Table 1. Relative expression of each gene was normalized to that of TATA-binding protein. The MIN6 pancreatic β-cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose, 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air (13Miyazaki J.

HEK293, HeLa, and COS-7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured in DMEM containing 2.5 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.02% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 μg/ml Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture (1/100)) from Nacalai Tesque. Total protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with primary antibodies. After incubation with the secondary antibodies, the proteins were visualized using Chemi-Lumi One Super (Nacalai Tesque) and a LAS-1000 imaging system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-HNF4α (1:1000) (H1415; Perseus Proteomics, Tokyo, Japan), anti-β-actin (1:2000) (A5441; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-harmonin (SAB250188; Sigma-Aldrich) (1:1000), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp-175) (1:1000) (antibody 9661, Cell Signaling), and anti-GRP78 (1:1000) (sc-1051, Santa Cruz Biotechnology or antibody 4332, Cell Signaling). Anti-Anks4b antiserum was generated by using a peptide that formed the central region of mouse Anks4b protein (amino acid residues 147–344). The nucleotide sequence of the peptide was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers (5′-CGGATCCCCATGAAAGAGTGCGAACGGCTT-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCCCTTACCATTCTACTTCTTCTTC-3′), and then it was subcloned into the pET28C+ vector. After expression in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), the His-tagged peptide was purified with His binding resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl. Subsequently, this peptide was used to inoculate rabbits for the production of anti-Anks4b antiserum. The mouse Anks4b promoter containing a putative HNF4α binding site was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers (5′-AGTGGTCATTGCCATGGTTGGT-3′ and 5′-AGGTAGGAGTCTTTGTCTAGGC-3′), and then it was subcloned into the pGL3 basic reporter (Promega). Transcription binding sites were altered by PCR-based mutagenesis to produce an HNF4α binding site mutant (GAACGGGGGCC) and an HNF1α binding site mutant (CTGACCGGCCAG). CD1b-HNF4α is a dominant negative mutant of HNF4α lacking the AF-2 activation domain (3Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C.

As described previously (14Yang Q. Yamagata K. Yamamoto K. Cao Y. Miyagawa J. Fukamizu A. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y.

The pcDNA3.1-wild-type (WT)-HNF1α and pcDNA3.1-P291fsinsC-HNF1α expression plasmids have been described previously (15Yamagata K. Yang Q. Yamamoto K. Iwahashi H. Miyagawa J. Okita K. Yoshiuchi I.

MIN6 cells or HEK293 cells (3 × 105 cells each) were seeded into 24-well plates at 18 h before transfection. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or X-treme GENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h after transfection, luciferase activity was measured by using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). A nuclear extract of MIN6 cells was prepared as described previously (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract from isolated mammalian nuclei.Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Then 5 μg of the nuclear extract was incubated with 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the HNF4α or HNF1α binding sequence in a mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Ficoll, 70 mm KCl, 30 mg/ml BSA, 4.8% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). Next, the DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at 120 V for 2 h, after which the dried gel was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen and analyzed with a BAS 2000 (Fuji Film). The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: wild-type HNF4α binding site (5′-GGCCGGAGTGAACTTTGGCCTGGGGTGATA-3′); mutant HNF4α binding site (5′-GGCCGGAGTGAATGGGAGCCTGGGGTGATA-3′); wild-type HNF1α binding site (5′-CCCCGTCACTGATTAACCAGCCCTGTTGGA-3′); and mutant HNF1α binding site (5′-CCCCGTCACTGACCGGCCAGCCCTGTTGGA-3′). An anti-HNF1 antibody (H205, sc-8986) was used for the supershift assay. MIN6 cells were fixed in DMEM containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and then cross-linking was quenched by placing the cells in 200 mm glycine for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated in Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at room temperature and then lysed in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA) followed by 5-fold dilution in ChIP dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 167 mm NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, and 0.11% sodium deoxycholate). Sonication was performed with a Sonifier 150 (Branson). Soluble sheared chromatin (20 μg) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with magnetic beads (Invitrogen Dynabeads protein G) bound to 2 μg of anti-HNF4α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-6556), anti-RNA polymerase II monoclonal antibody (Active Motif), or control IgG (Cell Signaling Technology antibody 2729) followed by sequential washing with low salt radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), high salt radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), wash buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 500 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.7% sodium deoxycholate), and Tris-EDTA. Then immune complexes were eluted from the magnetic beads by incubation with ChIP direct elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS) for 20 min at 65 °C. For reverse cross-linking, the eluate was incubated overnight at 65 °C, and then DNA fragments were purified by using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). PCR was performed to identify Anks4b promoter fragments in the immunoprecipitated DNA using a pair of primers (5′-TTCACCACACTCATGACACACC-3′ and 5′-AGGTAGGAGTCTTTGTCTAGGC-3′). Mouse Anks4b cDNA was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers (5′-CGGATCCCCATGTCTACCCGCTATCACCAA-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCTTAGAGGCTGGTGTCAACCAACT-3′) and was subcloned into the pGEX4T2 vector (GE Healthcare). Anks4b deletion mutants (N-Anks4b (amino acid residues 1–126), M-Anks4b (amino acid residues 127–345), and C-Anks4b (amino acid residues 346–423)) were also generated by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX4T3 vector (GE Healthcare). GST-Anks4b proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). GST or GST fusion proteins (20 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 500 μg of mouse liver lysate. After binding overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed with lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). Then the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Silver-stained gels were subjected to in-gel digestion followed by extraction of peptides and proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS. Gel digestion and peptide extraction were performed as reported previously (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins silver-stained polyacrylamide gels.Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7806) Google Scholar). The peptide samples thus obtained were analyzed in an ESI-Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer (6510; Agilent) with an HPLC chip-MS system, consisting of a nano pump (G2226; Agilent) with a four-channel microvacuum degasser (G1379B; Agilent), a microfluidic chip cube (G4240; Agilent), a capillary pump (G1376A; Agilent) with degasser (G1379B; Agilent), and an autosampler with thermostat (G1377A; Agilent). All modules were controlled by MassHunter software (version B.02.00; Agilent). A microfluidic reverse-phase-HPLC chip (Zorbax 300SB-C18; 5-μm particle size, 75-mm inner diameter, and 43 mm in length) was used for separation of peptides. The nano pump was employed to generate gradient nano flow at 600 nl/min, with the mobile phase being 0.1% formic acid in MS-grade water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient was 5–75% solvent B over 9 min. A capillary pump was used to load samples with a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid at 4 μl/min. The Agilent ESI-Q-TOF was operated in the positive ionization mode (ESI+), with an ionization voltage of 1,850 V and a fragmentor voltage of 175 V at 300 °C. Fragmentation of protonated molecular ions was conducted in the auto-MS/MS mode, starting with a collision energy voltage of 3 V that was increased by 3.7 V per 100 Da. The selected m/z ranges were 300–2,400 Da in the MS mode and 59–3,000 Da in the MS/MS mode. The data output consisted of one full mass spectrum (with three fragmentation patterns per spectrum) every 250 ms. The three highest peaks of each MS spectrum were selected for fragmentation. Mass lists were created in the form of Mascot generic files and were used as the input for Mascot MS/MS ion searches of the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant (NCBI nr) database using the Matrix Science Web server Mascot version 2.2. Default search parameters were as follows: enzyme, trypsin; maximum missed cleavage, 1; variable modifications, carbamidomethyl (Cys); peptide tolerance, ± 1.2 Da; MS/MS tolerance, ± 0.6 Da; peptide charge, 2+ and 3+; instrument, ESI-Q-TOF. For positive identification, the result of (−10 × log (p)) could not exceed the significance threshold (p < 0.05). Mouse Anks4b cDNA was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers (5′-CGGATCCCCATGTCTACCCGCTATCACCAA-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCTTAGAGGCTGGTGTCAACCAACT-3′) and was subcloned in-frame into the pcDNA3-HA and pcDNA3-FLAG expression vectors. The GRP78 expression vector (pCMV-BiP-Myc-KDEL-wt) was a gift from Dr. Ron Prywes (Addgene plasmid 27164). After transfection into COS-7 cells, the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 175 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque)) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Then 700 μg of cell lysate and FLAG tag antibody beads (Wako) were mixed and stirred at 4 °C for 18 h. After washing with immunoprecipitation buffer, proteins were eluted by using DYKDDDDK peptide (Wako). A sample of the eluate and 2% of the cell lysate (from before processing) were subjected to Western blotting analysis. Both the pcDNA3-HA-Anks4b and the pCMV-BiP-Myc-KDEL-wt vectors were transfected into HeLa, COS-7, and MIN6 cells with X-treme GENE (Roche Diagnostics) for 24 h. Then the cells were fixed in 10% neutralized formalin and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% BSA/PBS. Monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody (1:400) (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) and mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (1:400) (Wako) were used as the primary antibodies, whereas Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) were used as the secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence was detected under a laser scanning confocal microscope (FV-1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Mouse Anks4b and human HNF4α7 cDNAs were subcloned into the pMXs-puro retrovirus vector for overexpression (18Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T. Kumagai H.

Specific shRNA sequences for mouse HNF4α (5′-CCAAGAGCTGCAGATTGAT-3′) and Anks4b (5′-GAAGAAGACTCATTTCCAA-3′) were designed using the Clontech RNAi target sequence selector. Oligonucleotides encoding shRNA were synthesized and cloned into the pSIREN-RetroQ retroviral shRNA expression vector (Clontech). Then the pMXs-Anks4b, pMXs-HNF4α7, and empty pMXs vectors were transfected into Plat-E cells using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). For knockdown experiments, transfection was done with pSIREN-RetroQ-Anks4b, pSIREN-RetroQ-HNF4α, and the negative control pSIREN-RetroQ vector. MIN6 cells were infected with the retroviruses and selected by incubation with puromycin (5 μg/ml) (12Sato Y. Endo H. Okuyama H. Takeda T. Iwahashi H. Imagawa A. Yamagata K. Shimomura I. Inoue M.

An annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA) was used for the apoptosis assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. MIN6 cells were cultured in DMEM for 30 h with or without 1 μm thapsigargin (Nacalai Tesque). After incubation in trypsin/EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1×resuspension buffer, and the cells were stained with annexin V-FITC antibody. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature in the dark, stained cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tomy Digital Biology, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analyses were performed using Statview J-5.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The significance of differences was assessed with the unpaired t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. To identify target genes of HNF4α in pancreatic β-cells, DNA microarray analysis was performed using islets from βHNF4α KO mice and control mice. Body weight and blood glucose levels were similar for these two strains of mice (body weight was 32.7 ± 1.7 g (n = 5) versus 34.1 ± 1.9 g (n = 5) and random blood glucose was 128 ± 27 mg/dl (n = 5) versus 114 ± 24 mg/dl (n = 5) for βHNF4α KO versus control mice). Microarray analysis identified 56 up-regulated genes (signal log ratio ≥2) and 100 down-regulated genes (signal log ratio ≤−1.5) in βHNF4α KO islets (supplemental Table 2). Expression of the majority of the genes known to be involved in glucose metabolism was unchanged. To validate these results, expression of mRNA for genes randomly chosen from both the down-regulated and the up-regulated groups was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR in an independent group of 12-week-old male mice. As a result, differential expression of most genes was confirmed (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1). Gupta et al. (19Gupta R.K. Gao N. Gorski R.K. White P. Hardy O.T. Rafiq K. Brestelli J.E. Chen G.

Expression of ST5 mRNA was reduced by 24.6% in βHNF4α KO islets (supplemental Fig. 2). Next, we performed a computational scan of the HNF4α binding motif in the down-regulated genes. This identified 22 high affinity HNF4α binding sequences in the mouse promoter. In 3 out of 22 genes, the HNF4 motif was also conserved in the corresponding human genome. These three genes encoded Anks4b, guanylate cyclase 2c (Gucy2c), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (Ppargc1a). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed a significant decrease of Anks4b expression in the islets of 12-week-old βHNF4α KO mice (17.3% of the control level, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the reduction of Gucy2c mRNA expression was marginal (21.7% of the control level, p = 0.06), and Ppargc1a mRNA levels were unchanged. The difference of sex and age of mice or different detection systems might have contributed to the different results. To elucidate the direct effect of HNF4α on"

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable technique used to detect age-related changes in the human brain. Currently, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) enables the exploration of subtle and distributed changes of data obtained from structural MRI images. In this study, a new MVPA approach based on sparse representation has been employed to investigate the anatomical covariance patterns of normal aging. Two groups of participants (group 1∶290 participants; group 2∶56 participants) were evaluated in this study. These two groups were scanned with two 1.5 T MRI machines. In the first group, we obtained the discriminative patterns using a t-test filter and sparse representation step. We were able to distinguish the young from old cohort with a very high accuracy using only a few voxels of the discriminative patterns (group 1∶98.4%; group 2∶96.4%). The experimental results showed that the selected voxels may be categorized into two components according to the two steps in the proposed method. The first component focuses on the precentral and postcentral gyri, and the caudate nucleus, which play an important role in sensorimotor tasks. The strongest volume reduction with age was observed in these clusters. The second component is mainly distributed over the cerebellum, thalamus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. These regions are not only critical nodes of the sensorimotor circuitry but also the cognitive circuitry although their volume shows a relative resilience against aging. Considering the voxels selection procedure, we suggest that the aging of the sensorimotor and cognitive brain regions identified in this study has a covarying relationship with each other."
https://openalex.org/W2102630266,"In the Neotropics the predominant pathway to intensify productivity is generally thought to be to convert grasslands to sown pastures, mostly in monoculture. This article examines how above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) in semi-natural grasslands and sown pastures in Central America respond to rainfall by: (i) assessing the relationships between ANPP and accumulated rainfall and indices of rainfall distribution, (ii) evaluating the variability of ANPP between and within seasons, and (iii) estimating the temporal stability of ANPP. We conducted sequential biomass harvests during 12 periods of 22 days and related those to rainfall. There were significant relationships between ANPP and cumulative rainfall in 22-day periods for both vegetation types and a model including a linear and quadratic term explained 74% of the variation in the data. There was also a significant correlation between ANPP and the number of rainfall events for both vegetation types. Sown pastures had higher ANPP increments per unit rainfall and higher ANPP at the peak of the rainy season than semi-natural grasslands. In contrast, semi-natural grasslands showed higher ANPP early in the dry season. The temporal stability of ANPP was higher in semi-natural grasslands than in the sown pastures in the dry season and over a whole annual cycle. Our results reveal that, contrary to conventional thinking amongst pasture scientists, there appears to be no increase in ANPP arising from replacing semi-natural grasslands with sown pastures under prevailing pasture management practices in seasonally dry climates, while the temporal distribution of ANPP is more even in semi-natural grasslands. Neither sown pastures nor semi-natural grasslands are productive towards the end of the dry season, indicating the potential importance of the widespread practice of retaining tree cover in pastures."
https://openalex.org/W1966010275,"The development of novel fertilization treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic injection, has made pregnancy possible regardless of the level of activity of the spermatozoa; however, the etiology of male-factor infertility is poorly understood. Multiple studies, primarily through the use of transgenic animals, have contributed to a list of candidate genes that may affect male infertility in humans. We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a cause of male infertility in an analysis of spermatogenesis-specific genes.We carried out the prevalence of SNPs in the coding region of phosphoglycerate mutase 4 (PGAM4) on the X chromosome by the direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA from male patients. Using RT-PCR and western blot analyses, we identified that PGAM4 is a functional retrogene that is expressed predominantly in the testes and is associated with male infertility. PGAM4 is expressed in post-meiotic stages, including spermatids and spermatozoa in the testes, and the principal piece of the flagellum and acrosome in ejaculated spermatozoa. A case-control study revealed that 4.5% of infertile patients carry the G75C polymorphism, which causes an amino acid substitution in the encoded protein. Furthermore, an assay for enzymatic activity demonstrated that this polymorphism decreases the enzyme's activity both in vitro and in vivo.These results suggest that PGAM4, an X-linked retrogene, is a fundamental gene in human male reproduction and may escape meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. These findings provide fresh insight into elucidating the mechanisms of male infertility."
https://openalex.org/W2091178244,"Background Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), a lipid mediator currently used in treatment of human disease, is a critical regulator of adaptive immune responses. Although PGI2 signaling suppressed Th1 and Th2 immune responses, the role of PGI2 in Th17 differentiation is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings In mouse CD4+CD62L+ naïve T cell culture, the PGI2 analogs iloprost and cicaprost increased IL-17A and IL-22 protein production and Th17 differentiation in vitro. This effect was augmented by IL-23 and was dependent on PGI2 receptor IP signaling. In mouse bone marrow-derived CD11c+ dendritic cells (BMDCs), PGI2 analogs increased the ratio of IL-23/IL-12, which is correlated with increased ability of BMDCs to stimulate naïve T cells for IL-17A production. Moreover, IP knockout mice had delayed onset of a Th17-associated neurological disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and reduced infiltration of IL-17A-expressing mononuclear cells in the spinal cords compared to wild type mice. These results suggest that PGI2 promotes in vivo Th17 responses. Conclusion The preferential stimulation of Th17 differentiation by IP signaling may have important clinical implications as PGI2 and its analogs are commonly used to treat human pulmonary hypertension."

Here, we investigated molecular determinants of sensitivity and resistance of cell lines of different tumor types towards arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide was the most cytotoxic compound among 8 arsenicals investigated in the NCI cell line panel. We correlated transcriptome-wide microarray-based mRNA expression to the IC50 values for arsenic trioxide by bioinformatic approaches (COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses, Ingenuity signaling pathway analysis). Among the identified pathways were signaling routes for p53, integrin-linked kinase, and actin cytoskeleton. Genes from these pathways significantly predicted cellular response to arsenic trioxide. Then, we analyzed whether classical drug resistance factors may also play a role for arsenic trioxide. Cell lines transfected with cDNAs for catalase, thioredoxin, or the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene were more resistant to arsenic trioxide than mock vector transfected cells. Multidrug-resistant cells overexpressing the MDR1, MRP1 or BCRP genes were not cross-resistant to arsenic trioxide. Our approach revealed that response of tumor cells towards arsenic trioxide is multi-factorial."
https://openalex.org/W2039769657,"The androgen receptor (AR) has a critical role in the growth and progression of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancers. To identify novel inhibitors of AR transactivation that block growth of prostate cancer cells, a luciferase-based high-throughput screen of ~160,000 small molecules was performed in cells stably expressing AR and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-luciferase reporter. CPIC (1-(3-(2-chlorophenoxy) propyl)-1H-indole-3-carbonitrile) was identified as a small molecule that blocks AR transactivation to a greater extent than other steroid receptors. CPIC inhibited AR-mediated proliferation of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines, with minimal toxicity in AR-negative cell lines. CPIC treatment also reduced the anchorage-independent growth of LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells. CPIC functioned as a pure antagonist by inhibiting the expression of AR-regulated genes in LAPC-4 cells that express wild-type AR and exhibited weak agonist activity in LNCaP cells that express the mutant AR-T877A. CPIC treatment did not reduce AR levels or alter its nuclear localization. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify the site of action of CPIC. CPIC inhibited recruitment of androgen-bound AR to the PSA promoter and enhancer sites to a greater extent than bicalutamide. CPIC is a new therapeutic inhibitor that targets AR-mediated gene activation with potential to arrest the growth of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2053090725,"To reach the lymphatics, migrating dendritic cells (DCs) need to interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Heparanase, a mammalian endo-β-D-glucuronidase, specifically degrades heparan sulfate proteoglycans ubiquitously associated with the cell surface and ECM. The role of heparanase in the physiology of bone marrow-derived DCs was studied in mutant heparanase knock-out (Hpse-KO) mice. Immature DCs from Hpse-KO mice exhibited a more mature phenotype; however their transmigration was significantly delayed, but not completely abolished, most probably due to the observed upregulation of MMP-14 and CCR7. Despite their mature phenotype, uptake of beads was comparable and uptake of apoptotic cells was more efficient in DCs from Hpse-KO mice. Heparanase is an important enzyme for DC transmigration. Together with CCR7 and its ligands, and probably MMP-14, heparanase controls DC trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2010966350,"Origin recognition complex (Orc) plays an essential role in directing assembly of prereplicative complex at selective sites on chromosomes. However, Orc from vertebrates is reported to bind to DNA in a sequence-nonspecific manner, and it is still unclear how it selects specific genomic loci and how Cdc6, another conserved AAA+ factor known to interact with Orc, participates in this process. Replication from oriP, the latent origin of Epstein-Barr virus, provides an excellent model system for the study of initiation on the host chromosomes because it is known to depend on prereplicative complex factors, including Orc and Mcm. Here, we show that Orc is recruited selectively at the essential dyad symmetry element in nuclear extracts in a manner dependent on EBNA1, which specifically binds to dyad symmetry. With purified proteins, EBNA1 can recruit both Cdc6 and Orc independently on a DNA containing EBNA1 binding sites, and Cdc6 facilitates the Orc recruitment by EBNA1. Purified Cdc6 directly binds to EBNA1, whereas association of Orc with EBNA1 requires the presence of the oriP DNA. Nuclease protection assays suggest that Orc associates with DNA segments on both sides adjacent to the EBNA1 binding sites and that this process is stimulated by the presence of Cdc6. Thus, EBNA1 can direct localized assembly of Orc in a process that is facilitated by Cdc6. The possibility of similar modes of recruitment of Orc/Cdc6 at the human chromosomal origins will be discussed. Background: Enzymatic studies on the steps of mammalian DNA replication with purified proteins are essential to elucidate its mechanisms. Results: Association of Orc with oriP requires EBNA1 and is stimulated by Cdc6 directly interacting with EBNA1. Conclusion: EBNA1 recruits Cdc6/Orc at oriP, permitting site-specific assembly of pre-RC. Significance: This study provides novel insight into a mechanism for initiation of mammalian DNA replication with purified factors."
https://openalex.org/W1981064470,"Female birds transfer antibodies to their offspring via the egg yolk, thus possibly providing passive immunity against infectious diseases to which hatchlings may be exposed, thereby affecting their fitness. It is nonetheless unclear whether the amount of maternal antibodies transmitted into egg yolks varies with female quality and egg laying order. In this paper, we investigated the transfer of maternal antibodies against type A influenza viruses (anti-AIV antibodies) by a long-lived colonial seabird, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), in relation to fluctuating asymmetry in females, i.e. the random deviation from perfect symmetry in bilaterally symmetric morphological and anatomical traits. In particular, we tested whether females with greater asymmetry transmitted fewer antibodies to their eggs, and whether within-clutch variation in yolk antibodies varied according to the maternal level of fluctuating asymmetry. We found that asymmetric females were in worse physical condition, produced fewer antibodies, and transmitted lower amounts of antibodies to their eggs. We also found that, within a given clutch, yolk antibody level decreased with egg laying order, but this laying order effect was more pronounced in clutches laid by the more asymmetric females. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that maternal quality interacts with egg laying order in determining the amount of maternal antibodies transmitted to the yolks. They also highlight the usefulness of fluctuating asymmetry as a sensitive indicator of female quality and immunocompetence in birds."

In Japan, the Park-Sasaki method of speed-reading involves organized visual training while forming both a relaxed and concentrated state of mind, as in meditation. The present study examined relationships between reading speed, sentence comprehension, and eye movements while reading short Japanese novels. In addition to normal untrained readers, three middle-level trainees and one high-level expert on this method were included for the two case studies. Methodology/Principal Findings In Study 1, three of 17 participants were middle-level trainees on the speed-reading method. Immediately after reading each story once on a computer monitor, participants answered true or false questions regarding the content of the novel. Eye movements while reading were recorded using an eye-tracking system. Results revealed higher reading speed and lower comprehension scores in the trainees than in the untrained participants. Furthermore, eye-tracking data by untrained participants revealed multiple correlations between reading speed, accuracy and eye-movement measures, with faster readers showing shorter fixation durations and larger saccades in X than slower readers. In Study 2, participants included a high-level expert and 14 untrained students. The expert showed higher reading speed and statistically comparable, although numerically lower, comprehension scores compared with the untrained participants. During test sessions this expert moved her eyes along a nearly straight horizontal line as a first pass, without moving her eyes over the whole sentence display as did the untrained students. Conclusions/Significance In addition to revealing correlations between speed, comprehension and eye movements in reading Japanese contemporary novels by untrained readers, we describe cases of speed-reading trainees regarding relationships between these variables. The trainees overall tended to show poor performance influenced by the speed-accuracy trade-off, although this trade-off may be reduced in the case of at least one high-level expert."

It also examines the potential for recipient countries to increase domestic public financing for health.This is a cross-sectional study of 104 countries that received Global Fund disbursements in 2009. It analyses data on Global Fund disbursements; health financing indicators; government revenue and expenditure; and burden of disease.Global Fund disbursements made up 0.37% of THE across all 104 countries; but with considerable country variation ranging from 0.002% to 53.4%. Global Fund disbursements to government amounted to 0.47% of GHE across the 104 countries, but again with considerable variation (in three countries more than half of GHE was based on Global Fund support). Although the Global Fund provides progressively more funding for lower income countries on average, there is much variation at the country such that here was no correlation between per capita GF disbursements and per capita THE, nor between per capita GF disbursement to government and per capita GHE. There was only a slight positive correlation between per capita GF disbursement and burden of disease. Several countries with a high degree of 'financial dependency' upon the Fund have the potential to increase levels of domestic financing for health.The Global Fund can improve its targeting of resources so that it better matches the pattern of global need. To do this it needs to: a) reduce the extent to which funds are allocated on a demand-driven basis; and b) align its funding model to broader health systems financing and patterns of health expenditure beyond the three diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1984773015,"We present a model of disease transmission on a regular and small world network and compare different control options. Comparison is based on a total cost of epidemic, including cost of palliative treatment of ill individuals and preventive cost aimed at vaccination or culling of susceptible individuals. Disease is characterized by pre-symptomatic phase, which makes detection and control difficult. Three general strategies emerge: global preventive treatment, local treatment within a neighborhood of certain size and only palliative treatment with no prevention. While the choice between the strategies depends on a relative cost of palliative and preventive treatment, the details of the local strategy and, in particular, the size of the optimal treatment neighborhood depend on the epidemiological factors. The required extent of prevention is proportional to the size of the infection neighborhood, but depends on time till detection and time till treatment in a non-nonlinear (power) law. The optimal size of control neighborhood is also highly sensitive to the relative cost, particularly for inefficient detection and control application. These results have important consequences for design of prevention strategies aiming at emerging diseases for which parameters are not nessecerly known in advance."

We previously reported that a subset of dorsally expressed genes depends not only on Wnt/β-Catenin stimulation, but also on a MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor/IL1-receptor (TLR/IL1-R) signaling pathway. Here we show that these two signal transduction cascades converge in the nucleus to coactivate gene transcription in blastulae through a direct interaction between β-Catenin and NF-κB proteins. A transdominant inhibitor of NF-κB, ΔNIκBα, phenocopies loss of MyD88 protein function, implicating Rel/NF-κB proteins as selective activators of dorsal-specific gene expression. Sensitive axis formation assays in the embryo demonstrate that dorsalization by Wnt/β-Catenin requires NF-κB protein activity, and vice versa. Xenopus nodal-related 3 (Xnr3) is one of the genes with dual β-Catenin/NF-κB input, and a proximal NF-κB consensus site contributes to the regional activity of its promoter. We demonstrate in vitro binding of Xenopus β-Catenin to several XRel proteins. This interaction is observed in vivo upon Wnt-stimulation. Finally, we show that a synthetic luciferase reporter gene responds to both endogenous and exogenous β-Catenin levels in an NF-κB motif dependent manner. These results suggest that β-Catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator of NF-κB-dependent transcription in frog primary embryonic cells."

It is also home to a quarter of all global diversity. Large swathes of forest are removed each year, and many models have attempted to predict the spatial patterns of this forest loss. The spatial patterns of deforestation are determined largely by the patterns of roads that open access to frontier areas and expansion of the road network in the Amazon is largely determined by profit seeking logging activities. Here we present predictions for the spatial distribution of standing value of timber across the Amazon. We show that the patterns of timber value reflect large-scale ecological gradients, determining the spatial distribution of functional traits of trees which are, in turn, correlated with timber values. We expect that understanding the spatial patterns of timber value across the Amazon will aid predictions of logging movements and thus predictions of potential future road developments. These predictions in turn will be of great use in estimating the spatial patterns of deforestation in this globally important biome."

Adapting this method to nonlinear models, however, is known to be problematic. In this paper, we consider the simple case when the genetic instrument, the risk factor, and the outcome are all binary. We compare via simulations the usual two-stages estimate of a causal odds-ratio and its adjusted version with a recently proposed estimate in the context of a clinical trial with noncompliance. In contrast to the former two, we confirm that the latter is (under some conditions) a valid estimate of a causal odds-ratio defined in the subpopulation of compliers, and we propose its use in the context of Mendelian randomization. By analogy with a clinical trial with noncompliance, compliers are those individuals for whom the presence/absence of the risk factor X is determined by the presence/absence of the genetic variant Z (i.e., for whom we would observe X = Z whatever the alleles randomly received at conception). We also recall and illustrate the huge variability of instrumental variable estimates when the instrument is weak (i.e., with a low percentage of compliers, as is typically the case with genetic instruments for which this proportion is frequently smaller than 10%) where the inter-quartile range of our simulated estimates was up to 18 times higher compared to a conventional (e.g., intention-to-treat) approach. We thus conclude that the need to find stronger instruments is probably as important as the need to develop a methodology allowing to consistently estimate a causal odds-ratio."
