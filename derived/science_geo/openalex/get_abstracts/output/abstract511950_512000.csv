Responses to external stimuli are strongly modulated by the brain’s internal dynamics, which are organized around characteristic states that vary with arousal, attention, and behavioral context (Harris and Thiele, 2011Harris K.D.

Across multiple species, more active states are associated with cortical desynchronization, a reduction in the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations measured in EEG, LFP, or intracellular recordings. For example, primate cortex is more desynchronized during attentive states (Gould et al., 2011Gould I.C. Rushworth M.F. Nobre A.C.

Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation: An Unmet Public Health Problem. National Academies Press, Washington, DC2006Google Scholar). Nonprimate mammals also display a spectrum of cortical dynamics during waking periods, from more synchronized to more desynchronized states, and this internal variability modulates responses to external stimuli (Hei et al., 2014Hei X.

Specifically, recent work in awake mice has revealed that the cortex is desynchronized during bouts of exploratory behavior, such as whisking (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.H.

In mouse primary visual cortex (V1), this desynchronization is coupled with an enhancement of sensory responses (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A.

Subthreshold mechanisms underlying state-dependent modulation of visual responses.Neuron. 2013; 80: 350-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and similar effects are seen in primary somatosensory cortex (area S1; Zagha et al., 2013Zagha E. Casale A.E. Sachdev R.N. McGinley M.J. McCormick D.A. Motor cortex feedback influences sensory processing by modulating network state.Neuron. 2013; 79: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Between bouts of activity, there are longer epochs of “quiet wakefulness,” periods of behavioral quiescence that have not been well studied. While previous reports have emphasized the average increase in low-frequency synchronous activity during quiet wakefulness, we observed second-to-second state fluctuations during these periods in both V1 and S1. Fast state fluctuations during quiet wakefulness were closely tracked by changes in pupil diameter. During dilation, we found that the cortex was desynchronized and more responsive to external stimuli, compared to constriction, when low-frequency oscillations were enhanced and ensemble correlations were increased. (In this study we always use “dilation” and “constriction” to refer to active dilating and constricting, and not the state of being dilated or constricted.) Furthermore, vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) GABAergic interneurons and somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) interneurons were differentially modulated during dilation and constriction. These interneuron subtypes have recently been shown to participate in a canonical local circuit essential for the enhancement of visual responses during running (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A. Huang Z.J. Stryker M.P. A cortical circuit for gain control by behavioral state.Cell. 2014; 156: 1139-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), and our results suggest that this mechanism may be recapitulated in the state fluctuations that occur during quiet wakefulness. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of layer 2/3 cortical neurons in awake mice (n = 111 total neurons from 38 animals) while monitoring treadmill motion, whisking behavior, eye movements, and pupil diameter (Figures 1A and 1B ). All analyses in Figures 1, 2, and 3 were of spontaneous recordings, in order to avoid any confounding effects of visual stimuli. Periods of running, whisking, and eye movements usually occurred together (Figures 1C and S1; Movie S1), consistent with the idea that these behaviors are manifestations of a common exploratory state (Grant et al., 2012Grant R.A. Mitchinson B. Prescott T.J. The development of whisker control in rats in relation to locomotion.Dev. Psychobiol. 2012; 54: 151-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Approximately 90% of these epochs were accompanied by an increase in pupil size (Figures 1B and 1D; mean increase in pupil diameter during running periods 202 ± 11 μm, mean ± SEM; see Experimental Procedures). Consistent with previous studies (Bennett et al., 2013Bennett C. Arroyo S. Hestrin S.

Motor cortex feedback influences sensory processing by modulating network state.Neuron. 2013; 79: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we found that during exploratory behaviors (running and/or whisking), the membrane potential (Vm) in both S1 and V1 was desynchronized (red horizontal lines under example V1 recordings in Figure 1B). Relative to quiet wakefulness, Vm in these periods was depolarized (S1: 1.9 ± 0.4 mV, p < 0.001; V1: 3.6 ± 0.7 mV, p < 0.001) and less variable (change in Vm standard deviation, S1: −1.4 ± 0.2 mV, p < 0.0001; V1: −1.7 ± 0.4 mV, p < 0.001), and low-frequency oscillations were reduced (Hilbert amplitude of 2–10 Hz band-pass filtered Vm; S1: −1.4 ± 0.2 mV, p < 0.0001; V1: −1.3 ± 0.2 mV, p < 0.0001; Figure 1E; mean difference ± SEM; Wilcoxon signed-rank test for all comparisons). High-frequency oscillations in the gamma range were also enhanced during activity compared to quiet wakefulness (Figure S1B), consistent with previous reports (Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The large overlap in the amount of synchronous activity during active and quiet periods (Figure 1F) and the reliable increase in pupil size during the desynchronized periods associated with running and whisking led us to ask whether pupil dilation might also be associated with a desynchronized state during quiet wakefulness. To study quiet wakefulness, we excluded periods of running and whisking, and also saccades and blinks, which occurred rarely outside of active behaviors (less than one saccade per minute and less than one blink every 5 min; Figure S1A). We found that during quiet wakefulness, Vm variability was reduced during dilation versus constriction (change in Vm standard deviation, S1: −0.6 ± 0.08 mV, p < 0.0001; V1: −1.2 ± 0.2 mV, p < 0.0001). This effect could be explained primarily by a reduction in low-frequency oscillations (2–10 Hz Hilbert amplitude; S1: −0.56 ± 0.09 mV, p < 0.001; V1: −0.8 ± 0.2 mV, p < 0.001; Figure 1G; mean difference ± SEM; Wilcoxon signed-rank test for all comparisons). A modest increase in Vm oscillations at higher (gamma) frequencies was also observed during dilation compared to constriction (Figure S1C). However, in contrast with the effects of running and whisking, mean Vm was not significantly different for dilation versus constriction. Pupil fluctuations were much smaller and faster during quiet wakefulness than around bouts of exploratory behavior (Figures 2A–2C; Movies S1 and S2). The duration of individual dilation and constriction periods during quiet wakefulness varied, although in general dilation was faster than constriction (mean dilating duration 1.6 s, mean constricting duration 2.0 s; Figure S2). In order to characterize the time course of the change in synchronous activity relative to pupil fluctuations during quiet wakefulness, we binned the instantaneous 2–10 Hz Hilbert amplitude by the phase of the pupil trace at each time point, aligning multiple cycles of dilation and constriction to one canonical cycle. We found that the amplitude of low-frequency Vm oscillations reached a minimum toward the middle of the dilating phase and peaked during constriction (Figure 2D; plots are mean ± SEM across cells). Overall, the average intracellular membrane potential was more desynchronized during dilation in both areas S1 and V1 (Figure 2E; S1 and V1, p < 0.001; paired t test; bars are mean change during dilation compared to constriction over cells, error bars are SEM; see also Figure S3). This relationship between cortical state and pupil fluctuations persisted even after removing occasional small postural adjustments or whisker twitches from our analysis and after habituating the mice to the treadmill for 30 min per day for 5 days prior to recording (Movie S1; Figure S4). The robust link between pupil dilation and membrane potential desynchronization in area S1 argues against the possibility of a purely visual effect related to increased illumination of the retina. Although a small number of S1 cells (2/17) were weakly visually responsive (responsiveness generously defined as any significant change in Vm from baseline during a visual stimulus; α = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), the majority of visually unresponsive S1 cells still showed a robust relationship between dilation and Vm desynchronization (10/15; Figure 2F). To further rule out the possibility that changes in the visual input alone were responsible for cortical desynchronization, we patched cells in V1 of 8-week- to 4-month-old FVB/NJ (FVB) mice. In these mice, the retinal ganglion cell layer undergoes severe degeneration by P21 (Chang et al., 2002Chang B. Hawes N.L. Hurd R.E. Davisson M.T. Nusinowitz S. Heckenlively J.R. Retinal degeneration mutants in the mouse.Vision Res. 2002; 42: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type mice, where most of the V1 cells were visually responsive (12/13), none of the patched cells (0/9) were visually responsive in FVB mice. Yet the relationship between pupil fluctuations and cortical state was also observed in these cells (Figures 2D–2F; p < 0.05 Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 2E). We did not observe a significant difference in the effect across the three groups of cells (S1, V1, FVB; one-way ANOVA, p = 0.53). To examine whether state changes were tracked more closely by dilation and constriction or by pupil diameter, we examined the correlation between Vm synchronization and the derivative and absolute size of the pupil (Figures 2G and 2H). We found that the amplitude of 2–10 Hz oscillations was more closely tracked by the derivative than diameter of the pupil (mean fraction of variance explained in a two-way ANOVA for each cell by derivative, 0.13; by diameter, 0.05; p < 0.0001, t test). Recently, Fu and colleagues found that VIP+ interneurons are activated during running, while SOM+ interneurons are inhibited (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A. Huang Z.J. Stryker M.P. A cortical circuit for gain control by behavioral state.Cell. 2014; 156: 1139-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), consistent with several recent studies showing that VIP+ cells directly inhibit SOM+ cells, producing a net disinhibition of nearby pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, Fu et al. demonstrated that this cortical circuit was both necessary and sufficient to produce the enhancement of visual responses observed during running. We initially sought to replicate the effect of active behavior on these interneuron subtypes with targeted patch recordings of labeled VIP+ (n = 6) and SOM+ (n = 30) cells in V1. Consistent with Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A. Huang Z.J. Stryker M.P. A cortical circuit for gain control by behavioral state.Cell. 2014; 156: 1139-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, VIP+ cells were robustly depolarized during running (4.6 ± 0.8 mV; p < 0.05 Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures 3B and 3C ). However, the behavior of SOM+ cells was more complex. We found that our SOM+ Cre driver line (SST-IRES-Cre; Taniguchi et al., 2011Taniguchi H. He M. Wu P. Kim S. Paik R. Sugino K. Kvitsiani D. Fu Y. Lu J. Lin Y. et al.A resource of Cre driver lines for genetic targeting of GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 995-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) labeled a population of neurons that could be grouped into two distinct classes, which we call Type I and Type II. Type I SOM+ cells, which were the majority (n = 21/30), exhibited the characteristic low Vm variability described by Petersen and colleagues (Gentet et al., 2012Gentet L.J. Kremer Y. Taniguchi H. Huang Z.J. Staiger J.F. Petersen C.C.H. Unique functional properties of somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons in mouse barrel cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and these cells were inhibited during active epochs of running and whisking (−2.1 ± 0.47 mV; p < 0.001 Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures 3A and 3C; Figure S5). A smaller population of Type II-labeled SOM+ cells (n = 7/30) had intrinsic membrane properties more similar to VIP+ or PV+ cells, and these cells were depolarized during active epochs (3.5 ± 0.9 mV; p < 0.01 Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure S5). In many cases, we recorded from both types of labeled SOM+ cells in the same animal, and they were completely separable by a number of features, the simplest being the range of voltages spanned by Vm during recordings of spontaneous activity (Figure S5). Both SOM+ Type I and Type II cells were distinct from morphologically identified (spiny) pyramidal cells, which were rarely labeled (n = 2/56), presumably due to leaky expression of Cre recombinase (Figure S5). Although the fact that the widely used SST-IRES-Cre line (Taniguchi et al., 2011Taniguchi H. He M. Wu P. Kim S. Paik R. Sugino K. Kvitsiani D. Fu Y. Lu J. Lin Y. et al.A resource of Cre driver lines for genetic targeting of GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 995-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) labels subpopulations of interneurons with different in vivo functional properties has not been previously reported, a recent in vitro study using these mice found two electrophysiologically distinct populations of labeled cells in almost the same proportions that we observed here (Hu et al., 2013Hu H. Cavendish J.Z. Agmon A. Not all that glitters is gold: off-target recombination in the somatostatin-IRES-Cre mouse line labels a subset of fast-spiking interneurons.Front Neural Circuits. 2013; 7: 195Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we excluded Type II SOM+ cells in subsequent analyses. Having confirmed the results of Fu et al. with respect to running, we wondered whether the SOM+/VIP+ cortical circuit might also participate in the state changes indexed by dilation and constriction during quiet wakefulness. Indeed, we found that VIP+ cells were relatively depolarized during dilation (2.1 ± 0.6 mV, p < 0.05) while SOM+ cells were hyperpolarized (−0.7 ± 0.3mV, p < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed-rank test for all comparisons; Figures 3D and 3E). Our results support the view that the SOM+/VIP+ circuit is not only recruited during active behavior, but may also play a role in cortical state changes during quiet wakefulness. To determine whether stimulus encoding in V1 is improved during the desynchronized state indexed by pupil dilation, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of populations of layer 2/3 cells loaded with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1AM while presenting drifting oriented gratings (example site, Figures 4A and 4B ; n = 34 imaging sites in six mice). We analyzed cells that were tuned for orientation (1,200/3,435 cells significantly tuned; see Experimental Procedures). During exploratory activity (running and whisking), there was a 20% increase in the mean response to preferred direction (p < 10−12) and a 19% increase in the mean response to orthogonal directions (p < 10−15; n = 516 tuned cells in 14 sites with sufficient numbers of visual responses during both active behavior and quiet wakefulness). These changes resulted in a slight decrease in orientation selectivity, but consistent with previous reports (Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, Polack et al., 2013Polack P.-O. Friedman J. Golshani P. Cellular mechanisms of brain state-dependent gain modulation in visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), this change was not significant (7% decrease in OSI, p = 0.07; Figure 4C, error bands are SEM across cells). During quiet wakefulness, with running, whisking, and saccades removed, dilation was associated with a 9% increase in the mean response to preferred direction (p < 10−13) and no change (0.6%, p = 0.47) in the response to the orthogonal direction, resulting in an enhancement of orientation selectivity (Figures 4D and 4E; 16% increase in OSI, p < 10−6). Note that there was no significant difference in the size of the pupil between dilating and constricting trials (Figure S6). During dilation, responses to drifting gratings were also more reliable (Figure 4F; 28% increase in mean variability explained by stimulus conditions, p < 10−15; n = 619 cells in 22 sites). Although there are a number of caveats that make it difficult to estimate the absolute magnitude of noise correlations using calcium imaging data (Cotton et al., 2013Cotton R.J. Froudarakis E. Storer P. Saggau P. Tolias A.S. Three-dimensional mapping of microcircuit correlation structure.Front Neural Circuits. 2013; 7: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we found that the relative magnitude of correlated activity varied significantly between the two states. There was a decrease in both signal and noise correlations during dilation versus constriction (Figures 4G and 4H; 20% decrease in mean noise correlations, p < 0.0001 and 16% decrease in mean signal correlations, p < 0.01; n = 21 sites, paired t test used for all comparisons; see Experimental Procedures). In summary, we found that responses to drifting gratings were more selective, more reliable, and less correlated during dilation compared to constriction. We next asked whether visual encoding of natural stimuli was also enhanced during desynchronized states indexed by pupil dilation. We presented multiple repetitions of short prerecorded movies from a head-mounted camera of a mouse navigating an enriched environment. We performed calcium imaging in V1 (n = 53 imaging sites in seven mice). In addition to excluding running and whisking periods, we also removed saccades and any epochs where the eye deviated by more than 10° from its mean position. Correlating neural activity directly with changes in pupil size was not possible in this experiment because differences in brightness across frames elicited reliable dilations and constrictions of the pupil across multiple repetitions of the movie (r = 0.61 correlation of pupil size across trials for one example recording session, Figure 5A). To account for the effects of frame-to-frame changes in luminance, we sorted the responses to each 150 ms segment of the movie by the rate of change of pupil diameter and compared the neural responses for the upper and lower quartiles of the rates of change within each time bin (Figure 5B). Here, we assumed that the average change in pupil size over multiple movie repetitions (gray trace in Figure 5B) was due to luminance changes in the stimulus, while the variability around this average (blue and red vertical lines in Figure 5B) reflected the trial-to-trial differences in cortical state. Thus, for each bin, we compared “high” trials, when the pupil was dilating faster than usual (or constricting slower than usual) to “low” trials, when the pupil was dilating slower (or constricting faster) than the average. Visual responses were enhanced during high trials compared to low trials (example cell in Figure 5C). Consistent with the increased OSI we observed for oriented gratings, responses to preferred frames of the movie were selectively enhanced during high trials compared to low trials (Figures 5D and 5E). Again, the pupil was not larger during high trials than low trials (Figure S6). At the population level, both signal (Figure 5F; p < 0.001) and noise (Figure 5G; p < 0.05) correlations were reduced, and there was an increase in the reliability (Figure 5H; p < 0.001) and discriminability (Figure 5I; p < 0.001) of responses during high trials compared to low trials (t test for all comparisons). In summary, consistent with the enhancement of responses to drifting gratings during dilation, responses to natural movies were more selective, more reliable, and less correlated during high trials. We performed whole-cell patching and two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice (Bennett et al., 2013Bennett C. Arroyo S. Hestrin S.

During these periods, we observed small spontaneous fluctuations in pupil diameter on a timescale of 1–2 s, which tracked changes in intracellular dynamics of L2/3 neurons in both somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) cortex. Vm was desynchronized while the pupil was dilating and was dominated by low-frequency oscillations while the pupil was constricting. Dilation was accompanied by activation of VIP+ and inhibition of SOM+ interneurons, a phenomenon that has been shown to be essential to the enhanced visual responses observed during running (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Tucciarone J.M. Espinosa J.S. Sheng N. Darcy D.P. Nicoll R.A. Huang Z.J. Stryker M.P.

Using two-photon calcium imaging, we found that dilation was associated with an enhancement of visual responses and a reduction in both noise and signal correlations across ensembles of neurons for both gratings and natural stimuli.

In plasma wakefield acceleration, a charge-density wake with high accelerating fields is driven by the passage of an ultra-relativistic bunch of charged particles (the drive bunch) through a plasma. If a second bunch of relativistic electrons (the trailing bunch) with sufficient charge follows in the wake of the drive bunch at an appropriate distance, it can be efficiently accelerated to high energy. Previous experiments using just a single 42-gigaelectronvolt drive bunch have accelerated electrons with a continuous energy spectrum and a maximum energy of up to 85 gigaelectronvolts from the tail of the same bunch in less than a metre of plasma. However, the total charge of these accelerated electrons was insufficient to extract a substantial amount of energy from the wake. Here we report high-efficiency acceleration of a discrete trailing bunch of electrons that contains sufficient charge to extract a substantial amount of energy from the high-gradient, nonlinear plasma wakefield accelerator. Specifically, we show the acceleration of about 74 picocoulombs of charge contained in the core of the trailing bunch in an accelerating gradient of about 4.4 gigavolts per metre. These core particles gain about 1.6 gigaelectronvolts of energy per particle, with a final energy spread as low as 0.7 per cent (2.0 per cent on average), and an energy-transfer efficiency from the wake to the bunch that can exceed 30 per cent (17.7 per cent on average). This acceleration of a distinct bunch of electrons containing a substantial charge and having a small energy spread with both a high accelerating gradient and a high energy-transfer efficiency represents a milestone in the development of plasma wakefield acceleration into a compact and affordable accelerator technology."

We employed hippocampal organotypic slice cultures from mice lacking key presynaptic proteins, cryofixation, and three-dimensional electron tomography to study the mechanism of synaptic vesicle docking in the same experimental setting, with high precision, and in a near-native state. We dissected previously indistinguishable, sequential steps in synaptic vesicle active zone recruitment (tethering) and membrane attachment (docking) and found that vesicle docking requires Munc13/CAPS family priming proteins and all three neuronal SNAREs, but not Synaptotagmin-1 or Complexins. Our data indicate that membrane-attached vesicles comprise the readily releasable pool of fusion-competent vesicles and that synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and trans-SNARE complex assembly are the respective morphological, functional, and molecular manifestations of the same process, which operates downstream of vesicle tethering by active zone components."

These results further emphasize the role of cytoskeletal defects in ALS and demonstrate the power of gene-based rare variant analyses in situations where causal genes cannot be identified through traditional segregation analysis. The identification of mutations for human disorders is critical for our understanding of their pathogenesis. Although numerous studies have successfully used exome sequencing to identify novel disease genes, this approach is still limited by the fact that each individual harbors many rare variants, thus requiring DNA from multiple affected individuals from an affected family to be successful. Unfortunately, for many diseases the collection of multiple affected samples from the same family can be difficult. This is especially true for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), a late-onset, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease. As such, there is a need to develop approaches to use individual affected cases to identify disease genes. Exome-wide rare variant analysis has been proposed as a promising alternative strategy (Panoutsopoulou et al., 2013Panoutsopoulou K. Tachmazidou I. Zeggini E. In search of low-frequency and rare variants affecting complex traits.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22: R16-R21Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, Stitziel et al., 2011Stitziel N.O. Kiezun A. Sunyaev S. Computational and statistical approaches to analyzing variants identified by exome sequencing.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: 227Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By this approach, the total number of gene variants seen in cases is compared to that in controls. Threshold minor allele frequency and possibly functional significance filters are implemented to prevent statistical noise from common or neutral variants masking true gene associations. Importantly, although an abundance of variants in cases suggests the presence of pathogenic mutations, an associated variant set will still likely include neutral variants in both cases and controls. Since it does not rely on related samples, we decided to use this approach to identify novel causative genes for FALS. We performed exome sequencing on a discovery cohort of 363 index cases (i.e., one affected sample per family) from six countries (Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online) devoid of mutations/repeat expansions in known ALS genes (SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, FUS, PFN1, UBQLN2, OPTN, VCP, and ANG). An average of 3.2 × 109 target bases was sequenced per sample to an average depth of 90.4×. Control exome data included 4,300 European Americans available through the NHLBI’s Exome Variant Server (EVS) (Tennessen et al., 2012Tennessen J.A. Bigham A.W. O’Connor T.D. Fu W. Kenny E.E. Gravel S. McGee S. Do R. Liu X. Jun G. et al.Broad GOSeattle GONHLBI Exome Sequencing ProjectEvolution and functional impact of rare coding variation from deep sequencing of human exomes.Science. 2012; 337: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) and 31 internally sequenced samples. As proof of principle, we spiked our sample set with nine FALS exomes with known causative mutations (six in SOD1 and three in VCP). The analysis was restricted to the 12,487 genes fulfilling all quality control filters and to variants either predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 or resulting in a stop gain/loss. Variants were also only considered if they exhibited minor allele frequencies less than 0.04%, in keeping with previously reported ALS mutations (Chiò et al., 2012Chiò A. Calvo A. Mazzini L. Cantello R. Mora G. Moglia C. Corrado L. D’Alfonso S. Majounie E.

Delineating the genetic heterogeneity of ALS using targeted high-throughput sequencing.J. Med. Genet. 2013; 50: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The significance of disease associations following multiple test correction (Pcorrected) was calculated using permutation procedures (Kiezun et al., 2012Kiezun A. Garimella K. Do R. Stitziel N.O. Neale B.M. McLaren P.J. Gupta N. Sklar P. Sullivan P.F. Moran J.L. et al.Exome sequencing and the genetic basis of complex traits.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Strong signals of disease association were observed for SOD1 (6 cases [1.6%] versus 0 controls, p = 5.5 × 10−8, Pcorrected = 6.2 × 10−4) and VCP (3 cases [0.8%] versus 0 controls, p = 1.1 × 10−4, Pcorrected = 0.73) (Figure 1A and Figure S1). Excluding SOD1, the top hit from our analysis was TUBA4A, encoding the Tubulin, Alpha 4A protein (4 cases [1.1%] versus 0 controls, p = 9.1 × 10−6, Pcorrected = 0.09). Similar significance for TUBA4A was also obtained when using alternative bioinformatic tools to identify putatively damaging variants (SIFT, GERP, MutationTaster, and phyloP). TUBA4A ranked first or second in all tests (Table S1 and Figure S1), while no other gene ranked in the top ten hits for all five tests. Besides TUBA4A, our strategy revealed other strong candidate genes for FALS (Figure 1A; Table S1), including MATR3, responsible for distal myopathy 2 and recently identified as causative for FALS (Johnson et al., 2014Johnson J.O. Pioro E.P. Boehringer A. Chia R. Feit H. Renton A.E. Pliner H.A. Abramzon Y. Marangi G. Winborn B.J. et al.ITALSGEN ConsortiumMutations in the Matrin 3 gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we further investigated TUBA4A as a candidate gene associated with FALS. Exome sequencing revealed a total of five nonsynonymous TUBA4A changes, all localized in exon 4 and confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Table S2). None of them were observed in the 4,300 EVS controls and all occurred at highly conserved positions (Figure 1B). The mutations included two missense changes in the same residue (R320C/H) and a nonsense mutation (W407X) removing the last 41 amino acids. This C-terminal region contacts the β-tubulin subunit as well as the motor domain of kinesins and other microtubule-associated proteins (Howes et al., 2014Howes S.C. Alushin G.M. Shida T.

Cell. 2012; 47: 707-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Additional missense changes included R215C and A383T mutations. PolyPhen-2 predicted four of the five mutations to be deleterious (Table S2). In contrast, only three nonsynonymous changes were observed in the 4,300 EVS controls (V68A, I276V, and V375M), all predicted to be benign. No relatives of the affected patients were available to test segregation. To further evaluate TUBA4A as a causative ALS gene, we sequenced an independent replication cohort comprising a further 272 index FALS cases and 5,510 internal European American controls for rare damaging exon 4 variants. Reimplementation of the variant filtering strategies employed during the discovery analysis and subsequent testing using Fisher’s exact method revealed a significant excess of mutation carriers among patients (2 cases [0.65%] versus 2 controls [0.04%], p = 1.5 × 10−2). A combined analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts resulted in a statistically significant overabundance of rare variants after multiple test correction (OR = 36 [95% CI: 10–210], p = 4.3 × 10−7, Pcorrected = 4.2 × 10−3). Of the two mutations observed in the replication cohort, a T145P variant segregated with disease within the family, while a K430N variant was not detected in an affected first cousin of the sequenced proband (Figure S1C), suggesting that this is either a neutral polymorphism, as is often observed in rare variant analyses, or the two affected family members are phenocopies. Variants identified in controls included E386K and G365E substitutions but none of the variants detected in FALS patients from either the discovery or replication cohorts. Sequencing of the entire coding region in 1,355 sporadic ALS (SALS) cases also identified a G43V mutation in a single sample (Table S2). This variant was predicted to be benign by PolyPhen-2 and detected within 1 control from the internal replication panel. No TUBA4A mutations were identified in 131 ALS samples (89 FALS and 42 SALS) with known mutations/repeat expansions. All patients carrying TUBA4A mutations had spinal-onset, classical ALS, with upper and lower motor neuron signs. Two cases also developed a cognitive decline of frontal type, consistent with a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and another had a first-degree relative with FTD (Figure S1 and Table S3). Screening of 1,053 samples analyzed by the 1000 Genome project and 2,200 African Americans from the EVS revealed the A383T mutation within a single individual of African ancestry. Therefore, with the exception of A383T and G43V, the set of observed patient variants were not detected within a total of 13,023 control samples (Table S4). Since several causative ALS proteins form insoluble inclusions in postmortem brain tissues and in cell culture, we investigated the ability of TUBA4A mutants to aggregate by expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TUBA4A constructs in primary motor neurons (PMNs) and HEK293 cells. Interestingly, the W407X mutant did not incorporate into the microtubule network and formed small ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions in ∼40% of transfected PMNs and ∼85% of transfected HEK293 cells (Figures 2A and 2B ; Figure S2). Immunohistochemistry of brain and spinal cord tissue from SALS cases (without mutations) yielded a clear staining of the perikarya and neuropil region in both the spinal cord and motor cortex; however, no TUBA4A aggregates were identified (Figure S2). No coaggregation was observed in cells coexpressing an aggregation-prone TDP-43 C-terminal fragment and wild-type TUBA4A (Figure S2). While the other TUBA4A mutants formed cytoplasmic inclusions in 10%–30% of transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown), no aggregation was observed in PMNs. However, subtle alterations in their cytoplasmic distribution were observed, such as a more diffuse staining compared to the wild-type protein, which was mainly incorporated into the microtubule network (Figure 2A). We thus investigated the ability of mutant TUBA4A to efficiently form microtubules using a cell-free system to quantify its incorporation into α-/β-tubulin dimers (Cleveland et al., 1978Cleveland D.W.

Genet. 2010; 19: 3599-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each mutant was subjected to in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate that contains all components needed to form tubulin dimers. The products were then analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis to measure incorporation of the translated recombinant protein into tubulin dimers. Interestingly, TUBA4AW407X yielded no discernible dimers, while the A383T and both R320 mutants displayed significantly lower levels of assembly relative to the wild-type protein (Figures 2C and 2D). The other mutants did not differ from the control, save for a small but reproducible migration difference for TUBA4AR215C. In parallel, we tested the incorporation of mutant TUBA4A into microtubules in cultured cells. We chose primary astroglial cells, as they have a large cytoplasm and a relatively long cell cycle that result in an extensive and stable microtubule network. We performed an unbiased analysis of the cytoskeletal incorporation of HA-tagged TUBA4A constructs. The ratio between the fluorescence intensities of the filamentous versus overall staining, ranging from 1 to 0, was used to categorize each cell as normal (1–0.75), mild (0.75–0.5), moderate (0.5–0.25), or severe (0.25–0) (Figures 2E and 2F and Figure S3). The wild-type HA-tagged TUBA4A protein yielded nearly 70% of cells displaying a high level of microtubule incorporation. In contrast, several mutants displayed an altered incorporation into microtubules. In particular, the W407X yielded the most dramatic effect with an absence of tagged protein in the microtubule network and the presence of multiple aggregate-like inclusions. The R320C/H, A383T, and R215C mutants all displayed a significantly different distribution relative to the wild-type, but no differences were detected for the G43V protein. We next determined whether TUBA4A mutants affected microtubule dynamics by testing the ability of transfected COS7 cells to recover after transient microtubule depolymerization (Figure 3) (Gilissen et al., 2011Gilissen C.

Genet. 2010; 19: 3599-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For this assay, the wild-type, R320C, and W407X proteins were compared, as these mutants displayed an intermediate and severe phenotype, respectively, in the previous experiments. While ∼80% of cells transfected with TUBA4AWT formed centrosomes positive for the HA-tagged TUBA4A protein within 5 min of nocodazole removal, only ∼20% of TUBA4AR320C-transfected cells formed new microtubules containing the mutant protein at 15 min. The expression of mutant TUBA4A also impaired the ability of the endogenous protein to form microtubules, as only 50% of the cells contained TUBA4A-positive microtubules after 15 min, compared to ∼90% in wild-type-transfected cells (Figures 3A and 3B). Similar results were also observed in cells containing TUBA4AW407X-positive aggregates. On the contrary, cells expressing the TUBA4AW407X mutant without the presence of aggregates did not display any defect in the rate of microtubule repolymerization (Figures 3C and 3D). These results suggest that mutant TUBA4A by incorporating into the microtubules may disrupt their dynamics through a dominant-negative mechanism. To pursue this hypothesis, we investigated whether TUBA4A mutants would influence the overall stability of the microtubule network. PMNs expressing wild-type and mutant TUBA4A constructs were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 to extract soluble proteins before fixation and immunostained for HA-TUBA4A and β-tubulin. Under these conditions, the cytoskeleton was largely preserved in wild-type-transfected neurons, whereas each of the missense mutants resulted in decreased HA-TUBA4A and β-tubulin immunofluorescence (Figures 4A–4C). Furthermore, the levels of α-tubulin acetylation, which have been shown to correlate with increased microtubule stability (Matsuyama et al., 2002Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y. Seigneurin-Berny D. Osada H. Komatsu Y. Nishino N.

Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), were significantly reduced in mutant TUBA4A-expressing PMNs (Figures 4D and 4E). Of note, the G43V mutation, which is uniquely localized to the protein N terminus, did not impair tubulin acetylation, suggesting that defective binding of the acetyl-transferase αTAT1 to α-tubulin C-terminal tail (Howes et al., 2014Howes S.C.

Sunyaev S. Computational and statistical approaches to analyzing variants identified by exome sequencing.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: 227Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), where TUBA4A mutations are clustered, may be responsible for this effect. Together, these results further suggest that missense mutants of TUBA4A weaken the microtubule network by a dominant-negative mechanism. To summarize, we have used an unbiased case-control exome-sequencing study to identify a statistically significant and replicable excess of rare damaging TUBA4A variants in FALS. Disease-associated variants affect conserved residues and in most cases are absent in over 13,000 controls. The positive identification of samples with mutations in the SOD1 and VCP genes, as well as in the newly discovered ALS gene MATR3 within the initial cohort, further proves the validity of our approach. Though our burden approach demonstrated the importance of a specific class of TUBA4A variants, a limitation is that it is not informative as to the effects of individual variants. Thus, not all reported patient mutations may be pathogenically relevant or act with equal penetrance. An example of this is the K430N alteration not segregating in an affected first cousin. However, our results from biological characterization provided strong evidence to support a deleterious effect of most variants. Specifically, FALS-associated variants (1) inefficiently form α-/β- tubulin dimers in vitro,(2) display decreased incorporation into microtubules in cultured cells, and (3) inhibit microtubule network assembly and reduce structural stability. Based on these data, TUBA4A mutants appear to disrupt microtubule dynamics and stability through a dominant-negative mechanism. Interestingly, the truncation mutant TUBA4AW407X is deficient in forming dimers or incorporating into the microtubule network, suggesting that it may have a decreased ability to act as a dominant negative. This is illustrated by our observation that in cells expressing the W407X mutant without aggregates, there is no obvious defect in the rate of microtubule repolymerization. However, since TUBA4AW407X shows aggregation propensities analogous to other ALS-associated mutant proteins, its deleterious effect may be through a different mechanism, such as trapping tubulin-binding proteins into aggregates or by overburdening the ubiquitin proteasome system.

Moreover, the progressive motor neuronopathy (pmn) mutant mouse, a commonly used model for human motor neuron disease, bears a mutation in the Tubulin-specific Chaperone E (TBCE) gene (Bömmel et al., 2002Bömmel H.

Most mutant tubulin proteins show similar functional defects compared to TUBA4A mutants, such as impaired dimerization and microtubule incorporation and yet cause very different phenotypes. Interestingly, results from the BrainSpan Atlas and in developing mouse brain tissue show that most α- and β-tubulin subunits responsible for developmental defects are highly expressed during brain development and decrease with age, whereas TUBA4A levels increase dramatically (>50-fold) with age (Figure S4). Furthermore, similar to TUBA4A, expression of TUBB4A also increases over time and mutations in this gene are responsible for a disease with an onset age of 15–37 years (torsion dystonia type 4) (Hersheson et al., 2013Hersheson J.

Neurol. 2013; 73: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These observations may partially explain the difference between the neurodevelopmental and late-onset symptoms associated to the different tubulin mutations. TUBA4A is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues with its highest expression in brain (Rustici et al., 2013Rustici G. Kolesnikov N. Brandizi M. Burdett T. Dylag M. Emam I. Farne A. Hastings E.

Although a downregulation of α-tubulin subunit genes has been reported in motor neurons of SALS patients (Jiang et al., 2005Jiang Y.-M. Yamamoto M. Kobayashi Y. Yoshihara T. Liang Y. Terao S.

TUBA4A joins other ALS-associated genes encoding for cytoskeletal proteins, such as PFN1 (Wu et al., 2012Wu C.-H. Fallini C. Ticozzi N. Keagle P.J. Sapp P.C. Piotrowska K. Lowe P. Koppers M.

Ethical approval for this study was received by the IRBs of the participating institutions. Exome sequencing reads were aligned to a human reference (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and processed using the Genome Analysis ToolKit. Rare variant analyses were performed by logistic regression of case-control status with respect to the aggregated count of minor alleles in a given gene window. For each p value from the observed data set analysis, Pcorrected was calculated as the proportion of permuted data sets where an association of equal or greater significance was observed across any gene. PMNs were cultured from embryonic day 12.5 embryos and transfected at 2 days in vitro, as previously described (Fallini et al., 2010Fallini C. Bassell G.J. Rossoll W.

Using ImageJ, a region of interest (ROI) was selected for each HA-TUBA4A-positive cell and the signal was thresholded to remove background noise. A circularity filter (circularity index ≥ 0.2) was then applied to remove granular staining. The ratio between the fluorescence intensities of the filtered cytoskeleton versus the thresholded ROI yielded an incorporation index ranging from 0 (no incorporation) to 1 (complete microtubule incorporation).

https://openalex.org/W2048432879,"The promise of using reprogrammed human neurons for disease modeling and regenerative medicine relies on the ability to induce patient-derived neurons with high efficiency and subtype specificity. We have previously shown that ectopic expression of brain-enriched microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-9/9* and miR-124 (miR-9/9*-124), promoted direct conversion of human fibroblasts into neurons. Here we show that coexpression of miR-9/9*-124 with transcription factors enriched in the developing striatum, BCL11B (also known as CTIP2), DLX1, DLX2, and MYT1L, can guide the conversion of human postnatal and adult fibroblasts into an enriched population of neurons analogous to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). When transplanted in the mouse brain, the reprogrammed human cells persisted in situ for over 6 months, exhibited membrane properties equivalent to native MSNs, and extended projections to the anatomical targets of MSNs. These findings highlight the potential of exploiting the synergism between miR-9/9*-124 and transcription factors to generate specific neuronal subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2016507586,"Introduction Several studies reported the negative impact of elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on outcomes in many surgical and medical conditions. Previous studies used arbitrary NLR cut-off points according to the average of the populations under study. There is no data on the average NLR in the general population. The aim of this study is to explore the average values of NLR and according to race in adult non-institutional United States individuals by using national data. Methods The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of aggregated cross-sectional data collected from 2007 to 2010 was analyzed; data extracted included markers of systemic inflammation (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and NLR), demographic variables and other comorbidities. Subjects who were prescribed steroids, chemotherapy, immunomodulators and antibiotics were excluded. Adjusted linear regression models were used to examine the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts, and NLR. Results Overall 9427 subjects are included in this study. The average value of neutrophils is 4.3k cells/mL, of lymphocytes 2.1k cells/mL; the average NLR is 2.15. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants have significantly lower mean NLR values (1.76, 95% CI 1.71–1.81 and 2.08, 95% CI 2.04–2.12 respectively) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (2.24, 95% CI 2.19–2.28–p<0.0001). Subjects who reported diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and smoking had significantly higher NLR than subjects who did not. Racial differences regarding the association of smoking and BMI with NLR were observed. Conclusions This study is providing preliminary data on racial disparities in a marker of inflammation, NLR, that has been associated with several chronic diseases outcome, suggesting that different cut-off points should be set according to race. It also suggests that racial differences exist in the inflammatory response to environmental and behavioral risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2063459859,"Virtual reality (VR) enables precise control of an animal's environment and otherwise impossible experimental manipulations. Neural activity in rodents has been studied on virtual 1D tracks. However, 2D navigation imposes additional requirements, such as the processing of head direction and environment boundaries, and it is unknown whether the neural circuits underlying 2D representations can be sufficiently engaged in VR. We implemented a VR setup for rats, including software and large-scale electrophysiology, that supports 2D navigation by allowing rotation and walking in any direction. The entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, including place, head direction, and grid cells, showed 2D activity patterns similar to those in the real world. Furthermore, border cells were observed, and hippocampal remapping was driven by environment shape, suggesting functional processing of virtual boundaries. These results illustrate that 2D spatial representations can be engaged by visual and rotational vestibular stimuli alone and suggest a novel VR tool for studying rat navigation."

https://openalex.org/W2028281706,"Recent evidence implicates glutamatergic synapses as key pathogenic sites in psychiatric disorders. Common and rare variants in the ANK3 gene, encoding ankyrin-G, have been associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Here we demonstrate that ankyrin-G is integral to AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and maintenance of spine morphology. Using superresolution microscopy we find that ankyrin-G forms distinct nanodomain structures within the spine head and neck. At these sites, it modulates mushroom spine structure and function, probably as a perisynaptic scaffold and barrier within the spine neck. Neuronal activity promotes ankyrin-G accumulation in distinct spine subdomains, where it differentially regulates NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity. These data implicate subsynaptic nanodomains containing a major psychiatric risk molecule, ankyrin-G, as having location-specific functions and open directions for basic and translational investigation of psychiatric risk molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1981052127,"Policies have been in place since 1987 to reduce the release of chlorine atoms in the stratosphere, where they deplete ozone; here observations show that since 2007 hydrogen chloride has been increasing in the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, an increase that is attributed to a slowdown in atmospheric circulation. The Montreal Protocol, the 1987 UN treaty that restricted the use of the major chlorine- and bromine-containing halocarbons that were damaging the stratospheric ozone layer, has led to a decrease in the main stratospheric chlorine reservoir, hydrogen chloride. This paper reports a recent increase in hydrogen chloride in the Northern Hemisphere. With the help of a model study, the authors attribute the phenomenon to a short-term slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that transports aged air, with a larger relative conversion of chlorine source gases to hydrogen chloride in the lower stratosphere. The increase in hydrogen chloride is not the result of unaccounted emissions from chlorine-containing source gases and the Montreal treaty continues to lead to an overall long-term reduction in stratospheric halogens. The abundance of chlorine in the Earth’s atmosphere increased considerably during the 1970s to 1990s, following large emissions of anthropogenic long-lived chlorine-containing source gases, notably the chlorofluorocarbons. The chemical inertness of chlorofluorocarbons allows their transport and mixing throughout the troposphere on a global scale1, before they reach the stratosphere where they release chlorine atoms that cause ozone depletion2. The large ozone loss over Antarctica3 was the key observation that stimulated the definition and signing in 1987 of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty establishing a schedule to reduce the production of the major chlorine- and bromine-containing halocarbons. Owing to its implementation, the near-surface total chlorine concentration showed a maximum in 1993, followed by a decrease of half a per cent to one per cent per year4, in line with expectations. Remote-sensing data have revealed a peak in stratospheric chlorine after 19965, then a decrease of close to one per cent per year6,7, in agreement with the surface observations of the chlorine source gases and model calculations7. Here we present ground-based and satellite data that show a recent and significant increase, at the 2σ level, in hydrogen chloride (HCl), the main stratospheric chlorine reservoir, starting around 2007 in the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, in contrast with the ongoing monotonic decrease of near-surface source gases. Using model simulations, we attribute this trend anomaly to a slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, occurring over several consecutive years, transporting more aged air to the lower stratosphere, and characterized by a larger relative conversion of source gases to HCl. This short-term dynamical variability will also affect other stratospheric tracers and needs to be accounted for when studying the evolution of the stratospheric ozone layer."

The development of complex tissues depends on a balance of intercellular adhesive and repulsive signaling. Cell adhesion provides spatial stability to nonmoving cells and traction for migrating cells (Solecki, 2012Solecki D.J. Sticky situations: recent advances in control of cell adhesion during neuronal migration.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

The homophilic and Unc5 interactions both involve the FLRT N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR) (Karaulanov et al., 2006Karaulanov E.E. Böttcher R.T. Niehrs C.

Unc5B interacts with FLRT3 and Rnd1 to modulate cell adhesion in Xenopus embryos.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This domain is followed by a linker region, a type 3 fibronectin domain (FN) and a juxtamembrane linker, which contains a metalloprotease cleavage site (Figure 1A). Proteolytic shedding of the FLRT2 ectodomain controls the migration of Unc5D-expressing neurons in the developing cortex (Yamagishi et al., 2011Yamagishi S. Hampel F. Hata K. Del Toro D. Schwark M. Kvachnina E. Bastmeyer M. Yamashita T. Tarabykin V. Klein R. Egea J. FLRT2 and FLRT3 act as repulsive guidance cues for Unc5-positive neurons.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2920-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Like FLRTs, Unc5 receptors (Unc5A–D) are type 1 transmembrane proteins. The extracellular region contains two immunoglobulin-type domains (Ig1 and Ig2) and two thrombospondin-like domains (TSP1 and TSP2) (Figure 1A). Unc5 receptors act as classical dependence and repulsive signaling receptors for secreted Netrin ligands in the neural system (Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011Lai Wing Sun K. Correia J.P. Kennedy T.E. Netrins: versatile extracellular cues with diverse functions.Development. 2011; 138: 2153-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Netrin/Unc5B signaling also directs vascular development by controlling blood vessel sprouting (Larrivée et al., 2007Larrivée B. Freitas C. Trombe M. Lv X. Delafarge B. Yuan L. Bouvrée K. Bréant C. Del Toro R. Bréchot N. et al.Activation of the UNC5B receptor by Netrin-1 inhibits sprouting angiogenesis.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2433-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, Netrin is not present in many Unc5-expressing tissues, for example, in the developing cortex, suggesting a dependence on other ligands. The dual functionality of FLRTs as CAMs that also elicit repulsion (as one of several possible Unc5 ligands) renders the analysis of their contributions in vivo challenging. Can cells integrate FLRT adhesive and repulsive signaling activities, and what are the contributions of these contradictory functionalities in different cellular contexts? To address the complexities of FLRT function we first sought to identify the structural determinants of the homophilic and heterophilic interactions. Here we report crystal structures of FLRT2, FLRT3, Unc5A, Unc5D, and a FLRT2-Unc5D complex. Based on these data we assign homophilic adhesion and heterophilic repulsion to distinct molecular surfaces of FLRT. We show that by using these surfaces, FLRT can trigger both adhesive and repulsive signals in the same receiving cell, leading to an integrative response. Besides confirming that FLRT2/Unc5D repulsion regulates the radial migration of cortical neurons, we show here that FLRT3 also acts as a CAM in cortical development and modulates the tangential spread of pyramidal neurons. We further identify FLRT3 as a controlling factor in retinal vascularization. We demonstrate that FLRT controls the migration of human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAECs) through a similar mechanism to that which we found in the neuronal system. Taken together, our results reveal FLRT functions in cortical patterning and vascular development, and establish the FLRTs as a bimodal guidance system that combines homophilic adhesion with heterophilic repulsion. We performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements using purified ectodomains of Unc5A, Unc5B, and Unc5D (Unc5Aecto, Unc5Becto, Unc5Decto) and the LRR domains of their ligands FLRT2 and FLRT3 (FLRT2LRR, FLRT3LRR). These revealed a hierarchy of equilibrium dissociation constants (Kds), with the affinity of FLRT2 and Unc5D being the highest (Figure 1B; Table S1 available online). The relative affinities are consistent with those from previous cell-based binding assays (Karaulanov et al., 2009Karaulanov E. Böttcher R.T. Stannek P. Wu W. Rau M. Ogata S. Cho K.W.Y. Niehrs C.

FLRT2 and FLRT3 act as repulsive guidance cues for Unc5-positive neurons.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2920-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), although the absolute values are lower, presumably due to differences in the techniques applied. We also used SPR to test the binding of FLRT2LRR to Unc5D fragments encompassing different regions of the ectodomain (Unc5Decto, Unc5DIg12, Unc5DIg1, Unc5DIg2, and Unc5DT12; depicted in Figure 1A). The results showed that the N-terminal Unc5D Ig domain (Unc5DIg1) harbors the major FLRT2LRR-binding site (Figure 1C). We determined the crystal structures of mouse FLRT2LRR and FLRT3LRR. Crystallographic details are provided in Table S2. Both structures consist of ten lrr repeats plus flanking cap structures, together forming a horseshoe-shaped solenoid (Figures 1D–1F, S1A, and S1B). Superposition underscores the similarity of the two structures with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar) of 1.17 Å for 320 (out of 321) corresponding Cα atoms. We generated sequence conservation scores (Glaser et al., 2003Glaser F. Pupko T. Paz I. Bell R.E. Bechor-Shental D. Martz E. Ben-Tal N. ConSurf: identification of functional regions in proteins by surface-mapping of phylogenetic information.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) using alignments of FLRT2 and FLRT3 from mouse, chicken, frog, and fish and mapped these onto the FLRTLRR structures. A sequence-conserved patch extends from the concave to a lateral side surface of both FLRTLRR structures (Figures 1G and S1B). Comparison of FLRT2LRR with structures in the Dali database (Holm and Rosenström, 2010Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar) shows strongest similarity (rmsd for 264 aligned Cα atoms = 1.8) with the cell adhesion protein decorin, which is known to dimerize via the concave surface of its LRR domain (Scott et al., 2004Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Crystal structure of the dimeric protein core of decorin, the archetypal small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The predominantly charged concave surfaces of FLRT2LRR and FLRT3LRR (Figures 1H and S1B) provide lattice contacts in all of our crystal structures (Figure S1), suggesting that these regions could mediate functional FLRT-FLRT interactions. We determined the crystal structure of rat Unc5DIg1 (Table S2). The domain conforms to the Ig subtype 1 topology (Chothia and Jones, 1997Chothia C. Jones E.Y. The molecular structure of cell adhesion molecules.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 823-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). The structure is most similar to that of the N-terminal Ig domain of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (RPTPδ, rmsd for 86 aligned Cα atoms = 1.9 Å), although Unc5D lacks the positively charged surface patch that mediates the RPTPδ-glycosaminoglycan interaction (Coles et al., 2011Coles C.H. Shen Y. Tenney A.P. Siebold C. Sutton G.C. Lu W. Gallagher J.T. Jones E.Y. Flanagan J.G. Aricescu A.R. Proteoglycan-specific molecular switch for RPTPσ clustering and neuronal extension.Science. 2011; 332: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We also solved a crystal structure for Unc5AIg12T2 (Table S2), thereby revealing the fold of the second Ig domain, also subtype 1, and the TSP domain (Figure 2B). The crystallized construct corresponds to the complete human Unc5A isoform 1 ectodomain. The overall structure is elongated and lacks extended interdomain linkers. All human Unc5A isoforms and mouse Unc5A isoform 2 lack the first of the two TSP domains that are present in other Unc5 homologs. Otherwise, the sequences of Unc5A–D are 44%–63% conserved between the human Unc5 homologs. We solved the crystal structure of FLRT2LRR in complex with Unc5DIg1 (Table S2). Crystals diffracted to 4 Å only; however, the higher-resolution models of unliganded FLRT2LRR and Unc5DIg1 provide detailed information on the location of residues within each chain. Unc5Ig1 binds to FLRT2LRR burying a total of ∼1,280 Å2 protein surface, which is highly sequence conserved on both sides (Figures 2C and 2D). Superposition of Unc5AIg12T with Unc5DIg1 as found in complex with FLRT2LRR generates a model in which the domains downstream of Unc5 Ig1 extend away from the interface with FLRTLRR, suggesting that the Ig1 domain is the only interacting domain (Figure 2E). Based on this model alone, we cannot rule out that the extracellular FLRT regions downstream of the LRR domain also interact with Unc5. However, in SPR experiments we measured similar Unc5-binding affinities for FLRTecto and FLRTLRR constructs (data not shown), suggesting that there is no major second Unc5-binding site on FLRT. We provide further support for this conclusion using a mutagenesis approach (see next section). The core of the FLRT2-Unc5D-binding interface contains predominantly hydrophobic and positively charged residues (Figures 2F and 2G). The conserved FLRT2 histidine H170 forms a central anchor point that reaches deep into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Unc5D F82, K84, W89, V135, W137, and K144 and likely provides a hydrogen bond to Unc5D W137 (Figure 2G). FLRT2 R191 and L215 may stabilize this arrangement by providing additional contacts to Unc5D F82 and W137. The main residues forming the hydrophobic FLRT2-binding surface of Unc5D are fully conserved in Unc5B (Figure 2H), with the exception of F82, which is replaced by a tyrosine (Y78). The high degree of sequence conservation at the FLRT-Unc5-binding interface is in agreement with the observed binding promiscuity. Subtle differences in binding affinities for different homologs are likely due to sequence variations at the periphery of the binding interface (Figure 2I). Histidine residues have a side chain pKa(His) of ∼6, below which they are protonated. We predicted that the protonated FLRT2 H170 would be incompatible with binding to the hydrophobic binding pocket on Unc5D. Indeed, at pH ∼5.7, Unc5Decto does not interact with FLRT2ecto (Figure S2A). Based on the crystal structures, we designed mutations in the FLRT2-Unc5D interface to disrupt binding. In FLRT2 H170E and H170N, we replaced the central histidine with a negative-charged residue or an N-linked glycosylation site, respectively. Neither of these mutants binds Unc5D in our assays, confirming the binding site we describe is essential for the interaction (Figure 3A). Also, the Unc5D mutants E88A+W89A+H91A and W89N+H91T show poor binding to FLRT2 (Figure 3A). Binding was unaffected by FLRT2 and Unc5D mutations at sites involved in minor interactions in the crystal (FLRT2 D248N+P250T, Unc5D L101N+E103T), suggesting that these sites are not physiologically relevant (Figure 3A). For subsequent functional analysis we chose the non-Unc5-binding FLRT2 mutant H170N and the non-FLRT2-binding Unc5D mutant W89N+H91T. We henceforth refer to these Unc5-FLRT noninteracting mutants as FLRT2UF and Unc5DUF, respectively. We confirmed our SPR results using a cell-based assay, in which we visualized the binding of soluble FC-tagged ectodomain proteins to mVenus-tagged receptors expressed on the surface of COS7 (Figure S2B). The high degree of conservation in the Unc5-FLRT-binding sites allowed us to design binding-impaired mutants also for FLRT3 and Unc5B. We selected FLRT2UF and Unc5DUF as templates to design FLRT3 H165N (FLRT3UF) and Unc5B W85N+S87T (Unc5BUF) (Figure 3B). Additionally, we produced Unc5C W99N+H101T (Unc5CUF), to test whether our mutants are valid also beyond the functionally well-characterized ligand/receptor pairs FLRT2-Unc5D and FLRT3-Unc5B. We showed that wild-type Unc5C, but not the UF mutant, is able to bind FLRT (Figure S2B). We confirmed that wild-type and mutant FLRT and Unc5 constructs are expressed at the cell surface (Figure S2C). Previous studies showed that FLRT-FLRT binding between cells is mediated via the LRR domain (Karaulanov et al., 2006Karaulanov E.E. Böttcher R.T. Niehrs C. A role for fibronectin-leucine-rich transmembrane cell-surface proteins in homotypic cell adhesion.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect FLRTLRR-FLRTLRR binding using purified proteins in SPR experiments, possibly due to the low-affinity nature of the interaction. However, using size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), we could show that both FLRT3ecto and FLRT3LRR oligomerize in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 3C and S2D). An increased population of FLRT dimers or oligomers at higher concentrations is detected as an apparent increase in molecular mass. We found that the calculated mass of FLRT3ecto and FLRT3LRR correlates with the protein concentration across the elution peak; the resulting “upside-down smiley” mass profile is typical for proteins undergoing concentration-dependent oligomerization. Our crystal structures revealed that FLRTLRR-FLRTLRR lattice contacts depend on the concave surface of the proteins, a region that mediates homophilic dimerization in other LRR proteins (Kajander et al., 2011Kajander T. Kuja-Panula J. Rauvala H. Goldman A. Crystal structure and role of glycans and dimerization in folding of neuronal leucine-rich repeat protein AMIGO-1.J. Mol.

To probe this region, we produced the FLRT3 mutant R181N+D183T, which contains an N-linked glycosylation site in the concave surface. In contrast to wild-type FLRT3ecto, the mutant does not undergo concentration-dependent oligomerization; i.e., the apparent mass does not increase in correlation with the protein concentration. These data show that the homophilic interaction depends on the concave surface of the FLRT3 LRR domain (Figure 3C). We henceforth call this FLRT-FLRT noninteracting mutation FLRTFF, and the mutant ectodomain FLRT3ectoFF. In contrast to FLRT3ectoFF, the non-Unc5-binding mutant FLRT3ectoUF still oligomerizes in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure S2D). We and others have shown that the expression of transmembrane FLRT in suspended HEK cells leads to the formation of separate cell aggregates (Egea et al., 2008Egea J. Erlacher C. Montanez E. Burtscher I. Yamagishi S. Hess M. Hampel F. Sanchez R. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T.

Böttcher R.T. Niehrs C. A role for fibronectin-leucine-rich transmembrane cell-surface proteins in homotypic cell adhesion.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we revealed that mutations in the concave surface of the FLRT3 LRR domain (FLRT3FF), which disrupt FLRT3-FLRT3 ectodomain oligomerization in solution, also disrupt full-length FLRT3-based cell adhesion (Figure 3D). In contrast, FLRT3 with mutations in the convex surface of the LRR domain (S192N+P193G) and the Unc5-binding mutant FLRT3UF were still able to mediate cell adhesion (Figure 3E; data not shown). Based on our FLRT3 results, we designed an equivalent FLRT2FF mutant (R186N+D188T). The expression of FLRT2 and FLRT2UF, but not FLRT2FF, induced cell aggregation (Figures S2E and S2F). Thus, the FLRT-FLRT interaction surface we identified is conserved between the two homologs. We observed a small decrease in aggregation between cells expressing the UF mutants compared to wild-type FLRTs; however, the difference is not statistically significant. Western blot analysis confirmed similar expression levels of wild-type and mutant (Figure S2G). Finally, we demonstrated that FLRT3FF and FLRT2FF bind Unc5 ectodomains (Figures 3B and S2B). We conclude that FLRT-FLRT and FLRT-Unc5 interactions are mediated via distinct FLRT surfaces and can be controlled using specific mutations (Figure 3F). We previously showed that shed ectodomains of FLRTs act as repulsive guidance cues and cause axonal growth cone collapse of cortical neurons (Yamagishi et al., 2011Yamagishi S. Hampel F. Hata K. Del Toro D. Schwark M. Kvachnina E. Bastmeyer M. Yamashita T. Tarabykin V. Klein R. Egea J. FLRT2 and FLRT3 act as repulsive guidance cues for Unc5-positive neurons.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2920-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here we use our specific FLRT mutant proteins to test whether this activity is solely dependent on FLRT-Unc5 interaction. We chose intermediate thalamic explants (iTh) expressing Unc5B (Figure 4A), the functional receptor of FLRT3. Using an automatic image analysis program (Figures S3A–S3C), we found that iTh growth cones collapse upon incubation with FLRT3ecto or FLRT3ectoFF, compared to FC control protein. FLRT3ectoUF did not induce growth cone collapse, indicating that the collapse effect is dependent on FLRT3ecto-Unc5 interaction (Figures 4B–4D). Similar results were obtained with a mixed culture of Unc5B/Unc5D-expressing cortical neurons stimulated with mutant or wild-type mixtures of FLRT2+FLRT3 (Figures S3D–S3G). We also performed stripe assays (Vielmetter et al., 1990Vielmetter J. Stolze B. Bonhoeffer F. Stuermer C.A. In vitro assay to test differential substrate affinities of growing axons and migratory cells.Exp. Brain Res. 1990; 81: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) to test the responses of iTh axons toward different FLRT proteins. We found that iTh axons were repelled by stripes containing FLRT3ecto and FLRT3ectoFF (Figures 4E and 4F). iTh axons were also repelled by stripes presenting the non-Unc5-binding mutant FLRT3ectoUF, but the effect was significantly less compared to the wild-type and FF mutant (Figures 4G and 4H). To investigate this further, we arranged alternating stripes presenting wild-type FLRT3ecto and the mutant FLRT3ectoUF. iTh prefer to grow and extend axons on FLRT3ectoUF, suggesting that the repulsive effect of FLRT3ecto is dependent, at least in part, on interaction with Unc5. Conversely, when asked to choose between the Unc5-binding competent FLRT3ecto and FLRT3ectoFF proteins, iTh axons do not show significant preference for either surface (Figures 4I–4K). The stripe assay data raise the possibility that FLRT could also act as a surface-bound contact repellent. We confronted growing iTh axons with HeLa cells expressing a cleavage-resistant FLRT3 mutant, whose ectodomain is not shed (Yamagishi et al., 2011Yamagishi S. Hampel F. Hata K. Del Toro D. Schwark M. Kvachnina E. Bastmeyer M. Yamashita T. Tarabykin V. Klein R. Egea J. FLRT2 and FLRT3 act as repulsive guidance cues for Unc5-positive neurons.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2920-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the noncleavable FLRT3 construct repelled ∼80% of the extending axons, while nontransfected control cells repelled only ∼20% of the axons (Figures 4L and 4M; Movies S1 and S2). Thus, FLRTs act as chemo and contact repellents, and this activity is largely mediated by Unc5 receptors. During brain development, FLRTs and Unc5s are also expressed in overlapping regions. While iTh axons do not express detectable levels of FLRT3, rostral thalamic (rTh) axons express both Unc5B and FLRT3 (Figures 5A and 5B; Leyva-Díaz et al., 2014Leyva-Díaz E. del Toro D. Menal M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2102744370,"Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity together refine neural circuitry, but their interactions are unclear. In most existing models, each form of plasticity directly modifies synaptic strength. Equilibrium is reached when the two are inducing equal and opposite changes. We show that such models cannot reproduce ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) because negative feedback from the slow homeostatic plasticity observed in ODP cannot stabilize the positive feedback of fast Hebbian plasticity. We propose a model in which synaptic strength is the product of a synapse-specific Hebbian factor and a postsynaptic-cell-specific homeostatic factor, with each factor separately arriving at a stable inactive state. This model captures ODP dynamics and has plausible biophysical substrates. We confirm model predictions experimentally that plasticity is inactive at stable states and that synaptic strength overshoots during recovery from visual deprivation. These results highlight the importance of multiple regulatory pathways for interactions of plasticity mechanisms operating over separate timescales."
https://openalex.org/W2079279554,"The aim of the present study was to investigate selenite effects in the unicellular green algae Chlorella vulgaris as a primary producer and the relationship with intracellular bioaccumulation. The effects of selenite were evaluated by measuring the effect of different selenite concentrations on algal growth during a 144 h exposure period. It was found that lower Se concentrations (≤ 75 mg L(-1)) positively promoted C. vulgaris growth and acted as antioxidant by inhibiting lipid peroxidation (LPO) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidative effect was associated with an increase in guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and photosynthetic pigments. Meanwhile, significant increase in the cell growth rate and organic Se content was also detected in the algae. In contrast, these changes were opposite in C. vulgaris exposed to Se higher than 100 mg L-1. The antioxidation and toxicity appeared to be correlated to Se bioaccumulation, which suggests the appropriate concentration of Se in the media accumulation of C. vulgaris should be 75 mg L-1. Taken together, C. vulgaris possesses tolerance to Se, and Se-Chlorella could be developed as antioxidative food for aquaculture and human health."

National guidelines in Malawi and other African countries now advocate an increased induction dose of 1200 mg. We assessed whether this has improved outcomes.This was a prospective observational study of HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis confirmed by diagnostic lumbar puncture. Treatment was with fluconazole 1200 mg/day for two weeks then 400mg/day for 8 weeks. Mortality within the first 10 weeks was the study end-point, and current results were compared with data from our prior patient cohort who started on fluconazole 800 mg/day.47 participants received fluconazole monotherapy. Despite a treatment-induction dose of 1200 mg, ten-week mortality remained 55% (26/47). This was no better than our previous study (Hazard Ratio [HR] of death on 1200 mg vs. 800 mg fluconazole: 1.29 (95% CI: 0.77-2.16, p = 0.332)). There was some evidence for improved survival in patients who had repeat lumbar punctures during early therapy to lower intracranial pressure (HR: 0.27 [95% CI: 0.07-1.03, p = 0.055]).There remains an urgent need to identify more effective, affordable and deliverable regimens for cryptococcal meningitis."
https://openalex.org/W1984681612,"Introduction Tumor cell proliferation in breast cancer is strongly prognostic and may also predict response to chemotherapy. However, there is no consensus on counting areas or cut-off values for patient stratification. Our aim was to assess the matched level of proliferation by Ki67 when using different tissue categories (whole sections, WS; core needle biopsies, CNB; tissue microarrays, TMA), and the corresponding prognostic value. Methods We examined a retrospective, population-based series of breast cancer (n = 534) from the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program. The percentage of Ki67 positive nuclei was evaluated by visual counting on WS (n = 534), CNB (n = 154) and TMA (n = 459). Results The median percentage of Ki67 expression was 18% on WS (hot-spot areas), 13% on CNB, and 7% on TMA, and this difference was statistically significant in paired cases. Increased Ki67 expression by all evaluation methods was associated with aggressive tumor features (large tumor diameter, high histologic grade, ER negativity) and reduced patient survival. Conclusion There is a significant difference in tumor cell proliferation by Ki67 across different sample categories. Ki67 is prognostic over a wide range of cut-off points and for different sample types, although Ki67 results derived from TMA sections are lower compared with those obtained using specimens from a clinical setting. Our findings indicate that specimen specific cut-off values should be applied for practical use."
https://openalex.org/W2010794330,"Coordinated social interaction is associated with, and presumably dependent on, oscillatory couplings within and between brains, which, in turn, consist of an interplay across different frequencies. Here, we introduce a method of network construction based on the cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and examine whether coordinated social interaction is associated with CFC within and between brains. Specifically, we compare the electroencephalograms (EEG) of 15 heterosexual couples during romantic kissing to kissing one’s own hand, and to kissing one another while performing silent arithmetic. Using graph-theory methods, we identify theta–alpha hyper-brain networks, with alpha serving a cleaving or pacemaker function. Network strengths were higher and characteristic path lengths shorter when individuals were kissing each other than when they were kissing their own hand. In both partner-oriented kissing conditions, greater strength and shorter path length for 5-Hz oscillation nodes correlated reliably with greater partner-oriented kissing satisfaction. This correlation was especially strong for inter-brain connections in both partner-oriented kissing conditions but not during kissing one’s own hand. Kissing quality assessed after the kissing with silent arithmetic correlated reliably with intra-brain strength of 10-Hz oscillation nodes during both romantic kissing and kissing with silent arithmetic. We conclude that hyper-brain networks based on CFC may capture neural mechanisms that support interpersonally coordinated voluntary action and bonding behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2099823649,"Danshensu, a type of dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid, is one of the most abundant active phenolic acids in the dried root of Salvia miltiorrhizae (Lamiaceae)—widely used traditional Chinese medicine. The effects of danshensu on platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in rats were examined using various methods. It was found that danshensu significantly reduced thrombus weight in 2 experimental thrombosis models; dose-dependent inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation occurred in normal and blood stasis-induced rats; Danshensu also significantly mitigated blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and hematocrit levels. Moreover, danshensu significantly inhibited venous thrombosis-induced expression of cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) rather than cyclooxygenases-1(COX-1) in the venous walls, down regulated thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and up regulated 6-keto prostaglandin F1α (6-keto-PGF1α), normalizing the TXB2/6-keto-PGF1α ratio. In addition, danshensu did not induce gastric lesions and even had protective effects on aspirin-induced ulcer formation at doses as high as 60 mg/kg. These findings suggest that the antithrombotic and antiplatelet aggregation effects of danshensu are attributed to its highly selective inhibition of COX-2 and ability to normalize the thromboxane A2(TXA2)/prostacyclin(PGI2) balance. These findings suggest that danshensu have great prospects in antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2090174990,"Thrombotic risk is increased in eosinophil-mediated disorders, and several hypotheses have been proposed to link eosinophilia and thrombosis. In particular, eosinophils have been described as source of tissue factor (TF), the main initiator of blood coagulation; however, this aspect is still controversial. This study was aimed to evaluate whether TF expression varies in eosinophils isolated from normal subjects and patients with different hypereosinophilic conditions. Eosinophils were immunologically purified from peripheral blood samples of 9 patients with different hypereosinophilic conditions and 9 normal subjects. Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to test eosinophil TF expression. For comparison, TF expression was evaluated in monocytes from blood donors and in human endothelial (ECV304) and fibroblast (IMR90) cell lines. Western blot analysis revealed a major band of 47,000 corresponding to native TF in homogenates of purified eosinophils with a higher intensity in the 9 patients than in the 9 controls (p<0.0001). According to RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct), TF gene expression was higher in eosinophils from patients than in those from controls, median (range) 35.10 (19.45-36.50) vs 37.17 (35.33-37.87) (p = 0.002), and was particularly abundant in one patient with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and ischemic heart attacks (Ct: 19.45). TF gene expression was moderate in monocytes, Ct: 31.32 (29.82-33.49) and abundant in endothelial cells, Ct: 28.70 (27.79-29.57) and fibroblasts, Ct: 22.77 (19.22-25.05). Our results indicate that human blood eosinophils contain variable amounts of TF. The higher TF expression in patients with hypereosinophilic disorders may contribute to increase the thrombotic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2004748436,"In Brazil, the snail Biomphalaria glabrata is the most important vector of schistosomiasis due to its wide geographical distribution, high infection rate and efficient disease transmission. Among the methods of schistosomiasis control, the World Health Organization recommends the use of synthetic molluscicides, such as niclosamide. However, different substances of natural origin have been tested as alternatives for the control or eradication of mollusks. The literature describes the antitumor, antimicrobial and antiviral properties of usnic acid as well as other important activities of common interest between medicine and the environment. However, usnic acid has a low degree of water solubility, which can be a limiting factor for its use, especially in aquatic environments, since the organic solvents commonly used to solubilize this substance can have toxic effects on aquatic biota. Thus, the aim of the present study was to test the potassium salt of usnic acid (potassium usnate) with regard to molluscicidal activity and toxicity to brine shrimp (Artemia salina). To obtain potassium usnate, usnic acid was extracted with diethyl ether isolated and purified from the lichen Cladonia substellata. Biological assays were performed with embryos and adult snails of B. glabrata exposed for 24 h to the usnate solution solubilized in dechlorinated water at 2.5; 5 and 10 µg/ml for embryos, 0.5; 0.9; 1;5 and 10 µg/ml for mollusks and 0.5; 1; 5; 10 µg/ml for A. salina. The lowest lethal concentration for the embryos and adult snails was 10 and 1 µg/ml, respectively. No toxicity to A. salina was found. The results show that modified usnic acid has increased solubility (100%) without losing its biological activity and may be a viable alternative for the control of B. glabrata."
https://openalex.org/W2086897399,"Hyperoxia exposure of premature infants causes obliteration of the immature retinal microvessels, leading to a condition of proliferative vitreoretinal neovascularization termed retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Previous work has demonstrated that the hyperoxia-induced vascular injury is mediated by dysfunction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase resulting in peroxynitrite formation. This study was undertaken to determine the involvement of the ureahydrolase enzyme arginase in this pathology.Studies were performed using hyperoxia-treated bovine retinal endothelial cells (BRE) and mice with oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) as experimental models of ROP. Treatment with the specific arginase inhibitor 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid (ABH) prevented hyperoxia-induced apoptosis of BRE cells and reduced vaso-obliteration in the OIR model. Furthermore, deletion of the arginase 2 gene protected against hyperoxia-induced vaso-obliteration, enhanced physiological vascular repair, and reduced retinal neovascularization in the OIR model. Additional deletion of one copy of arginase 1 did not improve the vascular pathology. Analyses of peroxynitrite by quantitation of its biomarker nitrotyrosine, superoxide by dihydroethidium imaging and NO formation by diaminofluoroscein imaging showed that the protective actions of arginase 2 deletion were associated with blockade of superoxide and peroxynitrite formation and normalization of NOS activity.Our data demonstrate the involvement of arginase activity and arginase 2 expression in hyperoxia-induced vascular injury. Arginase 2 deletion prevents hyperoxia-induced retinal vascular injury by preventing NOS uncoupling resulting in decreased reactive oxygen species formation and increased nitric oxide bioavailability."
https://openalex.org/W2049594890,"Statins may inhibit the expression of the mutant KRAS phenotype by preventing the prenylation and thus the activation of the KRAS protein. This study was aimed at retrospectively evaluating the effect of statin use on outcome in KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer patients (mCRC) treated with cetuximab. Treatment data were obtained from patients who were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin bevacizumab ± cetuximab in the phase III CAIRO2 study. A total of 529 patients were included in this study, of whom 78 patients were on statin therapy. In patients with a KRAS wild type tumor (n = 321) the median PFS was 10.3 vs. 11.4 months for non-users compared to statin users and in patients with a KRAS mutant tumor (n = 208) this was 7.6 vs. 6.2 months, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for PFS for statin users was 1.12 (95% confidence interval 0.78–1.61) and was not influenced by treatment arm, KRAS mutation status or the KRAS*statin interaction. Statin use adjusted for covariates was not associated with increased PFS (HR = 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.71–1.54). In patients with a KRAS wild type tumor the median OS for non-users compared to statin users was 22.4 vs. 19.8 months and in the KRAS mutant tumor group the OS was 18.1 vs. 14.5 months. OS was significantly shorter in statin users versus non-users (HR = 1.54; 95% confidence interval 1.06–2.22). However, statin use, adjusted for covariates was not associated with increased OS (HR = 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.95–2.10). In conclusion, the use of statins at time of diagnosis was not associated with an improved PFS in KRAS mutant mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy and bevacizumab plus cetuximab."
https://openalex.org/W2079330060,"We describe a unique, versatile bioreactor consisting of two plates and a modified commercial porous membrane suitable for in vitro analysis of the liver sinusoid. The modular bioreactor allows i) excellent control of the cell seeding process; ii) cell culture under controlled shear stress stimulus, and; iii) individual analysis of each cell type upon completion of the experiment. The advantages of the bioreactor detailed here are derived from the modification of a commercial porous membrane with an elastomeric wall specifically moulded in order to define the cell culture area, to act as a gasket that will fit into the bioreactor, and to provide improved mechanical robustness. The device presented herein has been designed to simulate the in vivo organization of a liver sinusoid and tested by co-culturing endothelial cells (EC) and hepatic stellate cells (HSC). The results show both an optimal morphology of the endothelial cells as well as an improvement in the phenotype of stellate cells, most probably due to paracrine factors released from endothelial cells. This device is proposed as a versatile, easy-to-use co-culture system that can be applied to biomedical research of vascular systems, including the liver."

Then, differentiation experiments were carried out using RT-PCR, and Ki-67/Annexin V antibodies were used to measure proliferation and apoptosis. We also explored the impact of CSE on the differentiation and survival of CD4+Th/Tregs and examined the expression of MRs in healthy nonsmokers and patients with SCOPD.We found the percentages of circulating Th1 and Th17 cells were increased in patients with AECOPD, while the percentage of Th2 cells was decreased in patients with SCOPD. The percentages of Th10 cells were decreased in both patients with SCOPD and patients with AECOPD, while the percentages of Tregs were increased. In addition, the percentages of CD4+α-7+ T cells were decreased in patients with SCOPD and patients with AECOPD. However, only the decrease observed in patients with AECOPD was significant. In vitro studies also revealed MR expression affected the polarization of T cells, with different CD4+ T cell subtypes acquiring different MR expression profiles. The addition of CSE facilitated CD4+ T cell polarization towards pro-inflammatory subsets (Th1 and Th17) and affected the survival of CD4+ T cells and Treg cells by up-regulating the expression of MR3 and 5, resulting in an imbalance of CD4+ T cell subsets.Our findings suggest an imbalance of circulating CD4+ T cell subsets is involved in COPD pathogenesis in smokers. Cigarette smoking may contribute to this imbalance by affecting the polarization and survival of Th/Tregs through the up-regulation of MR3 and MR5."

In the present study we used Ehrlich solid carcinoma (ESC) bearing mice as a model to investigate MNPs antitumor activity, their effect on expression of p53 and p16 genes as an indicator for apoptotic induction in tumor tissues.MNPs coated with ascorbic acid (size: 25.0±5.0 nm) were synthesized by co-precipitation method and characterized. Ehrlich mice model were treated with MNPs using 60 mg/Kg day by day for 14 injections; intratumorally (IT) or intraperitoneally (IP). Tumor size, pathological changes and iron content in tumor and normal muscle tissues were assessed. We also assessed changes in expression levels of p53 and p16 genes in addition to p53 protein level by immunohistochemistry.Our results revealed that tumor growth was significantly reduced by IT and IP MNPs injection compared to untreated tumor. A significant increase in p53 and p16 mRNA expression was detected in Ehrlich solid tumors of IT and IP treated groups compared to untreated Ehrlich solid tumor. This increase was accompanied with increase in p53 protein expression. It is worth mentioning that no significant difference in expression of p53 and p16 could be detected between IT ESC and control group.MNPs might be more effective in breast cancer treatment if injected intratumorally to be directed to the tumor tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2058207200,"Treatment of advanced ovarian cancer involves platinum-based chemotherapy. However, chemoresistance is a major obstacle. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be one of the causes of chemoresistance, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Recently, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) has been reported to promote CSC-like traits. In this study, we found that a mitotic inhibitor, eribulin mesylate (eribulin), effectively inhibited growth of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Eribulin-sensitive cells showed a higher efficiency for sphere formation, suggesting that these cells possess an enhanced CSC-like phenotype. Moreover, these cells expressed a higher level of hTERT, and suppression of hTERT expression by siRNA resulted in decreased sensitivity to eribulin, suggesting that hTERT may be a target for eribulin. Indeed, we found that eribulin directly inhibited RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity, but not telomerase activity of hTERT in vitro. We propose that eribulin targets the RdRP activity of hTERT and may be an effective therapeutic option for CSCs. Furthermore, hTERT may be a useful biomarker to predict clinical responses to eribulin."
https://openalex.org/W1979517221,"Cephapirin, a cephalosporin antibiotic, is used by the majority of dairy farms in the US. Fecal and urinary excretion of cephapirin could introduce this compound into the environment when manure is land applied as fertilizer, and may cause development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics critical for human health. The environmental loading of cephapirin by the livestock industry remains un-assessed, largely due to a lack of appropriate analytical methods. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a cephapirin quantification method to capture the temporal pattern of cephapirin excretion in dairy cows following intramammary infusion. The method includes an extraction with phosphate buffer and methanol, solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up, and quantification using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The LOQ values of the developed method were 4.02 µg kg−1 and 0.96 µg L−1 for feces and urine, respectively. This robust method recovered >60% and >80% cephapirin from spiked blank fecal and urine samples, respectively, with acceptable intra- and inter-day variation (<10%). Using this method, we detected trace amounts (µg kg−1) of cephapirin in dairy cow feces, and cephapirin in urine was detected at very high concentrations (133 to 480 µg L−1). Cephapirin was primarily excreted via urine and its urinary excretion was influenced by day (P = 0.03). Peak excretion (2.69 mg) was on day 1 following intramammary infusion and decreased sharply thereafter (0.19, 0.19, 0.08, and 0.17 mg on day 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively) reflecting a quadratic pattern of excretion (Quadratic: P = 0.03). The described method for quantification of cephapirin in bovine feces and urine is sensitive, accurate, and robust and allowed to monitor the pattern of cephapirin excretion in dairy cows. This data will help develop manure segregation and treatment methods to minimize the risk of antibiotic loading to the environment from dairy farms."
https://openalex.org/W2003547657,"Somatic gene therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of severe diseases. Because of its abuse potential for performance enhancement in sports, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) included the term ‘gene doping’ in the official list of banned substances and methods in 2004. Several nested PCR or qPCR-based strategies have been proposed that aim at detecting long-term presence of transgene in blood, but these strategies are hampered by technical limitations. We developed a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) protocol for Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) detection and demonstrated its applicability monitoring 6 mice injected into skeletal muscle with AAV9-IGF1 elements and 2 controls over a 33-day period. A duplex ddPCR protocol for simultaneous detection of Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) and Erythropoietin (EPO) transgenic elements was created. A new DNA extraction procedure with target-orientated usage of restriction enzymes including on-column DNA-digestion was established. In vivo data revealed that IGF1 transgenic elements could be reliably detected for a 33-day period in DNA extracted from whole blood. In vitro data indicated feasibility of IGF1 and EPO detection by duplex ddPCR with high reliability and sensitivity. On-column DNA-digestion allowed for significantly improved target detection in downstream PCR-based approaches. As ddPCR provides absolute quantification, it ensures excellent day-to-day reproducibility. Therefore, we expect this technique to be used in diagnosing and monitoring of viral and bacterial infection, in detecting mutated DNA sequences as well as profiling for the presence of foreign genetic material in elite athletes in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2064543940,"Aix galericulata and Tadorna ferruginea are two Anatidae species representing different taxonomic groups of Anseriformes. We used a PCR-based method to determine the complete mtDNAs of both species, and estimated phylogenetic trees based on the complete mtDNA alignment of these and 14 other Anseriforme species, to clarify Anseriform phylogenetics. Phylogenetic trees were also estimated using a multiple sequence alignment of three mitochondrial genes (Cyt b, ND2, and COI) from 68 typical species in GenBank, to further clarify the phylogenetic relationships of several groups among the Anseriformes. The new mtDNAs are circular molecules, 16,651 bp (Aix galericulata) and 16,639 bp (Tadorna ferruginea) in length, containing the 37 typical genes, with an identical gene order and arrangement as those of other Anseriformes. Comparing the protein-coding genes among the mtDNAs of 16 Anseriforme species, ATG is generally the start codon, TAA is the most frequent stop codon, one of three, TAA, TAG, and T-, commonly observed. All tRNAs could be folded into canonical cloverleaf secondary structures except for tRNASer (AGY) and tRNALeu (CUN), which are missing the ""DHU"" arm.Phylogenetic relationships demonstrate that Aix galericula and Tadorna ferruginea are in the same group, the Tadorninae lineage, based on our analyses of complete mtDNAs and combined gene data. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests the 68 species of Anseriform birds be divided into three families: Anhimidae, Anatidae, and Anseranatidae. The results suggest Anatidae birds be divided into five subfamilies: Anatinae, Tadorninae, Anserinae, Oxyurinae, and Dendrocygninae. Oxyurinae and Dendrocygninae should not belong to Anserinae, but rather represent independent subfamilies. The Anatinae includes species from the tribes Mergini, Somaterini, Anatini, and Aythyini. The Anserinae includes species from the tribes Anserini and Cygnini."

Assessments were completed at baseline, before beginning the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and at 3-, 6-, and 12- months follow-up. The primary outcomes were physical activity and sedentary time assessed by accelerometers and servings of fruit, vegetables and junk food assessed by 3-day food records.During the intensive 8-week intervention sedentary time decreased by -5.1 min/day/month (95% CI: -11.0, 0.8) which was significantly greater than the rate of change during the waitlist period (p = .014). Moderate physical activity increased by 1.8 min/day/month (95% CI: -0.04, 3.6) during the intervention period, which was significantly greater than the rate of change during the waitlist period (p = .041). Fruit consumption increased during the intervention period (monthly incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.3, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.56) and junk food consumption decreased (monthly IRR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.94) and these changes were different to those seen during the waitlist period (p = .004 and p = .020 respectively).Participating in CAFAP appeared to have a positive influence on the physical activity, sedentary and healthy eating behaviours of overweight and obese adolescents and many of these changes were maintained for one year following the intensive intervention.Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12611001187932."
https://openalex.org/W2068711227,"T2A-1 is a newly developed transgenic rice that expresses a synthesized cry2Aa gene driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter. T2A-1 exhibits high resistance against lepidopteran pests of rice. The brown planthopper, Nilapavarta lugens (Stål), is a main nontarget sap-sucking insect pest of rice, and Cyrtorhinus lividipennis (Reuter) is the major predator of the eggs and young nymphs of planthoppers. As C. lividipennis may expose to the Cry2Aa protein via N. lugens, it is therefore essential to assess the potential effects of transgenic cry2Aa rice on this predator. In the present study, three experiments were conducted to evaluate the ecological risk of transgenic cry2Aa rice to C. lividipennis: (1) a direct feeding experiment in which C. lividipennis was fed an artificial diet containing Cry2Aa at the dose of 10-time higher than that it may encounter in the realistic field condition; (2) a tritrophic experiment in which the Cry2Aa protein was delivered to C. lividipennis indirectly through prey eggs or nymphs; (3) a realistic field experiment in which the population dynamics of C. lividipennis were investigated using vacuum-suction. Both direct exposure to elevated doses of the Cry2Aa protein and prey-mediated exposure to realistic doses of the protein did not result in significant detrimental effects on the development, survival, female ratio and body weight of C. lividipennis. No significant differences in population density and population dynamics were observed between C. lividipennis in transgenic cry2Aa and nontransgenic rice fields. It may be concluded that transgenic cry2Aa rice had no detrimental effects on C. lividipennis. This study represents the first report of an assessment continuum for the effects of transgenic cry2Aa rice on C. lividipennis."
https://openalex.org/W2085669519,"Species diversity and genetic diversity, the most basic elements of biodiversity, have long been treated as separate topics, although populations evolve within a community context. Recent studies on community genetics and ecology have suggested that genetic diversity is not completely independent of species diversity. The Mexican Picea chihuahuana Martínez is an endemic species listed as “Endangered” on the Red List. Forty populations of Chihuahua spruce have been identified. This species is often associated with tree species of eight genera in gallery forests. This rare Picea chihuahuana tree community covers an area no more than 300 ha and has been subject of several studies involving different topics such as ecology, genetic structure and climate change. The overall aim of these studies was to obtain a dataset for developing management tools to help decision makers implement preservation and conservation strategies. However, this unique forest tree community may also represent an excellent subject for helping us to understand the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes in determining community structure and dynamics. The AFLP technique and species composition data were used together to test the hypothesis that species diversity is related to the adaptive genetic structure of some dominant tree species (Picea chihuahuana, Pinus strobiformis, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Populus tremuloides) of the Picea chihuahuana tree community at fourteen locations. The Hill numbers were used as a diversity measure. The results revealed a significant correlation between tree species diversity and genetic structure in Populus tremuloides. Because the relationship between the two levels of diversity was found to be positive for the putative adaptive AFLP detected, genetic and species structures of the tree community were possibly simultaneously adapted to a combination of ecological or environmental factors. The present findings indicate that interactions between genetic variants and species diversity may be crucial in shaping tree communities."
https://openalex.org/W2035248791,"Evidence suggests the NADPH oxidases contribute to ischaemic stroke injury and Nox2 is the most widely studied subtype in the context of stroke. There is still conjecture however regarding the benefits of inhibiting Nox2 to improve stroke outcome. The current study aimed to examine the temporal effects of genetic Nox2 deletion on neuronal loss after ischaemic stroke using knockout (KO) mice with 6, 24 and 72 hour recovery. Transient cerebral ischaemia was induced via intraluminal filament occlusion and resulted in reduced infarct volumes in Nox2 KO mice at 24 h post-stroke compared to wild-type controls. No protection was evident at either 6 h or 72 h post-stroke, with both genotypes exhibiting similar volumes of damage. Reactive oxygen species were detected using dihydroethidium and were co-localised with neurons and microglia in both genotypes using immunofluorescent double-labelling. The effect of Nox2 deletion on vascular damage and recovery was also examined 24 h and 72 h post-stroke using an antibody against laminin. Blood vessel density was decreased in the ischaemic core of both genotypes 24 h post-stroke and returned to pre-stroke levels only in Nox2 KO mice by 72 h. Overall, these results are the first to show that genetic Nox2 deletion merely delays the progression of neuronal loss after stroke but does not prevent it. Additionally, we show for the first time that Nox2 deletion increases re-vascularisation of the damaged brain by 72 h, which may be important in promoting endogenous brain repair mechanisms that rely on re-vascularisation."
https://openalex.org/W2033745576,"Agonists such as icilin and menthol can activate the cool temperature-sensitive ion channel TRPM8. However, biological responses to menthol may occur independently of TRPM8 activation. In the rodent urinary bladder, menthol facilitates the micturition reflex but inhibits muscarinic contractions of the detrusor smooth muscle. The site(s) of TRPM8 expression in the bladder are controversial. In this study we investigated the regulation of bladder contractility in vitro by menthol. Bladder strips from wild type and TRPM8 knockout male mice (25-30 g) were dissected free and mounted in organ baths. Isometric contractions to carbachol (1 nM-30 µM), CaCl2 (1 µM to 100 mM) and electrical field stimulation (EFS; 8, 16, 32 Hz) were measured. Strips from both groups contracted similarly in response to both carbachol and EFS. Menthol (300 µM) or nifedipine (1 µM) inhibited carbachol and EFS-induced contractions in both wild type and TRPM8 knockout bladder strips. Incubation with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 µM), replacement of extracellular sodium with the impermeant cation N-Methyl-D-Glucamine, incubation with a cocktail of potassium channel inhibitors (100 nM charybdotoxin, 1 µM apamin, 10 µM glibenclamide and 1 µM tetraethylammonium) or removal of the urothelium did not affect the inhibitory actions of menthol. Contraction to CaCl2 was markedly inhibited by either menthol or nifedipine. In cultured bladder smooth muscle cells, menthol or nifedipine abrogated the carbachol or KCl-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Intravesical administration of menthol increased voiding frequency while decreasing peak voiding pressure. We conclude that menthol inhibits muscarinic bladder contractions through blockade of L-type calcium channels, independently of TRPM8 activation."

Elliptio complanata is a common freshwater mussel of eastern North America that can serve both as an indicator and as an experimental model for understanding mussel physiology and genetics. To support genetic components of these research goals, we assembled transcriptome contigs from Illumina paired-end reads. Despite efforts to collapse similar contigs, the final assembly was in excess of 136,000 contigs with an N50 of 982 bp. Even so, comparisons to the CEGMA database of conserved eukaryotic genes indicated that ∼20% of genes remain unrepresented. However, numerous candidate stress-response genes were present, and we identified lineage-specific patterns of diversification among molluscs for cytochrome P450 detoxification genes and two saccharide-modifying enzymes: 1,3 beta-galactosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase. Less than a quarter of contigs had protein-level similarity based on modest BLAST and Hmmer3 statistical thresholds. These results add comparative genomic resources for molluscs and suggest a wealth of novel proteins and noncoding transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1976624142,"Lake cress, Rorippa aquatica (Brassicaceae), is a semi-aquatic plant that exhibits a variety of leaf shapes, from simple leaves to highly branched compound leaves, depending on the environment. Leaf shape can vary within a single plant, suggesting that the variation can be explained by a simple model. In order to simulate the branched structure in the compound leaves of R. aquatica, we implemented reaction-diffusion (RD) patterning onto a theoretical framework that had been developed for serration distribution in the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, with the modification of the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion domain being deformed with the spatial periodicity of the RD pattern while expanding. This simple method using an iterative pattern could create regular and nested branching patterns. Subsequently, we verified the plausibility of our theoretical model by comparing it with the experimentally observed branching patterns. The results suggested that our model successfully predicted both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the timing and positioning of branching in growing R. aquatica leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2023448182,"Niacin has been demonstrated to activate a PI3K/Akt signaling cascade to prevent brain damage after stroke and UV-induced skin damage; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms for HCA2-induced Akt activation remain to be elucidated. Using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HCA2 and A431 cells, a human epidermoid cell line with high levels of endogenous expression of functional HCA2 receptors, we first demonstrated that niacin induced a robust Akt phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473 in a time-dependent fashion, with a maximal activation at 5 min and a subsequent reduction to baseline by 30 min through HCA2, and that the activation was significantly blocked by pertussis toxin. The HCA2-mediated activation of Akt was also significantly inhibited by the PKC inhibitors GF109203x and Go6983 in both cell lines, by the PDGFR-selective inhibitor tyrphostin A9 in CHO-HCA2 cells and by the MMP inhibitor GM6001 and EGFR-specific inhibitor AG1478 in A431 cells. These results suggest that the PKC pathway and PDGFR/EGFR transactivation pathway play important roles in HCA2-mediated Akt activation. Further investigation indicated that PI3K and the Gβγ subunit were likely to play an essential role in HCA2-induced Akt activation. Moreover, Immunobloting analyses using an antibody that recognizes p70S6K1 phosphorylated at Thr389 showed that niacin evoked p70S6K1 activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway. The results of our study provide new insight into the signaling pathways involved in HCA2 activation."

This study specifically evaluated the effect of genetic counseling and Connexin-26 and Connexin-30 genetic test results on participants' deaf identity and understanding of their genetic test results. Connexin-26 and Connexin-30 genetic testing was offered to participants in the context of linguistically and culturally appropriate genetic counseling. Questionnaire data collected from 209 deaf adults at four time points (baseline, immediately following pre-test genetic counseling, 1-month following genetic test result disclosure, and 6-months after result disclosure) were analyzed. Four deaf identity orientations (hearing, marginal, immersion, bicultural) were evaluated using subscales of the Deaf Identity Development Scale-Revised. We found evidence that participants understood their specific genetic test results following genetic counseling, but found no evidence of change in deaf identity based on genetic counseling or their genetic test results. This study demonstrated that culturally and linguistically appropriate genetic counseling can improve deaf clients' understanding of genetic test results, and the formation of deaf identity was not directly related to genetic counseling or Connexin-26 and Connexin-30 genetic test results."

Recently, a mutation located in the nuclear export signal (NES) of the FUS gene has been reported to cause an autosomal dominant form of familial Essential tremor. Material and Methods We sequenced the exons coding the NES domains of five RNA-binding proteins (TARDBP, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPA1, TAF15 and EWSR1) that have been previously implicated in neurodegeneration in a series of 257 essential tremor (ET) cases and 376 healthy controls. We genotyped 404 additional ET subjects and 510 healthy controls to assess the frequency of the EWSR1 p.R471C substitution. Results We identified a rare EWSR1 p.R471C substitution, which is highly conserved, in a single subject with familial ET. The pathogenicity of this substitution remains equivocal, as DNA samples from relatives were not available and the genotyping of 404 additional ET subjects did not reveal any further carriers. No other variants were observed with significant allele frequency differences compared to controls in the NES coding regions. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that the NES domains of RNA-binding proteins are highly conserved. The role of the EWSR1 p.R471C substitution needs to be further evaluated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2159964292,"Age is a key component of fitness, affecting survival and reproductive capacities. Where it is not possible to study known individuals from birth, morphometrics (predominantly patterns of plumage development for birds) are most often used to estimate age. Although criteria for age estimations exist for many species, the degree to which these criteria improve the precision of estimates remains to be tested, restricting their widespread acceptance. We develop a photographic tool for estimating ages of Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) chicks and test it using 100 human observers of varying prior experience across four breeding colonies (three North American sites and one European site) and under controlled laboratory conditions. We followed the design approach of other morphometric tools, expanding it to create a user-friendly guide (divided into six age groupings). The majority (86%) of observers improved in chick-aging accuracy when using the tool by an average of 20.1% (±1.4 SE) and correctly estimated 60.3% (±1.4) of chick ages. This was similar to the intrinsic aging ability of our best field observer (63.3%). Observers with limited experience showed the greatest increases in chick-aging accuracy over experienced observers who likely had established a method for estimating chick ages prior to using the tool. Even the best observers only correctly estimated ages of chicks 62.9% (±2.8) of the time in the field and 84.0% (±2.9) of the time in the lab when using the tool and typically underestimated ages. This indicates that developmental variation between individual chicks can prevent completely reliable age estimates and corroborates the few existing data that suggest that morphometric criteria fail to achieve robust levels of accuracy and may introduce error into studies that rely on them. We conclude that novel approaches for estimating age, not only morphometric criteria, must be pursued."

Dual-specificity phosphatase 2 (DUSP2) is widely expressed within the immune system and plays a key role promoting immune and inflammatory responses dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. We hypothesised that the absence of DUSP2 would protect mice against obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance. Accordingly, male and female littermate mice that are either wild-type (wt) or homozygous for a germ-line null mutation of the dusp2 gene (dusp2−/−) were fed either a standard chow diet (SCD) or high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks prior to metabolic phenotyping. Compared with mice fed the SCD, all mice consuming the HFD became obese, developed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and displayed increased macrophage recruitment and markers of inflammation in epididymal white adipose tissue. The absence of DUSP2, however, had no effect on the development of obesity or adipose tissue inflammation. Whole body insulin sensitivity in male mice was unaffected by an absence of DUSP2 in response to either the SCD or HFD; however, HFD-induced insulin resistance was slightly, but significantly, reduced in female dusp2−/− mice. In conclusion, DUSP2 plays no role in regulating obesity-associated inflammation and only a minor role in controlling insulin sensitivity following HFD in female, but not male, mice. These data indicate that rather than DUSP2 being a pan regulator of MAPK dependent immune cell mediated inflammation, it appears to differentially regulate inflammatory responses that have a MAPK component."

We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine attentional and evaluative processing of maternal stimuli while participants completed a Go/No-go Association Task that paired mother or others words with good or bad evaluative words. Behavioral data showed that participants responded faster to mother words paired with good than the mother words paired with bad but showed no difference in response to these others across conditions, reflecting a positive evaluation of mother. ERPs showed larger P200 and N200 in response to mother than in response to others, suggesting that mother attracted more attention than others. In the subsequent time window, mother in the mother + bad condition elicited a later and larger late positive potential (LPP) than it did in the mother + good condition, but this was not true for others, also suggesting a positive evaluation of mother. These results suggest that people differentiate mother from others during initial attentional stage, and evaluative mother positively during later stage."
https://openalex.org/W1984866312,"Purpose To develop a tri-modality image fusion method for better target delineation in image-guided radiotherapy for patients with brain tumors. Methods A new method of tri-modality image fusion was developed, which can fuse and display all image sets in one panel and one operation. And a feasibility study in gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation using data from three patients with brain tumors was conducted, which included images of simulation CT, MRI, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) examinations before radiotherapy. Tri-modality image fusion was implemented after image registrations of CT+PET and CT+MRI, and the transparency weight of each modality could be adjusted and set by users. Three radiation oncologists delineated GTVs for all patients using dual-modality (MRI/CT) and tri-modality (MRI/CT/PET) image fusion respectively. Inter-observer variation was assessed by the coefficient of variation (COV), the average distance between surface and centroid (ADSC), and the local standard deviation (SDlocal). Analysis of COV was also performed to evaluate intra-observer volume variation. Results The inter-observer variation analysis showed that, the mean COV was 0.14(±0.09) and 0.07(±0.01) for dual-modality and tri-modality respectively; the standard deviation of ADSC was significantly reduced (p<0.05) with tri-modality; SDlocal averaged over median GTV surface was reduced in patient 2 (from 0.57 cm to 0.39 cm) and patient 3 (from 0.42 cm to 0.36 cm) with the new method. The intra-observer volume variation was also significantly reduced (p = 0.00) with the tri-modality method as compared with using the dual-modality method. Conclusion With the new tri-modality image fusion method smaller inter- and intra-observer variation in GTV definition for the brain tumors can be achieved, which improves the consistency and accuracy for target delineation in individualized radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2052739947,"High charge and energy (HZE) particles are a main hazard of the space radiation environment. Uncertainty regarding their health effects is a limiting factor in the design of human exploration-class space missions, that is, missions beyond low earth orbit. Previous work has shown that HZE exposure increases cancer risk and elicits other aging-like phenomena in animal models. Here, we investigate how a single exposure to HZE particle radiation, early in life, influences the subsequent age-dependent evolution of oxidative stress and appearance of degenerative tissue changes. Embryos of the laboratory model organism, Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka fish), were exposed to HZE particle radiation at doses overlapping the range of anticipated human exposure. A separate cohort was exposed to reference γ-radiation. Survival was monitored for 750 days, well beyond the median lifespan. The population was also sampled at intervals and liver tissue was subjected to histological and molecular analysis. HZE particle radiation dose and aging contributed synergistically to accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, which are a marker of chronic oxidative stress. This was mirrored by a decline in PPARGC1A mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional co-activator required for expression of oxidative stress defense genes and for mitochondrial maintenance. Consistent with chronic oxidative stress, mitochondria had an elongated and enlarged ultrastructure. Livers also had distinctive, cystic lesions. Depending on the endpoint, effects of γ-rays in the same dose range were either lesser or not detected. Results provide a quantitative and qualitative framework for understanding relative contributions of HZE particle radiation exposure and aging to chronic oxidative stress and tissue degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W1999102830,"Exposure to unpredictable and uncontrollable conditions causes animals to perceive stress and change their behavior. It is unclear how the perception of stress modifies the motor components of behavior and which molecular pathways affect the behavioral change. In order to understand how stress affects motor function, we developed an experimental platform that quantifies walking motions in Drosophila. We found that stress induction using electrical shock results in backwards motions of the forelegs at the end of walking strides. These leg retrogressions persisted during repeated stimulation, although they habituated substantially. The motions also continued for several strides after the end of the shock, indicating that stress induces a behavioral aftereffect. Such aftereffect could also be induced by restricting the motion of the flies via wing suspension. Further, the long-term effects could be amplified by combining either immobilization or electric shock with additional stressors. Thus, retrogression is a lingering form of response to a broad range of stressful conditions, which cause the fly to search for a foothold when it faces extreme and unexpected challenges. Mutants in the cAMP signaling pathway enhanced the stress response, indicating that this pathway regulates the behavioral response to stress. Our findings identify the effect of stress on a specific motor component of behavior and define the role of cAMP signaling in this stress response."
https://openalex.org/W1977973800,"The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term outcomes and prognostic factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in Han and Uyghur patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in the Xinjiang region of China.One hundred twenty-one Han and 60 Uyghur patients with newly diagnosed NPC without distant metastasis received IMRT at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University between 2005 and 2008. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival rates, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences in survival.Comparing Han and Uyghur patients, the 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC), regional control (RC), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates were 81.9% vs 77.6% (P = 0.297), 72.1% vs 65.6% (P = 0.493), 88.3% vs 86.5% (P = 0.759), 95.0% vs 94.6% (P = 0.929), and 79.1% vs 75.2% (P = 0.613), respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression identified the following independent prognostic factors in Han patients: N stage (P = 0.007) and age (P = 0.028) for OS, and age (P = 0.028) for DFS. OS differed significantly between Han and Uyghur patients >60 years old group (P = 0.036). Among Uyghur patients, the independent prognostic factors were age for OS (P = 0.033), as well as N stage (P = 0.037) and age (P = 0.021) for DFS. Additionally, Uyghur patients were less likely to experience mucositis and dermatitis than Han patients.Han and Uyghur patients with NPC had statistically significant differences in age, smoking history, and N staging. There was no significant difference in overall treatment outcomes with IMRT between these 2 ethnic populations in Xinjiang, China."
https://openalex.org/W1973643993,"The reaction of DNA transposition begins when the transposase enzyme binds to the transposon DNA. Sleeping Beauty is a member of the mariner family of DNA transposons. Although it is an important tool in genetic applications and has been adapted for human gene therapy, its molecular mechanism remains obscure. Here, we show that only the folded conformation of the specific DNA recognition subdomain of the Sleeping Beauty transposase, the PAI subdomain, binds to the transposon DNA. Furthermore, we show that the PAI subdomain is well folded at low temperatures, but the presence of unfolded conformation gradually increases at temperatures above 15°C, suggesting that the choice of temperature may be important for the optimal transposase activity. Overall, the results provide a molecular-level insight into the DNA recognition by the Sleeping Beauty transposase."
https://openalex.org/W1814390881,"We sought to determine which parental cell type was best suited for creating reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and what differences might exist between iPSCs generated from various tissues. To do this, we reprogrammed primary mouse astrocytes, a central nervous system derived cell, into astrocyte-derived iPSCs (mAsiPSCs) using an ectopic expression of Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc. These mAsiPSCs expressed stem cell markers and formed teratomas. Importantly, mAsiPSCs grew more slowly and were more likely to differentiate into neuronal-type cells compared to mouse embryonic fibroblast-derived iPSCs (MEFsiPSCs), a non-central nervous system-derived cell type. These results suggest that mAsiPSCs retain a “memory” of their central nervous system origin and may have a higher incidence of neuronal differentiation. Moreover, direct conversion of somatic cells into lineage-specific progenitor cells in one step, bypassing the intermediated pluripotent stage, provides an alternative strategy for generating promising cell types. We demonstrated the conversion of adult dermal fibroblasts into induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs) using a novel combination of genes different from those previously reported. These iNPCs exhibit typical NPC morphology and marker gene expression, and a normal capacity for proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation. Our findings suggest new cell-replacement strategies that may be beneficial for studies involving neurodegenerative diseases, disease modeling, and neural development."
