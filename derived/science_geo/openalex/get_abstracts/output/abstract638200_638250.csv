https://openalex.org/W2969996045,"After a decade of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), fundamental questions in human genetics, such as the extent of pleiotropy across the genome and variation in genetic architecture across traits, are still unanswered. The current availability of hundreds of GWASs provides a unique opportunity to address these questions. We systematically analyzed 4,155 publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWASs on 558 traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and genetic architecture. We show that trait-associated loci cover more than half of the genome, and 90% of these overlap with loci from multiple traits. We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits. Our results provide insights into how genetic variation contributes to trait variation. All GWAS results can be queried and visualized at the GWAS ATLAS resource ( https://atlas.ctglab.nl )."
https://openalex.org/W2968292465,"Spatial mapping of proteins in tissues is hindered by limitations in multiplexing, sensitivity and throughput. Here we report immunostaining with signal amplification by exchange reaction (Immuno-SABER), which achieves highly multiplexed signal amplification via DNA-barcoded antibodies and orthogonal DNA concatemers generated by primer exchange reaction (PER). SABER offers independently programmable signal amplification without in situ enzymatic reactions, and intrinsic scalability to rapidly amplify and visualize a large number of targets when combined with fast exchange cycles of fluorescent imager strands. We demonstrate 5- to 180-fold signal amplification in diverse samples (cultured cells, cryosections, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections and whole-mount tissues), as well as simultaneous signal amplification for ten different proteins using standard equipment and workflows. We also combined SABER with expansion microscopy to enable rapid, multiplexed super-resolution tissue imaging. Immuno-SABER presents an effective and accessible platform for multiplexed and amplified imaging of proteins with high sensitivity and throughput."
https://openalex.org/W2969760455,"Chromatin architecture has been implicated in cell type-specific gene regulatory programs, yet how chromatin remodels during development remains to be fully elucidated. Here, by interrogating chromatin reorganization during human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation, we discover a role for the primate-specific endogenous retrotransposon human endogenous retrovirus subfamily H (HERV-H) in creating topologically associating domains (TADs) in hPSCs. Deleting these HERV-H elements eliminates their corresponding TAD boundaries and reduces the transcription of upstream genes, while de novo insertion of HERV-H elements can introduce new TAD boundaries. The ability of HERV-H to create TAD boundaries depends on high transcription, as transcriptional repression of HERV-H elements prevents the formation of boundaries. This ability is not limited to hPSCs, as these actively transcribed HERV-H elements and their corresponding TAD boundaries also appear in pluripotent stem cells from other hominids but not in more distantly related species lacking HERV-H elements. Overall, our results provide direct evidence for retrotransposons in actively shaping cell type- and species-specific chromatin architecture. Genetic deletion or transcriptional silencing of HERV-H elements in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) eliminates nearby topologically associating domain boundaries, while de novo insertion of HERV-H elements can introduce new ones. Mutations of specific HERV-H elements can impact hPSC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2967078590,"The clinical translation of cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been hindered by structural instability, proteolytic degradation and in vivo toxicity from nonspecific membrane lysis. Although analyses of hydrophobic content and charge distribution have informed the design of synthetic AMPs with increased potency and reduced in vitro hemolysis, nonspecific membrane toxicity in vivo continues to impede AMP drug development. Here, we analyzed a 58-member library of stapled AMPs (StAMPs) based on magainin II and applied the insights from structure–function–toxicity measurements to devise an algorithm for the design of stable, protease-resistant, potent and nontoxic StAMP prototypes. We show that a lead double-stapled StAMP named Mag(i+4)1,15(A9K,B21A,N22K,S23K) can kill multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, such as colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in a mouse peritonitis–sepsis model, without observed hemolysis or renal injury in murine toxicity studies. Inputting the amino acid sequences alone, we further generated membrane-selective StAMPs of pleurocidin, CAP18 and esculentin, highlighting the generalizability of our design platform. The authors designed stapled antimicrobial peptides that have potent antibacterial activity in mice and limited toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2969325194,"Recently much effort has been invested in using convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained on 3D structural images of protein-ligand complexes to distinguish binding from non-binding ligands for virtual screening. However, the dearth of reliable protein-ligand x-ray structures and binding affinity data has required the use of constructed datasets for the training and evaluation of CNN molecular recognition models. Here, we outline various sources of bias in one such widely-used dataset, the Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E). We have constructed and performed tests to investigate whether CNN models developed using DUD-E are properly learning the underlying physics of molecular recognition, as intended, or are instead learning biases inherent in the dataset itself. We find that superior enrichment efficiency in CNN models can be attributed to the analogue and decoy bias hidden in the DUD-E dataset rather than successful generalization of the pattern of protein-ligand interactions. Comparing additional deep learning models trained on PDBbind datasets, we found that their enrichment performances using DUD-E are not superior to the performance of the docking program AutoDock Vina. Together, these results suggest that biases that could be present in constructed datasets should be thoroughly evaluated before applying them to machine learning based methodology development."
https://openalex.org/W3102855971,"Most known terrestrial planets orbit small stars with radii less than 60% that of the Sun. Theoretical models predict that these planets are more vulnerable to atmospheric loss than their counterparts orbiting Sun-like stars. To determine whether a thick atmosphere has survived on a small planet, one approach is to search for signatures of atmospheric heat redistribution in its thermal phase curve. Previous phase curve observations of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e (1.9 Earth radii) showed that its peak brightness is offset from the substellar point $-$ possibly indicative of atmospheric circulation. Here we report a phase curve measurement for the smaller, cooler planet LHS 3844b, a 1.3 Earth radius world in an 11-hour orbit around a small, nearby star. The observed phase variation is symmetric and has a large amplitude, implying a dayside brightness temperature of $1040\pm40$ kelvin and a nightside temperature consistent with zero kelvin (at one standard deviation). Thick atmospheres with surface pressures above 10 bar are ruled out by the data (at three standard deviations), and less-massive atmospheres are unstable to erosion by stellar wind. The data are well fitted by a bare rock model with a low Bond albedo (lower than 0.2 at two standard deviations). These results support theoretical predictions that hot terrestrial planets orbiting small stars may not retain substantial atmospheres."
https://openalex.org/W2969861110,"Aberrations in genes coding for subunits of the BRG1/BRM associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes are highly abundant in human cancers. Currently, it is not understood how these mostly loss-of-function mutations contribute to cancer development and how they can be targeted therapeutically. The cancer-type-specific occurrence patterns of certain subunit mutations suggest subunit-specific effects on BAF complex function, possibly by the formation of aberrant residual complexes. Here, we systematically characterize the effects of individual subunit loss on complex composition, chromatin accessibility and gene expression in a panel of knockout cell lines deficient for 22 BAF subunits. We observe strong, specific and sometimes discordant alterations dependent on the targeted subunit and show that these explain intracomplex codependencies, including the synthetic lethal interactions SMARCA4-ARID2, SMARCA4-ACTB and SMARCC1-SMARCC2. These data provide insights into the role of different BAF subcomplexes in genome-wide chromatin organization and suggest approaches to therapeutically target BAF-mutant cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2969721268,"Many studies about classification and the functional annotation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are based on either the occurrence of long disordered regions or the fraction of disordered residues in the sequence. Taking into account both criteria we separate the human proteome, taken as a case study, into three variants of proteins: i) ordered proteins (ORDPs), ii) structured proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDPRs), and iii) intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The focus of this work is on the different functional roles of IDPs and IDPRs, which up until now have been generally considered as a whole. Previous studies assigned a large set of functional roles to the general category of IDPs. We show here that IDPs and IDPRs have non-overlapping functional spectra, play different roles in human diseases, and deserve to be treated as distinct categories of proteins. IDPs enrich only a few classes, functions, and processes: nucleic acid binding proteins, chromatin binding proteins, transcription factors, and developmental processes. In contrast, IDPRs are spread over several functional protein classes and GO annotations which they partly share with ORDPs. As regards to diseases, we observe that IDPs enrich only cancer-related proteins, at variance with previous results reporting that IDPs are widespread also in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies. Overall, the operational separation of IDPRs from IDPs is relevant towards correct estimates of the occurrence of intrinsically disordered proteins in genome-wide studies and in the understanding of the functional spectra associated to different flavors of protein disorder."

https://openalex.org/W2969495394,"Understanding the transcriptional changes that are engaged in stress resilience may reveal novel antidepressant targets. Here we use gene co-expression analysis of RNA-sequencing data from brains of resilient mice to identify a gene network that is unique to resilience. Zfp189, which encodes a previously unstudied zinc finger protein, is the highest-ranked key driver gene in the network, and overexpression of Zfp189 in prefrontal cortical neurons preferentially activates this network and promotes behavioral resilience. The transcription factor CREB is a predicted upstream regulator of this network and binds to the Zfp189 promoter. To probe CREB-Zfp189 interactions, we employ CRISPR-mediated locus-specific transcriptional reprogramming to direct CREB or G9a (a repressive histone methyltransferase) to the Zfp189 promoter in prefrontal cortex neurons. Induction of Zfp189 with site-specific CREB is pro-resilient, whereas suppressing Zfp189 expression with G9a increases susceptibility. These findings reveal an essential role for Zfp189 and CREB-Zfp189 interactions in mediating a central transcriptional network of resilience."

https://openalex.org/W2969743374,"The rodent hippocampus spontaneously generates bursts of neural activity (replay) that can depict spatial trajectories to reward locations, suggesting a role in model-based behavioral control. A largely separate literature emphasizes reward revaluation as the litmus test for such control, yet the content of hippocampal replay under revaluation conditions is unknown. We examined the content of awake replay events following motivational shifts between hunger and thirst. On a T-maze offering free choice between food and water outcomes, rats shifted their behavior toward the restricted outcome, but replay content was shifted away from the restricted outcome. This effect preceded experience on the task each day and did not reverse with experience. These results demonstrate that replay content is not limited to reflecting recent experience or trajectories toward the preferred goal and suggest a role for motivational states in determining replay content."
https://openalex.org/W2969257875,"Goals and methods A simulation study investigated how ceiling and floor effect (CFE) affect the performance of Welch’s t-test, F-test, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Scheirer-Ray-Hare-test, trimmed t-test, Bayesian t-test, and the “two one-sided tests” equivalence testing procedure. The effect of CFE on the estimate of group difference and on its confidence interval, and on Cohen’s d and on its confidence interval was also evaluated. In addition, the parametric methods were applied to data transformed with log or logit function and the performance was evaluated. The notion of essential maximum from abstract measurement theory is used to formally define CFE and the principle of maximum entropy was used to derive probability distributions with essential maximum/minimum. These distributions allow the manipulation of the magnitude of CFE through a parameter. Beta, Gamma, Beta prime and Beta-binomial distributions were obtained in this way with the CFE parameter corresponding to the logarithm of the geometric mean. Wald distribution and ordered logistic regression were also included in the study due to their measure-theoretic connection to CFE, even though these models lack essential minimum/maximum. Performance in two-group, three-group and 2 × 2 factor design scenarios was investigated by fixing the group differences in terms of CFE parameter and by adjusting the base level of CFE. Results and conclusions In general, bias and uncertainty increased with CFE. Most problematic were occasional instances of biased inference which became more certain and more biased as the magnitude of CFE increased. The bias affected the estimate of group difference, the estimate of Cohen’s d and the decisions of the equivalence testing methods. Statistical methods worked best with transformed data, albeit this depended on the match between the choice of transformation and the type of CFE. Log transform worked well with Gamma and Beta prime distribution while logit transform worked well with Beta distribution. Rank-based tests showed best performance with discrete data, but it was demonstrated that even there a model derived with measurement-theoretic principles may show superior performance. Trimmed t-test showed poor performance. In the factor design, CFE prevented the detection of main effects as well as the detection of interaction. Irrespective of CFE, F-test misidentified main effects and interactions on multiple occasions. Five different constellations of main effect and interactions were investigated for each probability distribution, and weaknesses of each statistical method were identified and reported. As part of the discussion, the use of generalized linear models based on abstract measurement theory is recommended to counter CFE. Furthermore, the necessity of measure validation/calibration studies to obtain the necessary knowledge of CFE to design and select an appropriate statistical tool, is stressed."

https://openalex.org/W2966997102,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the world's most deadly pathogen. Unlike less virulent mycobacteria, Mtb produces 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), an unusual terpene nucleoside of unknown function. In the present study 1-TbAd has been shown to be a naturally evolved phagolysosome disruptor. 1-TbAd is highly prevalent among patient-derived Mtb strains, where it is among the most abundant lipids produced. Synthesis of TbAd analogs and their testing in cells demonstrate that their biological action is dependent on lipid linkage to the 1-position of adenosine, which creates a strong conjugate base. Furthermore, C20 lipid moieties confer passage through membranes. 1-TbAd selectively accumulates in acidic compartments, where it neutralizes the pH and swells lysosomes, obliterating their multilamellar structure. During macrophage infection, a 1-TbAd biosynthesis gene (Rv3378c) confers marked phagosomal swelling and intraphagosomal inclusions, demonstrating an essential role in regulating the Mtb cellular microenvironment. Although macrophages kill intracellular bacteria through phagosome acidification, Mtb coats itself abundantly with antacid."

https://openalex.org/W2969590229,"Taurine, a nonprotein amino acid, is widely distributed in almost all animal tissues. Ingestion of taurine helps to improve obesity and its related metabolic disorders. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the protective role of taurine against obesity is not completely understood. In this study, it was found that intraperitoneal treatment of mice with taurine alleviated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis of the mice. Meanwhile, administration of the mice with taurine markedly induced the browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) with significantly elevated expression of PGC1α, UCP1, and other thermogenic genes in iWAT. In vitro studies indicated that taurine also induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in C3H10T1/2 white adipocytes. Knockdown of PGC1α blunted the role of taurine in promoting the brown-like adipocyte phenotypes in C3H10T1/2 cells. Moreover, taurine treatment enhanced AMPK phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, and knockdown of AMPKα1 prevented taurine-mediated induction of PGC1α in C3H10T1/2 cells. Consistently, specific knockdown of PGC1α in iWAT of the HFD-fed mice inhibited taurine-induced browning of iWAT, with the role of taurine in the enhancement of adaptive thermogenesis, the prevention of obesity, and the improvement of insulin sensitivity being partially impaired. These results reveal a functional role of taurine in facilitating the browning of white adipose tissue, which depends on the induction of PGC1α. Our studies also suggest a potential mechanism for the protective role of taurine against obesity, which involves taurine-mediated browning of white adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2969856745,"The commensal microbiota is one of the environmental triggers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recent studies have identified the characteristics of the gut microbiota in patients with RA. However, it is still unclear how the microbiota can be modulated to slow down disease progression. In the present study, berberine, a modulator of gut microbiota with substantial anti-RA effect, was chosen to explore the mechanisms by which the microbiota modulators ameliorate RA. The results showed that oral administration of berberine alleviated collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Berberine down-regulated the diversity and richness of the gut bacteria, reduced the abundance of Prevotella, and elevated the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in CIA rats as determined by the 16S rRNA gene sequence, which might function through limiting the generation of nitrate and stabilizing the physiologic hypoxia in the intestine. Moreover, berberine treatment significantly increased the intestinal butyrate level and promoted the expression and activity of butyryl-CoA:acetate-CoA transferase (BUT). The coadministration of a BUT inhibitor largely diminished the adjustment of intestinal environment and the antiarthritic effect of berberine. In conclusion, modulators of the gut microbiota might serve as therapeutic agents for RA by inducing the butyrate generation through promoting the expression and activity of BUT.-Yue, M., Tao, Y., Fang, Y., Lian, X., Zhang, Q., Xia, Y., Wei, Z., Dai, Y. The gut microbiota modulator berberine ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in rats by facilitating the generation of butyrate and adjusting the intestinal hypoxia and nitrate supply."
https://openalex.org/W2969938648,"Ischemic stroke has been shown to induce breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, although these changes are not fully characterized. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) has been used to investigate the effects of ischemia in cultured brain capillary endothelial cells, however this involves a change of medium which in itself may affect the cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of OGD and simple medium exchange followed by 48 h of reperfusion on barrier properties of primary bovine endothelial cells co-cultured with rat astrocytes. Barrier properties were evaluated by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements, passive permeability of flux markers, RT-qPCR and immunocytochemistry. Both OGD and simple medium exchange caused an increase in endothelial monolayer permeability. This correlated with reduced transcript levels of a number of tight junction and tight junction-associated proteins (claudin-1, claudin-5, occludin, ZO-1, tricellulin, marveld3 and PECAM-1), as well as with altered transcript level of several transporters and receptors (GLUT-1, HB-EGF, InsR, TfR, two members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, LDLR and LRP-1, and the efflux transporter BCRP). In contrast, effects induced specifically by OGD were transient de-localization of claudin-5 from the junction zone, increased InsR localization at the plasma membrane and transient downregulation of MRP-1 and P-gp transcript levels. In conclusion, OGD caused changes in claudin-5 and InsR localization, as well as in MRP-1 and P-gp transcript levels. Our results however also indicated that medium exchange alone caused changes in functional barrier properties and expression levels of wide range of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2969931139,"Background Despite improvements in mortality rates over the past several decades, cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the leading cause of death for African-Americans (AAs). Innovative approaches through mobile health (mHealth) interventions have the potential to support lifestyle change for CV disease prevention among AAs. We aimed to translate a behavioral theory–informed, evidence-based, face-to-face health education program into an mHealth lifestyle intervention for AAs. We describe the design and development of a culturally relevant, CV health and wellness digital application (app) and pilot testing using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach with AA churches. Methods This mixed methods study used a 4-phase iterative development process for intervention design with the AA community. Phase 1 included focus groups with AA community members and church partners (n = 23) to gain insight regarding potential app end user preferences. In Phase 2, the interdisciplinary research team synthesized Phase 1 input for preliminary app design and content development. Phase 3 consisted of a sequential 3-meeting series with church partners (n = 13) for iterative app prototyping (assessment, cultural tailoring, final review). Phase 4, a single group pilot study among AA church congregants (n = 50), assessed app acceptability, usability, and satisfaction. Results Phase 1 focus groups indicated general and health-related apps preferences: multifunctional, high-quality graphics/visuals, evidence-based, yet simple health information and social networking capability. Phase 2 integrated these preferences into the preliminary app prototype. Phase 3 feedback was used to refine the app prototype for pilot testing. Phase 4 pilot testing indicated high app acceptability, usability, and satisfaction. Conclusions This study illustrates integration of formative and CBPR approaches to design a culturally relevant, mHealth lifestyle intervention to address CV health disparities among AAs. Given the positive app perceptions, our study supports the use of an iterative development process by others interested in implementing an mHealth lifestyle intervention for racial/ethnic minority communities.

https://openalex.org/W2969815228,"Hallucinations, including auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), occur in both the healthy population and in psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia (often developing after a prodromal period). In addition, hallucinations can be in-context (they can be consistent with the environment, such as when one hallucinates the end of a sentence that has been repeated many times), or out-of-context (such as the bizarre hallucinations associated with schizophrenia). In previous work, we introduced a model of hallucinations as false (positive) inferences based on a (Markov decision process) formulation of active inference. In this work, we extend this model to include content-to disclose the computational mechanisms behind in- and out-of-context hallucinations. In active inference, sensory information is used to disambiguate alternative hypotheses about the causes of sensations. Sensory information is balanced against prior beliefs, and when this balance is tipped in the favor of prior beliefs, hallucinations can occur. We show that in-context hallucinations arise when (simulated) subjects cannot use sensory information to correct prior beliefs about hearing a voice, but beliefs about content (i.e. the sequential order of a sentence) remain accurate. When hallucinating subjects also have inaccurate beliefs about state transitions, out-of-context hallucinations occur; i.e. their hallucinated speech content is disordered. Note that out-of-context hallucinations in this setting does not refer to inference about context, but rather to false perceptual inference that emerges when the confidence in-or precision of-sensory evidence is reduced. Furthermore, subjects with inaccurate beliefs about state transitions but an intact ability to use sensory information do not hallucinate and are reminiscent of prodromal patients. This work demonstrates the different computational mechanisms that may underlie the spectrum of hallucinatory experience-from the healthy population to psychotic states."
https://openalex.org/W2969297570,"Background The general benefit of physical activity (PA) to one’s mental health has been widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, the specific type and amount of PA that associates with lower risk of depression in China awaits further investigation. The present study was conducted on middle- and older-aged Chinese population with two objectives: 1) to understand the patterns of PA; 2) to measure the associations between depression and PA at different levels from various aspects. Methods Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2015), we selected 9118 community residents aged 45 years and older. Depressive symptoms were measured by 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES-D 10). Multivariate logistic regression model was performed to examine the association between risk of depression and PA from four aspects including intensity, frequency, duration, and volume. Results Spending 1–2 days/week (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.91), less than 30 minutes each time (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.42, 1.03) or 150–299 min/week (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.87) on Moderate Physical Activity (MPA) was associated with lower odds of depression in women. Spending 3–5 days/week (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.05) or 6–7 days/week (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.11), 4 hours and longer each time (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.32), 300 min/week or longer (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.24) on Vigorous Physical Activity (VPA) in total, or 2250 Metabolic Equivalent of Task (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.38) on Moderate-to-Vigorous PA was associated with higher risk of depression in men. Conclusions The association between depression and PA depended largely on intensity and gender. Lower frequency, shorter duration, and moderate amount of MPA was associated with lower risk of depression in women. Risk of depression was higher in men who spent higher frequency, longer duration, and overlong time on VPA."
https://openalex.org/W2969327234,"Studies on changes in the prevalence and determinants of obesity in older adults living in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. We examined recent changes in obesity prevalence and associated factors for older adults in Ghana between 2007/08 and 2014/15.Data on adults aged 50 years and older in Ghana were drawn from the WHO SAGE 2007/08 (Wave 1; n = 4158) and 2014/15 (Wave 2; n = 1663). The weighted prevalence of obesity, overweight, normal weight and underweight, and of high central adiposity were compared in 2007/08 and 2014/15. Multinomial and binomial logistic regressions were used to examine whether the determinants of weight status based on objectively measured body mass index and waist circumference changed between the two time periods.The prevalence of overweight (2007/08 = 19.6%, 95% CI: 18.0-21.4%; 2014/15 = 24.5%, 95% CI: 21.7-27.5%) and obesity (2007/08 = 10.2%, 95% CI: 8.9-11.7%; 2014/15 = 15.0%, 95% CI: 12.6-17.7%) was higher in 2014/15 than 2007/08 and more than half of the population had high central adiposity (2007/08 = 57.7%, 95% CI: 55.4-60.1%; 2014/15 = 66.9%, 95% CI: 63.7-70.0%) in both study periods. While the prevalence of overweight increased in both sexes, obesity prevalence was 16% lower in males and 55% higher in females comparing 2007/08 to 2014/15. Female sex, urban residence, and high household wealth were associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity and high central adiposity. Those aged 70+ years had lower odds of obesity in both study waves. In 2014/15, females who did not meet the recommended physical activity were more likely to be obese.Over the 7-year period between the surveys, the prevalence of underweight decreased and overweight increased in both sexes, while obesity decreased in males but increased in females. The difference in obesity prevalence may point to differential impacts of past initiatives to reduce overweight and obesity, potential high-risk groups in Ghana, and the need to increase surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2969500280,"Background To enhance risk stratification for Wilms tumour (WT) in a pre-operative chemotherapy setting, we explored the prognostic significance and optimal age cutoffs in patients treated according to International Society of Paediatric Oncology Renal Tumour Study Group (SIOP-RTSG) protocols. Methods Patients(6 months-18 years) with unilateral WT were selected from prospective SIOP 93–01 and 2001 studies(1993–2016). Martingale residual analysis was used to explore optimal age cutoffs. Outcome according to age was analyzed by uni- and multivariable analysis, adjusted for sex, biopsy(yes/no), stage, histology and tumour volume at surgery. Results 5631 patients were included; median age was 3.4 years(IQR: 2–5.1). Estimated 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 85%(95%CI 83.5–85.5) and 93%(95%CI 92.0–93.4). Martingale residual plots detected no optimal age cutoffs. Multivariable analysis showed lower EFS with increasing age(linear trend P<0.001). Using previously described age categories, EFS was lower for patients aged 2-4(HR 1.34, P = 0.02), 4-10(HR 1.83, P<0.0001) and 10–18 years(HR 1.74, P = 0.01) as compared to patients aged 6 months-2 years. OS was lower for patients 4–10 years(HR 1.67, P = 0.01) and 10–18 years(HR 1.87, P = 0.04), but not for 2–4 years(HR 1.29, P = 0.23). Higher stage, histological risk group and tumour volume were independent adverse prognostic factors. Conclusion Although optimal age cutoffs could not be identified, we demonstrated the prognostic significance of age as well as previously described cutoffs for EFS (2 and 4 years) and OS (4 years) in children with WT treated with pre-operative chemotherapy. These findings encourage the consideration of age in the design of future SIOP-RTSG protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2969522584,"Although under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is declining in India, it is still high in a few selected states and among the scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) population of the country. This study re-examines the association between caste and under-five deaths in high focus Indian states following the implementation of the country's National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) program. In addition, we aim to quantify the contribution of socioeconomic determinants in explaining the gap in under-five death risk between the SC/ST population and non-SC/ST population in high focus states in India.Using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), we calculated the U5MR by applying a synthetic cohort probability approach. We applied a binary logistic regression model to examine the association of under-five deaths with the selected covariates. Further, we used Fairlie's decomposition technique to understand the relative contribution of socioeconomic variables on under-five death risk between the caste groups.In high focus Indian states, the under-five mortality risk between well-off and deprived caste children has declined in the post-NRHM period, indicating a positive impact in terms of reducing caste-based inequalities in the high focus states. Despite the reduction in under-five death risk, children belonging to the SC population experience higher mortality rates than children belonging to the non-SC/ST population from 1992 to 2016. Both macro level (district level mortality rates) and individual (regression analysis) analyses showed that children belonging to SCs experience the highest likelihood of dying before their fifth birthday. A decomposition analysis revealed that 83% of the caste-based gap in the under-five deaths is due to the distribution of women's level of educational attainment and household wealth between the SC/ST and non-SC/ST population. Program indicators such as place of birth and number of antenatal care (ANC) visit also contributed significantly to widening caste-based gaps in U5MR.The study indicates that there is still room to improve access to health facilities for mothers and children belonging to deprived caste groups in India.

Here, we report the roles of MUC13 in colonic tumorigenesis and tumor progression. High-MUC13 expression is associated with poor survival in two independent patient cohorts. In a comprehensive series of in vivo experiments, we identified a critical role for MUC13 in the development of this malignancy, by promoting survival and proliferation of tumor-initiating cells and driving an immunosuppressive environment that protects tumors from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. In Muc13-deficient mice, fewer tumors are generated after exposure to carcinogens and inflammation, they have markedly reduced β-catenin signaling, have more tumor-infiltrating CD103+ dendritic cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes, fewer myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and are rendered sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (anti-PD-L1). Mechanistically, we show that MUC13 protects β-catenin from degradation, by interacting with GSK-3β, which increases β-catenin nuclear translocation and promotes its signaling, thereby driving cancer initiation, progression, invasion, and immune suppression. Therefore, MUC13 is a potential marker of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, and inhibiting MUC13 may be useful in the treatment of colitis-associated cancer and sensitizing tumors to immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2969863665,"Background Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease that can occur in all warm-blooded animals, including humans. Vaccinating dogs can protect people from contracting rabies. Rabies is a public health threat in Rwanda, but the country does not have information on the epidemiology of rabies. The present study aimed to understand the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of rabies and its control among dog owners in Kigali city of Rwanda. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire among 137 dog owners selected from nine administrative study sites. A two-stage random sampling procedure was used to select the participants. Frequency distributions analysis and a series of chi-square tests of associations as well as binary logistic regressions were performed to determine the important factors associated with the response variables. Results The results showed that 99.5% of respondents knew at least a host susceptible to rabies. Only 22.4% and 21.3% knew that dogs and people can develop rabies, respectively. Nearly 73.6% knew that human rabies can be transmitted through dog-bites and 99% could identify at least a clinical sign of canine rabies. Overall, 81.8% knew that regular vaccination of dogs helps to prevent dog-transmitted human rabies and 43.1% and 26.3% were aware that rabies in humans and in dogs are fatal once clinical symptoms have shown, respectively. Only 69% would observe a dog for 10 days after it bites a man or an animal. Approximately 20.4% were familiar with appropriate cleaning of dog-bites wounds, and 20.6% knew that puppies could receive rabies vaccination before they are three months old. Of those who owned vaccinated dogs, 78% were happy about the cost (US $ ≤ 34) of rabies vaccination. Of all the respondents, 58% had their dogs vaccinated at home by veterinarians while 86% indicated their veterinarians kept rabies vaccines on ice in a cool box. Overall, 53% of the dog owners had sufficient knowledge of rabies, whilst 66% and 17% adopted adequate practices and positive attitudes towards rabies, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that none of the respondents’ sex, educational level, and the length of dog ownership were statistically associated with their knowledge, attitudes and practices of rabies. Conclusions This study showed that majority of the dog owners had sufficient knowledge and adopted appropriate practices of rabies. However there exist some knowledge gaps among the dog owners particularly on treatment, transmission and control methods. Therefore, rabies awareness campaign is required to upgrade rabies knowledge of the dog owners on rabies prevention and control in Rwanda."
https://openalex.org/W2969583714,"Pyrroloquinoline quinone is a prominent redox cofactor in many prokaryotes, produced from a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide PqqA via a pathway comprising four conserved proteins PqqB–E. These four proteins are now fairly well-characterized and span radical SAM activity (PqqE), aided by a peptide chaperone (PqqD), a dual hydroxylase (PqqB), and an eight-electron, eight-proton oxidase (PqqC). A full description of this pathway has been hampered by a lack of information regarding a protease/peptidase required for the excision of an early, cross-linked di-amino acid precursor to pyrroloquinoline quinone. Herein, we isolated and characterized a two-component heterodimer protein from the α-proteobacterium Methylobacterium (Methylorubrum) extorquens that can rapidly catalyze cleavage of PqqA into smaller peptides. Using pulldown assays, surface plasmon resonance, and isothermal calorimetry, we demonstrated the formation of a complex PqqF/PqqG, with a KD of 300 nm. We created a molecular model of the heterodimer by comparison with the Sphingomonas sp. A1 M16B Sph2681/Sph2682 protease. Analysis of time-dependent patterns for the appearance of proteolysis products indicates high specificity of PqqF/PqqG for serine side chains. We hypothesize that PqqF/PqqG initially cleaves between the PqqE/PqqD-generated cross-linked form of PqqA, with nonspecific cellular proteases completing the release of a suitable substrate for the downstream enzyme PqqB. The finding of a protease that specifically targets serine side chains is rare, and we propose that this activity may be useful in proteomic analyses of the large family of proteins that have undergone post-translational phosphorylation at serine.

https://openalex.org/W2969815678,"The corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), preferentially oviposits and feeds on ears of corn (Zea mays L.) and can be managed using transgenic hybrids that produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Concentrations of Bt proteins can vary spatially and temporally in plant tissues, creating a heterogeneous environment that can increase the risk of resistance development. We planted small-plot trials of nine Bt and non-Bt corn hybrids in South Carolina in 2016 and 2017 and investigated the development, survival, feeding injury, and feeding behavior in corn ear tissues. ELISA was used to quantify the concentrations of Cry1F and Cry2Ab2 in young silk, old silk, maternal tip tissue, kernels, and husk. Cry1F and Cry2Ab2 significantly varied with silk age and both proteins were generally highest in the silk and tip tissue. Hybrids with pyramided proteins significantly reduced feeding injury to the silk, tip, and kernel ear tissues, which was less apparent with single Bt protein hybrids. The pyramided hybrid expressing Vip3A incurred no injury to either the ear tip or kernels, and only eight 1st instar larvae were collected in the silk of 520 sampled ears. Age of larvae significantly varied among ear tissues but not between hybrids. Depending on hybrid family, mean larval instar in the silk, tip, and kernels was 1st or 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, respectively. Instar-specific feeding penetrance into corn ears increased with age but did not differ between hybrids. We characterized the instar- and tissue-specific feeding behavior of H. zea larvae but did not detect differences in feeding behavior between Bt and non-Bt hybrids. Implications for resistance management strategies such as seed mixtures are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2969623925,"Wetlands are one of the most critical resources in Inner Mongolia Plateau. However, the region has experienced severe wetland loss in the context of global change. To quantify the dynamic change and the related driving forces, we extracted wetland information using multi-temporal Landsat images between 1993 and 2013 using ArcGIS platform and man-machine interactive interpretation. Dynamically changing characteristics for the past 20 years were analyzed, including wetland types and spatial distribution patterns of the wetlands in Inner Mongolia. We also performed correlation analysis and generalized linear models to quantify the contribution of natural and human factors to the changes in natural wetland area. Our results indicated that the total area of wetlands was 42421.2 km2 in 1993, and decreased to 38912.4 km2 in 2013, a decline ratio of 8.3%. Meanwhile, all types of wetlands showed a trend of transformation into non-wetlands. Anthropogenic factors led to the loss of natural wetlands in Inner Mongolia. In grasslands, mining coal was the dominant driver for natural wetland loss, while in arable lands, agricultural encroachment and irrigation were the primary driving forces. These findings can provide meaningful information for improving sustainable wetlands management strategies according to local conditions in different sub-regions."
https://openalex.org/W2969568884,"The pathophysiological mechanisms of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction are largely unknown. The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is expressed in cardiac myocytes and is involved in bacterial endotoxin-mediated inflammatory disorders. TLR4 signaling leads to activation of the nuclear factor kappa B followed by increased expression of cytokines. Several protein phosphatases including PP2Cβ, PP2A or PP1 are known to act as regulators of this signaling pathway. Here, we examined the role of PP5 for the inflammatory response to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide in the heart using a transgenic mouse model with cardiac myocyte directed overexpression of PP5. In these transgenic mice, basal cardiac contractility was reduced, in vivo as well as in vitro, but LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction was less pronounced compared to wild type mice. Quantitative RT-PCR suggested an attenuated NF-κB signaling in the heart and cardiac expression of heat shock protein 25 (HSP25) was increased in PP5 transgenic mice. From our data we assume that PP5 increases stress tolerance of cardiac myocytes by downregulation of NF-κB signaling and upregulation of HSP25 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2969936238,"Many studies on collective animal behavior seek to identify the individual rules that underlie collective patterns. However, it was not until the recent advancements of micro-electronic and embedded systems that scientists were able to create mixed groups of sensor-rich robots and animals and study collective interactions from the within a bio-hybrid group. In recent work, scientists showed that a robot-controlled lure is capable of influencing the collective decisions of zebrafish Danio rerio shoals moving in a ring and a two-room setup. Here, we study a closely related topic, that is, the collective behavior patterns that emerge when different behavioral models are reproduced through the use of a robotic lure. We design a behavioral model that alternates between obeying and disobeying the collective motion decisions in order to become socially accepted by the shoal members. Subsequently, we compare it against two extreme cases: a reactive and an imposing decision model. For this, we use spatial, directional and information theoretic metrics to measure the degree of integration of the robotic agent. We show that our model leads to similar information flow as in freely roaming shoals of zebrafish and exhibits leadership skills more often than the open-loop models. Thus, in order for the robot to achieve higher degrees of integration in the zebrafish shoal, it must, like any other shoal member, be bidirectionally involved in the decision making process. These findings provide insight on the ability to form mixed societies of animals and robots and yield promising results on the degree to which a robot can influence the collective decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2968347939,"Objective The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of four different crank fore-aft positions on elbow flexion and shoulder protraction, the consequent propulsion kinetics and the physiological responses during handcycling. Methods Twelve able-bodied male participants volunteered in this study. Crank fore-aft positions were standardised at 94%, 97%, 100% and 103% of the participants’ arm length. Two submaximal 3 min trials were performed at a fixed cadence (70 rpm), in a recumbent handcyle attached to an ergometer at two fixed power outputs (30W and 60W). Elbow flexion, shoulder protraction, propulsion kinetics and physiological responses of the participants were continuously measured. Results As crank fore-aft distance increased, a decrease in elbow flexion (42±4, 37±3, 33±3, 29±3°) and an increase shoulder protraction was observed (29±5, 31±5, 34±5, 36±5°). The percentage of work done in the pull phase increased as well (62±7, 65±7, 67±6, 69±8%, at 60W), which was in line with an increased peak torque during the pull phase (8.8±1.6, 9.0±1.4, 9.4±1.5, 9.7±1.4Nm, at 60W) and reduced peak torque during the push phase (6.0±0.9, 5.6±0.9,5.6±0.9, 5.4±1.0Nm, in 60W condition). Despite these changes in work distribution, there were no significant changes in gross mechanical efficiency (15.7±0.8, 16.2±1.1, 15.8±0.9, 15.6±1.0%, at 60W). The same patterns were observed in the 30W condition. Conclusions From a biomechanical perspective the crank position closest to the trunk (94%) seems to be advantageous, because it evens the load over the push and pull phase, which reduces speed fluctuations, without causing an increase in whole body energy expenditure and hence a decrease of gross mechanical efficiency. These findings may help handcyclists to optimize their recumbent handcycle configuration."

To find potential insecticidal resources is always important. As an environmentally friendly compound, aconitine exhibits potential pesticide features. In the present study, the pesticide and knockdown effects of aconitine were first tested on the brown planthopper. The results showed that the knockdown rates for an aconitine concentration of 200 ppm was 83.6%. The insecticidal LD50 was 22.68 ng/pest (95% CI, 17.75–28.99). The molecular mechanisms responding to aconitine application were analyzed through transcriptional sequencing. Compared to that of the knockdown nymphs of the brown planthoppers, the enzymes CYP3A4, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), GST, carboxylesterase (EC3.1.1.1), and GABAergic synapse were up-regulated. We inferred that aconitine might be neurotoxic to the brown planthoppers, and the conscious nymphs resist the drug neurotoxicity through the upregulation of CYP3A4, UGT, and GABA receptor mutation. Although aconitine is not safe for mammals, it may be a leading compound to develop novel insecticides."

However, this family has not been systemically investigated in Brassica rapa. Here, a genome-wide systemic analysis of SOT genes in B. rapa subsp. pekinensis, a globally cultivated vegetable, were conducted. We identified 56 SOT genes from the whole B. rapa genome using Arabidopsis SOT sequences as queries and classified them into nine groups, rather than the eight groups of previous research. 56 B. rapa SOT genes (BraSOTs) were distributed on all 10 chromosomes except for chromosome 5. Of these, 27 BraSOTs were distributed in seven clusters on five chromosomes (ChrA01, ChrA02, Chr03, ChrA07, and Chr09). Among the BraSOT proteins, 48 had only one SOT_1 domain and 6 had two, while 2 had one SOT_3 domain. Additionally, 47 BraSOT proteins contained only known SOT domains. The remaining nine proteins, five in group-VIII and two in group-IX, contained additional transmembrane domains. Specific motif regions I and IV for 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate binding were found in 41 BraSOT proteins. Introns were present in only 18 BraSOT genes, and all seven BraSOT genes in groups VIII and IX had more than three introns. To identify crucial SOTs mediating the response to abiotic stress in B. rapa, expression changes in 56 BraSOT genes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR after drought, salinity, and ABA treatments, and some BraSOT genes were associated with NaCl, drought and ABA stress, e.g. Bra017370, Bra009300, Bra027880."

Isolates were tested for drug resistance against rifampin and isoniazid using the MTBDRplus assay. Results were compared with conventional drug-susceptibility testing and the frequency of specific mutations were reported.The MTBDRplus assay had a sensitivity for rifampin resistance of 98.8% (95% CI: 93.4-100) and for isoniazid resistance of 90.6% (95% CI: 83.0-95.6). The MTBDRplus assay showed mutations in rpoB in 81 of the 96 (84.4%) isolates. Of the 87 isolates showing resistance to isoniazid via the MTBDRplus assay, 71 (74.0%) isolates had mutations in the katG gene only, 15 (15.6%) isolates had mutations in the inhA promoter region, and 1 (1.0%) showed mutations in both genes.The GenoType MTBDRplus assay in Pakistan can identify subgroups at high-risk of having isolates with mutations in the katG and/or inhA genes.

https://openalex.org/W2969954927,"Ceratopteris thalictroides, a model fern, has two kinds of gametophytes with different sex expression: male and hermaphrodite. Hermaphroditic gametophytes have one or several archegonia beneath the growing point and a few antheridia at the base or margin. Male gametophytes show a spoon-like shape with much longer than the width and produce many antheridia at the margin and surface. The results of chlorophyll fluorescence detection showed that the photochemical efficiency of hermaphrodites was higher than that of males. By using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, the differentially abundant proteins in hermaphroditic and male gametophytes were identified. A total of 1136 ± 55 protein spots were detected in Coomassie-stained gels of proteins from hermaphroditic gametophytes, and 1130 ± 65 spots were detected in gels of proteins from male gametophytes. After annotation, 33 spots representing differentially abundant proteins were identified. Among these, proteins involved in photosynthesis and chaperone proteins were over-represented in hermaphrodites, whereas several proteins involved in metabolism were increased in male gametophytes in order to maintain their development under relatively nutritionally deficient conditions. Furthermore, the differentially abundant cytoskeletal proteins detected in this study, such as centrin and actin, may be involved in the formation of sexual organs and are directly related to sex expression. These differentially abundant proteins are important for maintaining the development of gametophytes of different sexes in C. thalictroides."

However, few research simultaneously use heterogenous features, which are embedded in the time series data. In this paper, a two route convolution neural network TRHD-CNN model, fed with two types of heterogeneous feature matrices, is proposed for classifying the bank accounts. TRHD-CNN adopts divide and conquer strategy to extract characteristics from two types of data source independently. The strategy is proved able in mining complementary classification characteristics. We firstly transfer the original log data into a directed and dynamic transaction network. On the basis of that, two feature generation methods are devised for extracting information from local topological structure and time series transaction respectively. A DirectedWalk method is developed in this paper to learning the network vector of vertices used for embedding the neighbor relationship of bank account. The extensive experimental results, conducted on a real bank transaction dataset that contains illegal pyramid selling accounts, show the significant advantage of TRHD-CNN over the existing methods. TRHD-CNN can provide recall scores up to 5.15% higher than competing methods. In addition, the two-route architecture of TRHD-CNN is easy to extend to multi-route scenarios and other fields."

Therefore, we retrospectively investigated the association between the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM)-DIC score and mortality in patients with acute exacerbation of fibrosing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (AE-fIIP).Between January 2008 and December 2016, consecutive patients with chronic fIIP who were admitted for the first time for AE-fIIP were recruited into the study. Associations between clinical data and JAAM-DIC score at the time of admission and mortality were examined.During the study period, a total of 91 patients with fIIP (73.0±8.4 y.o.) were hospitalized for AE-fIIP for the first time. The 30-day and hospital mortality were 8.7% and 17.5%, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that the JAAM-DIC score on admission was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidential interval [CI] 1.50-4.40, P = 0.0006). The APACHE II score (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.63, P = 0.03) and the JAAM-DIC score (OR 3.47, 95% CI 1.73-6.94, P = 0.0004) were independent predictors of hospital mortality.The JAAM-DIC scoring system can predict survival in patients with AE-fIIP.

https://openalex.org/W2969984701,"JMJD6 is a member of the Jumonji C domain containing enzymes that demethylate and/or hydroxylate substrate proteins. It is a multi-functional protein that has been implicated in disparate aspects of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression, including but not limited to enhancer and promoter binding, release of paused RNA polymerase II, control of splicing, and interaction with the translation machinery. JMJD6 contributes to multiple aspects of animal development, including adipogenesis modeled in culture. We mutated proposed or characterized domains in the JMJD6 protein to better understand the requirement for JMJD6 in adipogenic differentiation. Mutation of JMJD6 amino acids that mediate binding of iron and 2-oxogluterate, which are required cofactors for enzymatic activity, had no impact on JMJD6 function, showing that catalytic activity is not required for JMJD6 contributions to adipogenic differentiation. In addition, we documented the formation of JMJD6 oligomers and showed that catalytic activity is not required for oligomerization, as has been reported previously. We also observed no effect of mutations in the sumoylation site and in the poly-serine stretch. In contrast, mutation of the AT hook-like structure, which mediates interaction with DNA and/or RNA, compromised JMJD6 function by blocking its ability to interact with chromatin at genes that express regulators of adipogenesis. The ability of JMJD6 to interact with nucleic acids may be a critical requirement for its function in adipogenic differentiation. The requirement for the AT hook-like domain and the lack of requirement for catalytic activity giving rise to the idea that co-activation of transcription by JMJD6 may be functioning as a scaffold protein that supports the interactions of other critical regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2967072015,"The ligands for the natural killer group 2 (NKG2D) protein render tumor cells susceptible to NKG2D-dependent immune cell attack. However, cancer cells escape from immune surveillance by downregulating NKG2D ligands. We previously discovered that engagement of activated CD8+ T cells and tumor cells induces NKG2D ligands on tumor cells, but the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. Both in vivo mouse tumor models and in vitro cell assays were performed to study the downstream signaling. Our results supported the notion that, upon engagement with the cognate receptors, CD137 ligand and CD40 initiates activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in tumor cells even in the absence of CD8+ T cells. Like tumor and CD8+ T cell contact-dependent NKG2D ligand induction, this CD137L/CD40-mediated signaling activation was associated with elevated levels of acetyltransferase P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), whereas inhibition of phosphorylated NF-κB abrogated PCAF induction. Although stimulation of CD137L/CD40-mediated signaling is vital, inflammatory cytokines, including interferon gamma (IFNγ) and TNFα, also facilitate NKG2D ligand-induced immune surveillance via both facilitating T-cell chemotaxis and CD137L/CD40 induced NF-κB/PCAF activation. Collectively, our results unveil a novel mechanism of NKG2D ligand upregulation involving reverse signaling of CD40 and CD137L on tumor cells which, along with inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα, stimulate downstream NF-κB and PCAF activation. Understanding this mechanism may help in development of induced NKG2D ligand-dependent T-cell therapy against cancers."

This study examined and compared user-types and trends in dispensing of these medicines, and identified associated factors related to the duration of dispensing in Australia.A random 10% sample of unit-record data of opioids and benzodiazepines dispensed nationally during 2013-2016 was analyzed. Users were categorized into four types: single-quarter (i.e., three months), medium-episodic (dispensed 2-6 quarters), long-episodic (dispensed 7-11 quarters), chronic (dispensed 12-16 quarters). Dispensing quantity was computed in defined daily dose (DDD). Generalized multilevel ordinal models were developed to examine the factors associated with the duration of dispensing.There were similarities in terms of trends of dispensing of opioids and benzodiazepines in Australia. Overall, more people were dispensed opioids than benzodiazepines. Around 52% of opioids users and 46% of benzodiazepines users were dispensed these medicines for a single quarter. However, chronic users were dispensed 60% of opioids and 50% of benzodiazepines in DDD/1000 people/day, respectively. On average, 16.6 DDD/1000 people/day of opioids and 14.2 DDD/1000 people/day of benzodiazepines were dispensed in Australia during the study period. Tasmania was dispensed the highest quantity (in DDD/1000 people/day) of these medicines, followed by South Australia and Queensland. Women compared to men, and clients of age-group 20-44, 45-64 and 65+ compared to age-group 0-19, were significantly more likely to have dispensed opioids/benzodiazepine for a relatively long duration. Clients with a history of dispensing of one of these two medicines were significantly more likely to have dispensed the other for a relatively long period.There were similarities in patterns of dispensing of opioids and benzodiazepines in terms of user characteristics and structural variables.

https://openalex.org/W2969604672,"Smoking cigarettes and low socioeconomic status (SES) are both related to impaired cognition. However, it is unknown whether people of lower SES, who comprise most tobacco smokers worldwide, are more susceptible to cognitive impairment associated with smoking. In this non-randomized, cross-sectional study we investigated the effects of cigarette smoking, SES and their interaction on dissociable executive or “cool” and “hot” measures of behavioural self-regulation. Participants (n = 80) were selected among young physically and mentally healthy smokers and non-smokers who had graduated high school and were from different SES backgrounds. Cool self-regulation was measured by executive function tasks that tap inhibition, updating, shifting, dual tasking, planning, access to long-term memory (semantic fluency), and working memory capacity. Hot measures assessed self-reported impulsivity, delay discounting and risk taking. Exposure to tobacco (cotinine, exhaled carbon monoxide, tobacco dependence, cigarette consumption) was assessed to determine to what extent it mediated the cognitive effects of smoking. Nicotine abstinence and its acute effects were controlled, as were sex, age, schooling, and psychiatric symptoms despite the fact that smokers and non-smokers were selected as being as similar as possible in these demographic characteristics. Lower SES (less years of parental schooling) was associated with worse performance on tasks that measured all cool domains except dual tasking and fluency, while smoking status was related to impaired delayed discounting and impulsivity (hot domains), effects that were not mediated by tobacco exposure. Smoking and SES, however, did not interact. In short, impaired performance in measures of most cool skills was associated with SES irrespective of smoking status; in contrast, regardless of SES, smokers showed specific impairment in hot self-regulation domains (more difficulty resisting immediate temptations and weighing future consequences of actions). Possible explanations for the lack of mediation of tobacco exposure on hot skills of smokers are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2969814968,"Gene expression analysis of rare or heterogeneous cell populations such as disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) requires a sensitive method allowing reliable analysis of single cells. Therefore, we developed and explored the feasibility of a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to analyze single-cell cDNA pre-amplified using a previously established whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) protocol. We carefully selected and optimized multiple steps of the protocol, e.g. re-amplification of WTA products, quantification of amplified cDNA yields and final qPCR quantification, to identify the most reliable and accurate workflow for quantitation of gene expression of the ERBB2 gene in DCCs. We found that absolute quantification outperforms relative quantification. We then validated the performance of our method on single cells of established breast cancer cell lines displaying distinct levels of HER2 protein. The different protein levels were faithfully reflected by transcript expression across the tested cell lines thereby proving the accuracy of our approach. Finally, we applied our method to breast cancer DCCs of a patient undergoing anti-HER2-directed therapy. Here, we were able to measure ERBB2 expression levels in all HER2-protein-positive DCCs. In summary, we developed a reliable single-cell qPCR assay applicable to measure distinct levels of ERBB2 in DCCs."
