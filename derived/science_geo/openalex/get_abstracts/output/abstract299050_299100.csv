https://openalex.org/W2086318790,"Many Landsat images of Antarctica show distinctive flow and crevasse features in the floating part of ice streams and outlet glaciers immediately below their grounding zones. Some of the features, which move with the glacier or ice stream, remain visible over many years and thus allow time-lapse measurements of ice velocities. Measurements taken from Landsat images of features on Byrd Glacier agree well with detailed ground and aerial observations. The satellite-image technique thus offers a rapid and cost-effective method of obtaining average velocities, to a first order of accuracy, of many ice streams and outlet glaciers near their termini."
https://openalex.org/W2088647821,"The first 5 years (from 1980 to 1985) of total solar irradiance observations by the first Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM I) experiment on board the Solar Maximum Mission spacecraft show a clearly defined downward trend of -0.019% per year. The existence of this trend has been confirmed by the internal self-calibrations of ACRIM I, by independent measurements from sounding rockets and balloons, and by observations from the Nimbus-7 spacecraft. The trend appears to be due to unpredicted variations of solar luminosity on time scales of years, and it may be related to solar cycle magnetic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1971687062,"Pioneer Venus in situ measurements made with the retarding potential analyzer reveal strong variations in the nightside ionospheric plasma density from location to location in some orbits and from orbit to orbit. The ionopause is evident at night as a relatively abrupt decrease in the thermal plasma concentration from a few hundred to ten or fewer ions per cubic centimeter. The nightside ion and electron temperatures above an altitude of 250 kilometers, within the ionosphere and away from the terminator, are comparable in magnitude and have a value at the ionopause of approximately 8000 K. The electron temperature increases from a few tens of thousands of degrees Kelvin just outside the ionopause to several hundreds of thoussands of degrees Kelvin further into the shocked solar wind. The coldest ion temperatures measured at an altitude of about 145 kilometers are 140 to 150 K and are still evidently above the neutral temperature. Preliminary day-and nightside model ion and electron temperature height profiles are compared with measured profiles. To raise the model ion temperature to the measured ion temperature on both day-and nightsides, it was necessary to include an ion energy source of the order of 4 x 10(-3) erg per square centimeter per second, presumably Joule heating. The heat flux through the electron gas from the solar wind into the neutral atmosphere averaged over day and night may be as large as 0.05 erg per square centimeter per second. Integrated over the planet surface, this heat flux represents one-tenth of the solar wind energy expended in drag on the sunward ionopause hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2082688773,"It is shown that whistler mode waves from the ionosheath of Venus are absorbed by Landau damping at the dayside ionosphere boundary. This process heats the ionospheric electrons and it may provide an important energy input into the dayside ionosphere. Cyclotron damping of the waves does not occur in the same region. However, Landau damping of ionosheath waves is apparently not an important energy source in the nightside ionosphere. Impulsive events in the nightside ionosphere seem to fall into two classes: (i) lightning signals (near periapsis) and (ii) noise, which may be caused by gradient or current instabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2049658526,"Direct measurements of public opinion about national affairs appear with increasing frequency in all of the mass media. While such survey results are often flagged with statements as to expected error margins, discrepancies between multiple surveys in the news at the same time on what seem to be the same topics may convince casual consumers that such error margins must be considerably understated. A brief review of the several sources of variability and fixed bias in such surveys provides a clearer frame of reference for the evaluation of such data."
https://openalex.org/W2042310246,"The programs discussed above show how microcomputers have added to the arsenal of systematic biologists. This is a rapidly developing field, and there are no doubt major changes on the horizon. Swofford is working on a new version of PAUP that will have some of the interactive features of MacClade (and will not require a math coprocessor) and there are efforts under way to make PAUP available on Macintosh. PHYLIP has undergone a steady evolution since its release, and Felsenstein has plans to continue that policy. A microcomputer descendant of the large mainframe program PHYSYS, authored by James S. Farris, is supposed to be forthcoming before the end of the year. Just as this review was being completed, J. Rohlf and R. Sokal of the State University of New York at Stony Brook unveiled a beta-test microcomputer version of their phenetic program package, NT-SYS. Inasmuch as it was not in release form and does not include algorithms specifically designed to do phylogenetic analysis, it has not been included here (although some phenetic techniques, such as UPGMA, produce results similar to parsimony trees under certain assumptions)."
https://openalex.org/W4245771577,"Initial observations by the Pioneer Venus magnetometer on the nightside of Venus frequently reveal moderately strong fields from 20 to 30 nanoteslas. However, there is little evidence that thesefields arise from an internal dynamo since they are mainly horizontal and vary from orbit to orbit. Determining a precise upper limit to the intrinsic moment awaits further processing. This limit is expected to be much less than 10(22) gauss-cubic centimeters."
https://openalex.org/W1996356515,"Additional plasma measurements in the vicinity of Venus are presented which show that (i) there are three distinct plasma electron populations-solar wind electrons, ionosheath electrons, and nightside ionosphere electrons; (ii) the plasma ion flow pattern in the ionosheath is consistent with deflected flow around a blunt obstacle; (iii) the plasma ion flow velocities near the downstream wake may, at times, be consistent with the deflection of plasma into the tail, closing the solar wind cavity downstream from Venus at a relatively close distance (within 5 Venus radii) to the planet; (iv) there is a separation between the inner boundary of the downstream ionosheath and the upper boundary of the nightside ionosphere; and (v) during the first 4.5 months in orbit the measured solar wind plasma speed continued to vary, showing a number of high-speed, but generally nonrecurrent, streams."
https://openalex.org/W2031317913,"The major photochemical sources and sinks for ten of the ions measured by the ion mass spectrometer on the Pioneer Venus bus and orbiter spacecraft that are consistent with the neutral gas composition measured on the same spacecraft have been identified. The neutral gas temperature (Tn) as a function of solar zenith angle (chi) derived from measured ion distributions in photochemical equilibrium is given by Tn (K) = 323 cos(1/5)chi. Above 200 kilometers, the altitude behavior of ions is generally controlled by plasma diffusion, with important modifications for minor ions due to thermal diffusion resulting from the observed gradients of plasma temperatures. The dayside equilibrium distributions of ions are sometimes perturbed by plasma convection, while lateral transport of ions from the dayside seems to be a major source of the nightside ionosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2037699626,"In situ nightside electric field observations from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter have been interpreted as evidence of extensive lightning in the lower atmosphere of Venus. The scenario, including proposed evidence of clustering of lightning over surface highland regions, has encouraged the acceptance of currently active volcanic output as part of several investigations of the dynamics and chemistry of the atmosphere and the geology of the planet. However, the correlation between the 100-hertz electric field events attributed to lightning and nightside ionization troughs resulting from the interaction of the solar wind with the ionosphere indicates that the noise results from locally generated plasma instabilities and not from any behavior of the lower atmosphere. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial distribution of the noise shows that it is not clustered over highland topography, but rather occurs at random throughout the latitude and longitude regions sampled by the orbiter during the first 5 years of operation, from 1978 to 1984. Thus the electric field observations do not identify lightning and do not provide a basis for inferring the presence of currently active volcanic output. In the absence of known evidence to the contrary, it appears that Venus is no longer active."
https://openalex.org/W2078899560,"Datafrom the Pioneer Venus ion mass spectrometers are compared with model calculations of the ion density distributions appropriate for daytime conditions. The model assumes diffusive equilibrium upper boundary conditions for the major ions (O(2)(+), O(+), CO(2)(+), He(+), and H(+)); the agreement between the calculated and measured gross behavior of these ions is reasonably good except for H(+), which may be influenced strongly by convective transport processes. The distributions of five minor ions (C(+), N(+), NO(+), CO(+), and N(2)(+)) are also calculated for the chemically controlled region ( less, similar 200 kilometers); the agreements are, in general, poor, an indication that our present understanding of the Venus minor ion chemistry is still incomplete."

https://openalex.org/W2083975647,"The Pioneer Venus orbiter gamma burst detector is an astrophysics experiment for monitoring cosmic gamma-ray bursts. It is included in this planetary mission to provide a long baseline for accurately locating the sources of these bursts in order to identify them with specific astronomical objects. Responses to 14 gammaray burst events were examined; these events were verified from data acquired by other systems. Preliminary locations are proposed for three events, based on data from the Pioneer Venus orbiter, ISEE C, and Vela spacecraft. These locations will be improved, and additional locations will be determined by including in the analyses data from Helios B and the Russian Venera 11, Venera 12, and Prognoz 7 spacecraft."
