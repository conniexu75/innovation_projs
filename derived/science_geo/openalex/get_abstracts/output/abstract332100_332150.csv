https://openalex.org/W1964664772,"Molecular-based magnets with high magnetic-ordering temperatures, Tc, can be obtained by mild chemistry methods by focusing on the bimetallic and mixed-valence transition metal μ-cyanide of the Prussian blue family. A simple orbital model was used to predict the electronic structure of the metal ions required to achieve a high ordering temperature. The synthesis and magnetic properties of two compounds, [Cr5(CN)12]⋅10H2O and Cs0.75 [Cr2.125(CN)6]⋅5H2O, which exhibited magnetic-ordering temperatures of 240 and 190 kelvin, respectively, are reported, together with the strategy for further work."
https://openalex.org/W1999764847,"Natural climatic fluctuations, even those of recent years, cover a considerable range. They can be characterized as a ""noise"" spectrum which masks possible global effects of man-caused increases of atmospheric CO(2) and particulates. Local modifications, either deliberate or inadvertent, measurably affect the microclimate. Some artificial alterations of the microlimate are beneficial in agriculture. Among the unplanned effects, those produced by urbanization on local temperature and on wind field are quite pronounced. The influences on rainfall are still somewhat controversial, but effects may extend considerably beyond the confines of metropolitan areas. They are the result of water vapor released by human activity and of the influence of condensation and freezing nuclei produced in overabundance by motor vehicles and other combustion processes. Therefore it appears that on the local scale man-made influences on climate are substantial but that on the global scale natural forces still prevail. Obviously this should not lead to complacency. The potential for anthropogenic changes of climate on a larger and even a global scale is real. At this stage activation of an adequate worldwide monitoring system to permit early assessment of these changes is urgent. This statement applies particularly to the surveillance of atmospheric composition and radiation balance at sites remote from concentrations of population, which is now entirely inadequate. In my opinion, man-made aerosols, because of their optical properties and possible influences on cloud and precipitation processes, constitute a more acute problem than CO(2). Many of their effects are promptly reversible; hence, one should strive for elimination at the source. Over longer intervals, energy added to the atmosphere by heat rejection and CO(2) absorption remain matters of concern."

Increasing amounts of chlorophyll were found to be associated with a relative decrease in the blue portion of the spectra and an increase in the green. Anomalies in the spectra show that factors other than chlorophyll also affect the water color in some instances; these factors include other biochromes, suspended sediment, surface reflection, polarization, and air light."
https://openalex.org/W2038638944,"Coral skeletons are constructed of aragonitic crystals organized into fan systems. A theoretical model for the growth of such fan systems, which depends upon competition between crystals for space in which to grow, is corroborated by vital staining with sodium alizarinesulfonate. Fan systems of crystals compete with each other to form larger fan systems until large, relatively stable fans are produced. It is these relatively stable fan systems that have been observed in optical thin sections of coral skeletons."
https://openalex.org/W1972526002,"The hindrance effect on the aqueous diffusion rate of solutes within membrane pores of molecular size has been accurately determined. Mica membranes, 3 to 5 micrometers thick, were prepared with uniform, straight pores from 90 to 600 angstroms in diameter. With these membranes a direct estimation was possible of the interaction between pore size and molecular diffusion rates. There were no uncertainties due to wide pore size distributions or nonuniform tortuous channels as in previously used model microporous materials such as dialysis tubing or gels. Aqueous diffusion rates through these mica membranes were measured for a series of compounds with molecular diameters from 5.2 to 43 angstroms and were corrected for ""liquid film resistances"" adjacent to the membrane-solution interface to obtain estimates of molecular diffusivities within the micropores of the membrane. Definite evidence is presented showing that, even when molecular size is a small fraction of pore size, diffusion rates decrease markedly. The apparent reduction in solute diffusivity in the microporous membrane can be quantitatively estimated by means of the Renkin equation for hindered diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2123113448,"Water vapor was found to reappear in the atmosphere of Mars during its southern hemisphere spring and summer season, with a maximum vertical column abundance of 45 to 50 microns of precipitable water averaged over the entire planet. Although the spring-summer seasons for each hemisphere are generally symmetrical with respect to the appearance of water vapor, the data suggest that water vapor may appear later in the season and in slightly larger amounts during the southern hemisphere spring-summer."
https://openalex.org/W2093638263,"On the basis of estimates of molecular damage caused by the observation process, it is concluded that molecular microscopy of biological molecules in which the individual atoms are resolved is impossible with an electron or x-ray microscope. Microscopes that use low-energy helium atoms or neutrons as illuminants may be capable of serving as ultimate biomolecular microscopes."
https://openalex.org/W1964029251,"Various people have proposed that North and South America are a part of a gigantic crustal plate within which little differential movement is taking place. Considerations of the size of this postulated plate and the pattern of seismicity around the Caribbean indicate that it is in fact two plates, separated in the region between the Lesser Antilles and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Many of the offsets of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge opposite the Caribbean are the result of differential spreading rates and the westward continuations of the fracture zones extending from these offsets are active left-lateral faults."
https://openalex.org/W1989819832,"X-ray studies of slates from Bundenbach and Wissenbach (Lower and Middle Devonian, West Germany) revealed a surprising amount of pyritized soft parts of cephalopods and trilobites. The tentacles of cephalopods, the appendages, the intestinal tract, and the structure of the interior of facet eyes of trilobites (Phacops species and Asteropyge species) were found in a well-preserved state."

https://openalex.org/W2051417796,"A least-squares refinement of x-ray diffraction data has been developed in which the parameters are the populations of atomic orbital products describing the molecular electron density distribution. The procedure is applied to alpha-oxalic acid dihydrate and cyanuric acid. Complementary structural information obtained by neutron diffraction has been used. In the absence of complementary information, the method allows simultaneous determination of structural and charge-density parameters. There is an indication of a migration of charge from the ppi to the psigma orbitals in both molecules."

In this technique, the brightness of the oscilloscope is modulated by a signal obtained by mixing the signal (from secondary electrons or target current) with its first derivative. This enhances minor topographic features which are poorly reproduced in the conventional technique."
https://openalex.org/W2064504387,"By the use of a metal indentation techinque, microscopic transverse or side-running shock waves can be detected in composition C-4, an explosive consisting largely of cyclonite (RDX) with organic plasticizers. The minimum wave spacing observed is approximately 0.05 millimeters. with a lateral velocity of about 6.5 millimeters per microsecond. The instability was demnostrated in cylindrically divergent detonation waves."

Viscous creeping of bottom features due to gravitational stress was assumed, as was sea floor spreading at a rate of 2 centimeters per year. Values obtained agreed well with previous results obtained on the Fennoscandian Uplift, despite great differences in the horizontal dimensions of the bottom relief."
