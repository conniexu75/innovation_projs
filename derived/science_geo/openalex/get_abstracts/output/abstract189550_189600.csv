We here show that human subcutaneous adipose cells, like 3T3-L1 cells, are target cells for IL-6. To examine putative mechanisms and cross-talk with insulin, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured for different times with IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). IL-6, in contrast to TNF-α, did not increase pS-307 of insulin-receptor substrate (IRS)-1 or JNK activation. However, IL-6, like TNF-α exerted long term inhibitory effects on the gene transcription of IRS-1, GLUT-4, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. This effect of IL-6 was accompanied by a marked reduction in IRS-1, but not IRS-2, protein expression, and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas no inhibitory effect was seen on the insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with the reduced GLUT-4 mRNA, insulin-stimulated glucose transport was also significantly reduced by IL-6. An important interaction with TNF-α was found because TNF-α markedly increased IL-6 mRNA and protein secretion. These results show that IL-6, through effects on gene transcription, is capable of impairing insulin signaling and action but, in contrast to TNF-α, IL-6 does not increase pS-307 (or pS-612) of IRS-1. The link between IL-6 and insulin resistance in man was further corroborated by the finding that the expression of IL-6, like that of TNF-α and IL-8, was markedly increased (∼15-fold) in human fat cells from insulin-resistant individuals. We conclude that IL-6 can play an important role in insulin resistance in man and, furthermore, that it may act in concert with other cytokines that also are up-regulated in adipose cells in insulin resistance.

Coppack S.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Manson J.E. Rifai N. Buring J.E. Ridker P.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar). A possible involvement of TNF-α in insulin resistance has been suggested in a number of studies. TNF-α has been shown to increase plasma triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein concentrations (11Peraldi P. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Lang C.H. Dobrescu C. Bagby G.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) as well as lipolysis in mouse, rat, and human fat cells (13Feingold K.R. Doerrler W. Dinarello C.A. Fiers W. Grunfeld C.

Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the TNF-α gene is overexpressed in fat cells from both obese rodents (18Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6075) Google Scholar) and man (19Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin.

Invest. 1995; 95: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) and the expression is positively correlated with degree of obesity (BMI) and hyperinsulinemia. However, immunoabsorption of circulating TNF-α by specific antibodies in man did not improve insulin sensitivity (21Paquot N. Castillo M.J. Lefebvre P.J. Scheen A.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 1316-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It was also recently reported that circulating levels of TNF-α and its receptors, s-TNF-R60 and s-TNF-R80, were not increased in patients with impaired glucose tolerance but circulating IL-6 levels were significantly elevated (7Muller S. Martin S. Koenig W. Hanifi-Moghaddam P. Rathmann W. Haastert B. Giani G. Illig T. Thorand B. Kolb H. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). TNF-α reduces insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity at low concentrations and can also decrease the expression of the insulin receptor, IRS-1 and GLUT-4 at higher concentrations (22Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13580-13584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as increase the phosphorylation of serine 307 of IRS-1, thus impairing its ability to bind to the insulin receptor and initiate downstream signaling (23Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Only a few studies have addressed the potential metabolic effects of IL-6 and/or its ability to modify insulin sensitivity and action. Long term incubation with IL-6 has been shown to increase basal glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas acute stimulation had no effect (24Stouthard J.M. Oude Elferink R.P. Sauerwein H.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Huppertz C. Schwartz C. Becker W. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Joost H.G. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A preliminary study suggests that IL-6 may increase lipolysis in human fat cells maintained in culture for 48 h (26Trujillo M.E. Kalyoussef S. Brolin R.E. Schneider S.H. Greenberg A.S. Fried S.K. Diabetes. 2001; 50: A12PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Senn et al. (27Senn J.J. Klover P.J. Nowak I.A. Mooney R.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3391-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 28Senn J.J. Klover P.J. Nowak I.A. Zimmers T.A. Koniaris L.G. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13740-13746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) reported that IL-6 transiently (30-90 min) increased SOCS-3 expression in HepG2 cells and rat liver cells and that this was associated with an impaired effect of insulin to increase IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, p85 binding, and downstream PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Intracellular signaling for IL-6 is triggered by a complex consisting of the ligand-bound 80-kDa IL-6 receptor (or the soluble ∼50-kDa form, sIL-6) and two homodimerized transmembrane-spanning GP130 molecules. The activated tyrosine kinases Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 associate with GP130 followed by the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 (29Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Double transgenic mice, overexpressing both sIL-6 receptor and IL-6, are smaller than their wild type littermates and have reduced body weight. These animals have markedly reduced fat depots, enlarged spleen, and shrunken disfigured livers, suggesting a role for IL-6 in cell growth (30Peters M. Odenthal M. Schirmacher P. Blessing M. Fattori E. Ciliberto G. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1474-1481PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study showed that mice completely lacking IL-6 became obese and that intracerobroventricular injection of IL-6 increased energy expenditure (31Wallenius V. Wallenius K. Ahren B. Rudling M. Carlsten H. Dickson S.L. Ohlsson C. Jansson J.O. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). An association between energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, and the C174G polymorphism of the IL-6 promoter was also recently reported (32Kubaszek A. Pihlajamaki J. Punnonen K. Karhapaa P. Vauhkonen I. Laakso M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined if IL-6, like TNF-α, induces insulin resistance in adipose cells. We show that human subcutaneous fat cells are target cells for both IL-6 and TNF-α. Furthermore, the gene expression of IL-6 as well as TNF-α and IL-8 was markedly up-regulated (∼15-fold) in fat cells from insulin-resistant subjects. Studies with 3T3-L1 adipose cells also showed that IL-6 impairs both insulin action and the insulin signaling pathway. IL-6, in contrast to TNF-α, does not activate JNK or increase the phosphorylation of serine 307 or of serine 612 of IRS-1. However, both of these cytokines inhibit the transcriptional activity and protein expression of several molecules related to insulin signaling and action, like IRS-1 and GLUT-4. Taken together, these data support an important role of IL-6 in insulin resistance in man and, in addition, suggest that several cytokines expressed in the adipose cells may act in concert through different mechanisms and temporal patterns. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from 10 subjects, 31-56 years of age, undergoing surgery for a non-systemic abdominal disorder. In addition, adipocyte cytokine mRNA was analyzed in biopsies from 10 non-obese but insulin-resistant individuals as well as 6 insulin-sensitive control subjects. These individuals were selected on the basis of IRS-1 protein expression in the fat cells; normal or low (<50% of normal) expression, which identifies individuals with a marked insulin resistance in vivo (33Carvalho E.

Low IRS-1 is also accompanied by a reduced adiponectin and GLUT-4 expression in the adipose cells (34Carvalho E. Jansson P.A. Nagaev I. Wenthzel A.M. Smith U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1101-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Jansson P.A. Pellmé F. Hammarstedt A. Sandqvist M. Brekke H. Caidahl K. Forsberg M. Volkmann R. Carvalho E. Funahashi T.

Pellmé F. Hammarstedt A. Sandqvist M. Brekke H. Caidahl K. Forsberg M. Volkmann R. Carvalho E. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Wiklund O. Yang X. Taskinen M.R. Smith U. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1434-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The insulin sensitivity of the individuals used to study the cytokine and SOCS-3 mRNA expression in the adipose cells (Table II) have been measured with the euglycemic clamp technique and found to differ by ∼30% between groups (13.1 versus 10.3 mg/kg lean body mass × min). All procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of Göteborg University.Table IIIL-6, TNFα, IL-8, and SOCS-3 mRNA expression in fat cells from insulin-sensitive (normal) or insulin-resistant (low) subjects mRNA levels were measured with real-time RT-PCR using RNA from adipocytes with normal (n = 6) or low (n = 10) IRS-1 protein expression (33Carvalho E.

The isolated adipocytes were filtered through a 250-μm nylon mesh and washed four times with fresh medium. The cells were diluted ∼50-fold in a final volume of 500 μl and preincubated at 37 °C under slow shaking with TNF-α, IL-6 (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands), or without additions (basal) for 1 or 5 h and then for an additional hour with or without 4 mm 8-bromo-cAMP (Sigma) and 6.9 nm insulin as indicated under “Results.” The samples were centrifuged through silicone oil for 5 min at 2000 rpm and glycerol was measured as described (37Bradley D.C.

Glucose Transport, Human Cells—Isolated human adipocytes were washed in glucose-free medium, packed cells were diluted ∼10-fold and incubated in a final volume of 500 μl. The cells were preincubated as above and then for an additional hour with 0.15 μCi of [U-14C]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) with or without 6.9 nm insulin to measure glucose transport as described (34Carvalho E.

Cell Lysates and Protein Electrophoresis—Following preincubation with or without cytokines and 6.9 nm insulin for 30 min, the isolated fat cells were centrifuged through dinonyl phtalate or, for 3T3-L1 cells, directly transferred to tubes with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptine, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm AEBSF), vortexed briefly, and rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Lysate proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE as described (33Carvalho E. Jansson P.A. Axelsen M. Eriksson J.W. Huang X. Groop L. Rondinone C. Sjostrom L. Smith U.

They were then differentiated with the differentiation mixture (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% PEST and 10% fetal bovine serum, 500 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 10 μm dexamethasone) for 2 days as described (39Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin was present for an additional 2 days and the cultures were then continued with only Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1% PEST and 10% fetal bovine serum) for 4 days. On day 8 of differentiation, medium was changed to 1.5% fetal bovine serum overnight. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with or without 20 ng/ml TNF-α or 20 ng/ml IL-6 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for different times as shown under “Results.” Insulin, when present, was added at 100 nm for 30 min prior to harvesting and lysing the cells as described above. Glucose Transport, 3T3-L1 Cells—3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved and incubated with cytokines for 24 h as described above. All cells were washed twice with PBS and then preincubated at 37 °C in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 100 nm insulin for 30 min. Glucose transport was measured by adding 20 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 0.75 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min followed by the addition of 3.3 mm phloretin (Sigma). Cells were immediately washed three times with cold PBS, lysed with 0.2 m NaOH, and uptake of labeled glucose was measured. Protein concentration was measured with bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). IL-6 Secretion—Medium from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells cultured in 25-cm2 flasks was analyzed for IL-6 using a kit (Diaclone, Besancon, France). RNA Extraction and Northern Blots—The cells were washed with RNase-free PBS and lysed in guanidinium thiocyanate solution (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 17 mm Sarkosyl, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7, 0.01% Antifoam A) and sheared through a syringe 5 times and stored at -80 °C. RNA was extracted according to Chirgwin et al. (40Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed on total cellular RNA (30 μg) and the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with 32P-labeled probe overnight at 60 °C. The membranes were washed 3× for 30 min with 1% sodium chloride/sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 1× 30 min at 55 °C with 0.1% SDS. The IRS-2 probe consisted of a 750-bp restriction fragment, using XbaI-PuvII (kindly supplied by Dr. J. Pierce, NCI, National Institutes of Health) and the IRS-1 probe of a PCR-amplified 409-bp fragment as described (41Smith U. Gogg S. Johansson A. Olausson T. Rotter V. Svalstedt B.

Protein and RNA blots were scanned using a Personal Densitometer (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using Image-Quant software provided by the manufacturer. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR and Quantitation Analysis—Following the preincubations with cytokines as described above, the cells were washed twice with RNase-free PBS and homogenized in guanidinium thiocyanate solution. An equal volume of cold chloroform was added and the sample was shaken vigorously for 1 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at -4 °C for 10 min. The water phase was collected and stored at -80 °C until RNA was prepared as described above. cDNA was prepared using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents and the samples were quantified using TaqMan universal PCR master mix and the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described (34Carvalho E.

Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed in Excel and statistical significances were evaluated with the paired or unpaired, as appropriate, Student's t test. 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—We used differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes to be able to study both the acute and chronic effects of IL-6 on insulin signaling and gene and protein expression of key molecules involved in insulin action. Acute Effects on JNK and IRS-1 Serine 307 and 612 Phosphorylation—We first examined if IL-6, like TNF-α, exerts an acute (30 min) effect on serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and JNK activation. Increased phosphorylation of serine 307 of IRS-1 impairs the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 as well as the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (23Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that IL-6, in contrast to TNF-α, did not increase the phosphorylation of serine 307. Insulin also increased the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in agreement with a previous report (23Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, neither IL-6 nor TNF-α increased the phosphorylation of serine 612 of IRS-1, whereas insulin exerted a marked effect (Fig. 1). In agreement with this finding, IL-6 did not increase the phosphorylation of JNK1/2, while this was found for TNF-α (Fig. 1). We also examined if acute exposure to IL-6 reduced the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or IRS-1. However, no such effects were seen after 30 min (data not shown). Long-Term Effects on IRS-1/2 Expression and Tyr(P)—Because we saw no acute inhibitory effects by IL-6 on the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation or an increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, we examined potential long-term effects. As shown in Fig. 2, both cytokines induced a clear reduction in IRS-1 gene expression (∼50%) after 24 h (p < 0.04) while no significant reduction in IRS-2 mRNA was seen. Consistent with the reduced gene expression of IRS-1, there was also a ∼50% decrease in IRS-1 protein expression after treatment with either IL-6 or TNF-α for 24 h (Fig. 3a), whereas there was no significant reduction of IRS-2 protein following IL-6 or TNF-α although TNF-α tended to also reduce this docking protein (Fig. 3c). Control cells showed a large increase in IRS tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin for 30 min, whereas preincubation with IL-6 inhibited the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation to a similar extent as the reduced IRS-1 protein expression (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, IL-6, in contrast to TNF-α, did not inhibit the insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin in these cells (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data show that long-term exposure to IL-6 leads to an impaired insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes because of reduced gene and protein expression of IRS-1.Fig. 4Effect of IL-6 and TNF-α on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were cultured for 24 h without (bas) or with 20 ng/ml IL-6 or TNF-α as shown, followed by 30 min exposure to 100 nm insulin.

Consistent with the decreased GLUT-4 expression, we also found a significantly decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes incubated with IL-6 for 24 h (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2116899346,"A 21-base pair RNA duplex that perfectly matches an endogenous target mRNA selectively degrades the mRNA and suppresses gene expression in mammalian tissue culture cells. A single base mismatch with the target is believed to protect the mRNA from degradation, making this type of interference highly specific to the targeted gene. A short RNA with mismatches to a target sequence present in multiple copies in the 3′-untranslated region of an exogenously expressed gene can, however, silence it by translational repression. Here we report that a mismatched RNA, targeted to a single site in the coding sequence of an endogenous gene, can efficiently silence gene expression by repressing translation. The antisense strand of such a mismatched RNA requires a 5′-phosphate but not a 3′-hydroxyl group. G·U wobble base pairing is tolerated as a match for both RNA degradation and translation repression. Together, these findings suggest that a small inhibitory RNA duplex can suppress expression of off-target cellular proteins by RNA degradation or translation repression. Proper design of experimental small inhibitory RNAs or a search for targets of endogenous micro-RNAs must therefore take into account that these short RNAs can affect expression of cellular genes with as many as 3–4 base mismatches and additional G·U mismatches.

Small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) 1The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; stRNA, small temporal RNA; UTR, untranslated region; miRNA, microRNA. are small RNAs of ∼21-nucleotide length that trigger the destruction of target mRNA with which they share complementarity (1Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar). In vivo, they are generated by an RNase III enzyme, Dicer, which cleaves a precursor double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into ∼21-nucleotide sense, antisense, or, potentially, dsRNA fragments (2Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar, 3Parrish S. Fleenor J. Xu S. Mello C. Fire A. Mol.

The ∼21-nucleotide siRNA is incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that mediates the cleavage of target mRNA. RNA-mediated silencing was first observed in petunia flowers as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Jorgensen et al. observed silencing of the introduced transgene and the endogenous gene homologous to the transgene (6Jorgensen R.A. Cluster P.D. English J. Que Q. Napoli C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 957-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Que Q. Jorgensen R.A. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The authors defined this activity of exogenous elements to alter the expression of the endogenous gene as “cosuppression.” The key breakthrough came with the work of Mello and co-workers, who were employing antisense RNA for gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans (1Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar). They observed that the mixture of sense and antisense RNA was 10-fold more effective than single strand sense or antisense RNAs. The authors named this double-stranded RNA-mediated silencing “RNA interference (RNAi).” After their report, RNAi-mediated silencing was linked to a previously observed cosuppression phenomenon in plants, fungi, and Drosophila (6Jorgensen R.A. Cluster P.D. English J. Que Q. Napoli C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 957-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Que Q. Jorgensen R.A. Dev.

Schumacher M. Schmidhauser T.J. Selker E.U. Macino G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3153-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Tuschl and colleagues used RNAi to silence genes in mammalian tissue culture cells (10Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). This was significant, because the authors could demonstrate sequence-specific silencing of target genes in mammalian cells without any accompanying nonspecific interferon-mediated response. Subsequently, siRNA has been used extensively to silence specific genes for experimental purposes and to target infectious agents like the human immunodeficiency virus and the hepatitis B and C viruses (11Hamasaki K.

Distinct from siRNAs are another group of small RNAs called small temporal RNAs (stRNAs), named as such because they are temporally regulated during the development of C. elegans. Also called microRNAs, they silence genes by repressing translation while not affecting the levels of mRNA (17Grishok A. Pasquinelli A.E. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S. Ha I. Baillie D.L. Fire A.

Stark A. Russell R.B. Cohen S.M. Cell. 2003; 113: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). Important differences between siRNA and stRNA mechanisms have been noted. Double-stranded RNAs with long stretches of perfectly base-paired nucleotides are cleaved to produce smaller double-stranded siRNAs. On the other hand, double-stranded RNA with imperfect complementarity between the strands is cleaved to produce single-stranded stRNA (17Grishok A. Pasquinelli A.E. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S. Ha I. Baillie D.L. Fire A. Ruvkun G. Mello C.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). The most significant difference lies in the mechanism of gene silencing. siRNA causes degradation of a target mRNA to which it is perfectly base-paired, whereas stRNA inhibits translation of a target mRNA to which it is imperfectly base paired. The best studied stRNAs, lin-4 and let-7, repress their target genes, lin-14, lin-28 and lin-41, by partial base pairing to multiple target sequences in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (22Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V. Cell. 1993; 75: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9830) Google Scholar, 23Slack F.J. Basson M. Liu Z. Ambros V. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Mol.

Nature. 2000; 403: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3801) Google Scholar). Mutations in lin-4 and let-7 lead to developmental defects due to loss of repression of these target genes at specific stages of C. elegans development (24Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M. Pasquinelli A.E. Bettinger J.C. Rougvie A.E. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2000; 403: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3801) Google Scholar). Recently, a gene (bantam) has been identified in Drosophila that encodes a micro-RNA (miRNA) whose expression is temporally and spatially regulated (21Brennecke J. Hipfner D.R. Stark A. Russell R.B. Cohen S.M. Cell. 2003; 113: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). Around 100 miRNAs have now been identified in humans (18Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Science. 2001; 294: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar, 25Lim L.P. Glasner M.E. Yekta S. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

Some of the miRNAs (let-7) and their targets (lin-41) have been reported across eukaryotes, suggesting that these small RNAs may participate in the genetic regulation of a wide range of cellular pathways (27Pasquinelli A.E. Reinhart B.J. Slack F. Martindale M.Q. Kuroda M.I. Maller B. Hayward D.C. Ball E.E. Degnan B. Muller P. Spring J. Srinivasan A. Fishman M. Finnerty J. Corbo J. Levine M. Leahy P. Davidson E. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2000; 408: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). Because the targets of miRNA share only partial complementarity, very little is known about the targets or functions of most miRNAs. Transfection of siRNA complementary to an mRNA is a fast and convenient tool for studying loss of function of a target gene in mammalian cells. However, there are conflicting reports in literature about the specificity of the sequence match necessary to achieve gene silencing (28Semizarov D. Frost L. Sarthy A. Kroeger P. Halbert D.N. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 29Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G.

A. 2003; 100: 6343-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Recent reports by at least two different groups have claimed high specificity of RNAi silencing by analyzing genome-wide expression profiling (28Semizarov D. Frost L. Sarthy A. Kroeger P. Halbert D.N. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 30Chi J.T. Chang H.Y. Wang N.N. Chang D.S. Dunphy N. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6343-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, others have observed that partial complementarity between siRNA and mRNA leads to nonspecific changes in mRNA levels, raising an interesting debate on specificity of siRNA silencing (29Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Although some report that a single base mismatch with respect to a target abolishes silencing, others have observed that mismatches can be tolerated (13Amarzguioui M. Holen T. Babaie E. Prydz H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 31Boutla A. Delidakis C. Livadaras I. Tsagris M. Tabler M. Curr.

Semizarov et al. have observed that scrambled siRNA (the complementary siRNA with an inversion of a four-nucleotide fragment in the middle of sequence) does not cause any change in the level of target mRNA and protein (28Semizarov D. Frost L. Sarthy A. Kroeger P. Halbert D.N. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated the number of mutations that can be tolerated for a short RNA to suppress expression of an endogenous gene. We observed that when 3–4 mismatches are introduced into p21 or geminin siRNA, they can still silence the targeted gene, but by triggering translational repression instead of mRNA degradation. The 5′-phosphate group is required at the antisense strand for translational repression in human cells. The 3′-hydroxyl group is dispensable, eliminating any role of a primer extension-mediated amplification step in dsRNA-mediated translational repression silencing. The G·U wobble base pair is recognized like an authentic Watson-Crick base pair in antisense RNA oligonucleotide-mRNA duplex interaction. Base pairing at the center of duplex is more critical, stabilizing the antisense RNA oligonucleotide-mRNA duplex and enhancing the silencing. A recent report showed that mismatched short RNAs can translationally silence a target mRNA with multiple targets in the 3′-UTR (35Doench J.G. Petersen C.P. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Because the target mRNA was an artificial construct expressed from an exogenous promoter, it was not clear how these findings could apply to the conventional siRNA experiments in which the short RNA duplex is targeted to a single site in the coding region of an endogenous gene. We report here that a short RNA duplex similar to those used in siRNA experiments can function like an stRNA and silence an endogenous gene that carries only one natural target sequence partially complimentary to it. We also report that the target for this stRNA-like process is not limited to 3′-UTR and can include the coding sequence of a gene. Taken together, our results emphasize the possibility of off-target silencing by siRNAs used for an experimental or a therapeutic purpose. Cell Culture, Transfections, Protein, and RNA Analysis—PC3 cells from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, whereas HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For dsRNA transfection, commercial RNA duplexes composed of 21-nucleotide sense and 21-nucleotide antisense strands were used, paired so as to have a two-nucleotide 3′-overhang (Dharmacon and Ambion). Cells were grown to ∼50% confluence in a 6-well plate and transfected three times at 24-h intervals with 0.32 nmol of annealed RNA duplex (4.2 μg of RNA duplex) using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Transfection was done in the absence of fetal bovine serum, which was replenished 4 h after each transfection. By using this protocol and Oligofectamine reagent, cell mortality was <10%, even after three dsRNA transfections. The cells were then assayed for levels of targeted protein and mRNA. A nonspecific RNA duplex (GL2), complimentary to firefly luciferase (5′-AACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA-3′), was used as a negative control. Cell extracts were prepared in ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 1 unit/ml of DNase) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml each pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin. The concentration of total protein in the lysates was determined by Bradford assay, and equal amounts were used for Western blots. The geminin antibody has been described earlier (36Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), whereas p21 antibody (sc-397) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern analysis of geminin and p21 mRNA, 10 μg of total cellular RNA was separated on denaturing agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with random primed geminin and p21 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The quantitation of mRNA levels was done with the Fuji BAS-2500 phosphorimaging device and Image Gauge software. Protein levels were estimated with NIH software-Scion Image by scanning autoradiograms. Imperfect Base Pairing with the Target Causes siRNA to Silence the Gene in an stRNA-like Process—We initially designed an siRNA (p21-2) against a target in the 3′-UTR of the endogenous p21 mRNA (Fig. 1A). Upon transfection of PC3 cells, this perfectly base-paired p21 siRNA caused an ∼85% reduction in protein level (Fig. 1B, quantitation in Fig. 1C). Consistent with the silencing being mediated by RNAi, mRNA levels were significantly reduced (Fig. 1, B and C). Next, we incorporated mismatches in the siRNA to observe the effect of the mismatch on silencing. With 3–4 mismatches (p21-4, p21-10, and p21-11) we still observed a significant decrease in p21 protein levels. However, the mRNA was not degraded (Fig. 1, A–C). These results contrast to those observed by others, wherein a scrambled siRNA (the complementary siRNA with an inversion of a four-nucleotide fragment in the middle of sequence) does not cause any changes in levels of target protein (28Semizarov D. Frost L. Sarthy A. Kroeger P. Halbert D.N. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Therefore a short RNA duplex with mismatches to the target repressed protein levels without degrading the target mRNA. Given the mechanism of gene silencing by stRNA, the most likely mechanism of this repression of protein levels is through translational repression. stRNA-like Silencing Can Be Observed Even When Targeted to the Coding Sequence of a Gene—We next asked whether the stRNA-like silencing occurs in other genes and when targeted to the coding region of the mRNA. First, we designed a perfectly base-paired siRNA targeting the coding sequence of geminin mRNA (GEM2) (Fig. 2A). GEM2 siRNA reduces the protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 2B, quantitation in Fig. 2C). We then steadily incorporated mismatches within the siRNA. When three mismatches were incorporated with respect to the target (GEM3), there was significant decrease in protein but not in mRNA levels. Therefore, three mismatches in a geminin siRNA targeted to the coding region converts it to a function like an stRNA. Translational repression could be observed with three (GEM3) but not with five or eleven (GEM8, 7) mismatches (Fig. 2, A–C). Therefore stRNA-like silencing occurs on other endogenous genes and is not limited to the 3′-UTR. Because detection of protein levels by enhanced chemiluminesence immunoblotting can be non-linear, we loaded varying amounts of cell lysate for immunoblotting to carefully quantitate the decrease in protein levels. Around 4-fold more cell lysate had to be loaded from GEM3-transfected cells as compared with control cells to detect equivalent geminin levels (Fig. 2D, quantitation in Fig. 2E). This decrease to ∼25% of endogenous protein levels was comparable with the decrease seen with perfectly matched siRNA. G·U Wobble Base Pairing in Antisense RNA Oligonucleotide-mRNA Target Interaction—The RNA secondary structure permits G·U wobble base pairs that have a thermodynamic stability comparable with Watson-Crick base pairs (37Gautheret D. Konings D. Gutell R.R. RNA. 1995; 1: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar). If wobble base pairing is tolerated in the antisense RNA-target duplex, it would expand the range of potential targets for the same siRNA. To test whether wobble base pairing is tolerated in RNA-mediated silencing, we used a perfectly matched p21 siRNA that causes mRNA degradation (p21-2) (Fig. 3, A and B). Three nucleotides were replaced such that the siRNA would form three G·U wobble base pairs with the target (p21-3). The protein silencing and the mRNA degradation were unaltered. On the other hand, replacing the same three nucleotides such that there are “real” mismatches with the target (p21-4) still silences protein expression, but this is via an stRNA-like pathway (decrease in protein without change in mRNA levels; Fig. 3, A and B, with quantitation in Fig. 3C). Therefore the three G·U wobble base pairs were recognized as authentic base pairs, and replacing them with non-wobble base pairs (which are recognized as mismatches) leads to stRNA-type activity. We next investigated whether wobble base pairs can expand the spectrum of stRNA-like silencing. It has been reported that G·U base pairing is recognized as a mismatch in micro-RNAs leading to disruption of silencing (34Zeng Y. Cullen B.R. RNA. 2003; 9: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). GEM6 is a geminin dsRNA duplex that silences endogenous geminin by translational repression (Fig. 3, D and E, with quantitation in Fig. 3F). This dsRNA duplex has three real mismatches and two G·U wobble base pairings with respect to the target. It does not degrade the target mRNA but silences the target protein expression. When the two G·U base pairs were changed to non-wobble mismatches (five real mismatches; GEM8), there was a significant reduction in silencing (Fig. 3, D–F). Therefore, as in mRNA degradation, wobble base pairing functions as authentic base pairing in translational repression, expanding the gamut of potential off-target genes that may be silenced by stRNA-like processes. Base Pairing in the Center of the Target Region Is Critical for RNA-mediated Silencing—We tested whether mismatches at the ends are better tolerated than mismatches at the center of the RNA oligonucleotide-mRNA duplex. The antisense strand of a transfected dsRNA duplex is believed to be the functional strand in gene silencing. A perfectly base-paired RNA (p21-1) targeting the coding sequence of the p21 gene silences p21 efficiently (Fig. 4, A and B). When base pairing was disrupted at the 3′-end of the complementary region, we still observed effective silencing (p21-1g). However, when mismatches were introduced at the center of the base-pairing region (position 7–13 relative to the 5′-end of the antisense strand), no silencing was observed (p21-1h). Therefore, mismatches were better tolerated at the end of the duplex than in the middle. It is also of interest that a two-base pair mismatch in p21-1h abrogated silencing, whereas mismatches of three or four bases in p21-4, p21-10, and p21-11 still permitted silencing. Therefore, it is not simply the number of mismatches but also the context or nature of the mismatch that determines whether an oligonucleotide functions like an stRNA. Translational Repression Can Be Induced by Single-stranded Antisense RNA—We next determined whether some of the rules by which siRNAs function in mammalian cells were also applicable to gene silencing via translational repression. Single-stranded antisense RNA has been shown to be effective as an siRNA (38Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the single-stranded antisense RNA can induce silencing by translational repression. Consistent with published results, antisense single strand siRNA was as effective as double-stranded siRNA (GEM2) for silencing geminin expression (Fig. 4C, with quantitation in Fig. 4D). Transfecting the antisense strand of GEM3 also produced effective silencing, just like double-stranded GEM3 (Fig. 4, C and D). The sense strand of GEM3 did not change geminin levels. Therefore, a single-stranded antisense RNA that can imperfectly pair with the target mRNA can induce translational repression. 5′-Phosphate Is Required for stRNA-like Silencing in HeLa Cells—The antisense strand of siRNA needs a 5′-phosphate group for activity (38Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 39Chiu Y.L. Rana T.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). For the studies above, we used 5′-hydroxylated dsRNA, which is believed to be rapidly phosphorylated in vivo by endogenous kinases. We investigated the requirement of a 5′-phosphate group on the antisense strand of an RNA duplex for translational repression. For this we used an RNA duplex blocked at the 5′-end by an amino group with a three-carbon linker (as/5′-N3; Fig. 5A). These modified RNA duplexes lack the 5′-hydroxyl group and cannot be phosphorylated by kinases in vivo. We observed that these modified RNA duplexes did not silence gene expression (Fig. 5B, with quantitation in Fig. 5C). Therefore, similar to siRNA, the 5′-phosphate group on the antisense strand is essential for dsRNA to enter into the “stRNA-like silencing complex” to cause translational repression (38Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 39Chiu Y.L. Rana T.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The 3′-hydroxyl group in the antisense strand of siRNA, which is essential in C. elegans, is dispensable for silencing in mammalian cells. We therefore tested whether stRNA-like silencing requires the 3′-hydroxyl group as a primer for RNA synthesis following annealing to the target RNA-template. The 3′-hydroxyl group of the antisense strand was blocked with 3-aminopropyl phosphoester (3′-amino modifier) so that it could no longer be used as primer for extension (as/3′-N3–3′; Fig. 5A). There was no difference in silencing with 3′-modified oligonucleotides, suggesting that RNA-mediated translational repression does not involve amplification of RNA by primer extension from the 3′-hydroxyl end (Fig. 5, B and C). Mismatches Are Tolerated at the 3′-End but Not the 5′-End of the Antisense Strand—In light of the observation that modifications at the 5′-end are not tolerated in RNA-mediated silencing, we tested whether mismatches at the 5′-end are tolerated. Unlike mismatches at the 3′-end, incorporating mismatches at the 5′-end of and antisense strand abolished silencing (Fig. 5, D and E, with quantitation in Fig. 5F). Therefore, for the p21 mRNA, incorporating >3–4 mismatches in the center of the target region or mismatches at the 5′-end of the antisense strand limits RNA-mediated silencing. Different workers have reported varying degrees of tolerance for mismatches in siRNA-mediated silencing (13Amarzguioui M. Holen T. Babaie E. Prydz H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 31Boutla A. Delidakis C. Livadaras I. Tsagris M. Tabler M. Curr.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Although some report that a bulge or a 2–3 nucleotide mismatch is permissible in siRNA-mediated silencing, others observe that even a single base pair mismatch completely eliminates silencing (35Doench J.G. Petersen C.P. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 40Zeng Y. Wagner E.J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1327-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Here, we have systematically increased the mismatches between the short RNA and target RNA. We observe that, as mismatches increase, an siRNA begins to function like an stRNA. Therefore, we note that a 21-nucleotide double-stranded RNA that shares only partial complementarity with the target mRNA is still competent to cause gene silencing via translational repression. We also note that the antisense strand alone, but not the sense strand of the same duplex, can induce silencing. Adaptation of an siRNA to function like an stRNA implies that complementarity is a critical factor defining the mode of action of these small RNA molecules. Hutvagner and Zamore demonstrated that in human cell extracts a natural stRNA, let-7, can function as siRNA with a perfectly base-paired target (41Hutvagner G. Zamore P.D. Science. 2002; 297: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). Zeng et al. designed an miRNA that inhibited the translation of a target mRNA with which it shared partial complementarity (40Zeng Y. Wagner E.J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1327-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The target was an exogenously expressed mRNA in which four copies of the partial complementary sequence were inserted at the 3′-UTR. Similarly, Doench et al. reported that siRNA can function like an stRNA if it contains a central bulge with respect to the target (35Doench J.G. Petersen C.P. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). These workers again used an exogenously expressed mRNA in which four consecutive binding sites were engineered in the 3′-UTR. Here, we report that an RNA duplex can silence an endogenous gene with which it has a single binding site with up to 3–4 mismatches. This was demonstrated using two genes (p21 and geminin) in two different cell lines (PC3 and HeLa). Various reports in literature suggest that the target of an stRNA has to be the 3′-UTR (22Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V. Cell. 1993; 75: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9830) Google Scholar, 23Slack F.J. Basson M. Liu Z. Ambros V. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Mol.

Nature. 2000; 403: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3801) Google Scholar). However, recently Kawasaki and Taira have reported a natural micro-RNA, miR-23, that is partially complementary to the coding region and stop codon of the target mRNA (42Kawasaki H. Taira K. Nature. 2003; 423: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We now show that a mismatched RNA designed to target the coding sequence of the gene can function like an stRNA. The perfectly base-paired siRNA (GEM2) silences the gene by mediating degradation of geminin mRNA. Although the silencing was complete, with undetectable protein levels, low levels of mRNA could still be detected. Therefore, it is possible that gene silencing mediated even by a perfectly base-paired siRNA like GEM2 involved a component of translational repression. It is likely that this serves as an additional or redundant mechanism (in case the mRNA target degradation is unsuccessful for some reason) to effect complete silencing. We have identified the characteristics of dsRNA important for it to function like an stRNA. The 5′-phosphate but not the 3′-hydroxyl group of the antisense strand is required for translational repression in human cells. The requirement of the 5′-phosphate for stRNA-like activity is similar to that observed in siRNA (38Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 39Chiu Y.L. Rana T.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is clear that, as with siRNA in human cells, amplification of an RNA duplex by primer extension from the 3′-hydroxyl end of the antisense strand is not required for translational repression in human cells. Can we definitely predict the efficacy of dsRNA-mediated silencing based on the number of mismatches with the target? Two mismatches with the p21 mRNA (p21-h) abolishes silencing, whereas the same number of mismatches with geminin mRNA (GEM3) permits silencing. Therefore, it is not the absolute number of mismatches but probably the overall stability of the antisense RNA oligonucleotide-mRNA duplex that determines the success of a silencing event. This study suggests that additional experiments are necessary to explicitly predict the efficacy of silencing of different targets and sequences on the basis of number of mismatches. The secondary structure of the mRNA target and the sequence composition of the short RNA likely contribute to the stability of the duplex. Therefore, additional targets and sequences should be tested systematically to define broad rules for dsRNA-mediated silencing. Is there any advantage for a cell to allow gene silencing by short RNA that has only partial complementarity? It has been suggested that si/stRNAs evolved as a defense mechanism against viruses and other intracellular pathogens. Because mismatched oligonucleotides can suppress protein expression, pathogens with a few nucleotide changes at the target site will still be inhibited by RNA duplexes. In addition, a single short RNA to a relatively conserved region might inhibit multiple cellular genes in the same family. It should also be noted that, because short RNA duplexes with mismatches and wobble base pairs can silence endogenous genes, programs searching for targets of siRNA should allow for such mismatches and wobble base pairs. There are numerous reports in the literature describing the phenotypes following inactivation of various genes by siRNA duplexes (43Hammond S.M. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). This study cautions that the silencing phenotypes observed by small RNA-mediated silencing should be interpreted conservatively, because there are now at least two additional mechanisms by which the target range is extended, namely mismatches and G·U wobble base pairs. Recently Jackson et al. have shown that partial complementarity between siRNA and mRNA leads to nonspecific changes in mRNA levels (29Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). We show here that partial complementarity can also lead to translational repression, thereby increasing the range of nonspecific effects. To eliminate off-target silencing effects, a simple precaution is to use two or more separate duplexes targeting different regions of an mRNA to look for a reproducible phenotype.

Many questions have, however, been raised regarding such a mechanism. We have instead identified a completely new mechanism to explain the role of red cells in the delivery of NO to the microcirculation. This new mechanism results in the production of NO in the microcirculation where it is needed. Nitrite produced when NO reacts with oxygen in arterial blood is reutilized in the arterioles when the partial pressure of oxygen decreases and the deoxygenated hemoglobin formed reduces the nitrite regenerating NO. Nitrite reduction by hemoglobin results in a major fraction of the NO generated retained in the intermediate state where NO is bound to Hb(III) and in equilibrium with the nitrosonium cation bound to Hb(II). This pool of NO, unlike Hb(II)NO, is weakly bound and can be released from the heme. The instability of Hb(III)NO in oxygen and its displacement when flushed with argon requires that reliable determinations of red blood cell NO must be performed on freshly lysed samples without permitting the sample to be oxygenated. In fresh blood samples Hb(III)NO accounts for 75% of the red cell NO with appreciably higher values in venous blood than arterial blood. These findings confirm that nitrite reduction at reduced oxygen pressures is a major source for red cell NO.

Their model is based on the potential binding of NO released from arterial endothelial cells to the few vacant deoxyhemes to form Hb(II)NO and to the β-93 cysteine to form S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNOHb) (11Gow A.J.

The relative affinity for these two hemoglobin sites was assumed to depend on the hemoglobin quaternary conformation with heme-bound NO favored by the T-state present in deoxygenated hemoglobin transferred to the cysteine in the R-state formed during hemoglobin oxygenation. The destabilization of the cysteine bound NO during hemoglobin deoxygenation was assumed to facilitate the transfer of NO to low molecular weight and membrane-associated thiols resulting in an increase in the availability of NO for vasodilation in the microcirculation (8Jia L.

The Stamler proposal has attracted much attention because it provides a mechanism for the delivery of relatively unstable NO produced in the larger arteries to the smaller blood vessels where the regulation of blood flow for the delivery of oxygen is crucial. Many investigators have challenged the validity of this hypothesis. The areas of disagreement include almost all aspects of the hypothesis. 1) The hypothesis was based on determinations of red cell Hb(II)NO and SNOHb in arterial (A) and venous (V) blood indicating micromolar levels of red blood cell NO with A/V differences in rats and humans consistent with a conformationally linked transfer between both sites (9Stamler J.S.

Although Rassaf et al. (14Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Maloney R.E. Specian V. Kelm M. Kalyanaraman B. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 481-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have been able to confirm the data of Stamler used in the initial studies on rodents, their results indicate no detectable heme-NO with human subjects, completely contradicting the Stamler results. Gladwin et al. (15Gladwin M.T. Ognibene F.P. Pannell L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(a) NO should not bind specifically to the low levels of deoxyHb present in arterial blood where most of the endothelial NO is produced (16Huang Z. Louderback J.G. Goyal M. Azizi F. King S.B.

(b) NO tightly bound to Hb(II) should not be transferred to the β-93 cysteine residue producing SNOHb, and (c) the R to T quaternary conformation does not seem to facilitate the release of NO from SNOHb (19Spencer N.Y.

In order to address the levels of red cell NO in human subjects, we have developed a new chemiluminescence assay that can measure heme-NO (Hb(II)NO and Hb(III)NO) without any sample processing and without interference from nitrate, nitrite, or nitrosothiols down to a level of 10 nm in red blood cells. By this method we find appreciable levels of heme-NO and significant A/V differences with more heme-NO in the venous blood. Furthermore, by combining electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with chemiluminescence we have shown that ∼75% of this heme-NO is not Hb(II)NO, which other investigators have focused on, but Hb(III)NO. The Hb(III)NO represents a labile form of heme-NO, which is formed by nitrite reduction in the red cell.

Arterial samples (3 ml) were obtained from the cannulated brachial artery and venous samples (3 ml) from a cannula in the ipsilateral antecubital fossa and immediately placed on ice. Within 30 min the cells were centrifuged to remove plasma and stored at 77 K. Hb(II)NO Preparation—Human hemoglobin was purified from fresh hemolysate by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-100 column equilibrated with NaCl-phosphate buffer and stored in liquid nitrogen. 50 μm hemoglobin was completely deoxygenated by flushing with argon while stirring until the spectrum of hemoglobin corresponded to that of deoxyHb. The NO gas (2.5%) was purified by passing through concentrated NaOH with small amounts of NO added to a deoxyHb solution to produce Hb(II)NO as confirmed spectrophotometrically. The Hb(II)NO was then quickly passed down a Sephadex G-25 at 4 °C to remove unreacted NO. The final concentration of Hb(II)NO was determined by visible spectroscopy using the millimolar heme extinction coefficient for Hb(II)NO of 11.4 at 544 nm. Multiple aliquots of the sample were stored in liquid nitrogen. Chemiluminescence Method to Determine Hb(II)NO—The Model 280 Nitric Oxide Analyzer (NOA) from Sievers Instruments was used to determine heme-NO. The purge vessel contained 5.5 ml of glacial acetic acid, 1.5 ml of 0.8 m potassium ferricyanide in water and 1 ml of 100 mm sulfanilamide in 2 m acetic acid. Potassium ferricyanide was used to help release the NO from Hb(II)NO by oxidizing the hemoglobin. Sulfanilamide was used to react with nitrite under acidic conditions to minimize the NO signal coming from nitrite. Acetic acid enhances the release of NO from Hb(II)NO and prevents protein foam formation. The temperature of the purge vessel was maintained at 30 °C. Argon bubbled through the purge vessel carries any released NO to the detector, which quantitates the NO by measuring the gas-phase chemiluminescent NO reaction with ozone. Volumes corresponding to 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 25 pmol of Hb(II)NO were injected into the purge vessel to obtain concentration dependent chemiluminescence signals. Origin 6.1 software was used to integrate the peak areas. A calibration curve was prepared by plotting concentrations of Hb(II)NO versus area. The absence of interference from other nitric oxide species in this assay was verified by injecting 10 pmol of Hb(II)NO premixed with 25 pmol of nitrite, nitrate, or S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Determination of Heme-NO (Hb(II)NO and Hb(III)NO) by Chemiluminescence—(A) Heme-NO formed during nitrite reduction by deoxyHb: 1 mm deoxyHb was incubated with varying concentrations (0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 μm) of freshly prepared sodium nitrite in NaCl-phosphate buffer in septum-sealed cuvettes at 22 °C. 20–50 μl of sample was withdrawn from the reaction mixture with a gas tight syringe at varying time points and was injected into the NOA purge vessel to determine the released NO, which consists of total heme-NO. The concentration of NO released was determined by comparing the area of the observed signal with that for an Hb(II)NO standard curve (above). Hb(II)NO was determined after oxygenation of the sample during, which time the NO bound to Hb(III) reacted with oxygen producing nitrite. Subtraction of the Hb(II)NO values from the total heme-NO provides values for Hb(III)NO. (B) Heme-NO formed during nitrite reduction by red blood cells: deoxygenated red blood cells (30% hct) were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) with 1, 5, and 10 μm nitrite for 30 min at 22 °C in septum-sealed cuvettes. After the reaction, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of water. 50 μl of this lysate was injected into the purge vessel. Under the conditions of this experiment, without removing oxygen from the PBS used to wash the cells and the water used for lysis, the detected heme-NO is predominantly Hb(II)NO. (C) In vivo formation heme-NO in arterial and venous red blood cells: Just prior to analysis, 100 μl of freshly thawed cells were transferred using a gas tight syringe to an anaerobic cuvette containing 300 μl of deoxygenated double distilled water to determine total heme-NO or 300 μl oxygenated double distilled water to determine Hb(II)NO. 100 μl of the lysed samples were injected into the purge vessel in triplicate (the reagent in the purge vessel was changed after 3–4 determinations). The concentration of hemoglobin in the injected sample was determined by visible spectroscopy using the millimolar heme extinction coefficient for oxyHb of 15.37 at 577 nm. The concentration of NO released was calculated using the Hb(II)NO standard curve. The concentrations of NO and hemoglobin were used to calculate the percent hemoglobin nitrosylated. The Origin 6.1 program was used to integrate the area of the smoothed chemiluminescence signals. Determination of Heme-NO (Hb(II)NO and Hb(III)NO) by EPR— Samples prepared for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies were transferred to 4 mm clear fused quartz EPR tubes (707 SQ250M-WILMAD) and frozen by submerging the EPR tubes in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at 77 K until recorded. EPR spectra were measured using an IBM ER-200D SRC spectrometer with 100 kHz modulation. An Oxford continuous flow ESR900 cryogenic unit with an ITC 502 temperature controller was used to maintain the temperature of the sample in the spectrometer at 3.6–4.0 K. (A) Hb(II)NO formed during nitrite reduction by deoxyHb: 1 mm deoxyHb was reacted with 250 μm nitrite in NaCl-phosphate buffer and transferred anaerobically to 4-mm quartz EPR tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The g = 6 amplitude of Hb(III) was used to correct the observed spectrum of Hb(II)NO in the region from 3150–3550 gauss for the g = 2 Hb(III) signal. The concentration of Hb(II)NO was determined by comparing the spectrum obtained during nitrite reduction with that of a standard solution of Hb(II)NO. (B) Hb(III)NO formed during nitrite reduction of deoxyHb: Hb(III)NO has no EPR spectrum due to the interaction of paramagnetic Hb(III) with the unpaired electron on NO. Hb(III)NO can, however, be quantitated by flushing the sample with argon to remove the weakly bound NO. 1 mm deoxyHb was reacted with 250 μm nitrite in NaCl-phosphate buffer for 10 min. One aliquot of the sample was anaerobically transferred to a 4-mm EPR tube and frozen. The remaining sample was flushed with argon for 3 min before a second aliquot was transferred to an EPR tube. The EPR signals were measured in the region of 900–1300 gauss to quantitate the amount of Hb(III). The increase in the signal after flushing with argon was a measure of the amount of Hb(III)NO in the sample. The observed spectra were compared with that of a standard solution of Hb(III). (C) Hb(III)NO in red blood cells from arterial and venous blood: The blood was spun to remove plasma within 30 min of being drawn. Cells were then diluted with 4 volumes of deoxygenated PBS to measure the basal Hb(III) or oxygenated PBS to measure the additional Hb(III) that formed after the reaction of oxygen with Hb(III)NO. The samples were transferred to EPR tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen to measure the Hb(III) signal as described above. The difference between the intensities of these two samples of Hb(III) was a measure of Hb(III)NO. Chemiluminescence Assay of Hb(II)NO Standard—Chemiluminescence assays for NO are highly sensitive with a detection limit of 0.5 pmol. Despite this sensitivity there are a number of difficulties with the conventional NO assays. Since NO is highly unstable, the conventional method for the determination of NO is to reduce all nitric oxide related species (nitrite, nitrate, Hb(II)NO, SNOHb etc.) back to NO gas under strongly reducing conditions (strong reducing agents in strong acid at high temperature). This method, however, does not differentiate between the different NO species. It, therefore, becomes essential to utilize separation procedures involving ultrafiltration, column chromatography etc. to remove nitrite, nitrate, and other NO-related species from the species of interest. Such procedures have difficulties associated with contaminants picked up during the purification procedure and the possible loss of signal from unstable NO species of interest. Our chemiluminescence method, bypasses all of these difficulties by directly determining heme-NO levels as low as 10 nm, even in hemolysate without any sample purification, and without interference of other NO species. This is accomplished by placing all of the reagents necessary to specifically release NO from heme in the chemiluminescence purge vessel. Fig. 1 shows the results obtained for the determination of Hb(II)NO with the sample being injected into the purge vessel containing potassium ferricyanide, sulfanilamide, and glacial acetic acid. The concentration-dependent increase in signal is shown in Fig. 1A. The inset shows the stoichiometric release of NO. A recovery of 95 (±5) was obtained when standards of Hb(II)NO were added to concentrated hemoglobin or a 25% hct suspension of red blood cells. With red blood cells the peaks were slightly broader, but the total area was the same (data not shown). The specificity of the assay is shown in Fig. 1B where the addition of nitrite (25 pmol), nitrate (25 pmol), or GSNO (25 pmol) to 10 pmol of Hb (II) NO did not have any effect on the signal intensity. Nitrite Reduction to NO by DeoxyHb—The chemiluminescence method was used to follow the reaction of nitrite with deoxyHb under conditions approaching the 500 nm physiological level of nitrite (22Preik-Steinhoff H. Kelm M. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1996; 685: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with a large excess of deoxyHb. The reaction leveled off within 5 min with 60–80% of the nitrite converted to NO (Fig. 2A). The assay used (see above) will measure heme-NO with the NO bound to either Fe(II) or Fe(III). The binding of NO to Fe(II) is very strong with a very slow off-rate (23Sharma V.S. Ranney H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6467-6472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulting in a stable complex. However, the binding of NO to Fe(III) is much weaker (24Sharma V.S. Traylor T.G. Gardiner R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and this complex is not expected to be stable in the presence of oxygen, which readily reacts with NO producing nitrite. To help identify the heme-NO species present during nitrite reduction, the sample was oxygenated after the anaerobic reaction of deoxyHb with nitrite proceeded for 40 min (Fig. 2B). The 42% reduction in signal intensity after oxygenation indicates that even 40 min after nitrite reduction was initiated a major fraction of the heme-NO is not stable in the presence of oxygen and is presumably Hb(III)NO. Although free nitric oxide will also disappear as a result of the reaction with oxygen, in the presence of an excess of deoxyHb no free NO is expected to be present. To confirm that Hb(II)NO does not contribute to this unstable pool of NO, it was shown that the heme-NO signal was not affected by oxygenation when Hb(II)NO was prepared by directly mixing deoxyHb with NO gas at a ratio of 1000:1 (data not shown). EPR Spectroscopic Determination of Hb(III), Hb(II)NO and Hb(III)NO during Nitrite Reduction by DeoxyHb—EPR can unambiguously identify both Hb(III) and Hb(II)NO. EPR is, however, less sensitive than chemiluminescence, and it was necessary to perform these experiments with higher concentrations of reactants. These experiments were performed at 250 μm nitrite with a 4-fold excess of deoxyHb (1 mm). Fig. 3A shows an increase in the Hb(III) signal in the region of g = 6 over the basal level and the generation of an Hb(II)NO signal in the region of g = 2 during the reaction of nitrite with deoxyHb. EPR, however, does not directly detect Hb(III)NO, because of the coupling of the unpaired electron on the nitric oxide with that of the paramagnetic Hb(III). The amount of NO bound to Hb(III) can, however, be quantitated by displacing this weakly bound NO with argon resulting in an increase in the Hb(III) signal (25Ribeiro J.M. Hazzard J.M. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The increase in the intensity of the Hb(III) signal by flushing with argon (Fig. 3A) is indicative of the presence of labile Hb(III)NO. Also shown in Fig. 3B is the increase in the g = 2 signal for Hb(II)NO after flushing with argon. This effect is attributed to the binding of the NO released from Fe(III) to other Fe(II) sites present in deoxyHb. On the basis of the EPR data, after a 10-min reaction of 1 mm Hb with 250 μm nitrite, Hb(III)NO accounts for most of the NO formed with 77 μm Hb(III)NO and only 11.5 μm Hb(II)NO. To quantitate the time-dependent formation of Hb(III)NO, we have compared the chemiluminescence assay of total heme-NO and the EPR determination of Hb(II)NO at the same 4:1 heme:nitrite molar ratio (Fig. 3C). The finding that the reaction detected by chemiluminescence is so much faster than that of Hb(II)NO measured directly by EPR clearly indicates that the heme-NO detected by chemiluminescence in the early stages of the reaction (Figs. 2A and 3C) is primarily Hb(III)NO and not Hb(II)NO. Nitrite Reduction in Vivo—Fig. 4 shows that Hb(II)NO was produced when deoxygenated red blood cells (30% hct) were incubated with low levels of nitrite approaching the 500 nm plasma level of nitrite (22Preik-Steinhoff H. Kelm M. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1996; 685: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 the basal Hb(II)NO signal corresponding to 0.056 μm Hb(II)NO increased to 0.11, 0.32, and 0.84 μm when the cells were incubated with 1, 5, and 10 μm nitrite, respectively. To determine whether nitrite reduction actually occurs in vivo, we have quantitated the level of Hb(III)NO in red blood cells utilizing the instability of Hb(III)NO relative to Hb(II)NO in the presence of oxygen (Fig. 2B). We measured the total heme-NO by diluting the hemolysate (arterial and venous) in argon flushed water and only the more stable Hb(II)NO by diluting in oxygenated water (Fig. 5A). The decrease in signal for the oxygenated sample is a lower limit of the level of Hb(III)NO present in the sample. The presence of unstable Hb(III)NO in red blood cells was also confirmed by EPR results on two samples of fresh venous blood for which the Hb(III) intensity increased when NO bound to Hb(III) decomposes in the presence of oxygen (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C and Table I shows the average values for heme-NO of arterial and venous blood determined by chemiluminescence. These results indicate that the major fraction of heme-NO (∼75%) consists of Hb(III)NO with red blood cells obtained from both arterial and venous blood (Fig. 5C). The arterial red blood cells had 0.00108 ± 0.0004% Hb(III)NO that corresponds to 201 ± 72 nm. The venous red blood cells had 0.00176 ± 0.0003% Hb(III)NO, which corresponds to 353 ± 61 nm. These values would correspond to values in whole blood of 80.4 nm Hb(III)NO in arterial blood and 141.2 nm Hb(III)NO in venous blood.Table IArterial and venous heme-NOMol Hb(II)NO/mol HbaNitrosylated hemoglobin in red blood cells and in whole blood was calculated based on the red blood cell heme concentration of 20 mm and whole blood heme concentration of 8 mm.Hb(II)NOMol Hb(III)NO/mol HbaNitrosylated hemoglobin in red blood cells and in whole blood was calculated based on the red blood cell heme concentration of 20 mm and whole blood heme concentration of 8 mm.Hb(III)NOTotal heme-NO%nm%nmnmArterial RBC0.00040 ± 0.001681 ± 360.00108 ± 0.0004201 ± 72282Venous RBC0.00052 ± 0.000157103 ± 320.00176 ± 0.0003353 ± 61456Arterial blood32.480.4112.8Venous blood41.2141.2182.4a Nitrosylated hemoglobin in red blood cells and in whole blood was calculated based on the red blood cell heme concentration of 20 mm and whole blood heme concentration of 8 mm. Open table in a new tab The values of Hb(II)NO in arterial RBCs was 0.0004 ± 0.00016%, which corresponds to ∼ 81 ± 36 nm, whereas venous red blood cells contained 0.00052 ± 0.000157%, which corresponds to 103 ± 32 nm. The levels Hb(II)NO would be 32.4 nm in arterial circulation and 41.2 nm in venous circulation. The reaction of nitric oxide with smooth muscle guanylate cyclase plays a crucial role in the regulation of vascular tone and blood flow (1Lancaster Jr., J.R. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Although most of the nitric oxide is synthesized in the endothelial cells lining the walls of the larger arteries, the flow through the microcirculation is in large part determined by the pre-capillary resistant arterioles.

To examine the interrelationship between these sites, cells were transfected with wild-type (WT), T497A, T497D, S1179D, and T497A/S1179D eNOS and activity, NO release and eNOS localization were assessed. Although eNOS T497A, S1179D and T497A/S1179D eNOS had greater enzymatic activity than did WT eNOS in lysates, basal production of NO from cells was markedly reduced in cells transfected with T497A and T497A/S1179D eNOS but augmented in cells transfected with S1179D eNOS. Stimulating cells with ATP or ionophore normalized the loss of function seen with T497A and T497A/S1179D eNOS to levels observed with WT and S1179D eNOS, respectively. Despite these functional differences, the localization of eNOS mutants were similar to WT. Because both T497A and T497A/S1179D eNOS exhibited higher enzyme activity but reduced production of NO, we examined whether these mutations were “uncoupling” NO synthesis. T497A and T497A/S1179D eNOS generated 2-3 times more superoxide anion than WT eNOS, and both basal and stimulated interactions of T497A/S1179D eNOS with hsp90 were reduced in co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

Due to its importance to overall cardiovascular health, nature has evolved multiple control mechanisms that tightly regulate the enzymatic function of eNOS. eNOS is a prototype for proteins regulated by spatial and temporal signals, namely subcellular targeting to the Golgi complex and lipid rafts/caveolae by protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation events (1Fulton D. Gratton J.P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar). These complex post-translational mechanisms control the state of eNOS activation/inactivation and the fidelity of electron flux through the reductase domain of the protein to the oxygenase domain where the chemistry of NO synthesis occurs. Dysregulation of the synthesis of eNOS cofactors, protein-protein interactions, and phosphorylation could potentially “uncouple eNOS,” i.e. electron transfer reactions result in the production of superoxide, instead of NO. eNOS can be phosphorylated on serines 116, 617, 635, and 1179 and phosphorylated on threonine 497 (bovine amino acids) (2Gallis B.

Using cells transfected with a de-phosphomutant of eNOS (T495A in human eNOS), there is an enhanced interaction of the essential allosteric regulator calmodulin, which correlates well with increased eNOS calcium sensitivity in vitro.

Because the T495A eNOS mutant (de-phospho) demonstrated enhanced calcium sensitivity compared with T495D eNOS (potential phosphomimetic) and the rate of electron flux through the reductase domain of eNOS critically determines eNOS activity and the potential for uncoupling eNOS (12Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Here we show that T497A eNOS increases NOS activity in cell lysates but reduces basal NO production in intact cells. Combining eNOS T497A with a mutation of Ser1179 that renders eNOS constitutively active to produce NO (eNOS S1179D) generates an extremely active enzyme (eNOS T497A/S1179D) but neutralizes the ability of S1179D eNOS to produce basal and stimulated NO and promotes eNOS-dependent superoxide anion release. Thus, the phosphorylation of threonine 497 is a critical residue that may be an intrinsic mechanism to balance whether eNOS generates NO versus superoxide anion in cells. Cell Culture Conditions—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs, passages 4-8), COS-7, and HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. All of the experiments using these cells were done when cells reached confluency in 100-mm dishes for BAECs or in 6-well plates for COS-7 and HEK 293 cells. Prior to agonist stimulation, BAECs or transfected COS-7 cells were rendered quiescent in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 or 6 h, respectively, before the addition of 1 μm ionomycin (Sigma), 1 μm PMA (Calbiochem), 10 μm ATP (Sigma), or 50 ng/ml VEGF (Genentech) at various time points. eNOS Constructs—The mutant bovine eNOS constructs were generated by standard cloning methods. The S1179D, T497A, and T497D mutant eNOS constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The T497A/S1179D double mutant eNOS construct was generated by subcloning the XhoI/XbaI fragment of S1179D mutant eNOS into the T497A construct. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Human eNOS constructs (wild-type, Ala495, and Asp495 also called T495A and T495D in this paper) were generated as described previously (7Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Generation of Stable Cell Line—COS-7 or HEK 293 cells were transfected with the bovine eNOS cDNA (wild-type or mutants) with or without an HA-tagged hsp90 cDNA construct (14Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's protocol. Transiently transfected cells were used 48 h post-transfection. Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were used in superoxide anion measurements and were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 for 2-3 weeks. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immediately after agonist stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and subsequently lysed in buffer that contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 0.3 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, 20 mm Na2MoO4, 5 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. Cell lysates were Douncehomogenized (50 strokes) and rotated at 4 °C for 15 min before the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. In some experiments, after normalizing for equal protein concentration, lysates supernatant were either collected or precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads. Pre-cleared samples were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged hsp90 followed by protein G-Sepharose incubation. In other experiments, eNOS and associated proteins were concentrated by affinity binding to 2′-5′-ADP-Sepharose beads after samples had been precleared with Sepharose. Proteins in both the cell lysates and immunoprecipitate were heated in SDS sample buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE. Following overnight transfer of the proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes, Western blots were performed using anti-HA or phospho-specific antibodies against Ser1179 (Cell Signaling) or Thr497 (3Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The blots were then stripped and re-probed for total eNOS (9D10, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). NO Release from Transfected Cells—48 h after transfection of eNOS mutants into COS-7 or HEK 293 cells, the media were processed for the measurement of nitrite (NO2-), a stable breakdown product of NO in aqueous solution, by NO-specific chemiluminescence (8Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Samples collected from basal overnight accumulation of (NO2-) in serum media were treated with 100% cold EtOH to precipitate serum proteins. After removing serum proteins by centrifugation, sample supernatants were subjected to speed vacuum to remove EtOH. The same cells were then incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 6 h, and fresh medium was added to accumulate preagonist nitrite for 30 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 1 mm l-NAME during the 30-min preagonist nitrite accumulation. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with agonists (1 μm ionomycin, 10 μm ATP or 5 μm A23187, Sigma) for another 30 min to allow post-agonist nitrite accumulation. The medium was then harvested, and nitrite accumulation was measured using NO-specific chemiluminescence. The cells were lysed with either 1 m NaOH or lysis buffer as described above to determine the total protein concentration. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting analysis to demonstrate equal eNOS expression in all of the samples. NOS Activity Assay—The activity of the different eNOS mutants was monitored by conversion of l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline. Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in the lysis buffer described above without Na2MoO4 or ATP. After removing the insoluble material by centrifugation, the supernatant was assayed to normalize protein concentration. 100 μg of total protein was used per assay reaction and was diluted in a total volume of 100 μl of activity assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 nm calmodulin (Sigma), 1 mm NADPH (Sigma), 15 μm BH4 (6R-tetrahydro-l-biopterin, Sigma), 8.6 μm l-arginine (Sigma), 1.4 μm l-[14C]arginine (348 mCi/mmol), and 2.5 mm CaCl2 (Sigma). All of the reaction samples were kept on ice until incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 5.5, 2 mm EDTA, and2mm EGTA to each sample. The samples were then passed through Dowex AG50WX8 cation exchange resin, and the flow-through was counted on a liquid scintillation analyzer. eNOS Localization—Transiently transected COS-7 cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by cell permeabilization using 0.1% Triton X-100. Prior to incubation with anti-eNOS mAb (clone H32, Biomol), cells were blocked with 5% goat serum for 20 min. Immunofluorescent staining of eNOS was visualized using an AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells were then counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize the nuclei. Z-series images were captured using the Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope and deconvolved using the Openlab 3.1.3 image analysis software (Improvision). Measurement of Superoxide Anion—Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were grown to confluency prior to analysis for NO release or superoxide anion production measured by ferricytochrome c reduction (15Pritchard Jr., K.A. Groszek L. Smalley D.M. Sessa W.C. Wu M. Villalon P. Wolin M.S. Stemerman M.B. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 1 mm l-NAME for 30 min before washing with Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution and incubated with 50 μm ferricytochrome c and 5 μm A23187 with or without 1 mm l-NAME in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution for another 30 min. The same experiment was carried out in the presence of 1000 units/ml superoxide dismutase. Rates of superoxide anion release were calculated from superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c absorbance at 550 nm using the molar extinction coefficient ϵ = 21,000 m-1 cm-1. To characterize the relationship between eNOS phosphorylation on Thr497 and Ser1179, BAECs were challenged with three agonists, PMA, VEGF, or ionomycin and the time course of changes in phosphorylation was examined using phosphospecific antibodies. As seen in Fig. 1A, PMA increased the extent of phosphorylation on Thr497, a known protein kinase C phosphorylation site, but did not influence phosphorylation on Ser1179. VEGF, an agonist that signals via a receptor tyrosine kinase, stimulated the time-dependent phosphorylation on Ser1179 that was maximal 1-3 min after agonist challenge but did not influence Thr497 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Treatment of BAEC with ionomycin to promote the release of calcium and capacitive calcium entry into cells stimulated the time-dependent phosphorylation on Ser1179 and dephosphorylation of Thr497. Thus, distinct agonists exert differential regulation of Thr497 versus Ser1179. It has been suggested that the dephosphorylation of Thr497 is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of Ser1179. To examine the interrelationship between these sites in a defined reconstituted system, COS cells were transfected with WT eNOS and the following mutants, T497A, S1179D, and T497A/S1179D eNOS and then stimulated with ionomycin to examine the time course of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on Ser1179 and Thr497. The rationale was that since T497A exhibits enhanced calcium sensitivity and calmodulin binding (7Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and S1179D is a constitutively active form of eNOS that also lowers the threshold for calcium-calmodulin activation (13McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), combining the two mutants should create synergy between the sites. As seen in Fig. 2A, the basal phosphorylation on Ser1179 is very low at time 0 (in cells transfected with WT and T497A eNOS), whereas the basal phosphorylation on Thr497 is high (in cells transfected with WT and S1179D eNOS). Ionomycin stimulation of cells transfected with WT eNOS resulted in a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation on Ser1179 and a decrease in phosphorylation on Thr497, consistent with the data in BAEC (Fig. 1C). A similar increase in phosphorylation on Ser1179 was seen in cells transfected with T497A eNOS showing that the level of Thr497 phosphorylation has no significant influence on the extent of Ser1179 phosphorylation in this reconstituted system. The constitutively active eNOS S1179D was highly phosphorylated on Thr497 and was partially dephosphorylated upon challenge with ionomycin. In cells transfected with T497A/S1179D eNOS, no phosphosignal was present documenting the specificity of the antibodies. Thus, both WT and S1179D eNOS are highly phosphorylated on Thr497. We next examined NOS enzymatic activity of the different eNOS constructs. Transfection of COS cells with WT eNOS increased NOS activity (under V max conditions) in detergent-solubilized cell lysates (Fig. 2B). Both T497A and S1179D eNOS exhibited greater enzyme activity (2-2.5-fold) than WT eNOS, whereas the activity of T497D eNOS was comparable with that of WT enzyme. Transfection with the double mutant, T497A/S1179D, eNOS resulted in a large increase in enzymatic activity (5-fold) compared with WT eNOS and the other mutants. Thus, combining T497A and S1179D mutations generates a highly active form of the enzyme. Because the rate of eNOS activity correlates well with the production of NO for WT and S1179D eNOS, we examined basal (24-h accumulation) and ATP-stimulated (30-min collection period) NO release measured as nitrite (NO2-) from COS cells transfected with the different eNOS constructs. Transfection with WT eNOS increased basal (Fig. 3A) and ATP-stimulated (Fig. 3B) NO2- release from cells. Transfection with constitutively active S1179D eNOS enhanced both basal and stimulated NO2- release from cells compared with WT eNOS. Surprisingly, transfection with T497A, T497D, and T497A/S1179D all resulted in reduced basal accumulation of NO2- (Fig. 3A). In contrast, upon challenge with ATP, equivalent amounts of NO2- were produced from T497A eNOS compared with WT enzyme, whereas NO release from T497D eNOS remained depressed. Challenging cells expressing either T497A/S1179D eNOS or S1179D eNOS with ATP resulted in similar amounts of NO2- release. We repeated the above experiments using ionomycin as an agonist for NO release and obtained similar results (Fig. 3, C and D). Basal accumulation of NO2- (Fig. 3C) was reduced in cells transfected with T497A, T497D and T497A/S1179D eNOS and following stimulation (Fig. 3D), the deficit in NO production was partially compensated or rescued. These data suggest that the lack of phosphorylation on Thr497 in eNOS impairs the ability of eNOS to produce NO in the absence of an agonist challenge (“calcium-independent” activation), but is functionally “normalized” by stimulation with two distinct calcium-mobilizing agonists. We also compared basal and stimulated NO2- release from COS cells transfected with human eNOS constructs (WT, T495A, T495D) to assess if the above effects were particular to bovine eNOS. As seen in Fig. 3, E and F, both T495A and T495D human eNOS exhibited reduced basal accumulation of NO2-, an effect partially overcome by the stimulation of cells with ionomycin. Thus, the enhanced NOS activity observed with T497A and T497A/S1179D eNOS and comparable activities between WT and T497D eNOS do not precisely correlate with basal or stimulated NO generation of NO2-, as is typically seen with WT and S1179D eNOS. One possible explanation for the inability of Thr497 mutants to produce NO synthesis may be because of impaired localization of eNOS. Indeed, eNOS localization is necessary for the fidelity of stimulus-dependent NO release (16Sessa W.C. García-Cardeña G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 17Fulton D. Fontana J. Sowa G. Gratton J.P. Lin M. Li K.X. Michell B. Kemp B.E. Rodman D. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4277-4284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To examine the localization of eNOS, WT, T497A, T497D, S1179D, and T497A/S1179D eNOS constructs were transfected into COS cells and eNOS localization was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using an eNOS mAb. As seen in Fig. 4, all of the eNOS constructs localized to the perinuclear region of cells and the plasmalemma. Thus, all of the constructs tested localized in a similar fashion to WT eNOS. We next rationalized that the apparent discrepancy in NOS activity assays versus NO release may be explained by a defect in the coupling of l-arginine metabolism to NO synthesis. Clearly, the rate of electron flux from the reductase domain of eNOS is tightly coupled to NO synthesis in the oxygenase domain. Enhancement of electron flux by calmodulin binding or by a phosphomimetic substitution of Ser1179 with aspartate (S1179D eNOS) results in an equivalent increase in electron flux and NO synthesis. Moreover, both WT and S1179D eNOS exhibit low level superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction under conditions of l-arginine deprivation (8Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar, 13McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) Mutation of the serine residue Ser1412 to aspartate in neuronal NOS, a site equivalent to the phosphorylation site Ser1179 in eNOS, accelerates electron flux in the neuronal NOS reductase domain and results in less NO release, suggesting an optimal coupling of electron flux to NO generation (18Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the rate of electron flux into the heme domains of different NOS isoforms regulates the coupling of l-arginine metabolism to NO synthesis. Perhaps if Thr497 phosphorylation regulates the fidelity of electron transfer coupled to NO synthesis, mutations preventing the phosphorylation of Thr497 may permit eNOS to generate superoxide anions. To test this hypothesis, stable cell lines were generated in HEK 293 cells expressing equivalent amounts of WT, T497A, and T497A/S1179D eNOS and the production of superoxide anion was assessed by superoxide dismutase-sensitive ferricytochrome c reduction and NO2- was quantified. As seen in Fig. 5A, the three cell lines expressed similar levels of eNOS protein by Western blotting. The basal levels of superoxide produced by the cells were lower than the limits of detection for this assay. Stimulation of cells with ionophore resulted in barely detectable superoxide anion production from cells expressing WT eNOS (solid bar). However, the addition of l-NAME enhanced the detection of superoxide (open bar), presumably by eliminating the quenching action of eNOS-derived NO on superoxide anion generated from non-NOS sources. In contrast, cells expressing T497A eNOS and T497A/S1179D eNOS produced much more superoxide, an effect reduced by treatment of the cells with l-NAME. Similar to cells transiently transfected with these constructs, basal NO2- release was less for cells stably transfected with T497A or T497A/S1179D eNOS (14.4 ± 0.5, 8.3 ± 0.4*, and 10.9 ± 0.6*‡ nmol NO2-/mg protein for cells expressing WT, T497A, and T497A/S1179D eNOS, respectively; p < 0.05, compared with WT (*) and compared with T497A (‡)). Moreover, ionophore-stimulated NO2- was comparable with WT in cells expressing T497A eNOS or T497A/S1179D eNOS (Fig. 5B). Thus, the mutation of Thr497 to a residue that cannot be phosphorylated, perhaps mimicking the de-phosphostate, augments the ability of eNOS to serve as a superoxide anion generator at the expense of NO synthesis. The ability of T497A and T497A/S1179D eNOS to produce superoxide anion instead of NO synthesis may explain, in part, the discordance between the elevated NOS activity in broken cell lysates and reduced NO production from cells transfected with these constructs. If T497A eNOS and T497A/S1179D eNOS were not uncoupled, the production of NO under basal and stimulated conditions should have exceeded the levels obtained from cells expressing WT or S1179D eNOS, respectively (see Fig. 3). Recent evidence suggests that the association of eNOS with the molecular chaperone, hsp90, may influence many functions of eNOS including coupling l-arginine metabolism to NO biosynthesis (19Pritchard Jr., K.A. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 20Song Y.

Med. 2003; 34: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To examine the interaction of eNOS with hsp90, WT eNOS and different eNOS mutants were co-transfected with HA-tagged hsp90 and the levels of phosphorylation and interaction with hsp90 were examined. As seen in Fig. 5C, the levels of eNOS and HA-hsp90 expression in lysates were identical with the expected time-dependent changes in phosphorylation similar to data in Fig. 2. Immunoprecipitation of HA-hsp90 in non-stimulated cells (time 0) resulted in equal amounts of eNOS recovered from cells expressing WT and T497A eNOS. However, the interaction of eNOS with hsp90 was increased in cells transfected with S1179D eNOS and virtually eliminated with cells expressing T497A/S1179D eNOS (Fig. 5D). After stimulation with ionophore, the interaction of WT and T497A eNOS with hsp90 were similar, whereas the enhanced interaction of S1179D with hsp90 was maintained. In contrast, both basal and stimulated interaction of T497A/S1179D eNOS with hsp90 was less than that seen with the other constructs. Thus, an altered interaction with hsp90 may be an additional mechanism to account for the elevated capacity of T497A/S1179D eNOS to produce superoxide anion. Collectively, the data suggest that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Thr497 in bovine eNOS or Thr495 in human eNOS does not change eNOS subcellular localization but may regulate NO production and determine the generation of NO versus superoxide anion upon stimulation of cells. Most strikingly, combining the T497A mutation with the well characterized “gain-of-function” mutant S1179D eNOS results in a very active enzyme in vitro. The basal release of NO from cells expressing T497A/S1179D eNOS is effectively lower than WT eNOS and markedly less than that observed with S1179D eNOS. However, upon agonist challenge, both T497A eNOS and T497A/S1179D eNOS behave similarly to WT and S1179D eNOS, respectively, despite their higher activities in broken cell assays. This finding suggests that at rest, in the absence of a marked increase in cytoplasmic calcium, the S1179D mutation removes the autoinhibitory loop located in the carboxyl tail of eNOS (13McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 24Lane P. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19087-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), thus increasing electron flux, improving the calcium sensitivity of the enzyme and its interaction with hsp90, and resulting in an enhanced basal NO release. This occurs despite the fact that Thr497 is phosphorylated in WT and S1179D eNOS. Upon stimulation, WT and S1179D eNOS are dephosphorylated on Thr497 and the level of NO release increases as expected. With T497A and T497A/S1179D eNOS, the apparent hysteresis of NOS activity versus NO release is complex and difficult to fully understand mechanistically. Clearly, the activity of T497A eNOS (assayed under V max conditions with optimal amounts of cofactors) is greater than WT eNOS and comparable with that of S1179D eNOS. Moreover, the activity of the combined mutant T497A/S1179D eNOS is far greater than T497A and S1179D eNOS. Despite the high in vitro NOS activities of the mutant enzymes, in contrast to WT and S1179D eNOS, T497A and T497A/S1179D eNOS produce less basal NO despite equal levels of Ser1179 phosphorylation (at least for T497A). The decrease in basal NO release may be explained by the alanine substitution at Thr497 reducing the affinity of a key NOS cofactor/regulator from performing its function in a cellular context or changing the alignment of the reductase and oxygenase domains, effects overcome by agonist stimulation. This possibility is predicated on the data that eNOS is normally localized in the cells (Fig. 4) and the reasonable assumption that the cellular levels of l-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin are similar in the different transfectants. Evidence supporting an altered protein-protein interaction are the data demonstrating enhanced co-association of hsp90 with S1179D eNOS and reduced co-association of hsp90 with T497A/S1179D eNOS under basal conditions. However, the interaction of T497A with hsp90 and phosphorylation on Ser1179 are similar to WT eNOS. Thus, changes in the interaction of hsp90 with eNOS cannot fully explain this phenomenon. Another possibility is that Thr497 phosphorylation regulates the fidelity of electron flux coupled to NO synthesis under basal conditions (i.e. resting levels of calcium in the cell), and upon agonist challenge, enhanced calmodulin binding, regulatory protein-protein interactions, and phosphorylation of other sites maintain NO release despite the capacity to produce superoxide triggered by Thr497 dephosphorylation. These data with T49A eNOS are consistent with a recent report (14Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) showing that adenoviral transduction of endothelial cells with hsp90 increases both basal and stimulated Ser1179 and Thr497 phosphorylation concomitantly with enhanced basal and stimulated NO release, suggesting that phosphorylation of Thr497 promotes the coupling of eNOS and NO synthesis. In summary, our data imply that the phosphorylation of Thr497 in eNOS may be important for the coupling of l-arginine metabolism to NO synthesis. It is possible that upon dephosphorylation of Thr497, eNOS may serve a generator of both superoxide and NO. Moreover, the ability of eNOS to maintain its ability to produce NO in excess over superoxide anion production may reside in the recruitment of eNOS regulatory proteins, protein phosphorylation, and the correct alignment of the oxygenase/reductase domains of the enzyme. Our data suggest that the importance of Thr497 in eNOS is unlikely to be explained exclusively by regulating calmodulin binding to NOS. Future experiments examining how the phosphorylation of Thr497 influences NADPH-dependent electron flux through the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain and the heme environment of eNOS are clearly warranted. We thank Dr. Bruce Kemp for phospho-Thr497 antibody and Allan Ackerman for technical assistance with superoxide anion measurements."

A distinguishing feature of mucins is that they contain O-linked oligosaccharides, i.e. the sugar chains are attached to the peptide backbone via a O-glycosidic linkage between a Ser or Thr residue and a GalNAc 1The abbreviations used are: GalNAcN-acetylgalactosamineGalNAc-olN-acetylgalactosaminitolNeuAcN-acetylneuraminic acidFucfucoseMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime-of-flightMSmass spectrometryGCgas chromatographyH-3axH-3 axialH-3eqH-3 equatorial. residue.

Intestinal mucins are mainly produced by goblet cells but also by enterocytes and occur both as soluble-secreted and membrane-bound forms. High glycosylation and high mass structures give the mucins gel-forming abilities and other general physical properties that have been regarded as having a protective and rheological function at mucosal surfaces (2Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press Ltd, New York1994: 1245-1283Google Scholar). The identification of several different encoded mucins and an enormous repertoire of possible mucin oligosaccharides indicate that the tasks for these glycoproteins may be more subtle than their macroscopic properties suggest. Indeed, mucins may also provide precise structural information carried in determinants among their glycans and in the peptide core, which could mediate specific binding of antibodies, pathogenic microbes, and leukocytes, and may be important in host-pathogen interactions, inflammation, and cancer metastasis (3Van Klinken B.J.

In situ hybridization has demonstrated that MUC2 is expressed only in goblet cells in the intestine, whereas MUC3 is expressed in both goblet cells and absorptive cells (9Chang S.K. Dohrman A.F. Basbaum C.B. Ho S.B. Tsuda T. Toribara N.W. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 28-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a maturational gradient exists for MUC3. This mucin is expressed only on the mucosal surface and in the upper parts of the crypts in the colon. Thus, both the structural differences between MUC2 and MUC3 and the differences in their expression suggest that these two mucins may have different functions. Moreover, MUC4 is widely expressed in the gastrointestinal tract including the colon and the small intestine (10Porchet N. Nguyen V.C. Dufosse J. Audie J.P. Guyonnet-Duperat V. Gross M.S. Denis C.

Glycosylation is thought to be essential for the biological functions of mucins, and it has been claimed that cell type-specific mucin expression may be related to the type of glycosylation. To date, few structural studies have dealt with the glycosylation of human intestinal mucins (13Slomiany B.L. Murty V.L.N. Slomiany A. J. Biol.

These different studies suggest a regio-specific glycosylation of the mucins of the human intestinal tract. Using NMR and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques, we demonstrated the presence of decreasing gradients from ileum to rectum of fucose and ABH blood group expression and of an increasing acidic gradient along the gut. These differences in glycosylation of intestinal mucins could have important implications for the specialized biological functions these molecules play in the intestine. Moreover, we demonstrated a similar glycosylation pattern in each part of the intestine between the two individuals. All of the immediate autopsy specimens were obtained by France Transplant Association from kidney donors according to protocols approved by the National Ethical Committee. Samples of mucosa were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. The human samples from which the different parts of the gut were analyzed came from two male donors with ALeb blood group and colon type W+Z+, two antigenic specificities called W and Z by Zweibaum et al. (18Zweibaum A. Oriol R. Dausset J. Marcelli-Barge A. Ropartz C. Lanset S. Tissue Antigens. 1975; 6: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and described in normal colonic secretions. After thawing, the tissue was kept at 4 °C and the mucosa was scraped, homogenized in distilled water (Ultra-turrax, Jankee and Kunkel, Stauffer, Germany), and centrifuged (1 h at 48,000 × g). The supernatant was heated for 1 h in a boiling water bath and further centrifuged (1 h at 48,000 × g). The resultant supernatant was dialyzed against distilled water for 2 days at 4 °C and lyophilized (19Lesuffleur T. Roche F. Hill A.S. Lacasa M. Fox M. Swallow D.M. Zweibaum A. Real F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13655-13673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The colonic mucins were submitted to β-elimination under reductive conditions (0.1 m KOH, 1 m KBH4 for 24 h at 45 °C) (20Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture of oligosaccharide alditols was purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a column of Bio-Gel P2 (85 × 2 cm 400 mesh, Bio-Rad), equilibrated, and eluted with water (10 ml/h) at room temperature. The oligosaccharide fractions detected by UV absorption at 206 nm were pooled for structural analysis. The monosaccharide composition of the mucins and oligosaccharide alditol fractions were determined by gas chromatography (GC) on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph equipped with a 25 m × 0.32-mm CP-Sil5 CB Low bleed/MS capillary column and 0.25-μm film phase (Chrompack France, Les Ullis, France) after methanolysis (0.5 m HCl-methanol for 24 h at 80 °C), N-reacetylation, and trimethylsilylation (21Kamerling J.P.

Kennedy J.F. Carbohydrate Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 143-204Google Scholar). The glycoprotein-bound sialic acids were hydrolyzed (105 min at 80 °C in 2 m acetic acid) and lyophilized. The dry samples were then analyzed as described previously (23Zanetta J.P. Pons A. Iwersen M. Mariller C. Leroy Y. Timmerman P. Schauer R. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For GC/MS analysis, the GC separation was performed on a Carbo Erba GC 8000 gas chromatograph equipped with a 25 m × 0.32-mm CP-Sil5 CB Low bleed/MS capillary column, 0.25-μm film phase, and a Finnigan Automass II mass spectrometer. Analyses were performed in the electron impact mode of ionization (ionization energy, 70 eV; source temperature, 150 °C). Samples were repeatedly treated with 2H2O (99.97% 2H atoms, Euriso-top, CEA, Saclay, France). 1H Chemical shifts were expressed in parts/million downfield from TMSP (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentanoate sodium salt) but were measured by reference to the internal standard acetone (δ = 2.225 ppm). Samples were analyzed in 200 × 5-mm BMS-005B Shigemi® tubes at 300 K on a Bruker® ASX-400-NB spectrometer equipped with a double resonance (1H/X) broadband inverse z-gradient probe head. NMR samples were recorded without sample spinning. The one-dimensional 1H spectra were measured using 90°-tipping angle for the pulse and 1.5 s as recycle delay between each of the 16 acquisitions of 2.4 s. The spectral width of 4006 Hz was collected in 16,384 complex data points. Two-dimensional homonuclear spectra (TOCSY) were measured using the standard Bruker pulse program and acquired in the time phase-sensitive proportional increment method. Two-dimensional TOCSY spectra performed on oligosaccharide alditol mixture from each intestinal segment were strictly recorded with the same parameters (pulses and delays) using 120 ms as mixing time for the MLEV-17 sequence. Moreover, the spectral width was 4006 Hz in both dimensions. 512 spectra of 4096 data points with 16 scans/time incrementation of experiment in F1 dimension were recorded giving a spectral resolution of 0.9 Hz/pt in F2 and 7.8 Hz/point in F1. All of the spectra were interpreted in comparison with spectral data published for a large number of O-linked glycans and other relevant saccharides. Overviews were given by Kamerling and Vliegenthart (24Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Berliner L. Reben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Vol. 10. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-287Google Scholar) and in Sugabase, a data base available at www.boc.chem.ruu.nl/sugabase/sugabase.html. All of the mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager Elite (DE-STR) reflectron time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) and a gridless delayed extraction ion source. Oligosaccharide samples were analyzed in delayed extraction mode using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, a pulse delay time of 200 ns, and a grid voltage of 66%. Detector bias gating was used to reduce the ion current for masses below 500 Da. Between 100 and 200 scans were averaged for each mass spectrum. Oligosaccharide alditols were co-crystallized with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix (10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in methanol/water (50/50) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid supplemented with 5 mm NaCl). For all of the measurements, the “dried droplet” preparation technique was used. Typically, 1 μl of the matrix was mixed on target with 1 μl of water-dissolved oligosaccharides and allowed to dry under an air stream. They were analyzed in both positive and negative ion modes. Mucins were isolated from the different parts of normal human intestinal tract (ileum, cecum, transverse, sigmoid, and rectum) of two ALeb blood group individuals. Oligosaccharide alditols were released by base/borohydride treatment followed by desalting. The percent of saccharides that were recovered after release from the protein backbone was estimated based on monosaccharide compositional analyses of the whole mucin and of the released fraction. The yield was ∼50%, a typical yield for this procedure. After the desalting step, oligosaccharide mixtures from each part of the intestine were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy without prior derivatization or fractionation. In the current study, 1H one-dimensional (Fig. 1) and 1H-1H TOCSY-NMR spectroscopy (Figs. 2,3,4) were used to obtain information on the structure of mucin O-glycans released by reductive β-elimination. All of the analyses were performed on the same total amount of oligosaccharide alditols in each fraction to make a qualitative and a “semi-quantitative comparison” of specific sequences or blood group determinants. The one-dimensional NMR spectrum of the unfractionated mixture of O-linked glycans showed three proton areas corresponding to (i) anomeric protons, (ii) skeleton protons, and (iii) H-3 of NeuAc and methyl protons of both N-acetyl groups and Fuc residues. These three areas made it possible to compare specific sequences identified in each fraction i.e. α3or α6-linked NeuAc, Lewis groups, Sda/Cad determinants, sulfate groups, or cores of O-glycans.Fig. 2Extended regions of two-dimensional TOCSY NMR spectra of oligosaccharide alditol mixture isolated from each part of the intestinal part showing H-5/H-6 cross-peaks of fucosyl residues.

The TOCSY with mixing times of 120 ms resolved these signals. Characteristic cross-peak areas corresponding to well known structures allowed us to define typical oligosaccharidic sequences. Therefore, despite the complexity of the different classes of NMR signals, it was possible to distinguish many typical features of glycosidic sequences along the intestinal tract. Purified mucins isolated from each part of the intestine were analyzed for their carbohydrate composition. It should be noted that the mannose detected in some of the oligosaccharide fractions suggested the presence of N-linked glycans in the mucins. Because N-linked oligosaccharides are not usually released by the alkaline conditions used here, the detected mannose probably represented unreleased N-linked glycopeptides remaining after the cation-exchange step. Moreover, the lack of contamination by non-mucin glycoproteins has been assessed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. With the exception of high molecular components (over 300 kDa), no other protein was detected (data not shown). It should also be stressed that free GalNAc-ol, resulting from a single GalNAc residue attached to Ser or Thr, could not be separated from the high amount of salt used during the reductive β-elimination procedure and was completely lost by gel filtration. As indicated in Table I, the monosaccharide composition of the different mucins and oligosaccharide alditols fractions presented interesting features. Indeed, GC analyses showed an increasing gradient in the molar ratio of sialic acid from the ileum to the rectum, whereas the reverse situation was observed for Fuc.Table IMonosaccharide composition of the native mucins and oligosaccharides isolated from the different mucins after a β-elimination procedureNative mucinsaThe molar ratio of the different monosaccharides was calculated on the basis of one GalNAc residue for the native mucins and on the basis of one GalNAcol residue for the oligosaccharides.OligosaccharidesaThe molar ratio of the different monosaccharides was calculated on the basis of one GalNAc residue for the native mucins and on the basis of one GalNAcol residue for the oligosaccharides.IbIleum.CcCecum.TdTransverse.SeSigmoid.RfRectum.ICTSRDonor 1 Fuc1.10.80.650.70.62.01.81.71.51.4 Gal1.31.41.52.53.92.43.03.54.66.4 Man0.20.30.20.20.10.30.40.50.350.2 GlcNAc1.21.51.62.53.81.72.62.73.95.3 GalNAc1.01.01.01.01.00.650.650.80.70.5 NeuAc0.30.71.11.62.60.150.81.01.82.7 GalNAcol1.01.01.01.01.0Donor 2Fuc1.10.80.60.50.32.21.00.70.60.5Gal1.11.21.41.41.52.31.82.21.952.0Man0.10.20.30.30.20.10.20.50.20.2GlcNAc1.01.41.61.81.752.01.82.32.02.0GalNAc1.01.01.01.01.01.10.90.80.60.5NeuAc0.20.81.151.31.50.451.11.91.82.0GalNAcol1.01.01.01.01.0a The molar ratio of the different monosaccharides was calculated on the basis of one GalNAc residue for the native mucins and on the basis of one GalNAcol residue for the oligosaccharides.b Ileum.c Cecum.d Transverse.e Sigmoid.f Rectum. Open table in a new tab Unreduced GalNAc was detected by gas chromatography (Table I), indicating that some of the GalNAc residues were localized in a non-reducing position in the glycans. Because GalNAc-ol is always situated at the reducing position of oligosaccharide alditols, the molar ratio relative to this compound produced important information. Indeed, these results suggested the presence of A blood group and/or Sda/Cad antigens. Calculated average oligosaccharide chain length of donor 1 was substantially longer than that of donor 2, especially for the two last parts of the intestine: 14 monosaccharides versus 8 in the sigmoid and 18 versus 8 in the rectum. These oligosaccharide lengths are longer than those estimated by MS (see below). This discrepancy could be due in part to the MALDI-MS method, which favors detection of low masses, but it could also be attributed to a possible underestimation of the GalNAc-ol during monosaccharide analyses. Nevertheless, the relative differences in the lengths of oligosaccharides between the two donors suggested the presence of repeated polylactosamine structures in donor 1. The analysis of sialic acids (Table II) showed a large heterogeneity in the different portions of the gut. Throughout, Neu5Ac was the major compound. Among the O-acetylated sialic acids, 9-O-acetylation was the most important followed by 7-O-acetylation, whereas 8-O-acetylation was detected only in the sigmoid colon. Three different triacylated sialic acids were present: Neu5,8,9Ac3, Neu5,7,9Ac3, and Neu5,8Ac29-lactyl. A special concentration of O-acetylated sialic acids was found in the rectum (>40% of total sialic acids), the level being approximately twice much as in the other gut areas. The same type of profiles was observed for the two human specimens, although the detailed sialic acid pattern was different. This variation was not related to technical problems because repetitive analyses of the same samples gave reproducible results but was actually the reflection of individual variations as previously observed for the sialic acids of the human erythrocyte membranes (25Bulai T. Bratosin D. Pons A. Montreuil J. Zanetta J.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It should be strengthened that Neu5Ac9-lactyl, Neu5Gc, and 3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonic acid were never detected in these human samples, but a trace of Neu4,5Ac2 was recovered in one of the rectum samples. The presence of this sialic acid in human was already demonstrated in the glycoproteins of the human erythrocyte membranes, indicating that this acetylation was not from bacterial origin but endogenously performed by human tissues. The nomenclature of the different sialic acids was according to Schauer and Kamerling (26Schauer R. Kamerling J.P. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H.

Open table in a new tab Desalted oligosaccharide alditols were directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS after reductive β-elimination. Based on the mass of the compounds obtained by MS analysis, 71 different oligosaccharide alditols were detected in gut mucins (Table III). This number is certainly underestimated because MALDI-TOF MS only shows molecular ions and does not distinguish among isomer oligosaccharides. This observation is especially important because the complexity and number of potential isomers grow quickly as a function of the number of sugar residues. Taking into account the number of isomers, it was likely that mucins carried several hundred different oligosaccharide structures.Table IIIDeduced monosaccharide compositions of the major oligosaccharides identified by MALDI-TOF analysis in the two donors (in lightgray), in donor 1 (in medium gray) and in donor 2 (in dark gray)a Monoisotopic m/z values refer to [M+(n – 1)H + nNa]+, where the number of sodium adducts proportionally increased with the sialic acid or sulfate content.b Ileum.c Cecum.d Transverse.e Sigmoid.f Rectum.

The ileum presented the specificity of having larger mass compounds characterized by a very high degree of fucosylation and without sialic acids. In fact, 43 of the 52 oligosaccharide alditols found in this part of the gut were fucosylated, 7 of them having a single sialic acid residue, and only 6 compounds were neither fucosylated nor sialylated. None of them was sulfated. Moreover, 29 oligosaccharide alditols were specifically found in ileum but not in other intestinal areas. In agreement with the monosaccharide composition, oligosaccharides recovered in the other areas were less fucosylated and contained more sialic acid and sulfate residues. Indeed, in the cecum, 10 of the 29 oligosaccharides were sialylated and/or sulfated, whereas in the distal colon, more than half of the structures was acidic. Only small variations in the oligosaccharide repertoire were observed between the two individuals, mainly for the highly fucosylated glycans recovered in ileum. Because the sensitivity of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer decreases with the number of sugar residues, it is difficult to know whether some large oligosaccharides could be missed in these analyses or whether they are not present in the fraction. Regardless, these results suggested that glycosylation of intestinal mucins between individuals with the same blood group seemed to be quite similar. As illustrated in Table III, O-linked glycans formed an almost regular gradient from the ileum to the rectum. Indeed, with the exception of a few compounds common to all parts of the gut, all of the other compounds were found in one, two, three, or four adjacent areas without interruption. Independent of the mass of the compounds, this scheme was always respected. For example, the situation in which compounds present both in the ileum and in the rectum were absent from the three intermediate regions was never found. Although the absolute demonstration of this phenomenon would require the study of shorter portions of the gut, the absence of any except"
https://openalex.org/W2109421961,"The emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major health problem and, therefore, it is critical to develop new antibiotics with novel modes of action. FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase, plays an essential role in bacterial cell division, and its homologs are present in almost all eubacteria and archaea. During cell division, FtsZ forms polymers in the presence of GTP that recruit other division proteins to make the cell division apparatus. Therefore, inhibition of FtsZ polymerization will prevent cells from dividing, leading to cell death. Using a fluorescent FtsZ polymerization assay, the screening of >100,000 extracts of microbial fermentation broths and plants followed by fractionation led to the identification of viriditoxin, which blocked FtsZ polymerization with an IC50 of 8.2 μg/ml and concomitant GTPase inhibition with an IC50 of 7.0 μg/ml. That the mode of antibacterial action of viriditoxin is via inhibition of FtsZ was confirmed by the observation of its effects on cell morphology, macromolecular synthesis, DNA-damage response, and increased minimum inhibitory concentration as a result of an increase in the expression of the FtsZ protein. Viriditoxin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, without affecting the viability of eukaryotic cells. The emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major health problem and, therefore, it is critical to develop new antibiotics with novel modes of action. FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase, plays an essential role in bacterial cell division, and its homologs are present in almost all eubacteria and archaea.

Bacterial infection is a global health hazard. There are a number of very good clinically efficacious antibiotics in use today; however, because bacteria render almost all of these antibiotics less effective because of the development of resistance, new antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action are needed to overcome the emerging resistance problem. To date, there are ∼150–670 essential proteins that have been identified in bacteria as potential drug targets (1Ji Y. Zhang B. Van S.F. Horn Warren P. Woodnutt G. Burnham M.K.R. Rosenberg M.

To overcome resistance, existing antibiotics have been modified extensively in an attempt to maintain activity against their targets. Because efficacious modification is becoming increasingly difficult, targeting new, unexplored essential proteins to identify new classes of small molecular weight compounds is critical for the discovery of new, non-cross resistant antibacterial agents. FtsZ is a GTPase and an essential protein for cell division with homologs in almost all species of eubacteria and archaea (6Bramhill D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7Rothfield L. Justice S. Garcia-Lara J. Annu. Rev.

FtsZ shows limited sequence similarity to tubulin; however, the three-dimensional structure of FtsZ shows significant similarities with α and β tubulin (9Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). FtsZ is the most abundant of all bacterial cell division proteins, totalling ∼10,000–20,000 copies per single bacterium (10Bi E. Dai K. Subbarao S. Beall B. Lutkenhaus J. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). During vegetative growth, bacterial cells divide into two identical copies. The first stage in the cell replication process is localization of the FtsZ protein at the site of cell division where self-polymerization occurs. The polymerized FtsZ recruits other cell division proteins, including FtsA (11Addinall S.G. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7167-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Dewar S.J.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), either by direct physical interaction or by secondary protein-protein interactions, leading to the formation of a Z-ring and the initiation of the complex process of septation. All of these cell division proteins are localized at mid-cell, working in concert to constrict the cell and resulting in cell division. Because FtsZ is essential for bacterial cell division and shows a high degree of similarity among bacterial species, it presents an excellent novel target for antibacterial drug discovery. In this study, we identified viriditoxin as an inhibitor of bacterial cell division and studied its mechanism of action and broad-spectrum antibacterial properties. Isolation, Purification, and Identification of Viriditoxin—Aspergillus sp. (MF6890) was isolated from herbivore dung collected in Arizona. It was grown on a seed medium consisting of 4 g of yeast extract, 8 g of malt extract, 4 g of glucose, and 1.5 g of junlon (Nihon Junyaku Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) in 1 liter of distilled water at pH 7.0. After 4 days, it was transferred to a vermiculite-based production medium consisting of (per liter) 150 g of glucose, 20 g of glycerol, 4 g of yeast extract, 1 g of sodium nitrate, 3 g of monosodium glutamate, 0.5 g of Na2HPO4, 1 g of MgSO4.7H2O, and 8 g of CaCO3. The fermentation broth was extracted with methyl ethyl ketone and successively chromatographed on Sephadex LH 20 in methanol followed by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography affording 2 mg/liter of viriditoxin. The structure of viriditoxin was elucidated by 1H, 13C, and two-dimensional NMR methods and mass spectral studies. Protein Purification—FtsZ and FtsZT65C were purified as described (25Trusca D. Bramhill D. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) was transformed with plasmid pET11a-ftsZwt or pET11a-ftsZT65C and induced by adding 1 mm IPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; wt, wild type. to mid-log culture (A 600 = 0.5 ∼ 0.6). Cultures were harvested after 1 h at 37 °C. To purify FtsZ and FtsZT65C, the cells were allowed to lyse for 30 min at 0 °C in Buffer A (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, and 10% sucrose) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). The lysed cells were then sonicated with four 30-s bursts using a microprobe. After centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a 45 Ti rotor for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was adjusted to 10 mm MgCl2, solid ammonium sulfate was added (0.17 g/ml), and the cells were centrifuged for 1 h again. Ammonium sulfate pellets of FtsZwt (wild type) were resuspended in Buffer B (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) while ammonium sulfate pellets of FtsZT65C were suspended in buffer B with 1 mm reducing agent Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl). FtsZwt or FtsZT65C was loaded separately onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a KCl gradient from 80 to 600 mm KCl. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The FtsZ- or FtsZT65C-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using Amicon. The fluorescein-labeled FtsZT65C was prepared by incubating the purified FtsZT65C with 2 mm fluorescein iodoacetamide for 25 min in the same buffer on ice, and the free dye was removed by using a Sephadex G25 column. All proteins were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. FtsZ Polymerization Assay—The assay was done as described previously (25Trusca D. Bramhill D. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, the NUNC 96-well Silent Screen filter plates were pre-washed with wash Buffer C (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 67.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.1% Tween.) followed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at room temperature for 15 min in a Beckman tabletop centrifuge. The fluorescence-labeled FtsZT65C (FtsZT65C-fluorescein) was pre-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to removes any pre-existing polymers. The FtsZ polymerization assay was done by mixing 1 μm fluorescence-labeled FtsZT65C with a serial dilution of inhibitors in 200 μl of Buffer D (50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 34 mm KCl, 0.75 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm GTP, and 2% Me2SO) and initiated with 50 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the filter plates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min, and the fluorescence units were read on the Tecan SpectraFluor with 485/535-nm filters. The range of reading was between 3,000 and 40,000 fluorescence units. IC50 was determined using Prism Graph. GTPase Assay—GTPase activity was measured and analyzed as described (25Trusca D. Bramhill D. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1999: 123-151Google Scholar) with a small modification. Briefly, this assay was performed at 37 °C in a 50-μl buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 34 mm KCl, 0.75 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml DEAE-dextran, 2% Me2SO, GTP, and pre-centrifuged FtsZ or FtsZT65C-fluorescein. The concentrations of GTP and the proteins as well as the time of the reaction are indicated in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, 5. Assays were stopped by the addition of activated charcoal, and the supernatant was counted.Fig. 4Time course of GTPase activity with or without addition of viriditoxin. The GTPase assay was described in the legend of Fig. 3 and under “Experimental Procedures.” In this study, the GTP hydrolysis of wild type FtsZ (○) and FtsZT65C-fluorescein with (▪) or without (•) 200 μg/ml of viriditoxin was measured at the different times shown on the abscissa. The concentrations of FtsZ and FtsZT65C-fluorescein were at 1 μm, except when FtsZT65C-fluorescein was measured at 0.2 μm (▵). The final concentration of GTP was 40 μm with the addition of a trace amount of [γ-32P]GTP, yielding 60 cpm/pmol. The other components were identical to Fig. 3.

The final concentration of GTP was 40 μm with the addition of a trace amount of [γ-32P]GTP, yielding 85.6 cpm/pmol. Similar experiments were performed twice in duplicate providing IC50 values of 6.6 ± 1.3 and 7.4 ± 1.4 μg/ml, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Morphology Assay—Cell morphology was observed with an inverted microscope, Axiovert 135M (Zeiss), at 20 × 650 magnification. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)—The MIC against each of the strains was determined according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic inhibiting visible growth. Whole Cell-labeling Assay—The effect of viriditoxin on macromolecular synthesis was performed as described (27Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M.-H. Patchett A.A. Galloway S.M. Hyland S.A. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. Science. 1996; 274: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). MIC Assay with FtsZ Expression—A permeable (envA–) BL21(DE3)pLysS-derivative Escherichia coli strain was constructed using standard P1 transduction methodology (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar), utilizing a Tn10 transposon linked to the envA1 gene (29Young K. Silver L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3609-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cells were transformed with the plasmid pET11a-ftsZT65C. The MICs of viriditoxin against the transformed cells were assayed at increasing concentrations of IPTG in LB medium containing 25 μg/ml of ampicillin and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C for 20 h. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. A high-throughput FtsZT65C-fluorescein polymerization assay has been developed (25Trusca D. Bramhill D. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) for identification of novel inhibitors. Using this assay, we screened >100,000 extracts of microbial fermentation broths and plants, getting a hit rate of 0.043%. All the active extracts were tested secondarily for filament morphology and also in an SOS induction assay (30Huisman O. D'Ari R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 169-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to further refine the quality of the actives providing only eight promising hits. Although many of these are still under active investigation, bioassay-guided purification of one of the most promising active extracts derived from an Aspergillus sp. led to the isolation of viriditoxin (Fig. 1), which was first reported in 1971 from Aspergillus viridinutans (31Weisleder D. Lillehoj E.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1971; 48: 4705-4706Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At the time of original discovery, the structure of viriditoxin was incorrectly assigned and was reported to have an LD50 of 2.8 mg/kg to mice (31Weisleder D. Lillehoj E.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1971; 48: 4705-4706Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structure was corrected in 1990 (32Suzuki K. Nozawa K. Nakajma S. Kawai K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1990; 38: 3180-3181Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The spectral data (NMR, mass spectroscopy, and UV) of the isolated compound was identical to the reported data of viriditoxin (32Suzuki K. Nozawa K. Nakajma S. Kawai K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1990; 38: 3180-3181Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, a subsequent report in 1976 suggested that it showed a lower level of toxicity to pregnant mice at up to 3.5 mg/kg for 10 days (33Hood R.D. Hayes A.W. Scammell J.G. Food Cosmet. Toxicol. 1976; 14: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was reported that it had little effect on prenatal survival or growth (33Hood R.D. Hayes A.W. Scammell J.G. Food Cosmet. Toxicol. 1976; 14: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The activity of purified viriditoxin was first confirmed in the FtsZT65C-fluorescein polymerization assay. It inhibited the polymerization with an IC50 average value of 8.2 μg/ml (n = 3) (Fig. 2). To confirm that viriditoxin inhibits wild type FtsZ polymerization, we compared the GTPase activity of the wild type FtsZ directly with FtsZT65C-fluorescein. For this study, we used purified wild type FtsZ and FtsZT65C-fluorescein. The Km values for GTP of wild type FtsZ and FtsZT65C-fluorescein are similar, providing an average value of 19.4 μm (n = 2) and 19.7μm (n = 3), respectively. The V max of FtsZT65C-fluorescein is 1.15 mol of Pi/mol of protein/min, whereas the V max of wild type FtsZ is 1.40 mol of Pi/mol of protein/min (an 18% difference; Fig. 3). The Km of wild type FtsZ was comparable with data reported in previous publications (34Sossong T.M.J. Brigham-Burke M.R. Hensley P. Pearce K.H.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the V max of wild type FtsZ was also comparable with published data (35Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), although the assay conditions were not identical. At a fixed concentration of 40 μm GTP with 1 μm wild type FtsZ or 1 μm FtsZT65C-fluorescein, at 37 °C, the t ½ values of steady-state GTP hydrolysis were 11.7 and 15.9 min, respectively (Fig. 4). Because GDP/GTP exchange (35Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) is not rate-limiting, the apparent rate constants of GTP hydrolysis of both wild type FtsZ and FtsZT65C-fluorescein are apparently 0.059 and 0.043 min–1, respectively, further indicating that both proteins have similar GTPase properties. Because the polymerization of FtsZ is GTP-dependent and the GTPase activity of FtsZ is activated by self-polymerization (34Sossong T.M.J. Brigham-Burke M.R. Hensley P. Pearce K.H.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we first measured GTP hydrolysis under conditions in which the polymerization of FtsZT65C-fluorescein was not detectable (0.2μm FtsZT65C-fluorescein; Fig. 4, ▵). GTP hydrolysis in 120 min was only 2 mol per mol of protein. Second, we tested the effect of viriditoxin on GTPase activity with prepolymerized FtsZT65C-fluorescein (Fig. 4, ▪). In the presence of 200 μg/ml viriditoxin, GTP hydrolysis was 2 mol per mol of protein in 120 min, consistent with the near total inhibition of polymerization by this level of viriditoxin. In contrast, the GTP hydrolysis of both wild type FtsZ and FtsZT65C-fluorescein under identical conditions but without the inhibitor was 32.7 and 33.7 mol per mol of protein, respectively (Fig. 4, ○ and •). Titration of viriditoxin into the GTP hydrolysis assay (Fig. 5) yielded an average IC50 of 7.0 μg/ml (n = 2). To measure directly the effect of viriditoxin on cell division, a morphology assay was employed (36Trusca D. Scott S. Thompson C. Bramhill D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3946-3953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Highly permeable E. coli (MB5431) cells lacking the SulA protein, the natural inhibitor of FtsZ polymerization and GTPase that is normally induced by the SOS response leading to filamentation (36Trusca D. Scott S. Thompson C. Bramhill D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3946-3953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used to reduce the likelihood of any inhibitors of DNA replication causing an indirect block of cell division. Mid-log (A 600 = 0.3) MB5431 cells were treated with the addition of a serial dilution of viriditoxin for 75 min. The cells were observed under a microscope for the formation of filaments. The viriditoxin-treated cells formed filaments at 50 (Fig. 6A) as well as at 12.5, 25, and 100 μg/ml (data not shown). Without viriditoxin treatment, cells in mid-log did not form filaments (Fig. 6B). For comparison, we tested a strain in which SulA production is under lac promoter control. The strain, HMS174 (DE3, plysS) containing pET11-SulA, was grown to log phase and then induced with IPTG for 75 min, resulting in morphological behavior similar to what was seen with viriditoxin-treated cells (Fig. 6C). Without induction by IPTG, the cells did not form filaments (Fig. 6D). To confirm that viriditoxin interacts with FtsZ in bacteria, we performed a MIC assay with the permeable E. coli-bearing pET11a-ftsZT65C. First, we tested the lethal dose of IPTG induction without the addition of viriditoxin and found that 8 μm IPTG had little effect (10% decrease) on the viability of the transformed cells under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentrations of IPTG below 8 μm did not affect cell growth and viability. Second, we tested the effect of the expression of FtsZ on MICs of viriditoxin using a serial dilution of IPTG at final concentrations of 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 μm. Without the addition of IPTG, the MIC of viriditoxin was 25 μm. With the addition of 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μm IPTG, the MIC increased to 50 μm. At 2, 4, or 8 μm IPTG, the MIC increased to 100 μm. The experiment was repeated twice with standard controls of antibiotics. Lastly, viriditoxin was evaluated for its effect against clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. The MIC values of viriditoxin are shown in Table I. It inhibited the growth of various strains of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 4–8 μg/ml. The growth of methicillin-sensitive and resistant coagulase negative strains of Staphylococcus was inhibited with similar MIC values. Viridotoxin showed MIC values of 2–16 μg/ml against various strains of vancomycin-sensitive and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. It inhibited the growth of all drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested including quinolone-, tetracycline-, macrolide-, penicillin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains with MICs similar to comparable drug-sensitive strains (2–32 μg/ml). Although the MIC of viriditoxin was >64 μg/ml against a wild type E. coli strain (MB2884), it did show inhibitory activity against the permeable (envA–) Gram-negative strain (E. coli, MB5431) with a MIC value of 25 μg/ml, indicating that penetration plays a role in the insensitivity of the compound of Gram-negative bacterial strains. In comparison, it did not show activity against Candida albicans (MIC >64 μg/ml) and human HeLa cells (MTS, IC50 >66.7 μg/ml), indicating a selectivity for prokaryotic over eukaryotic cells.Table IMIC (μg/ml) against antibiotic resistant clinical strainsOrganismAssigned number and genotypeViriditoxinTetracyclineCiprofloxacinAzithromycinStaphylococcus aureus (MS)aCells were inoculated at 105 CFU followed by incubation at 35 °C with a serial dilution of compounds in CAMHB (BBL, BD Biosciences) for 20 h.CL 9080 (MSSA)40.120.124CL 9959 (MSSA)40.250.124CL 140504>640.5>32CL 9032 macR, quinR80.25>16>32CL 8949 tetR4160.25>32CL 9689A tetR, ciproR432>16>32CL 9656 tetR4160.254Staphylococcus aureus (MR)aCells were inoculated at 105 CFU followed by incubation at 35 °C with a serial dilution of compounds in CAMHB (BBL, BD Biosciences) for 20 h.CL 8072 (MRSA)80.58>32CL 11821, MRSA, tetR8320.54CL 10197 tetR41616>32COL (MRSA)4>640.254Staphylococcus sp.

Open table in a new tab Our in vitro results indicated that viriditoxin inhibits FtsZ polymerization and GTPase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first small organic non-peptide molecule (molecular mass, 662 Da) shown to act as a cell division inhibitor by blocking FtsZ polymerization. Because the three-dimensional structure of FtsZ is strikingly similar to tubulin, we titrated the known tubulin inhibitors (albendazole, colchicine, nocodazole, paclitaxel, 3-methoxybenzamide, and thiabendazole) in FtsZ polymerization and GTPase assays. Up to 167 μg/ml, none of these compounds showed any inhibition of FtsZ polymerization or GTPase activity in vitro (data not shown), thus differentiating the FtsZ from tubulin and the viriditoxin from classical tubulin inhibitors. The results obtained from the whole cell experiments, particularly the filamentation experiment with the E. coli (SOS–, SulA–) strain, showed that filaments were not formed because of DNA damage and confirmed the target selectivity of viriditoxin. Viriditoxin was not active (data not shown) in a modified SOS chromo test (30Huisman O. D'Ari R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 169-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further corroborating that it was not involved in DNA damage. The increased MIC by induction of FtsZ expression indeed gives solid evidence that viriditoxin interacts with FtsZ in the cell. In whole cell labeling experiments using wild type S. aureus MB2985 (MIC = 3.25 μg/ml) and the permeable E. coli MB5431 (MIC = 25 μg/ml), viriditoxin did not block DNA, RNA, protein, fatty acid, and cell wall synthesis (for all macromolecular syntheses in both strains the IC50 was >100 μg/ml; data not shown), further supporting the activity as a result of a new mode of action. The broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of this compound, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and other antibiotic resistant strains, would indicate that the activity of this compound is due to blockage of a new target, i.e. FtsZ. Furthermore, although viriditoxin was identified initially by its activity against the purified E. coli (Gram-negative) FtsZ protein, the in vivo activity of viriditoxin against many Gram-positive bacteria indicates a high functional conservation of the target in these clinically important species. Presumably, the structure of the FtsZ molecule is very highly conserved in the pocket that is engaged by viriditoxin, and this may limit the ability to develop resistance in the target. Although viriditoxin may not be a drug itself, it could be a lead for drug discovery as well as an important tool for biological studies in the field of cell division. We are grateful to Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1994525597,"The gap junction gene connexin 43 (Cx43) showed tumor-suppressing effects on various tumor cell lines. We have previously demonstrated that Cx43 inhibited expression of S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), the human F-box protein that regulates the ubiquitination of p27. Cx43 did not alter the mRNA level of SKP2, but it promoted the degradation of the Skp2 proteins (Zhang, Y. W., Nakayama, K., Nakayama K. I., and Morita, I. (2003) Cancer Res. 63, 1623-1630). In this study, we showed that the specific gap junction inhibitor 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid did not influence the inhibitory effect of Cx43 on Skp2 expression. Further, the deletion mutation analyses demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of Cx43 that did not form gap junctions was sufficient to inhibit expression of Skp2, whereas the N-terminal domain that formed the gap junctions did not show such an effect. Like the full-length Cx43, the C-terminal domain also increased the protein instability of Skp2, whereas the N terminus did not. Moreover, the C-terminal domain was as effective as the full-length Cx43 in inhibiting cell proliferation; however, the N-terminal domain did not show any inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. Therefore, these data revealed a gap junction-independent pathway for Cx43 to inhibit tumor growth by suppressing the Skp2 expression. The gap junction gene connexin 43 (Cx43) showed tumor-suppressing effects on various tumor cell lines. We have previously demonstrated that Cx43 inhibited expression of S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), the human F-box protein that regulates the ubiquitination of p27.

Therefore, these data revealed a gap junction-independent pathway for Cx43 to inhibit tumor growth by suppressing the Skp2 expression. As one of the cell-cell interaction structures, the gap junctions (GJs) 1The abbreviations used are: GJ, gap junction; GJIC, gap junctional intercellular communication; BFA, brefeldin A; Cx, connexin; GA, 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid; Skp2, S phase kinase-associated protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FL, full-length. provide direct transfer of small hydrophilic molecules (e.g. ions and metabolites) up to ∼1 kDa in size from the cytoplasm of one cell to that of adjacent cells. This process is called gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). GJs are composed of connexin (Cx) proteins. Currently, at least 14 Cxs have been cloned and identified (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 2Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). A large number of studies have indicated that certain Cxs (e.g. Cx26, Cx32, and Cx43) have tumor-suppressing effects (3Yamasaki H. Naus C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Yamasaki H. Krutovskikh V. Mesnil M. Tanaka T. Zaidan-Dagli M.L. Omori Y. C. R. Acad. Sci.

Either the Cx-modulated GJs or the Cx protein itself contributed to the effects of tumor growth inhibition (4Yamasaki H. Krutovskikh V. Mesnil M. Tanaka T. Zaidan-Dagli M.L. Omori Y. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1999; 322: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It seems that the Cx species and the cell types used determined whether the GJs or the Cx proteins regulate the tumor growth (4Yamasaki H. Krutovskikh V. Mesnil M. Tanaka T. Zaidan-Dagli M.L. Omori Y. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1999; 322: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Mesnil M. Krutovskikh V. Piccoli C. elfgang C. Traub O. Willecke K. Yamasaki H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 629-639PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that Cx43 suppressed expression of S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), the human F-box protein that regulates p27 ubiquitination (7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar); through it, Cx43 increased the level of p27 and inhibited cell proliferation of the osteosarcoma U2OS cells (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that Cx43 inhibited Skp2 expression via a GJ-independent pathway. Construction of the Cx43 Mutants—The rat heart cDNA library (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) was used to generate the Cx43 mutants by PCR. The primers will be provided upon request. TaRaKa Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa) was used to attach an additional A at the 3′ end of the PCR products. Then the PCR products were ligated into the pcDNA3.1/V5-HisTOPO (Invitrogen) vector using the TA cloning techniques. Sense insertion and the DNA sequence were confirmed by both restriction enzyme reaction and sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—U2OS and COS-7 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), as recommended by the manufacturer. Cell Proliferation—Cell proliferation was estimated by counting the cell number as previously described (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GJIC Analysis—A cell-coupling assay was performed as previously described using the gap fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (gap-FRAP) technique (8Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Nishida M. Murota S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Zhang L. Gang S. Yao X.S. Murota S. Planta Med. 2000; 66: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS containing 1.25 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBS (+)) and stained with 5-10 μm 5,6-carboxyfluorescence diacetate (CFDA) in PBS (+) for 10-15 min. The cells were then rinsed five times with PBS (+) to remove the extra dye and covered with PBS (+) for FRAP analysis. The fluorescence of several randomly selected cells that had been stained with CFDA was bleached with 488-nm 600 mW visible laser beams, and then the recovery of fluorescence was monitored over the subsequent 15 min. An unbleached cell served as the 100% fluorescence control and was used to correct for the loss of fluorescence due to background leakage and photobleaching. This technique involves analyzing the increase of fluorescence over time in a photobleached living cell adjacent to unbleached dye-labeled living cells, so it is able to yield quantitative data. The fluorescence recovery of the photobleached cell reflects the level of GJIC that existed between the photobleached cell and neighbor cells. Immunofluorescence Staining—Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to a modified procedure (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Nishida M. Murota S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded into 35-mm glass-cover dishes 1 day prior to transfection with the Cx43 mutants. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed in cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 15 min at room temperature. After thorough washing, the cells were blocked in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.2% saponin for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with mouse anti-His6 or anti-Cx43 antibodies (1:150) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were washed five times with PBS, exposed to goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Rhodamine (1:200) for 45 min, washed extensively with PBS, and viewed with the fluorescent microscope. 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain the nuclei. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Anti-Skp2 (H-435) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-Cx43 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-His6 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Genzyme Techne (Minneapolis, MN) and Qiagen (Stanford, CA). Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (8Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Nishida M. Murota S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—The Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—The Student's t test was performed for statistical evaluation of a difference; p < 0.001 was considered to be statistically significant. The Specific GJ Inhibitors Did Not Alter the Effects of Cx43 on Skp2 Expression—In our previous study (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we reported that stable-transfection of Cx43 elevated the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 in the human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. We recently demonstrated that Cx43 suppressed the expression of Skp2 (7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar), the human F-box protein that regulates the ubiquitin-dependent p27 degradation. Because both the GJ-dependent and the GJ-independent pathways were involved in the Cx43-induced p27 up-regulation (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we then asked whether Cx43 inhibited expression of Skp2 via the GJ-dependent pathway or not. We first examined effects of two GJ inhibitors on the down-regulated Skp2 expression by Cx43. Brefeldin A (BFA) blocks the transfer of the Cx43 proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the cellular membranes, thus preventing formation of both the GJs and the hemi-channels by Cx43 (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) specifically inhibits the GJ function whereas it does not affect the GJ formation (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, both BFA and GA significantly inhibited the GJIC level of the Cx43-transfected cells (Fig. 1A) (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Then we examined the expression of Skp2 in the presence of these two GJ inhibitors. As reported (7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar), the level of Skp2 was clearly reduced in the Cx43-transfected cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-3). Nevertheless, treatment with neither BFA nor GA changed the reduction in the level of Skp2 in the Cx43-transfected cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-5). Because Cx43 reduced the level of Skp2 via increasing the protein degradation (7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined effects of BFA and GA on the Skp2 protein stability. Fig. 1B showed that the Skp2 degradation was clearly enhanced when the Cx43-transfected cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. However, BFA or GA did not alter the enhanced effect of Cx43 on the degradation of Skp2. Thus, these data suggest that Cx43 inhibited the Skp2 expression likely through a GJ (also including the hemi-channel-)-independent pathway, which may be ascribed from the biological role of the Cx43 protein itself. The Cytoplasmic Carboxyl Terminal Domain Was the Active Part of Cx43 in Suppressing Skp2 Expression—Cx43, like other connexin proteins, goes through the cellular membranes four times, leading to a short N-terminal and a relatively long C-terminal domain within the cytoplasm (3Yamasaki H. Naus C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The above mentioned data indicate that the inhibitory effect of Cx43 on Skp2 expression is likely GJ-independent (Fig. 1). To confirm this hypothesis, we generated four deletion mutants that contained part of either N-terminal or C-terminal domain of Cx43. All these mutants were tagged at the C terminus with an additional His6 tail. To eliminate the possibility that the His6 tail might influence the function of these mutants, we generated the full-length (FL) construct of Cx43, which was also tagged with the His6 tail at the C terminus (Fig. 2A). We first analyzed the cellular distribution of these mutants. In comparison with the parental cells that did not show any GJ staining in the membranes (Fig. 2B, a), the un-tagged Cx43 proteins, the FL and the N3 constructs (all contain the four trans-membrane domains of Cx43) went into the membranes and formed GJs (Fig. 2B, b-d). However, the N1, N2, and C mutants (all contain only a part of the four trans-membrane domains of Cx43) did not form GJs (Fig. 2B, e-g). Next we examined the GJIC levels in cells transiently transfected with these mutants. Like Cx43, the FL and the N3 constructs showed very high level of GJIC, whereas the N1, N2, and C mutants did not (Fig. 3). Together with Fig. 2, these data indicate that the four trans-membrane domains are necessary for the formation of functional GJs. Immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-His6 antibodies demonstrated that cells transfected with these constructs expressed the similar levels of proteins (Fig. 4A). In addition, FL and C, but not N1, N2, and N3, were also recognized by the anti-Cx43 antibody (Fig. 4A), because only FL and C contained the amino acid sequence a of Cx43, from which the mouse anti-Cx43 antibody was generated (Fig. 2A). Then we examined effects of these constructs on the Skp2 expression. Cx43 suppressed expression of Skp2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Likewise, this inhibitory effect was observed in the FL transiently transfected cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4), indicating that the His6 tag at the C terminus does not obviously disturb the effect of Cx43 on Skp2 expression (also see below, Fig. 4C and Fig. 5). The cells transfected with the mutants N1, N2, and N3 did not show any reduction in the level of Skp2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 5-10). However, expression of Skp2 was significantly inhibited in the mutant C transfected cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 11, and 12); moreover, the inhibitory effect was quite close to that of the full-length Cx43 (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 3, 11, and 12), indicating that the C-terminal domain (amino acids 242-382) was not only required but also sufficient for Cx43 to inhibit Skp2 expression. Together with Figs. 1,2,3, these data suggest that Cx43 did not require the GJ forming domain (amino acids 1-242) to inhibit Skp2 expression. In other words, the inhibitory effect of Cx43 on Skp2 was GJ-independent. We have previously reported that Cx43 did not change the mRNA level of SKP2, but increased the protein instability (7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, all these constructs did not show obvious effects on the mRNA level of SKP2 (Fig. 4B). The effects of these constructs on the protein stability of Skp2 were also examined. The results showed that Cx43, Fl, and C increased the protein instability of Skp2 in the presence of cycloheximide, whereas N1, N2, and N3 did not show any effect (Fig. 4C). Thus, these data confirmed the negative role of the C terminus of Cx43 on Skp2 expression. They argue again that Cx43 inhibited Skp2 expression via mechanisms independent of the Cx43-modulated GJs. The Cytoplasmic C Terminus of Cx43 Inhibited Cell Proliferation—Subsequently, we examined effects of these mutants on cell proliferation by counting the cell number. As reported previously (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar), cell proliferation of the Cx43 stably transfected U2OS cells was significantly inhibited compared with the parental cells (Fig. 5). The FL and C constructs also showed strong inhibitory effects on cell proliferation of U2OS cells, although the effects were weaker than that of stably transfected Cx43. However, the N1, N2, and N3 mutants did not inhibit cell proliferation at all (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the C terminus also had the ability to inhibit proliferation of U2OS cells, implying that the GJ-independent role of Cx43 contributed primarily to the Cx43-induced cell proliferation inhibition. Finally, to preclude the possibility that the inhibition of Cx43 on Skp2 expression were only observed in U2OS cells, we examined the effects of these mutants on other cell lines. As shown in Fig. 6A, the FL and C mutants, but not the N1, N2, and N3 mutants, clearly reduced the level of Skp2 in COS-7 cells. Moreover, the FL and C mutants also significantly slowed the cell proliferation of COS-7 cells, whereas the N1, N2, and N3 mutants did not show any effect on the cell proliferation (Fig. 6B). We noticed that the N3 mutant did not inhibit cell proliferation in both tested cell lines, even though it formed GJs and showed high level of GJIC. However, our previous data showed that the GJ function of Cx43 did play a role in cell proliferation inhibition. One possible explanation may be that the GJs formed by the N3 mutant are not completely the same as those formed by the full-length Cx43. Together, these data suggest a gap junction-independent pathway for Cx43 to inhibit cell proliferation in certain cell lines by down-regulation of Skp2. In the present study, we provided evidence that Cx43 inhibited expression of the human F-box protein Skp2 by mechanisms independent of the Cx43-modulated GJs. First, the specific GJ inhibitors did not affect the inhibitory effect of Cx43 on Skp2 expression. Second, the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of Cx43 (amino acids 242 to 382 that did not form the GJ channels) exhibited nearly the same effects as that of the full-length Cx43 on Skp2 expression, whereas the N-terminal part of Cx43 (amino acids 1 to 242 that contains the four trans-membrane domains of Cx43 and formed the GJ channels) did not. Thus, these data revealed another novel aspect of Cx43 in inhibiting tumor proliferation by negative regulation of Skp2 via GJ-independent mechanisms. The principal role of the Cx proteins has been thought to be the formation of the GJ channels that mediate the tissue homeostasis. Therefore, the mechanisms by which Cxs inhibit tumor growth were originally proposed to be through the diffusion of putative growth inhibitory factors via the Cx-modulated GJs (10Loewenstein W.R. Rose B. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 59-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, increasing evidence suggests that the GJ-independent roles are also involved in the Cx-induced growth inhibition (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Mesnil M. Krutovskikh V. Piccoli C. elfgang C. Traub O. Willecke K. Yamasaki H.

Further, it was reported that the C-terminal domain showed the same growth inhibition effects as the full-length Cx43 in certain cell lines (13Moorby C. Patel M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Dang X. Doble B.W. Kardami E. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2003; 242: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (and the present study). We have previously reported that stable-transfection of Cx43 increased the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). This increase was the result of the increased synthesis and the reduced degradation of the p27 proteins. Both the GJ-dependent and the GJ-independent mechanisms contributed to the increase of p27 (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have shown that cAMP was involved in the GJ-dependent pathway (5Zhang Y.W. Morita I. Ikeda M. Ma K.W. Murota S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4138-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), whereas our recent study, together with the present data, suggest that a GJ-independent inhibition of Skp2 expression was responsible for the reduced p27 degradation (7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed a pathway for Cx43 to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, at least in certain cell lines (Fig. 7). Because we have observed that Skp2 played the major roles in the Cx43-induced p27 increase and cell growth inhibition (7Zhang Y.W. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Morita I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that the GJ-independent pathway contributed much more than the GJ-dependent way in the Cx43-induced cell proliferation inhibition. In comparison with normal cells that have a high level of p27, human tumors often express a low level of p27, and the reduced p27 protein level correlates well with high grade and decreased survival of tumors (reviewed in Refs. 16Sgambato A. Cittadini A. Faraglia B. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 183: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cel.

The reduced level of p27 was reported to be, at least in part, the result of increased expression of Skp2 (19Latres E. Chiarle R. Schulman B.A. Pavletich N.P. Pellicer A. Inghirami G. Pagano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 20Gstaiger M. Jordan R. Lim M. Catzavelos C. Mestan J. Slingerland J. Krek W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This, then, raises the question of how Skp2 is dysregulated in tumors. Two possibilities may be considered. One is that the normal machinery controlling the level of Skp2 is altered in tumors. It has been reported that the human F-box protein Skp2 (23Wirbelauer C. Sutterluty H. Blondel M. Gstaiger M. Peter M. Reymond F. Krek W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5362-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the yeast F-box proteins Cdc4p (24Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and Grr1 (25Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) were themselves subjected to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. Thus, it is possible that the self-regulation mechanisms controlling the level of Skp2 are disturbed in tumors, which consequently results in the elevated level of Skp2. But this hypothesis needs to be tested in human tumors. The other is that Skp2 may be the target of some oncogenes and/or tumor-suppressing genes. Activation of the oncogenes or inactivation of the tumor-suppressing genes increases the level of Skp2 via currently unidentified mechanisms, which may include modulation of the self-ubiquitination system of Skp2. Indeed, recent experimental data supported the later hypothesis. A 2-5-fold increase in the level of Skp2 was observed in lymphomas of TMTV-Nras transgenic mice (19Latres E. Chiarle R. Schulman B.A. Pavletich N.P. Pellicer A. Inghirami G. Pagano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Transformation of PAX3-FKHR (the oncogenic form of the Pax3 transcription factor) elevated the level of Skp2 accompanied by reduced expression of p27 (26Zhang L. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the tumor suppressor PTEN (27Mamillapalli R. Gavrilova N. Mihaylova V.T. Tsvetkov L.M. Wu H.

Ueno T. Sata M. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) caused decreases in Skp2 levels with concomitant increases of p27 proteins in tumor cells. Considering these studies and our observations, we propose that one of the explanations for Cx43 to function as a tumor-suppressing gene may be through targeting the proto-oncogene SKP2, and consequently increasing the level of the cell cycle controller p27. The mechanisms by which Cx43 promoted the Skp2 degradation remained unclear. Immunoblotting showed that the Cx43 proteins expressed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (data not shown); therefore, it is possible that a protein thought to form the cell-cell interaction channels in the membranes was involved in events happened in the cytoplasm and/or nuclei. Cx43, or the truncated C terminus, may enter the nuclei through the putative nuclear-localization sequence (13Moorby C. Patel M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) to promote the ubiquitination of Skp2, or they just increase the degradation rate of the Skp2 proteins in the cytoplasm. Further study is needed to show how Cx43 increased the Skp2 degradation."

Ammonium transporters (AMTs) 1The abbreviations used are: AMT, ammonium transporter; MEP, methylammonium permease; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, Trisbuffered saline including 0.1% Tween 20; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ub, ubiquitin; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.1The abbreviations used are: AMT, ammonium transporter; MEP, methylammonium permease; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, Trisbuffered saline including 0.1% Tween 20; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ub, ubiquitin; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. of the AMT/MEP/Rh protein family have been identified in all domains of life, including plants, bacteria, archea, yeast, and animals (1von Wirén N. Gazzarrini S. Gojon A. Frommer W.B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Ludewig U. von Wirén N. Rentsch D. Frommer W.B. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar). AMT/MEP/Rh proteins are highly hydrophobic membrane proteins with a predicted molecular mass of ∼45-55 kDa and 11 or 12 putative transmembrane spans. Initially AMT/MEP/Rh ammonium transporters from yeast and plants were identified molecularly by functional complementation of a yeast mutant defective in ammonium uptake (3Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol.

Later, homologs were isolated from bacteria (6Siewe R.M. Weil B. Burkovski A. Eikmanns B.J. Eikmanns M. Kramer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5398-5403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and animals (Caenorhabditis elegans), and phylogenetic analysis showed that mammalian Rh (rhesus) blood group polypeptides belong to the same super-family (7Marini A.M. Urrestarazu A. Beauwens R. André B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 460-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Heterologously expressed RhAG and a homolog from kidney (RhGK = RhCG) were also shown to function as ammonium transporters (8Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 9Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Plants require transporters for NH4+ acquisition from a wide range of external concentrations and are able to concentrate and transiently accumulate NH4+ in the cytosol before being metabolized or further compartmentalized (10Gojon A. Soussana J.F. Passama L. Robin P. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 254-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ammonium transport across root plasma membranes is biphasic, consisting of a high-affinity and a low-affinity nonsaturating component (11Ullrich W.R. Larsson M. Larsson C.M. Lesch S. Novacky A. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 369-376Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Wang M.Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Ruth T.J. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The high-affinity transport system, which operates predominantly at low external ammonium concentrations, is energized by the membrane potential. In tomato, the NH4+-uniporter LeAMT1;1 encodes a component of the high-affinity transport system that depends on the membrane potential (13Ludewig U. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of the low-affinity transport system, however, is less clear. It contributes significantly to overall NH4+ uptake at higher external ammonium concentrations (>1 mm) and may have a distinct transport mechanism, because uncharged NH3 or charged NH4+ may be the substrate (11Ullrich W.R. Larsson M. Larsson C.M. Lesch S. Novacky A. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 369-376Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Wang M.Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Ruth T.J. Glass A.D.M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 152-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because NH4+/NH3 are in aqueous solution always in a pH-dependent equilibrium with a pK a of 9.25, most of the ammonium (≈98%) is at physiological pH in its charged form. To differentiate the species, the chemical symbols (NH4+ or NH3) will be used to discriminate between the two molecules, whereas the term ammonium is used for both forms. Three ammonium transporters from tomato have been isolated and functionally expressed in yeast. Although LeAMT1;3 is expressed mainly in shoots, transcripts of LeAMT1;1 and LeAMT1;2 (75.6% identical at the protein level) have been detected both in roots and shoots and particularly in root hairs (16Lauter F.R. Ninnemann O. Bucher M. Riesmeier J.W. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8139-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17von Wirén N. Lauter F.R. Ninnemann O. Gillissen B. Walch-Liu P. Engels C. Jost W. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2000; 21: 167-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LeAMT1;1 was shown to be up-regulated under nitrogen deficiency, whereas LeAMT1;2 was induced upon addition of its substrate. To verify whether LeAMT1;2 might provide different biochemical transport properties, which might be related to its physiological role, and to verify its transport mechanism, LeAMT1;2 was expressed heterologously in Xenopus frog oocytes and characterized functionally by two-electrode voltage clamp. Oligomerization of transporter subunits appears to be a typical feature of secondary active transporters and channels (18Reinders A. Schulze W. Kühn C. Barker L. Schulz A. Ward J.M. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1567-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. Trends Biochem.

BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A molecular mass estimation of native AmtB proteins from Escherichia coli by density ultracentrifugation, and a polypeptide mass determination in denaturing SDS-PAGE suggested that bacterial AmtB form trimers (21Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas the more distant Rh polypeptides appear to form hetero-oligomeric tetramers (22Hartel-Schenk S. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5569-5574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast genome encodes three high-affinity ammonium transporters (MEP1-3), which mediate ammonium uptake when expressed individually in a null background, but circumstantial evidence for the interaction between different MEP homologs has been provided (23Marini A.M. Springael J.Y. Frommer W.B. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indications of such an interaction came from a detailed analysis of a mep1-1 mep-2 yeast mutant initially used to isolate ammonium transporters (3Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The mutant carried a deletion in the MEP2 gene, whereas the MEP3 genomic sequence was present and unchanged compared with wild type. A single point mutation (G413D) in the MEP1 gene inactivated both MEP1 and MEP3 simultaneously (23Marini A.M. Springael J.Y. Frommer W.B. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which may support the idea of direct interaction of MEP proteins. However, because the inhibitory effect of the MEP1-G413D mutant was studied in S. cerevisiae, endogenous interacting factors and indirect effects could not be ruled out. Highly similar results were obtained for ammonium transporters from Aspergillus, where the corresponding mutation in the endogenous ammonium transporter inhibited wild type ammonium transporters when introduced in Aspergillus (24Brendon J.M. Unkles S.E. Tsing T. Kinghorn J.R. Hynes M.J. Davis M.A. Fungal Gen. Biol. 2002; 36: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taken together, the dominant negative effect of yeast ammonium transporter mutants together with the identification of oligomerization of AMT-related proteins may suggest that a single AMT/MEP/Rh polypeptide may be the catalytic unit of transport that can assemble with variable stoichiometry. We, therefore, addressed the question whether functional plant AMT1 transporters form oligomeric complexes by three independent methods: co-expression in Xenopus oocytes, analysis in the split ubiquitin system, and protein gel blotting of plant membrane proteins. The results indicate that plant AMT1 transporters can form oligomers, and the functionally distinct LeAMT1;1 and LeAMT1;2 may form either homo- or heteromers. Plasmid Constructs for Oocyte and Yeast Expression—LeAMT1;2 (17von Wirén N. Lauter F.R. Ninnemann O. Gillissen B. Walch-Liu P. Engels C. Jost W. Frommer W.B.

Mutant G458D (exchange of glycine at position 458 by aspartate) in LeAMT1;1-pOO2 (13Ludewig U. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol.

Constructs were verified by sequencing. Another mutant (G421R, glycine 421 to arginine in LeAMT1;2) yielded currents identical to wild type and served as control. The amino acid transporter AtAAP6 was also expressed from the pOO2 plasmid (25Fischer W.-N. Loo D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Capped cRNA was transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase in vitro using mMessage mMachine (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), after linearization of the plasmids with MluI. At least two independent cRNA preparations were used for each construct. LeAMT1;1-GFP wild type and mutant translational fusions were constructed by PCR, ligated into the yeast plasmids pDR196, and sequenced. Yeast strain 31019b (MATa, ura3, mep1Δ, mep2Δ::LEU2, mep3Δ::kanMX2) was transformed, and single colonies were restreaked on fresh plates of YNB (yeast nitrogen base)-Glc medium containing 1 mm ammonium as the sole nitrogen source (7Marini A.M. Urrestarazu A. Beauwens R. André B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 460-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Preparation, Injection, and Electrophysiology of Oocytes—Xenopus oocytes were removed from adult female frogs by surgery and manually dissected. Oocytes (Dumont stage V or VI) were defolliculated using collagenase 10 mg/ml (Roche Applied Science) and trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) for 1 h and injected with 50 nl of cRNA diluted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (≈6-50 ng/oocyte). For co-expression experiments, oocytes were injected with low (6-12 ng/nl) concentrations of cRNA to avoid expression saturation effects due to limiting translation and processing of heterologously expressed AMT proteins in oocytes. These cRNA concentrations allowed a linear increase of transporter activity with cRNA amount injected. Each coinjection experiment was repeated multiple times, and 4-15 oocytes were measured for each construct. After injection oocytes were kept for 2-5 days at 16 °C in ND96 (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4), and gentamycin (20 μg/ml) with added Na-pyruvate (2.5 mm). Total data were collected from more than 10 batches of oocytes from different frogs. Electrophysiological measurements were done as described (13Ludewig U. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Standard bath solutions contained (in mm): 100 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 4 Tris, pH adjusted to 7.5 with MES. Data Analysis—All data are given as means ± S.D. The concentration dependence of ammonium-induced current at each voltage was fitted using Equation 1, I=Imax(1+Km/c)(Eq. 1) where I max is maximal current at saturating ammonium concentration, K m is substrate concentration permitting half-maximal currents, and c is experimentally used concentration. For the co-injections, Equation 2 was used. I=Imax×[1/(1+Km1/c)+1/(1+Km2/c)](Eq. 2) Voltage dependence of K m was fitted with Equation 3, Km(δ)=Km(0mV)×exp(δ×e×V/k×T)(Eq. 3) where δ is fractional electrical distance, e is elementary charge, V is membrane potential, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is absolute temperature. Statistical significance was evaluated by using a paired t test. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Interaction Tests with Split Ubiquitin—LeAMT1;1 (X92854), AtKAT1 (At5g46240), and AtSUC2 (At1g22710) were amplified by standard PCR procedures using gene-specific forward primers flanked by a B1-linker (acaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggctctccaaccaccATGxxx-5′-strand cDNA) and gene-specific reverse primers flanked by B2-linker (tccgccaccaccaaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtaxxx-3′-strand cDNA deleting the stop codon). The vector X-NubWTgate was derived from the vector XNgate according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) by site-directed mutagenesis using the forward primer 5′-ctttgaccggtaaaaccataacattggaagttgaatc and the reverse primer 5′-gaaactggccattttggtattgtaaccttcaacttag. The vectors metYCgate and XNgate, yeast strains THY.AP4 and THY.AP5, and the cloning of PCR products by recombinational in vivo cloning has been described elsewhere (26Fusco C. Guidotti E.

For the construction of NubG and NubWT fusions, the split ubiquitin vectors XNgate and X-NubWTgate were cleaved with EcoRI/SmaI and used with the PCR products to transform THY.AP5 yeast strain (MATα URA3 leu2-3,112 trp1-289 his3-Δ1 ade2Δ::loxP). Transformants were selected on full synthetic media lacking tryptophan and uracil. For Cub fusions, the vector metYCgate was cleaved with PstI/HindIII and used with the PCR products to transform yeast strain THY.AP4 (MATa leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-289 lexA::HIS3 lexA::ADE2 lexA::lacZ). Transformants were selected on full synthetic media lacking leucine. Approximately 50 clones from each THY.AP5 and THY.AP4 transformation were mixed and incubated in appropriate selective synthetic media with and without G418. Cultures were grown to the lag phase, harvested, resuspended in YPD medium (yeast-peptone-dextrose), and used for the mating approach. For mating, 10 μl of THY.AP4 (Cub constructs) and 10 μl of THY.AP5 suspension (NubG or NubWT constructs) were mixed and plated on YPD. After a 6-8-h incubation at 28 °C, diploid cells were selected by replica plating on full synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and uracil at 28 °C for 2-3 days. Diploid cells were plated on synthetic minimal media supplemented with different concentrations of methionine and grown for 3 days. Isolation and Fractionation of Membrane Proteins—Tomato plants were grown hydroponically and precultured under nitrogen deficiency for 3 days (17von Wirén N. Lauter F.R. Ninnemann O. Gillissen B.

Biochem. 1997; 35: 945-950Google Scholar). Total microsomal membrane fractions were isolated according to von Wirén et al. (1997), with all operations conducted at 4 °C. Tomato roots were homogenized by a Waring blender in a buffer containing 50 mm bis-Tris-propane (adjusted to pH 7.8 by dry MES), 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EGTA (pH 7.8), 10% w/v glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (added after filtration of the homogenate), 2 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The final ratio of medium to roots was 3 ml g-1 fresh weight. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of crosswise placed cheesecloth, and the filtrate was centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant was filtered through gauze (58 μm) and recentrifuged at 85,000 × g for 30 min. The drained pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm K2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 7.8), and 3 mm KCl (7 ml mg-1 protein) and gently homogenized in a potter. For preparation of microsomal membrane fractions, the homogenate was pelleted and resuspended in conservation buffer (5 mm bis-Tris-propane, MES, pH 6.5, 250 mm sorbitol, 20% w/v glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein Gel Blot Analysis—A peptide representing the C terminus of LeAMT1;1 (NH2-YHEEDPKLGMQMRRIEPTTST-COOH) was synthesized and conjugated to KLH, and a polyclonal antibody was raised (Biotrend, Koeln, Germany). Pre- and postimmune sera were collected and analyzed by protein gel dot blot. The antisera were affinity-purified by binding the peptide to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany), blocking the membranes in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCL, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature under gentle agitation, washing in TBS for 5 min, and incubating the membranes in serum for 2-3 h at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed four times in TBS-T (TBS including 0.1% Tween 20) and washed twice in TBS. Antibody was eluted in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 1 min and neutralized immediately with 1 n NaOH. 12 mg ml-1 BSA and 0.01% sodium azide were added for stabilization. Antibody samples were concentrated using Vivaspin 20 (M r 10,000 polyethersulfone, Sartorius, Germany). Protein content was determined according to Bradford and adjusted for equal loading by Coomassie colloidal staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Microsomal membrane proteins were suspended in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% v/v glycerol, 2% w/v SDS, 2.5% v/v 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue, 1% proteinase inhibitor mix (0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25 m p-aminobenzamidine), incubated at 40 °C for 30 min, separated by SDS-PAGE (according to Laemmli) on a 10% gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting. Proteins were fixed to the membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol, stained using Ponceau S, and blocked in TBS-T, 5% skim milk powder, 1% BSA for 2-3 h at room temperature under gentle agitation. The blots were rinsed briefly in TBS-T three times and twice in TBS before incubation with the primary antibody in TBS, 3% BSA overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed in TBS-T four times for 5 min and four times in TBS for 5 min. Blots were then incubated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated (Sigma) using a 1:5000 dilution in TBS, 3% BSA) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed in TBS-T and TBS and rinsed for 1 min in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris, pH 9.5) with NBT-BCIP (nitro blue tetrazolium-bromo-chloro-indoyl phosphate, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The alkaline phosphatase reaction was stopped by rinsing the membrane in distilled water. Generation of an Inactive LeAMT1;1 Mutant—A mutation in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of fungal ammonium transporters led to a strong reduction in transport activity (23Marini A.M. Springael J.Y. Frommer W.B. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Brendon J.M. Unkles S.E. Tsing T. Kinghorn J.R. Hynes M.J. Davis M.A. Fungal Gen. Biol. 2002; 36: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), when a conserved glycine was replaced by an aspartate residue (G458D). To test whether the mutation of the corresponding glycine in the plant NH4+-transporter LeAMT1;1 has a similar effect, the mutation was introduced into the LeAMT1;1 gene, and wild type and mutant genes were expressed in the ammonium uptake-defective yeast strain 31019b. Although wild type LeAMT1;1 restored the growth defect of 31019b on medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source, the mutant was unable to mediate efficient uptake (Fig. 1A). GFP fusions of wild type and mutant LeAMT1;1 forms showed similar localization when expressed in 31019b (Fig. 1B). To analyze the subcellular distribution in plant cells, the fusion constructs were expressed in plant protoplasts. Both wild type and mutant forms localized predominantly as a peripheral ring consistent with plasma membrane localization (Fig. 1C). Thus, the tomato ammonium transporter LeAMT1;1 functions as a plasma membrane transport system. To analyze the functionality of the mutant in more detail, wild type and mutant forms were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. NH4+ induced significant currents in LeAMT1;1-expressing oocytes, whereas the mutant permitted no detectable ammonium-induced currents above background when expressed at different cRNA concentrations in oocytes (n = 3 batches of oocytes, Fig. 2). Thus, the mutant seemed fully inactive, supporting the notion that also in planta the conserved glycine is crucial for function. Specific Inhibition of LeAMT1;1 Ammonium Transport by the Point Mutant G458D—The mutated plant transporter was used as a tool to study whether AMT transporters exist as oligomers in a heterologous system, which might lack other proteins potentially required to mediate interaction between ammonium transporters. To be able to evaluate possible interactions between mutant and wild type ammonium transporters, it was necessary to measure transport under conditions in which expression levels of the transporters correlate with activity. Increasing amounts of cRNA injected per oocyte led to larger ammonium currents, but the maximum current obtained saturated with ≈50 ng cRNA. Such saturation is a typical feature of oocyte expression of a variety of channels and transporters (e.g. Ref. 48Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Pusch M. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At low amounts of cRNA injected per oocyte (≈6-12 ng), ammonium currents increased linearly with the amount of injected cRNA (Fig. 2). The linear correlation between functional LeAMT1;1-mediated ammonium transport and cRNA concentration (Fig. 2) allowed direct quantitative analysis of co-expressed mutant and wild type polypeptides in oocytes. Co-expression of equal amounts of wild type and mutant cRNA led to a dramatic decrease of ammonium transport to ≈12% (Fig. 2). Protein biosynthesis was not saturated in oocytes, as twice the amount of wild type LeAMT1;1 led to a doubling of ammonium currents (Fig. 2). Lower amounts of co-injected mutant cRNA led to lower inhibition of wild type-dependent ammonium transport (Fig. 2). To exclude the possibility that the inhibition was due to indirect effects, the LeAMT1;1 mutant G458D was co-expressed with the structurally unrelated amino acid transporter AtAAP6 (25Fischer W.-N. Loo D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Co-expression of equal amounts of mutant LeAMT1;1 cRNA with AtAAP6 did not influence amino acid currents (Fig. 2). Thus, the LeAMT1;1-G458D mutant protein specifically inhibited ammonium conductance. The dominant negative effect of a plant ammonium transporter mutant expressed heterologously in animal cells is indicative of a direct interaction between mutant and wild type polypeptides. LeAMT1;1 Interactions Detected by an Optimized Split Ubiquitin System—To test whether LeAMT1;1 can interact with itself directly, an optimized yeast split ubiquitin system, developed for large scale proteome analysis of membrane protein interactions was used. 3P.

The split ubiquitin system allows detection of interactions between membrane proteins in vivo. The new system allows in vivo cloning of PCR products by recombination into expression vectors, mating-based detection of the interactions, and improved selection of interacting fusions on media lacking histidine and adenine (26Fusco C.

Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3882) Google Scholar). In addition to this, fine-tuning of relative expression levels via methionine-dependent promoters improves detection limits. Protein fusions to the mutated N-terminal half, NubG, and the C-terminal half, Cub, of ubiquitin were constructed, and the interaction of membrane protein partners was then monitored by the release of the artificial transcription factor PLV activating lexA-driven reporter genes in the nucleus (29Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Weak interactions were observed between LeAMT1;1 (Fig. 3). LeAMT1;1 did not interact with other plasma membrane proteins, such as the potassium channel AtKAT1 or the sucrose transporter AtSUC2. As expected, interactions were observed between the AtKAT1 subunits themselves, shaker-like channel polypeptides known to form tetramers (30Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Cherel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31Pilot G. Lacombe B. Gaymard F. Cherel I. Boucherez J. Thibaud J.B. Sentenac H. J. Biol.

If the wild type N-terminal half (NubWT) does not harbor a mutation, it interacts strongly with the C-terminal half Cub of ubiquitin. Thus, soluble NubWT and LeAMT1;1 fused to NubWT served as positive controls. The interaction of LeAMT1;1-Cub with LeAMT1;1-ubG was too weak to be detected by measuring β-galactosidase activity of LacZ (data not shown). Results obtained with the novel split ubiquitin system showed weak but significant interaction of LeAMT1;1 with itself and provided independent evidence that LeAMT1;1 polypeptides are capable of co-assembling in a homomeric protei"

SNX9 has in its amino terminus a Src homology 3 domain and a region with predicted low complexity followed by a carboxyl-terminal part containing the phox domain. We previously found that SNX9 is one of the major proteins in hematopoietic cells that binds to the αand β2-appendages of adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), a protein with a critical role in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane. In the present study we show that clathrin and dynamin-2, two other essential molecules in the endocytic process, also interact with SNX9. We found that both AP-2 and clathrin bind to the low complexity region in SNX9 in a cooperative manner, whereas dynamin-2 binds to the Src homology 3 domain. In the cytosol, SNX9 is present in a 14.5 S complex containing dynamin-2 and an unidentified 41-kDa protein. In HeLa cells, SNX9 co-localized with both AP-2 and dynamin-2 at the plasma membrane or on vesicular structures derived from it but not with the early endosomal marker EEA1 or with AP-1. The results suggest that SNX9 may be recruited together with dynamin-2 and become co-assembled with AP-2 and clathrin at the plasma membrane.

Sorting nexins are characterized by the presence of a subclass of the phosphoinositide-binding phox (PX) domain, and it is believed that a common function of proteins in this family is to participate in sorting processes in the cell. Several members localize to endosomal structures, and some of the SNX proteins have been shown to directly interact with transmembrane receptors to regulate their sorting in the endosomal pathway (for a review, see Ref. 1Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The localization of SNX proteins is suggested to be determined by their PX domains, although protein-protein interactions may also contribute to the membrane specificity (2Xu Y. Hortsman H. Seet L.

SNX9 and its close relative SNX18 are the only members of the sorting nexin family that contains an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. SH3 domains interact specifically with short proline-containing sequences (PXXP) and are present in a large number of proteins (4Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Target sequences are often located in distinct domains, referred to as proline-rich domains (PRDs). SNX9 was originally identified as a molecule that interacted with PRDs in certain metalloprotease disintegrins (ADAMs) (5Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Work in Drosophila showed that SNX9 (named DSH3PX1) interacted with Dock (the fly orthologue of mammalian Nck) and Dscam (Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule) to form a complex involved in axonal guidance in the fly (6Worby C.A.

In addition, SNX9 was found to interact with the clathrin-binding tyrosine kinase Ack through an SH3-PRD interaction. In mammalian cells, Ack2 interacted with the receptor for epidermal growth factor, and this interaction was stabilized by SNX9. Upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor, SNX9 became tyrosine-phosphorylated and was suggested to play a role together with Ack2 in the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (8Lin Q. Lo C.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10134-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In a previous report (9Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we identified SNX9 as one of the major proteins in the cytosol from human K562 cells that bound to the appendages of adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2). It was therefore suggested that SNX9 in some way is involved in the process of clathrin-coated vesicle formation at the plasma membrane. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is triggered by the assembly of AP-2 and clathrin at specific sites at the plasma membrane, mediated by interactions with phosphoinositides in the membrane (10Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 11D'Hondt K. Heese-Peck A. Riezman H. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). As the clathrin coat forms, the membrane invaginates and becomes a coated pit. Once activated in the coat, AP-2 reaches out to collect transmembrane cargo proteins by protein-protein interactions (13Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). A variety of accessory factors participates in these events, many of them interacting with the appendage domains of AP-2 (14Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). At a certain stage, the large GTPase dynamin is recruited to the coated pit and forms a collar at its base (15Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 16Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The assembly of dynamin leads to fission of the clathrin-coated vesicle from the membrane, possibly by a force generated through the hydrolysis of GTP. Although it is known that dynamin plays an essential role in the later stages of endocytosis, the mechanism of action has not yet been revealed (17Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Song B.D. Schmid S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, it has not been established how this important molecule is targeted to the membrane. In the present study, we identify dynamin-2 (Dyn2) as a major partner for SNX9 in the cytosol from hematopoietic cells and show that SNX9 assembles with Dyn2 and AP-2 at the plasma membrane. The results suggest that SNX9 plays a role in the clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery. Antibodies—Polyclonal antiserum against SNX9 was generated by immunizing a rabbit with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SNX9 fusion protein. Antibodies were affinity-purified using the recombinant protein or used as serum after removal of anti-GST antibodies. Purchased antibodies were: mouse anti-EEA1 clone 14 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), mouse anti-β1/β2-adaptin clone 100/1, mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma), rabbit anti-dynamin-2 (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), mouse anti-dynamin Hudy 1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA), fluorescein-linked donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulins, and Cy3-linked goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Amersham Biosciences). All other antibodies were as described previously (9Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs—cDNAs encoding human full-length SNX9, SH3, LC, LC-2, LC-3, and LC-4 were amplified by PCR using the appropriate primers and IMAGE clone 3832234 (UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre) as template. After digestion, the PCR products were ligated into the pGEX-5X-1 or pGEX-6p-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) generating GST fusion constructs. Coding regions corresponding to SH3LC, PXCT, LC-1, and SH3LCPX were excised from full-length SNX9 or from the LC construct and subcloned into the pGEX-5X-1 or pGEX-6p-2 vector. GST-LC-108S (W108S substitution), GST-LC-165S/169S (W165S, W169S substitutions), and GST-LC108S/165S/169S (W108S, W165S, W169S substitutions) were created by PCR-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). GST-αc and GST-β3c were described before (9Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The construct encoding human dynamin-2 PRD (19Dong J. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Westermann P. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 20: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Peter Westermann. For expression in K562 cells, DNA encoding SNX9 and SH3LCPX was excised from IMAGE clone 3832234 and inserted into the expression vector pMEP4 (Invitrogen). To obtain amino-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins, oligonucleotides corresponding to a FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) were inserted into the pMEP4 vector. DNA encoding SNX9, SH3LC, and PXCT were then subcloned into the modified vector. For expression in HeLa cells, FLAG-SNX9 and FLAG-SH3LC was excised from the pMEP4-FLAG vector and inserted into the pFLAG-CMV-4 vector (Sigma). All constructs and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. All oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technologies (Aarhus, Denmark). Transfections—The conditions for transfection of K562 cells by electroporation were as described previously (20Marklund U. Osterman O. Melander H. Bergh A. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30626-30635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of expression by 0.1–0.5 μm Cd2+ resulted in a 10–15-fold expression over endogenous SNX9 as estimated by immunoblotting. HeLa cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics were transfected using the CaCl2 method (21Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Transferrin Uptake—HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min on ice, washed, and permeabilized and blocked in 0.05% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were stained with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies following standard protocols and scanned with a laser scanning Leica DMIRBE confocal microscope equipped with an argon-krypton laser. Sets of fluorescent images were acquired sequentially for the red and green channels to prevent crossover of signals. To quantify the degree of co-localization, cells were divided into 100-μm2 squares, and the total number of red, green, and yellow fluorescent dots was counted in each square. In total 14 squares and over 800 dots from several cells were counted for each quantification, and the percent co-localization was calculated. Holotransferrin (Calbiochem) was biotinylated by a 7-fold molar excess of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin (Pierce) in 50 mm NaHCO3 and desalted. For transferrin uptake experiments, transfected cells were harvested, starved in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with serum-free medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml biotinylated transferrin. Cells were washed repeatedly in phosphate-buffered saline to remove surface-bound transferrin before fixation. After washes, cells were opened and blocked as indicated above before incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and Cy3-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences). After repeated washes, cells were mounted and viewed using a Carl Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Analysis of transferrin uptake by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed essentially as described before (22Smythe E. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using glutathione for quenching of surface-bound transferrin. Protein Expression and Purification—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (9Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Dynamin PRD was expressed and purified according to Ref. 19Dong J. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Westermann P. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 20: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. GST-αc was cleaved overnight at 37 °C with Factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by repeated absorption with glutathione-Sepharose beads. For purification of clathrin triskelions, cytosol was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose to which GST-β3c was previously cross-linked using dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma). After extensive washes of the beads in 0.1% Triton X-100 in HKM buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, and 1 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.4) bound material was eluted with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Before use in binding experiments, the buffer was changed to HKM buffer using MicroBio-Spin P6 columns (Bio-Rad). Preparation and Use of Cytosol—K562 cells were harvested and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and twice in KSHM buffer (HKM buffer with 85 mm sucrose), both supplemented with 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were resuspended with 1–2 volumes of KSHM buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and a protease inhibitor mixture (9Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the suspension was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 850 × g for 5 min. The morphology of the cells was not affected by this treatment indicating that internal structures were mainly intact. The majority of both SNX9 and Dyn2 was released into the supernatant. The supernatant was centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min, and the cytosol was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was 15–20 mg/ml. The cytosol was thawed and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g before use. For immunoprecipitations, cytosol was added to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) to which antibodies were previously bound, and the samples were incubated by slow agitation for 1–3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4 before analysis by SDS-PAGE combined with immunoblotting or Coomassie Blue staining. Pull-down assays with GST fusion proteins were performed as described before (9Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For pull-down assays with purified proteins, equal molar amounts of fusion proteins (3 μm) were used together with 8 μm Dyn2-PRD, 3 μm AP-2 α-appendage, or 0.2 μm clathrin heavy chain. For velocity sedimentation analysis, freshly prepared cytosol (250 μl) was loaded on top of a 4-ml continuous sucrose gradient (10–30% sucrose in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 4 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor at 200,000 × gav for 16 h. In parallel, a mixture of bovine serum albumin, catalase, and ferritin as sedimentation markers was centrifuged. Fractions (250 μl) were collected from the top. A pellet fraction was obtained by resuspension in 250 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. Membrane Analysis—A 70,000 × g pellet fraction obtained from the cytosol preparation (see above) containing membranes and vesicles was resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 in KSHM buffer and incubated for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and analyzed, and the pellet was divided in two aliquots that were either incubated in a low salt buffer (85 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, and 1 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.4) or in an equal mixture of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and KSHM buffer. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the samples were centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were analyzed. The pellets contained less than 1% of the total protein in the starting material and were found to be devoid of clathrin, AP-2, Dyn2, and SNX9. Membrane/vesicular material obtained after freezing/thawing of K562 cells as above were separated according to density by equilibrium centrifugation in a 12-ml continuous 0–60% Nycodenz gradient in KSHM buffer. After centrifugation in an SW41 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 16 h, fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and for density by refractometry. A pellet fraction was obtained by resuspension in 1 ml of KSHM buffer. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Coomassie Bluestained bands from SDS-PAGE were excised, and proteins were digested with 1 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade modified trypsin, Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) essentially as described before (23Fountoulakis M. Langen H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Peptide coverage was >50% for both dynamin-2 and clathrin heavy chain. Liposome Experiments—Phospholipids were purchased from Matreya (State College, PA) or from Sigma. Liposomes (50 nmol of phospholipid/reaction) were prepared in KSHM buffer essentially as described before (24Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and incubated with GST fusion proteins in a total volume of 40 μl of KSHM buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Liposomes were rinsed with 200 μl of KSHM buffer, centrifuged, and finally prepared for SDS-PAGE. Identification of Proteins Interacting with SNX9 —We previously described that SNX9 contains binding sites for the appendages of AP-2 (9Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Since SNX9 consists of several domains with potential binding function, it was of interest to identify other interacting endocytic proteins to establish a role for SNX9 in this system and to map the interaction sites in SNX9. Full-length SNX9 and truncation variants were produced as GST fusion proteins and used in binding experiments and for the production of polyclonal antibodies. Fig. 1 shows the constructs and the nomenclature used in the present investigation. In a pull-down experiment from cytosol, several proteins were detected that specifically interacted with the GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). Two of the major binding proteins, migrating at 180 and 110 kDa, were identified by mass spectrometry as clathrin heavy chain and Dyn2, respectively (Fig. 2A, bands denoted 1 and 2). Both of these proteins were pulled down by the amino-terminal one-third of SNX9 (GST-SH3LC).Fig. 2Identification of proteins interacting with different domains of SNX9 and analysis of binding specificity. GST fusions of proteins indicated at the top of each figure or GST alone was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with cytosol or purified proteins. After washing, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Blue staining or by immunoblotting using antibodies against Dyn2, clathrin heavy chain, and AP-2 α-chain as indicated. A, binding of cytosolic proteins to different regions of SNX9. Loaded beads were incubated with (+ cytosol) or without (–cytosol) cytosol, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands denoted 1 and 2 were identified by MALDI-TOF as clathrin heavy chain and Dyn2, respectively. Bands below the fusion proteins are degradation products. B, binding of clathrin and Dyn2 from cytosol and purified recombinant domains (PRD from Dyn2 and appendage domain of AP-2 α-chain, αc domain) to different regions of SNX9. C, binding of purified appendage domain of AP-2 α-chain to full-length SNX9 and different variants of the LC region of SNX9. D, binding of clathrin triskelions purified from cytosol to full-length SNX9 and different variants of the LC region of SNX9 and to the carboxyl-terminal part of AP-3 β-chain (β3c) as a control. A Coomassie Blue stain of purified clathrin analyzed by SDS-PAGE is shown to the left (CHC, clathrin heavy chain; CLC, clathrin light chains).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify more precisely the domains in SNX9 that bound clathrin, Dyn2, and AP-2, pull-down experiments were performed with fusion proteins containing different parts of SNX9 together with both cytosol and purified proteins. Fig. 2B shows that the SH3 domain in SNX9 binds directly to the PRD in Dyn2. This result was expected since several other SH3-containing proteins interact with dynamin through this region (16Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Both clathrin and AP-2 α-appendage bind to a disordered region (designated LC) located between the SH3 and PX domains. The binding of the α-appendage was stronger to the SH3LC construct than to full-length SNX9, and clathrin-binding was only detectable with the SH3LC construct (see also Fig. 2A), suggesting that the binding sites for clathrin and AP-2 is obstructed in full-length SNX9. The low complexity sequence between the SH3 and PX domains that is located outside the LC region (starting at amino acid 185) does not appear to possess any strong binding sites for clathrin and AP-2 α-chain since construct PXCT, which contained this extra sequence, was negative. Mapping of Binding Sites for AP-2 and Clathrin in SNX9 Low Complexity Region—Investigation of the fine specificity of α-appendage and clathrin binding to the LC region is shown in Fig. 2, C and D. The appendages of AP-2 are known to bind DPF and DPW sequences in various proteins (25Owen D.J. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since SNX9 contains a DPW motif at amino acids 106–108, we expected this sequence to be involved in the binding of AP-2. As can be seen in Fig. 2C, some binding of purified α-appendage to LC1 and LC2 containing the DPW sequence was found. However, a stronger binding was revealed when the fusion protein was extended to amino acid 183 (LC). The extra region consists of 64 amino acids containing the acidic sequence DDDDWDEDWD. This sequence has properties reminiscent of a recently described additional motif for α-appendage binding (FXDXF) (26Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Indeed LC3, which contains the acidic sequence but not the DPW sequence, displayed approximately the same binding strength as LC1 and LC2. That the two described motifs are of importance was shown by the markedly weakened binding for the α-appendage in point mutants of LC where tryptophan residues in the respective motif were changed to serines (LC-S108/S165/S169). Mutations in either motif displayed intermediate binding (LC-S108 and LC-S165/S169), indicating a cooperative binding of the α-appendage to the wild-type LC sequence. Surprisingly LC4, which is a shorter version of the acidic sequence-containing region, did not show any binding of the α-appendage. The region between the two motifs (amino acids 120–151) may be of importance for the correct presentation of the acidic motif in the fusion protein or may contain a weak third binding site. Purified clathrin triskelions were used to prove a direct interaction with the LC region in SNX9 and for investigation of the binding specificity (Fig. 2D). For the binding of clathrin, an even more pronounced cooperative effect was seen. Only the full-length sequence of LC showed significant binding, and all three tryptophan mutant variants abolished detectable interaction. The nature of the motifs that is recognized by clathrin is not obvious since SNX9 does not contain a classical “clathrin box” motif as present e.g. in the β-chain of AP-3 (β3c in Fig. 2D). However, many variants of clathrin binding sequences have been reported recently (27Dell'Angelica E.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 315-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both affected sites in SNX9 (107PWSAW and 164DWDEDW) are slightly similar to one of the clathrin-binding sequences in amphiphysin (PWDLW) (28Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17583-17589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and low affinity interactions of the triskelion with these sites may result in significant cooperative binding. It appears, however, that clathrin and AP-2 use overlapping binding sites in SNX9, which may have interesting implications for the arrangements in putative ternary complexes. Characterization of a SNX9-Dyn2 Complex in Cytosol—The affinity of SNX9 for Dyn2 produces an association between the two proteins in a native complex in cytosol. This was shown by co-immunoprecipitations from cytosol with antibodies against both Dyn2 and SNX9 (Fig. 3A). As a control of specificity, Eps15, which is another accessory protein involved in endocytosis (14Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), was not detected in the SNX9-Dyn2 complex. That substantial amounts of Dyn2 are in complex with SNX9 in cytosol was indicated by the fact that Dyn2 was seen as a major band after immunoprecipitation with anti-SNX9 and staining of the gel with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3B). In addition, an unidentified protein at 41 kDa was specifically co-immunoprecipitated by anti-SNX9. As judged from the staining intensity of the bands, it appears that the three components of the complex are present in a 1:1:1 molar ratio. Sedimentation velocity analysis of cytosol (Fig. 3C) showed that most of SNX9 and part of Dyn2 co-migrated with a sedimentation coefficient of 14.5 S. For a globular complex this sedimentation corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼400 kDa. Coomassie staining of sedimentation fractions after immunoprecipitation revealed that also the 41-kDa protein co-migrated with SNX9 and Dyn2 (data not shown). Taken together, the data are most consistent with the presence of a complex consisting of two molecules each of SNX9 (78 kDa), Dyn2 (100 kDa), and p41. SNX9 Is Assembled on Membranes—In our previous study (9Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) we found by cell fractionation experiments that most of SNX9 was present in the cytosol fraction with very small amounts on the membranes. We have now found that the membrane association of SNX9 is highly dependent on the salt concentration in the extraction buffer. If cell fractionation is performed at a physiological salt concentration, as done in the present study, at least half of SNX9 remains membrane-bound. Fig. 4A shows an experiment where the material released from the cells after a quick freeze/thaw cycle was analyzed by sedimentation and extraction. All molecules detected, including SNX9, were enriched in the membrane pellet fraction. Extraction of the pellet with detergent solubilized a large"

TM may also possess functions distinct from its anticoagulant activity. Here the influence of TM on cell adhesion was studied in TM-negative melanoma A2058 cells transfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged TM (TMG) or lectin domain-deleted TM (TMG(ΔL)). Confocal microscopy demonstrated that both TMG and TMG(ΔL) were distributed in the plasma membrane. TMG-expressed cells grew as closely clustered colonies, with TM localized prominently in the intercellular boundaries. TMG(ΔL)-expressed cells grew singly. Overexpression of TMG, but not TMG(ΔL), decreased monolayer permeability in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. The cell-to-cell adhesion in TMG-expressed cells was Ca2+-dependent and was inhibited by monoclonal antibody against the lectin-like domain of TM. The effects of TM-mediated cell adhesion were abolished by the addition of mannose, chondroitin sulfate A, or chondroitin sulfate C. In addition, anti-lectin-like domain antibody disrupted the close clustering of the endogenous TM-expressed keratinocyte HaCaT cell line derived from normal human epidermis. Double-labeling immunofluorescence staining revealed similar distributions of TM and actin filament in the cortex region of the TMG-expressed cells. Thus, TM can function as a Ca2+-dependent cell-to-cell adhesion molecule. Binding of specific carbohydrates to the lectin-like domain is essential for this specific function.

Thrombomodulin (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TMthrombomodulinGFPgreen fluorescence proteinTMGTM-GFP fusion proteinTMG(ΔL)lectin-like domain-deleted form of TM-GFP fusion proteinEGFepidermal growth factorPBSphosphate-buffered saline. is a membrane-intercalated glycoprotein, which functions in anticoagulation by virtue of complexation with thrombin. The complex can effectively activate protein C, which in turn catalyzes the proteolytic inactivation of blood coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, leading to down-regulation of the blood coagulation cascade (1Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Harris K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7944-7947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). TM is constitutively expressed on endothelial cells (1Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Harris K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7944-7947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As such, it might be one of the factors that localizes the coagulation cascade to sites of vascular injury (2Esmon C.T.

The observations from a number of studies support the contention that TM may also play a role in other extravascular activities (3Boffa M.C. Burke B. Haudenschild C.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ablation of the TM gene causes early postimplantation embryonic lethality that precedes the establishment of a functional cardiovascular system (4Healy A.M. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. Weiler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). TM may also have antiscarring properties, by virtue of the modulation of early collagen deposition of normal epidermis (5Raife T.J. Lager D.J. Peterson J.J. Erger R.A. Lentz S.R. J. Investig. Med. 1998; 46: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). Complete or nearly complete TM deficiency has not been reported in humans (6Lane D.A. Grant P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1517-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with the view that a severe reduction of TM function may have more dire consequences than the defects in coagulant or anticoagulant factors. An inverse correlation between TM expression and tumor progression is evident clinically (7Tezuka Y. Yonezswa S. Maruyama I. Matsushita Y. Shimizu T. Obama H. Sagara M. Shirao K. Kusano C. Natsugoe S. Yoshinaka H. Baba M. Fukumoto T. Aikou T. Sato E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4196-4200PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tabata M. Sugihara K. Yonezawa S. Yamashita S. Maruyama I. J. Oral Pathol.

Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that TM exerted a growth-suppressing effect independent of its anticoagulant activity but dependent on the lectin-like domain (10Zhang Y. Weiler-Guettler H. Chen J. Wilhelm O. Deng Y. Qiu F. Nakagawa K. Klevesath M. Wilhelm S. Bohrer H. Nakagawa M. Graeff H. Martin E. Stern D.M. Rosenberg R.D. Ziegler R. Nawroth P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The myriad and diverse possible functions of TM may reflect the glycoprotein structure. TM consists of 557 amino acid residues arranged in five distinct domains: an NH2-terminal lectin-like domain, a domain with six epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like structures that contain thrombin binding sites, an O-glycosylation site-rich domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (11Suzuki K. Kusumoto S. Deyashiki Y. Nishioka J. Maruyama I. Zushi M. Kawahara S. Honda G. Yamamoto S. Horiguchi S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal lectin-like domain has two modules. The first 155-amino acid module, is homologous to Ca2+-dependent lectin (12Petersen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 51-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The second module, adjacent to the EGF-like domain, is a hydrophobic region of 70 amino acid residues. These lectin-like domains exist in other proteins, where they participate in a wide variety of cell biologic processes, including inflammation and cell-to-cell recognition processes (13Chay C.H. Pienta K.J. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 2000; 35: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gabius H. J. Cancer Invest. 1997; 15: 454-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Mody R. Joshi S. Chaney W. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1995; 33: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The TM lectin-like domain is not required for cofactor activity for activating protein C, and its biological function remains mostly unclear. It has been reported that many null mutations in adhesion genes are lethal during embryonic development (16Larue L. Ohsugi M. Hirchenhain J. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8263-8267Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 17Riethmacher D. Brinkmann V. Birchmeier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1996; 98: 2193-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and that TM is necessary for embryonic development (4Healy A.M. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. Weiler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The lectin-like activity may be influential in a cell-to-cell adhesive interaction (19Ogawa H. Yonezawa S. Maruyama I. Matsushita Y. Tezuka Y. Toyoyama H. Yanagi M. Matsumoto H. Nishijima H. Shimotakahara T. Aikou T. Sato E. Cancer Lett. 2000; 149: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that TM may function as an additional cellular adhesive molecule. Immunocytochemical studies have localized the TM antigen principally to the intercellular bridges between keratinocytes in stratified squamous epithelium of skin and in various benign or malignant squamous cell carcinomas (7Tezuka Y.

Indeed, the levels of both E-cadherin and TM are decreased in metastases of squamouscellcarcinoma(7Tezuka Y. Yonezswa S. Maruyama I. Matsushita Y. Shimizu T. Obama H. Sagara M. Shirao K. Kusano C.

Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar).ItiswellknownthatE-cadherin-dependent cell-to-cell adhesion is important for the maintenance of epithelial structural integrity and that the loss of E-cadherin expression is correlated with increased invasive potential of both carcinoma cell lines and tumor samples (24Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The parallel relationship of the expression levels of E-cadherin and TM in tumor progression prompted us to test the adhesion and morphoregulatory activities of TM in comparison with E-cadherin. Although the direct participation of TM in cell-to-cell adhesion is suspected, no supportive experimental evidence has been provided. The present study sought such evidence, through the testing of the hypothesis that TM functions as a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule, and, if so, elucidation of the roles of the participating TM domains. Clones of A2058 melanoma cells that stably expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged full-length or lectin-like domain-truncated TM were generated. We report here on our observations that the lectin-like domain of TM prompted the clustering of cells in close proximity with one another by enhancing cell-to-cell adhesiveness through a Ca2+-dependent interaction of TM molecules. This interaction could be involved in limiting cell growth. Materials—Tissue culture dishes and plastic ware were purchased from Corning Life Sciences (Corning, Inc.).

All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Construction of Green Fluorescent Protein-tagged Thrombomodulin—Human TM gene in chromosomal DNA was amplified by PCR using a BamHI forward primer, TM719 (5′-CGGGATCCCGGAATGCTTGGGGTCCTGGTCCTTG-3′) and an EcoRI reverse primer (5′-GGAATTCGGAGTCTCTGCGGCGTCCGCT-3′). The 1.7-kb PCR product encoding amino acid residues 1–575 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting fragment was ligated to the expression vector pEGFPN1, which had been digested with BglII and EcoRI. This construct was named TMG. The lectin-like module within the NH2-terminal domain of TM was removed by recombinant PCR using the following method. Four primers were designed such that they overlapped and skipped the lectin-like module. Two oligonucleotide primers, TM719 and TM1480 (5′-CATTGCACGCGTGCTCGCAGCCGC-3′), flanked the region from nucleotide 719 to 1480. The other primers were 5′-CACGCTGCAGTCCCAAGCGCCACCCGGCTGCGGCTC-3′ and its reverse complement 5′-GAGCCGCAGCCGGGTGGCGCTTGGGACTGCAGCGTG-3′. Each of the latter two primers was utilized with primer TM719 and TM1480 for PCR amplifications, respectively. The 92- and 66-bp PCR products were purified, denatured, annealed, and amplified using primers TM719 and TM1480. The recombinant 140-bp product was digested with BamHI and MluI and subcloned to replace the wild type NH2-terminal domain of human TM in the expression vector pEGFPN1. The final product was designated TMG(ΔL). Both constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection of Human Melanoma (A2058) Cells— A2058 cells (ATCC CRL-11147) or HaCaT cells (25Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.292 g/liter l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. A2058 cells grown until 40–60% confluence were transfected with TMG or TMG(ΔL) using Lipofectin reagent. To generate cell lines stably expressing the various constructs, cells were diluted and seeded 2 days after transfection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (neomycin). Clonal expression was examined initially by fluorescence microscopy, and clones for further study were selected and expanded. Thrombomodulin Activity Assay—Cells at a density of 2 × 104/well were split into wells of a 96-well plate and allowed to reattach overnight. The cells were washed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated with 40 μl of reaction mixture (37.5 nm thrombin and 5 μg/ml protein C in the washing buffer) at 37 °C for 30 min. Protein C activation was terminated by adding 40 μl of antithrombin III (6 IU/ml) and heparin (12 IU/ml). The enzymatic activity of activated protein C was measured with the peptide substrate H-d-Lys-Z-Pro-Arg-4-nitroanilidediacetate (Chromozym PCa; 0.5 mm in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C. The absorbance change at 405 nm was measured with a Thermomax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Controls containing thrombin and protein C in the absence of cells were treated similarly. Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analyses—TM-expressing cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 20 min and then disrupted with a needle. Total lysates were quantified using a micro-BCA kit (Pierce). Proteins (10 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to a nylon filter. The nylon filter was blocked for 1 h in 5% (v/v) fat-free milk in PBST buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). After a brief wash in the buffer, the nylon filter was incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-human TM antiserum diluted in PBST buffer. The antiserum was prepared in our laboratory from BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant TM protein purified from the Pichia pastoris expression system. The primary antibody was removed, and the filter was washed four times in PBST buffer. Subsequent incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody proceeded at room temperature for 2 h. The filter was washed four times in PBST buffer to remove the secondary antibody, and the blot was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. Confocal Microscopy—To examine the distribution of TM, transfected cells were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips overnight. The coverslips were washed three times with cold PBS, and the cells were fixed with a 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde solution in PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were observed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica model TCS2) with a Leica Mellis-Griot ×63 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, pinhole of 1.5, and electronic zoom 1.5 or 2. GFP was excited using a 488-nm argon/krypton laser and detected with a 515–540-nm band pass filter. Tetramethylrhodamine was excited using a 543-nm argon/krypton laser and detected with a 550–620-nm band pass filter. The images were manipulated with a Leica TCS NT scanner. Immunofluorescence Staining—For immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown on glass coverslips at 37 °C. After being fixed in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Tetramethylrhodamine-phalloidin, anti-keratin antibody, anti-lectin-like domain antibody, or anti-human TM EGF-like domain antibody was applied to the samples. After three PBS washes, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with tetramethylrhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies. Glass coverslips were washed three times with PBS, mounted, and examined using a confocal microscope. Calcium Switch Methods—Cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips at a constant density (5 × 104 cells/well) in 24-well culture plates. The cells were serum-starved for 8 h, and Ca2+ was removed by incubation with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. After 1 h, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.8 mm Ca2+ was added to replace the Ca2+-free medium. In control experiments, cells received fresh medium in the absence of EGTA. In selected experiments, 10 μg/ml of anti-TM lectin-like antibody, 10 μg/ml isotype-specific control antibody or anti-E-cadherin antibody (20 μg/ml) was added to the Ca2+-containing medium. Determination of Carbohydrate Specificity for TM-mediated Cell Adhesion—A variety of simple carbohydrates (d-mannose, d-galactose, d-lactose, d-glucose, d-xylose), heparin, low molecular weight heparin, chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate B, and chondroitin sulfate C were tested to determine their ability to block cell-cell adhesion of the TMG cells. In these experiments, the carbohydrate to be tested was added to the cell monolayer to compare its ability to compete with the TMG. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C overnight and examined by light microscopy (Leica model DM IL). Monolayer Permeability Assay—Horseradish peroxidase flux across A2058 cell monolayers was measured using Transwell cell culture chambers (0.4-μm pore polycarbonate filters; Corning) as previously described (26Herren B. Garton K.J. Coats S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. Raines E.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, A2058 cells (7.5 × 104) were cultured for 2–3 days in Transwell units (Corning). After reaching confluence, cells were washed, and the medium was replaced with serum-free medium (1.5-ml upper chamber and 2.6-ml lower chamber). Type IV-A horseradish peroxidase (0.1 μm) was added to the upper chamber and incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time, medium in the lower chambers was assayed for horseradish peroxidase activity using a 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) liquid substrate system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Tumor Growth in Vivo—To study the in vivo growth of A2058 cells, BALB/c SCID male mice were used. Cells (106) in 100 μl of PBS were injected subcutaneously into 6–8-week-old male mice. Tumor sizes were recorded every 7 days by measuring the two largest diameters. Expression of TMG and TMG(ΔL) Proteins in A2058 Cells— The cDNA encoding either the full-length human TM or the lectin-like domain truncated TM was cloned from human DNA and ligated to the GFP gene in the mammalian expression vector pEGFPN1 (Fig. 1A). Each recombinant gene was transfected into A2058 cells. Several stable clones expressing TM-GFP fusion proteins were initially screened by the presence of GFP autofluorescence on the cell membrane. These clones (TMG and TMG(ΔL)) were maintained for the experiments described subsequently. The thrombin-interacting domain of TM extended to the outer surface of the cells (as expected in native TM) because the cells expressing TMG or TMG(ΔL) proteins activated protein C in conjunction with thrombin, whereas clones that expressed GFP alone showed no thrombin-dependent protein C activation (Fig. 1B). The TMG and TMG(ΔL) proteins had molecular masses of 110 and 94 kDa, respectively, which were close to the calculated values (Fig. 1C). TM Localization and Cell Morphology—The cell morphology and subcellular localization of GFP-tagged TM protein in A2058 cells were monitored by confocal microscopy. The green fluorescence of the GFP-expressed cells was evident in the cytoplasm, with a higher concentration in the nuclear region (Fig. 2A). Conversely, the green fluorescence of TMG proteins was distributed near the cell surface, particularly at regions of cell-to-cell contact (Fig. 2B). The fluorescence of TMG(ΔL) was evenly distributed on the cell membrane (Fig. 2C). The cells expressing TMG clustered closely together, with strong cell-to-cell adhesion that was distinctly different from parental A2058 cells and cells expressing GFP or TMG(ΔL) (Fig. 2). Phase-contrast images also showed that cells expressing TMG produced compact cell colonies, and cells at the edges of colonies rarely extended membrane protrusions onto the surrounding cell-free surface (Fig. 3A). In contrast, both the clones of the GFP- or TMG(ΔL)-expressed cells were poorly compacted and had a more fibroblastic morphology than TMG-expressed cells (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in five stable clones of TMG and seven clones of TMG(ΔL). Lectin-like Domain-mediated Cell-to-cell Adhesion—Because accumulation of TM proteins in the cell-to-cell adhesion sites led to the establishment of the compact clustering morphology, we further explored whether the lectin-like domain of TM played a critical role in cell-to-cell contacts. A monoclonal antibody (clone D-3) directed against the lectin-like domain was used to block the function of lectin-like domain and to test its effect on cell morphology. The antibody bound specifically to TM protein in the TMG cell lysates rather than any proteins in the control or TMG(ΔL) cell lysates, as shown by Western blotting results. When the TMG-expressed cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the lectin-like domain, the cell-to-cell contacts were completely inhibited (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the antibody specific for the EGF-like domain of TM did not cause the TMG-expressed cells to assume the dispersed type colony (Fig. 3B). These results were consistent with a more critical role of the lectin-like domain versus the EGF-like domain in promoting the formation of close cell-to-cell contacts in the cultures of TMG-expressed cells. To further investigate the effect of TM expression on the permeability of the cell-to-cell junction, the infiltration ability of horseradish peroxidase through a monolayer of the cell cultures on the polycarbonate membrane was measured using a Transwell assay system. The permeability of the monolayer of TMG cell cultures was significantly lower compared with the TMG(ΔL) and control cells (Fig. 4). Previous reports have demonstrated that human keratinocytes express TM, which appears to be predominantly localized to the cell membrane and the intercellular bridges (20Raife T.J. Lager D.J. Madison K.C. Piette W.W. Howard E.J. Sturm M.T. Chen Y. Lentz S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To further verify the potential physiologic importance of TM in the cell-to-cell adhesion junction, a keratinocyte cell line derived from normal human epidermis (HaCaT) (25Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar), which expressed TM endogenously, was used to observe the morphologic changes in the presence of a monoclonal antibody directed against the lectin-like domain of TM. Immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-TM lectin-like domain antibody showed that a high concentration of TM protein was localized at the intercellular boundary of HaCaT cells (Fig. 5A). The cultured HaCaT cells showed typical compacted sheet-forming colonies. However, HaCaT cells were almost completely dissociated when cultured in the medium containing the anti-lectin-like domain antibody for 24 h. The anti-EGF domain antibody or the isotype control IgG failed to dissociate the compact colonies (Fig. 5, B–D). Ca2+Involvement in TM-mediated Cell-to-cell Adhesion— The NH2 terminus of the TM molecule contains a C-type lectin domain, to which the binding of potential ligand is Ca2+-dependent. The Ca2+ switch method was utilized to investigate whether TM-mediated adhesion junction assembly is Ca2+-dependent. The cell-to-cell contacts of the A2058TMG (Fig. 6A) or HaCaT (Fig. 6F) cells were disrupted when the culture medium was changed to the EGTA-containing medium for 40 min (Fig. 6, B and G). The cell-to-cell adhesion junction was restored in the Ca2+-containing medium for 1 h with the presence of 10 μg/ml control IgG (Fig. 6, C and H). To further verify the TM domain that was directly involved in the Ca2+-modulated adhesion, the functional antibody against the lectin-like domain of TM was added to the Ca2+-containing medium, following the EGTA dissociation of cell-to-cell adhesion. No restoration of cell-to-cell adhesion occurred in the presence of a 10 μg/ml concentration of the antibody (Fig. 6, D and I). Furthermore, TM localization became more uniformly distributed rather than concentrated at the intercellular region (Fig. 6I). Anti-E-cadherin antibody (20 μg/ml) was able to inhibit Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion in HaCaT cells (Fig. 6J) but not in TMG cells (Fig. 6E). TMG Colocalized with Actin Filaments at the Submembrane Cortex—The intracellular domains of adhesion molecules, including cadherins and integrins, interact with the cytoskeleton actin filaments or intermediate filaments through adaptor proteins inside the cell. These interactions provide mechanical continuity from cell to cell (27Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We examined the colocalization of the TMG proteins and these cytoskeletal elements in TMG-expressed cells by confocal microscopy. The actin and intermediate filaments in the cultured cells were immunohistochemically stained with tetramethylrhodamine-labeled phalloidin or anti-human keratin antibody, respectively. The surface TM molecules and actin filaments were colocalized at the cortex region in cell-cell adhesion sites (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the keratin filaments localized in the cytoplasmic region, and there was little overlap in distribution between the TM and intermediate filaments (Fig. 7B). Influence of Mannose, Chondroitin Sulfate A, or Chondroitin Sulfate C on the Cell-cell Adhesion in TMG Cells—Based on the observation that TMG-expressed A2058 cells formed close clustering colonies, we proposed that the lectin-like domain of TM might mediate the cell-cell adhesion by binding to specific carbohydrate moieties of the neighboring cells. To test the hypothesis, different carbohydrates, including d-mannose, d-galactose, d-glucose, d-xylose, d-lactose, chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C, heparin, and low molecular weight heparin, were tested for their ability to disperse the close clustering morphology of the TMG culture cells. Among these monosaccharides, only mannose was found to be effective in inducing of cell dispersion. Among the sulfate-containing polysaccharides, chondroitin sulfate A (chondroitin 4-sulfate) and chondroitin sulfate C (chondroitin 6-sulfate) also could induce cell dispersion. Heparin showed a minor inhibitory effect on the cell adhesion. On the other ha"

Biol. Chem. 277, 22426–22429). Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors suppressed both ABCA1 stabilization and cellular lipid release mediated by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) but not ABCA1 increase by calpain inhibitors. The increase of ABCA1 and the cellular lipid release by apoA-I were both suppressed by a phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C (PC-PLC) inhibitor but not by the inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-PLC and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. A protein phosphatase inhibitor further enhanced the ABCA1 increase by apoA-I. Biochemical and microscopic evidence indicated that apoA-I activated PKCα, and phosphorylation of ABCA1 was directly demonstrated by apoA-I via PKC. Finally, digestion of sphingomyelin increased ABCA1, and a PC-PLC inhibitor suppressed it. We conclude that apoA-I activates PKCα by PC-PLC-mediated generation of diacylglycerol initiated by the removal of cellular sphingomyelin ((2002) J. Biol.

Cholesterol is an essential lipid molecule having many important biological functions, such as regulation of the general physicochemical properties of the biomembrane, formation of its microdomains with sphingomyelin to accommodate various signal-related molecules, direct modification of a key signal protein hedgehog for development, and biosynthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids. On the other hand, cholesterol is synthesized in most somatic cells, whereas its catabolic site is limited to the liver and steroidogenic cells except for partial hydroxylation in the peripheral cells. Therefore, release of cell cholesterol is a major event in cholesterol homeostasis not only for cells but also for whole animal bodies.

Thus, the essential role of ABCA1 in the HDL assembly reaction is obvious, although the molecular mechanism for ABCA1 to mediate the cellular lipid release and HDL assembly is still vague. We and others have discovered that helical apolipoproteins in their free form stabilize ABCA1 against its degradation by thiol protease, most likely calpain, and increase its protein level in cells (16Arakawa R.

This is a self-activated positive feedback system for the HDL assembly, so that its molecular mechanism is one of the key factors for regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis and plasma HDL level. In this paper, we demonstrate that the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway plays an essential role in the apoA-I-induced stabilization and phosphorylation of ABCA1. This particular signaling is presumably activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) produced by phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C (PC-PLC) for replenishment of sphingomyelin (SPM) removed by apoA-I (18Ito J.

Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with various compounds and apoA-I in MEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA/MEM). None of conditions for cell treatment influenced cell viability as determined by LDH release assay (Wako), cellular protein, and lipid level. Cellular Lipid Release Assay—WI-38 cells were seeded into 6-well trays at a density of 1.0–1.5 × 105 cells/well and grown to a confluent stage. Cellular lipid release was induced by 10 μg/ml apoA-I or 0.5% CD in BSA/MEM. Lipid was extracted from the medium and cells, and total and free cholesterol and choline-phospholipid were measured (12Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S.

Western Blotting of ABCA1—Total membrane fraction was prepared, and ABCA1 was analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit antiserum against the C-terminal peptide of human ABCA1 (16Arakawa R. Yokoyama S.

Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The density of the visualized protein bands was quantitated by digital scanning in an Epson GT9500. Metabolic Labeling of ABCA1 by [35S]Methionine/Cysteine or [32P]Orthophosphate—For WI-38, 9-cis retinoic acid was present throughout the experiments. In [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling, WI-38 cells at a confluent stage in 100-mm dish or HEK293 cells in 60-mm dish were incubated with methionine/cysteine-free MEM for 30 min, and [35S]methionine/cysteine, 0.2 or 0.4 mCi/ml, was added for a further 2-h incubation. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in BSA/MEM with apoA-I or ALLN. For labeling with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml and 0.25 mCi/ml for WI-38 and 293 cells, respectively), cells at a confluent stage in 60-mm dishes were washed three times with phosphate-free MEM and incubated with [32P]orthophosphate for 3–3.5 h in phosphate-free MEM containing 0.1% BSA. Stimulants (10 μg/ml apoA-I, 320 nm PMA, or 0.5 mm dibutyryl cAMP) were added to the [32P]orthophosphate-containing medium 1 h before termination of incubation. After the treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and collected. The cells were lysed with a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture) by rotation for 20 min at 4 °C. When the cells were 32P-labeled, the lysis buffer contained phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) as a final concentration of 1% (v/v). The cell lysate was centrifuged at low speed to remove cellular and nuclear debris. The supernatant was analyzed by immunoprecipitation using rabbit anti-human ABCA1 serum and protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after the cell lysate was incubated with protein A-agarose and standard rabbit serum (16Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated ABCA1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed at –80 °C. A Fuji BAS 2000 scanner (Fujifilm) was used to visualize and quantitiate radiolabeled proteins. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared by using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) from WI-38 cells at a confluent stage in 60-mm dishes after incubation under various conditions. First-strand cDNA synthesized by using total RNA and a SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) was amplified by TaqDNA polymerase (TaKaRa) with specific primers for human ABCA1 cDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA for 20, 24, and 28 cycles of PCR (16Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR product was analyzed in a 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Molecular Probes). PKC Assay—Cells in a confluent stage in 100-mm dishes were incubated in BSA/MEM for 20–24 h prior to stimulation by apoA-I, 10 μg/ml, or PMA, 160 nm, for 20–30 min. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and pelletted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min for membrane preparation. The pellet was resuspended in the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm benzamidine) and sonicated at 20 watts for 30 s in ice. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the pelletted membrane fraction was resuspended in the same buffer. PKC activity in the membrane fraction was determined by using a MESACUP Protein Kinase Assay Kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The method was validated by activation of PKC by a 30-min incubation with PMA to yield the increase of membrane-associated PKC by 5.2-fold. In addition, rabbit anti-PKCα serum purchased from Sigma and rabbit antibodies against PKCβ, PKCγ, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCζ from Invitrogen were used for their immunoblotting analysis. Transient Expression of PKCα-GFP and Its Microscopic Observations—PKCα-GFP vector was obtained from Clontech. The GFP-tagged PKCα plasmid was transfected into WI-38 cells 18–24 h after seeding to glass-coated 35-mm dish (Iwaki) by LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The medium was changed to BSA/MEM 24 h after transfection, and cells were further incubated for 2–3 h. ApoA-I (10 μg/ml) or PMA (160 nm) was added to the medium, and translocation of PKCα-GFP was observed for 30 min at room temperature under Nikon microscopy with a charge-coupled device camera (CCD) (Keyence). As shown elsewhere (16Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), stabilization of ABCA1 by apoA-I was also demonstrated in human fibroblast cell line WI-38 cells that expresses both ABCA1 and caveolin-1 and generates cholesterol-rich HDL by apoA-I (19Yamauchi Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ApoA-I increased ABCA1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). It became apparent within 30 min (increase to 132% based on densitometric estimation) and was evident even after substantial cholesterol removal by 24-h incubation (226% at 8 h and 192% at 24 h). On the other hand, equivalent cholesterol removal by CD (19Yamauchi Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) resulted in decrease of ABCA1 (64%), suggesting that cholesterol removal is not a trigger of the ABCA1 stabilization. The slow catabolic rate of ABCA1 by apoA-I was demonstrated in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 1B) and by a pulse labeling experiment (Fig. 1C). In contrast, ABCA1 mRNA was not influenced by apoA-I for 4 h; rather, it decreased after 24 h, moderately by apoA-I, and markedly by CD, presumably because of the decrease of cell cholesterol (Fig. 1D). Retardation of ABCA1 catabolism by apoA-I was also shown for the transfected ABCA1-GFP in HEK293 (20Tanaka A.R. Abe-Dohmae S. Ohnishi T. Aoki R. Morinaga G. Okuhira K. Ikeda Y. Kano F. Matsuo M.

Consistent with previous work (16Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P.

Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), a thiol protease inhibitor, ALLN, retarded ABCA1 degradation in WI-38 and HEK293/ABCA1-GFP. ABCA1 was apparently increased up to 170% by ALLN (Fig. 2A) and up to 170 and 150% by calpain inhibitors calpeptin and PD150606 (Fig. 2C), respectively, in WI-38. The retarded degradation of ABCA1 by ALLN was demonstrated by inhibiting translation by CHX and by pulse-labeling in WI-38 (Fig. 2, B and D) and in HEK293 (Fig. 2E). Thus, the calpain-mediated degradation of ABCA1 was shown to be a common pathway to regulate cellular ABCA1. To test the hypothesis that PKCα-related signal transduction is involved in the apoA-I-induced cellular events (22Theret N. Delbart C. Aguie G. Fruchart J.C. Vassaux G. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12045-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the effect of PKC modulators on this reaction was examined in WI-38 human fibroblasts (Fig. 3). ApoA-I-induced increase of ABCA1 (284%) was suppressed by H-7, bisindolylmaleimide I, and sphingosine to 132, 142, and 140%, respectively (Fig. 3A), whereas PKC activation by PMA increased ABCA1 (170–180% by PMA and 103% by 4αPMA) (Fig. 3B). Gö6976, a specific inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKCα and -βI (26Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), almost canceled the apoA-I-mediated 2–3-fold increase of ABCA1 at either 4 or 24 h, and it prevented retardation of the ABCA1 decay by apoA-I when translation was blocked by CHX to the same extent based on density (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, the inhibitors of PKC did not influence the mRNA level of ABCA1 (Fig. 3D). In the absence of apoA-I, ABCA1 level was not significantly influenced by PKC inhibitors, and the increase of ABCA1 by the calpain inhibitors ALLN and calpeptin was uninfluenced by Gö6976 (Fig. 3E). The increase was to 160 and 180% by ALLN and 192 and 170% by calpeptin in the absence and presence of Gö6976, respectively. Therefore, PKC is involved in the steps initiated by apoA-I and not directly in the proteolysis by calpain. Fig. 4 shows the effects of PKC inhibitors on the apoA-I-mediated release of cellular lipid. H-7 inhibited the cholesterol release from WI-38 in a dose-dependent manner to reach a maximum of 52% at 50 μm (Fig. 4A). The release of phospholipid also decreased by 20% (Fig. 4B). In contrast, HA1004, a control compound of H-7 and an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), did not influence the apoA-I-mediated lipid release. A potent PKA inhibitor, H-89, however, inhibited the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid release by 56 and 76%, respectively, at 10 μm, consistent with previous observations (27See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Nonspecific cholesterol efflux to CD was reduced by neither H-7 nor HA1004 (an apparent increase by H-7 at the highest concentration was because of the apparent decrease of cell protein, for unknown reasons, and the efflux per well and percent efflux were both unchanged) (Fig. 4C). In addition, more specific PKC inhibitors, bisindolylmaleimide I, sphingosine, and Gö6976, reduced the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol and phospholipid by 40–60% and 20–30%, respectively (Fig. 4, D–F). Short-time incubation (4 h) also yielded similar results (data not shown). Other PKC inhibitors such as chelerythrine and long-term treatment with PMA also inhibited apoA-I-mediated cholesterol release (data not shown). The results were thus consistent with the effects of the PKC inhibitors on the apoA-I-induced change of ABCA1. A PKC activation is initiated by the production of DAG mediated by PC hydrolysis by PC-PLC and/or phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover by PI-PLC. We therefore undertook experiments to observe the effects of inhibitors of the PLCs. The stabilization of ABCA1 by apoA-I (increase to 180%) was counteracted by D609, a PC-PLC inhibitor (102%), but not by the PI-PLC inhibitor U73122 (206%) (and its inactive analogue, U73343, 190%) (Fig. 5A, panel 1). The ABCA1 stabilization was not influenced by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 either (180%), further supporting the hypothesis that PI turnover is not involved in this reaction (Fig. 5A, panel 1). Our recent finding indicated that acute reduction of SPM in cells by digestion or by apoA-I-mediated removal induces SPM replenishment by the PC-PLC-mediated PC hydrolysis that generate phosphorylcholine and DAG (18Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Ueno S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44709-44714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of SPM digestion on ABCA1 was examined. ABCA1 was increased by sphingomyelinase treatment to 200–250% (Fig. 5A, panel 2, SPMase), and both Gö6976 and D609 partially inhibited this effect by reversing the 140% increase to 101 and 99%, respectively (Fig. 5A, panel 3). The effect of the PLC inhibitors on apoA-I-mediated lipid release was consistent with the effects of these inhibitors on the increase of ABCA1 by apoA-I; only D609 suppressed the release of cholesterol and phospholipid by apoA-I (Fig. 5B, panels 1–3). To affirm the observations made by using PKC inhibitors, we measured PKC activation by apoA-I. ApoA-I induced translocation of PKC to the membrane fraction indicating PKC activation by apoA-I (Fig. 6A). Western blotting analysis showed that WI-38 cells predominantly express PKCα, and PKCβ and PKCγ at very low levels (data not shown); Gö6976 selectively inhibits Ca2+-dependent PKCα and PKCβI (26Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that PKCα is likely to be a PKC isotype involved in apoA-I-induced ABCA1 stabilization. To test this idea, PKCα tagged with GFP was transiently expressed in WI-38, and the transfected cells were stimulated by apoA-I. PMA induced translocation of the PKCα-GFP to plasma membrane as well as to cytoplasmic vesicular-like compartments (Fig. 6B, top), and a similar translocation profile was demonstrated by apoA-I at 10–20 min after stimulation (Fig. 6B, middle), consistent with the profile of PKCα-GFP activation by other stimuli (29Ng T. Squire A. Hansra G. Bornancin F. Prevostel C. Hanby A. Harris W. Barnes D. Schmidt S. Mellor H. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J.

The time course of the PKCα-GFP translocation by apoA-I was consistent with the PKC activation shown in Fig. 6A. PKCα-GFP translocation by apoA-I was completely blocked by Gö6976 (Fig. 6B, bottom). D609 (50 μg/ml) also inhibited the apoA-I-induced translocation of PKCα-GFP (data not shown). PKC catalyzes phosphorylation of serine and/or threonine residues in specific amino acid residue sequences, and ABCA1 contains several serine and threonine residues that are potentially phosphorylated by PKC. We therefore investigated phosphorylation of ABCA1 by apoA-I. ABCA1 was phosphorylated with PKA activation by dibutyryl cAMP in both WI-38 and HEK293 cells expressing ABCA1-GFP, consistent with previous work by others (27See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A."

Little is known concerning the cell signaling systems that receive, transduce, and convey mechanical information to the chondrocyte interior. Here, we show that ex vivo cartilage compression stimulates the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/ERK kinase-1 (SEK1) of the JNK pathway. Mechanical compression induced a phased phosphorylation of ERK consisting of a rapid induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation at 10 min, a rapid decay, and a sustained level of ERK2 phosphorylation that persisted for at least 24 h. Mechanical compression also induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in strictly a transient fashion, with maximal phosphorylation occurring at 10 min. Mechanical compression stimulated SEK1 phosphorylation, with a maximum at the relatively delayed time point of 1 h and with a higher amplitude than ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that mechanical compression alone activates MAPK signaling in intact cartilage. In addition, these data demonstrate distinct temporal patterns of MAPK signaling in response to mechanical loading and to the anabolic insulin-like growth factor-I. Finally, the data indicate that compression coactivates distinct signaling pathways that may help define the nature of mechanotransduction in cartilage.

Articular cartilage serves as a bearing surface for joints (1Muir H. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 2Huber M. Trattnig S. Lintner F. Investig. Radiol. 2000; 35: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this capacity, it is routinely exposed to mechanical loading. Articular cartilage is nearly unique among mammalian tissues in that it lacks a blood supply. This removes it from the minute-to-minute hormonal regulation available to other more vascularized tissues. In this environment, mechanical forces may play an important role in regulating cellular functions within tissues (3Urban J.P. Biorheology. 2000; 37: 185-190PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, in vivo joint loading can result in peak dynamic mechanical stresses on cartilage as high as 15-20 megapascals (150-200 atmospheres) (4Hodge W.A. Fijan R.S.

These peak stresses occur over very short durations (<1 s) and therefore lead to cartilage compressive strains of only 1-3%. In contrast, sustained (static) physiological stresses of ∼3.5 megapascals applied to cadaveric knee joints for 5-30-min durations resulted in compressive strains of various knee cartilages as high as 40-45% (5Herberhold C.

Such static compressive forces can down-regulate the gene expression and production of type II collagen, aggrecan core protein, and link protein (11Kim Y.J. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H. Arch. Biochem.

Articular cartilage biosynthetic activity is also regulated by cell signaling molecules.

Rather, it is thought that specific mechanotransduction mechanisms mediate the chondrocyte biosynthetic machinery under load (11Kim Y.J. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H. Arch. Biochem.

Mechanical forces are complex multicomponent stimuli. The relatively simple case of a ramp-and-hold static compression of cartilage can result in transient interstitial fluid expression, cell deformation (25Freeman P.M. Natarajan R.N. Kimura J.H. Andriacchi T.P. J. Orthop. Res. 1994; 12: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), increased osmolarity (26Urban J.P. Hall A.C. Gehl K.A. J. Cell.

Res. 1995; 13: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), changes in fixed charge density (28Mow V.C. Wang C.C. Hung C.T. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 41-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and altered transport of soluble factors within the tissue (22Bonassar L.J. Grodzinsky A.J. Srinivasan A. Davila S.G. Trippel S.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Each of these physical phenomena may potentially act as a “mechano-ligand” activating or inhibiting one or more signaling pathways. Prior studies have often focused on the effects of one or a few of these components of compressive loading such as negative fixed charge density (26Urban J.P. Hall A.C. Gehl K.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) or interstitial pH (22Bonassar L.J. Grodzinsky A.J. Srinivasan A. Davila S.G. Trippel S.B. Arch. Biochem.

Black A.C. Hunziker E.B. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also demonstrated that mechanical stretching of chondrocytes can increase nitric oxide production (31Lee D.A. Frean S.P. Lees P. Bader D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and alter membrane transport phenomena, resulting in proliferative changes (32Wu Q.Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In many cell types, protein kinases are critical mediators of the cellular responses involved in the minute-to-minute regulation of tissue function. Little is known of the role of signaling by protein kinases in cartilage in response to load. The existing evidence for MAPK involvement in chondrocyte mechanotransduction is particularly scant. Interestingly, however, previous kinetic studies found that the chondrocytic response to static load is unlikely to be due to the intermediary action of cytokines or growth factors (22Bonassar L.J. Grodzinsky A.J. Srinivasan A. Davila S.G. Trippel S.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that a mechanism of direct mechanical regulation of cartilage exists. At present, published data linking any MAPK pathway activation to mechanotransduction events in cartilage are limited to the response to fluid shear flow applied over plated chondrocyte monolayers using fluid velocities that are much higher than those known to occur during cartilage loading in vivo (33Jin G. Sah R.L. Li Y.S. Lotz M. Shyy J.Y. Chien S. J. Orthop. Res. 2000; 18: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Hung C.T. Henshaw D.R. Wang C.C. Mauck R.L. Raia F. Palmer G. Chao P.H. Mow V.C. Ratcliffe A. Valhmu W.B. J. Biomech. 2000; 33: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, the temporal organization of simultaneously activated pathways has, to our knowledge, not been investigated. This is particularly true for the analysis of chondrocyte signaling under physiologically relevant loads applied to cells in situ within their native matrix. Such information would have potential relevance to the pre-pathological states leading up to the formation of degenerative joint disease. To gain further insight into the mechanisms of mechanotransduction in chondrocytes, we have studied the role of MAPK pathways in response to mechanical compression of chondrocytes within their native cartilage. We have demonstrated that activation of the ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways is mechano-dependent and that these pathways are differentially activated with respect to each other and with respect to IGF-I. Materials—Articular cartilage was obtained from freshly harvested intact juvenile bovine femorotibial joints (Arena, Inc., Hopkinton, MA). The protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Phosphorylation state-specific ERK1/2, anti-p38 and anti-SEK1 polyclonal antibodies; phosphorylation state-independent anti-ERK1/2 and anti-p38 antibodies; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Protran™ nitrocellulose was from Schleicher & Schüll. The enhanced chemiluminescence detection substrate (ECL) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were from Sigma and were the purest grade available. Cartilage Explant Preparation and Compression for Dose-response Studies—Disks of articular cartilage (3 × 1 mm, diameter × thickness) were harvested from the femoropatellar groove of newborn calves and were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, an additional 0.4 mm proline, and 20 μg/ml ascorbate (basal medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 2 days. Disks were subjected to graded levels of unconfined uniaxial static mechanical compression in incubator-housed compression chambers containing fresh basal medium plus designated amounts of FBS. Compression was expressed as a percentage of the original cut thickness of the disks (1 mm). Loading conditions included no compression and 0 (held at 1 mm), 12, 25, 35, and 50% compression. In each experiment, 12 cartilage disks were simultaneously compressed within a loading chamber designated for each loading condition, unless noted otherwise. Following compression for the indicated time periods, the disks from within an individual compression chamber were pooled, rinsed with serum-free medium, blotted dry, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. This termination procedure was repeated for each compression chamber. To evaluate the effect of loading in the presence of low serum concentrations (2%) and in the absence of serum, experiments were performed as described above with the exception that cartilage disks were incubated in basal medium containing 2% FBS for 2 days following harvest and then segregated into two groups of 48 disks each. One group was cultured for an additional 24 h in fresh basal medium containing 2% FBS. The other was cultured in fresh basal medium containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin. All cartilage disks were then subjected to graded compressive loads (no compression and 0, 12, 25, 35, and 50% compression; eight disks per load condition) for 4 h in basal medium. Following compression, disks from within an individual compression chamber were pooled, rinsed with basal medium, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. This termination procedure was repeated for each compression chamber. Cartilage Explant Preparation and Compression for Time Course Studies—In short-term time course experiments, cartilage disks were harvested and incubated in basal medium containing 2% FBS as described above. Cartilage disks were maintained at no compression and at 0 or 50% of the original cut thickness for 10, 20, 40, or 60 min. In long-term time course experiments, cartilage disks were maintained at either 0 or 50% of the original cut thickness and compressed for 4, 8, 12, or 24 h (eight disks per time condition). Following compression, the disks from within each compression chamber were pooled, rinsed with serum-free medium, briefly blotted dry, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. This termination procedure was repeated for each compression chamber. IGF-I Treatment of Cartilage Explants—Cartilage was harvested as described above with the exception that explants were cut into disks of 3 × 0.5 mm (diameter × thickness) to facilitate IGF-I diffusive penetration into the full thickness of the disks. After incubation for 2 days in basal medium containing 2% FBS, the medium was removed, and all disks were serum-starved in basal medium for 24 h. The cartilage disks were then incubated in basal medium in the presence or absence of 300 ng/ml human recombinant IGF-I (PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) for graded time periods (10, 20, and 40 min and 4, 12, and 24 h) under no compression. At the completion of incubation, disks comprising each individual IGF-I/time combination were pooled, rinsed with serum-free medium, blotted dry, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue Preparation and Immunoblotting—Cartilage disks were pulverized under liquid nitrogen using a Bessman tissue pulverizer (Fisher) and then homogenized using a Polytron device (Brinkmann Instruments) for 45 s in buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) at a ratio of 100 μl/10 mg of tissue. Homogenates were extracted by end-over-end rotation for 1 h at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 60 min. Supernatants were quantified for protein concentration using the BCA assay (Pierce). Aliquots containing 40 μg of protein suspended in Laemmli buffer were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% resolving gel); transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes; and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline/Tween) for 2 h at 37 °C. Membranes were incubated with phosphorylation state-specific antibody (1:1000) or phosphorylation state-independent antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C, washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween (3 × 5 min), incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature, and again washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween (5 × 10 min). For the ECL reaction, immunoblots were developed for 1 min in Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The respective phosphoproteins or total proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence on x-ray film (Blue Sensitive autoradiographic film, Marsh Biomedical Products, Inc., Rochester, NY) and then quantified using a computing densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were determined by calculating the sum of all pixel optical density values within selected bands minus the background (volume integration). Band intensity profiles are denoted on individual figures by use of the arbitrary term “Volume” and are meant to identify total optical density units of band intensity minus the appropriate background values. Note that specific phosphorylation state-independent antibodies were utilized in conjunction with the corresponding phosphorylation state-specific antibodies on immunoblots to demonstrate equivalency of protein loading between lanes for each phosphoprotein analyzed. In each case, protein loading was found to be equivalent, or minor differences were not correlative with phosphorylation trends between lanes. Statistical Analysis—For strain dose dependence and time course experiments, the density of bands within given blots was normalized to that of the most common test condition between the various experiments of that type. Two-way ANOVAs of strain and time were then used to determine whether significant changes were present. In case of significance, two-tailed Student's t tests and one-way ANOVAs were performed to determine where the significance occurred. Dependent values created by normalization were removed. Statistical analyses were performed using the SYSTAT Version 9.0 statistical software package (SYSTAT Software Inc., Richmond, CA). Note that each figure depicts a representative immunoblot and its accompanying band intensity plot for each type of experiment performed. However, all available data from individual experiments were utilized in the generation of statistical analyses. Mechanical Compression Activates the ERK1/2 MAPK Pathway in Bovine Cartilage Explants—Cartilage explants were subjected to graded amounts of compression ranging from 0% (cut thickness) to 50%, and the activation state of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway was assessed by immunoblot analysis using phosphorylation state-specific anti-ERK1/2 antibodies. Both the ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) kinases were phosphorylated in a dose-dependent manner within the 0-50% compression range (Fig. 1). This dose-dependent response was observed in n = 10 separate experiments. The pattern and degree of load-induced ERK1/2 activation were similar under the two serum conditions except at the maximal compression tested (50%). These data suggest that mechanical compression activates the ERK1/2 pathway and that this activation does not depend on the presence of exogenous serum growth factors. The maximal magnitudes of the increases in ERK phosphorylation were 2.2- and 3.7-fold for ERK1 and ERK2, respectively, at 50% compression for 4 h in the absence of serum. The effect of compression was consistently greater for ERK2 than for ERK1. This difference was observed at the various time points and compression levels tested in all experiments. The total ERK1/2 protein levels were assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were found to be equivalent among lanes (Fig. 1, gels, lower panels). Effect of Duration of Compression on Compression-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—To determine whether the dose-response pattern of compression-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 1) is dependent on the duration of the compressive stimulus, further dose-response experiments were carried out for shorter (10 min and 1 h) and longer (24 h) time periods. Dose-response analyses were performed using phosphorylation state-specific ERK1/2 immunoblot assays as described above. We found a nearly linear dose-response relationship between ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the magnitude of static compression after 10 min of compression (Fig. 2A). After a 1-h compression period, ERK1/2 phosphorylation showed a dose-response curve with a stronger plateau at the higher compressions (Fig. 2B). At 24 h, the dose-response pattern changed dramatically, with a significantly lower sensitivity to compression at the lower compressive strains (Fig. 2C). At all three time points, the maximal increase in ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation was observed at the highest magnitude of compression. Replicate experiments (n = 10) showed similar ERK1/2 phosphorylation patterns. Time Course of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in Response to Mechanical Compression—Cartilage explants were subjected to no compression (NC) or 0 or 50% compression for 10, 20, 40, and 60 min and then subjected to phosphorylation state-specific ERK1/2 immunoblot analysis. In shorter time course experiments, the phospho-ERK1/2 levels in the 50% compressed samples were highest at the earliest time point tested (10 min) and then decreased over the next 50 min (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained in n = three experiments. In longer time course experiments (n = two experiments), cartilage explants were analyzed by phosphorylation state-specific ERK1/2 immunoblotting following compression times of 4, 8, 12, and 24 h (Fig. 3B). The phospho-ERK2 levels were highest at the earliest time point (4 h) and decreased with time in a bimodal fashion (Fig. 3B). In the 8-h interval between the first three time points of the experiment (4-12 h), the phospho-ERK2 levels decreased by 82% of the total phospho-ERK2 decrease over the entire time interval of the experiment (4-24 h). This period of rapid decay was followed by an ∼12-h period of slower loss of phospho-ERK2 levels. Interestingly, at 50% compression, even after 24 h, the phospho-ERK2 levels remained elevated in comparison with samples held at 0% compression. These data indicate that one effect of static compression on cartilage explants is to produce a sustained ERK2 activation. As in the earlier dose-response experiments (Figs. 1 and 2), ERK1 phosphorylation was increased to a lesser degree than ERK2 phosphorylation by prolonged static compression. Time Course of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in Response to IGF-I—To compare mechanically induced ERK1/2 activation with activation by a known biochemical inducer of the ERK pathway, we investigated the time course of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to addition of IGF-I. Cartilage explants were harvested as described above and incubated in the absence or presence of 300 ng/ml IGF-I for the same time periods used for ERK1/2 activation in mechanically loaded explants. This concentration of IGF-I was chosen on the basis of previously reported dose-response studies demonstrating that, under the conditions of these experiments, 300 ng/ml is reproducibly on the upper plateau of the dose-response curve for IGF-I stimulation of [3H]proline and [35S]sulfate incorporation, indices of protein and glycosaminoglycan synthesis, respectively (22Bonassar L.J.

Bhaktav N.R. Trippel S.B. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). IGF-I produced an initial rapid increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, followed by a rapid decrease to the phospho-ERK1/2 levels present in untreated explants (Fig. 3C). This pattern of transient ERK1/2 activation is in contrast to the sustained activation produced by compressive stress (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in n = two experiments. Effect of Compression on p38 MAPK Phosphorylation—The p38 MAPK pathway is an alternative to the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in the response mechanism used by many cell types to adapt to environmental changes. To determine whether the p38 pathway is involved in mechanical regulation of cartilage, explants were subjected to graded levels of compression from 0 to 50%, and tissue extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activation state of p38 was assessed by immunoblot analysis using a phosphorylation state-specific anti-p38 antibody. After a 10-min loading period, compression produced a “dose-dependent” increase in phosphorylated p38, with a maximal stimulation at 50% compression, the highest magnitude of compression tested. Maximal stimulation was ∼5-fold compared with non-compressed samples. When analyzed 1 h after the onset of loading, the phosphorylated p38 MAPK levels remained close to base line, with maximal levels ∼4-fold lower than those observed at 10 min and with a marginal dose-response (Fig. 4). Similar trends were observed in n = five experiments. Time Course Responsiveness of p38 MAPK Phosphorylation—Cartilage explants were statically compressed to either 0 or 50% of the original cut thickness for graded time periods, and phospho-p38 was assessed by immunoblot analysis. At 0% compression, the phospho-p38 levels remained low over the entire duration of the short-term (10-60 min) (Fig. 5A) and long-term (20 min to 24 h) (Fig. 5B) experiments. The data of Figs. 4 and 5 (A and B) collectively indicate that, at 50% compression, maximal p38 phosphorylation occurred between 10 min and 4 h (Fig. 5, A and B), followed by a decline in phospho-p38 to levels close to those at 0% compression by 24 h (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that mechanical compression activates the p38 MAPK pathway in a transient fashion. Effect of Compression on SEK1 Phosphorylation—JNKs, together with the p38 kinases, constitute the SAPK subfamily of MAPKs (36Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell M"

Recently, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) has been identified as one of the effector molecules essential for lobuloalveolar development. The molecular mechanisms by which PRL may induce RANKL expression have not been carefully examined. Here we report that RANKL expression in the mammary gland is developmentally regulated and dependent on PRL and progesterone, whereas its receptor RANK (receptor activator of NF-κB) and decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) are constitutively expressed at all stages in both normal (PRL+/-) and prolactin knockout (PRL-/-) mice. In vitro, PRL markedly increased RANKL expression in primary mammary epithelial cells and RANKL-luciferase reporter activity in CHOD6 cells, which constitutively express the PRL receptor. We identified a γ-interferon activation sequence (GAS) in the region between residues -965 to -725 of the RANKL promoter, which conferred a PRL response. Using dominant negative mutants of recombinant Jak2 and Stat5 in CHOD6 cells, and by reconstituting the Jak2/Stat5 pathway in COS7 cells, we determined that Jak2 and Stat5a are essential for the PRL-induced RANKL expression in mammary gland.

Mammary gland development is a postnatal and discontinuous process, with two important phases: puberty and pregnancy. Each phase is controlled by the actions of reproductive hormones derived from the pituitary gland, ovaries, and placenta. At the onset of puberty estrogen and progesterone stimulate ductal growth and branching in the mammary fat pad. The epithelial ducts become decorated with subordinate branches and alveolar buds especially during pregnancy or repeated estrous cycles. The final development of mammary tissue into a functional lactating gland is primarily regulated by the pituitary hormone, prolactin (PRL), 1The abbreviations used are: PRL, prolactin; oPRL, ovine PRL; Jak2, Janice kinase 2; Stat, signal transducers and activators of transcription; OPG, osteoprotegerin; RANK, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; IKKα, inhibitor of κB kinase α; ovx, ovariectomy; wt, wild type; PMEC, primary mouse mammary epithelial cell; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WAP, whey acidic protein; IGF-2, insulin-like growth factor-2; GAS, γ interferon activating sequence. and occurs during post-partum (1Horseman N.D.

However, classic hormone ablation and replacement studies identified the critical roles of progesterone (P4) and PRL in the later stages of mammary gland development (4Topper Y.J. Freeman C.S.

Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Silberstein G.B. Van Horn K. Shyamala G. Daniel C.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The primary pathway by which PRL transduces its signal in epithelial cells has been identified (13Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Binding of PRL to its receptor activates Janus kinase2 (Jak2) a member of the protein-tyrosine kinase superfamily, which phosphorylates the latent transcription factor Stat5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) (8Kelly P.A. Bachelot A. Kedzia C. Hennighausen L. Ormandy C.J. Kopchick J.J. Binart N. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2002; 197: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Stat5 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to the PRL response elements (TTCTTGGAA), which conforms to the consensus γ-interferon-activating sequence GAS (TTCXXXGAA) (15Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). At present four Jak and seven Stat family members are known in mammals (16Watson C.J. J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Among them Jak2, Stat5a, and Stat5b have been shown definitively to be involved in PRL signaling (13Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Stat5a and 5b are encoded by two distinct genes, yet are highly similar. They bind to the same GAS site and show redundant functions except in the mammary gland, where only Stat5a is necessary for alveolar morphogenesis (16Watson C.J. J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, mice null for genes that encode PRL, PRL-receptor, and Stat5a exhibit similar phenotypes (8Kelly P.A. Bachelot A. Kedzia C. Hennighausen L. Ormandy C.J. Kopchick J.J. Binart N. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2002; 197: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All these mice failed to lactate due to undeveloped lobuloalveolar structures during pregnancy. RANKL knockout (RANKL-/-) mice exhibit severe osteopetrosis and failure of tooth eruption because of a complete absence of osteoclasts and defective bone remodeling. In addition, these mice show undeveloped lobuloalveolar buds and fail to express the milk protein β-casein, resulting in the death of pups. This phenotype has similarities to those earlier reported in mice lacking expression of genes related to PRL signaling. Taken together these studies suggest that RANKL may be one of the downstream targets of PRL (14Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 20Fata J.E. Kong Y.Y. Li J. Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Moorehead R.A. Elliott R. Scully S. Voura E.B.

RANKL, its biological receptor RANK, and decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) are the members of tumor necrosis factor and tumor necrosis factor receptor families. RANKL and RANK were first identified in activated T-cells and dendritic cells and subsequently in bone-forming osteoblast and bone-resorbing osteoclast cells (17Khosla S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5050-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The main function of RANKL is to increase the survival of dendritic cells and regulate Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating bone resorption in physiological and pathological conditions. RANKL signaling has been extensively studied in osteoclasts. Binding of RANK initiates a signaling cascade that activates NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and protein kinase B/AKT (17Khosla S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5050-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 18Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G. Scully S. Hsu H.

In subsequent studies it was noted that mice with a mutant version of the NF-κB regulatory kinase inhibitor of κB kinase α (IKKα) exhibited a similar mammary gland phenotype to that observed in RANKL-/- mice. IKKα-/- mice failed to activate NF-κB and up-regulate cyclin D1, a protein essential for epithelial cell proliferation. Interestingly, the IKKα-defective phenotype was rescued by overexpression of cyclin D1 in mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that NF-κB signaling, in addition to Stat signaling, plays a critical role in alveolar morphogenesis by inducing the cell cycle protein cyclin D1 (21Cao Y.

Previous studies have provided conflicting evidence regarding whether RANKL is one of the targets of PRL (20Fata J.E. Kong Y.Y. Li J. Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Moorehead R.A. Elliott R. Scully S.

Therefore, this study has been carried out to test the hypothesis that RANKL expression is PRL-dependent and to identify a signaling pathway by which PRL may induce RANKL expression in mammary gland. Here we show that RANKL expression is regulated during the course of mammary gland development. Using PRL gene-disrupted mice and in vitro studies, we show that PRL and P4 induce the expression of RANKL and that PRL acts through a Jak-Stat pathway that preferentially uses Stat5a. Animals and Hormone Treatment—Mice were maintained on a 14-h, 10-h daily light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. An ovariectomy (ovx) was done via a bilateral incision in the flanks. Surgeries were performed under general anesthesia and aseptic conditions. All experiments were conducted under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols. Sixteen-week-old female prolactin-deficient (PRL-/-) mice were treated by grafting an anterior pituitary gland from normal PRL+/- mice under the kidney capsule, implanted subcutaneously with 21-day release progesterone and estrogen tablets for 18 days, or were sham-operated essentially as described (23Matsuda M. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Lactating and virgin wt C57Bl/6J mice were purchased from the Harlan Laboratory. Cell Culture—Primary mouse mammary epithelial cells (PMECs) were prepared from virgin or pregnant mice by enzymatic digestion and differential trypsinization, according to the methods of Imagawa with modifications (24Imagawa W. Tomooka Y. Nandi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4074-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In brief, excised mammary glands were minced with a razor blade, transferred into 50-ml conical tubes, and digested in M199 medium (medium 199, 1×, Invitrogen catalog number 12350-39) containing bovine serum albumin (205 mg/ml, fraction V, Sigma) and 0.1% collagenase type III (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (100 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 h at 37 °C. Organoids were allowed to settle in rat tail collagen-coated dishes (BD Biosciences), washed twice with PBS, and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, insulin (5 mg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and 1× pen/strep (100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Resulting epithelial cells were plated (2 × 105) on conventional plastic tissue culture plates and treated with oPRL (5 μg/ml) (25Kim H.J. Yoon M.J. Lee J. Penninger J.M. Kong Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 277: 5339-5344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CHOD6 cells, a cell line that constitutively expresses pigeon PRL receptor, were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen, Rockville MD), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis. MO). COS7 cells were purchased from ATCC and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. Preparation of Total RNA and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from mammary gland or primary epithelial cells using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from each sample was treated with DNase I following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison WI). Two micrograms of the treated total RNA was reversed-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction using Superscript II RT and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The reverse-transcribed reaction (2 μl) was amplified by PCR (PCRExpress thermal cycler, Hybaid, Middlesex, UK) using TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) in a final reaction volume of 50 μl with 35 cycles (15 s at 94 °C, 30s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). Amplified products (10 μl) were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Sense and antisense primers for RANKL, RANK, and OPG used were as follows: RANKL, Sense 5′-CGCTCTGTTCCTGTACTTTCGAGCG-3′ and Antisense 5′-TCGTGCTCCCTCCTTTCATCAGGTT-3′; RANK, sense 5′-TTAAGCCAGTGCTTCACGGG-3′ and antisense 5′-ACGTAGACCACGATGATGTCGC-3′; and OPG, sense 5′-GTGGTGCAAGCTGGAACCCCAG-3′ and antisense 5′-AGGCCCTTCAAGGTGTCTTGGTC-3′. GAPDH, 28-S, WAP, and β-casein primers were used as described earlier (23Matsuda M. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection—CHOD6 cells were grown at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells in 12-well plates 24 h prior to the experiments. Transfections were conducted using either FuGENE (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total plasmid was transiently transfected containing 0.5 μg of reporter gene, and 100 ng each of β-galactosidase expression vector or pcDNA empty vector. In some experiments RANK and PRL-receptor and wild type Stat5 expression vectors were also used at a concentration of 100 ng/well. CHOD6 and PMEC cells were treated with 1 μg or 5 μg/ml ovine prolactin (oPRL) as noted and harvested after 24 h. Luciferase activities were measured using a Luciferase (Luc) reporter assay kit (Roche Applied Science), and β-galactosidase activities were measured using the Galacto-Light Plus™ Chemiluminescent reporter assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions in a single cell luminometer. Each well was corrected with β-galactosidase activity, and results were expressed as Luc activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Plasmid Constructs—Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The GAS sequence present in the RANKL promoter TACAGAGAA was changed to TACAGAcAg. Dn JAk2KD (double mutation in C-terminal kinase domain) and Jak2Δ829 (deletion of kinase domain after amino acid 829) were described previously (26Gao J. Hughes J.P. Auperin B. Buteau H. Edery M. Zhuang H. Wojchowski D.M. Horseman N.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 847-856PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length and Dn Stat5a and Stat5b constructs were as described (27Hou Z. Srivastava S. Mistry M.J. Herbst M.P. Bailey J.P. Horseman N.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1910-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—CHOD6 cells were grown in 100-mm culture plates and were either treated with 1 μg/ml oPRL for 30 min or remained untreated. Wild type and mutant probes were synthesized, annealed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]deoxy-CTP purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA) using Klenow Large Fragment DNA polymerase (Promega). Stat5a antibody #sc 1081 and Stat binding sequence #sc 2565(GAS) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts and EMSA were conducted as previously described (28Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Adler S. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Statistics and Experimental Replications—Each experiment was done in triplicate and was repeated at least three times. One representative experiment has been shown. Differences between means were tested by Student's t test (two-tailed). Differences among groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey's test for pairwise multiple comparisons. Significance was accepted for p < 0.05. Mammary RANKL Was Induced during Pregnancy and by Elevated PRL—The mammary gland is regulated by a variety of hormones and growth factors at specific stages of development. We first investigated whether RANKL expression was developmentally regulated and determined the effects of PRL, P4, and estrogen (E2) on RANKL, its receptor RANK, and its decoy receptor OPG. Total RNA was isolated from 4th mammary glands at various developmental stages in PRL normal+/- and PRL-/- mice. Total RNA (2 μg) was reversed-transcribed and subjected to PCR using gene-specific primers for RANKL, its receptor RANK, and osteoprotegerin (OPG). GAPDH was used as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 1A, RANKL expression was undetectable in normal virgin+/- and PRL-/- mice, and it was markedly increased with pregnancy and in PRL-/- mice exposed to high PRL levels by pituitary grafting (23Matsuda M. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, RANK and OPG were expressed similarly in all conditions examined. We also examined RANKL expression at various stages of pregnancy and lactation. RANKL expression was undetectable in virgin mice, gradually increased during pregnancy, peaked at day 17.5 during pregnancy, and decreased to a barely detectable level in late pregnancy, during lactation and involution. Gene expression for β-casein and whey acidic protein (WAP) was high from mid-pregnancy through lactation, and remained detectable during involution (Fig. 1B) Prolactin, Progesterone, and Estrogen Regulate RANKL Expression in Mammary Epithelial Cells—PRL, P4, and E2 are key hormones that coordinate the development of the mammary gland during early pregnancy. Therefore, we examined their effects on RANKL mRNA expression in PRL-/- mice using RT-PCR. 3-week-old mice were ovariectomized (ovx) or sham-operated and given 2 weeks for recovery. At the end of 2 weeks mice were pituitary-grafted to provide a high level of PRL stimulation (23Matsuda M. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In some mice E2 and P4 slow release capsules were implanted. After 9 days mice were sacrificed, and total RNA was extracted from the mammary gland and subjected to RT-PCR (diagrammatic representation Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, normal+/- and PRL-/- virgin mice controls did not express detectable levels of RANKL mRNA (lanes 1 and 2), and P4 treatment alone did not induce RANKL mRNA expression. Pituitary grafted mice with intact ovaries (lane 4) had markedly induced RANKL expression. In ovariectomized mice E2 and P4 together induced RANKL mRNA expression to a barely detectable level (lane 5). Pituitary grafted ovx mice expressed RANKL at high levels only when treated with E2 and P4 together (lane 8). These results demonstrate that PRL, E2, and progesterone are required to induce RANKL expression and alveolar bud formation in vivo. RANKL Is Expressed in Mammary Epithelial Cells but Not in Stromal Cells—Because whole mammary glands contain cells from both epithelial and stromal compartments, we could not conclude whether RANKL expression was restricted to one type or expressed in both cell types. To investigate this issue we isolated and cultured mammary epithelial cells and stromal cells from mammary glands of normal PRL+/- virgin mice for treatments in vitro. PRL treatment significantly induced RANKL mRNA expression in epithelial cells, whereas stromal cells failed to express RANKL under basal conditions or after stimulation with PRL (Fig. 3). RANK expression was also restricted to mammary epithelial cells and was not induced by PRL. In contrast, OPG was expressed in both stromal and epithelial cells. These observations suggest that an autocrine/paracrine mode of RANK/RANKL signaling in the mammary gland, with potential modulation by stromally derived OPG. Overexpression of Stat5a Induces RANKL Expression in Primary Epithelial Cells—To determine whether PRL and/or P4 alone can also induce RANKL expression in vitro, PMEC were treated with PRL or P4 (10-6m) in the presence or absence of E2 (10-7m). Epithelial cells treated with PRL and mammary tissues from pregnant mice were used as positive controls. P4 induced RANKL expression only in the presence of E2, to a degree similar to that of PRL-treated cells (Fig. 4A). These observations suggest that P4 and PRL both induce RANKL expression in vitro, but that E2 is a necessary factor for P4 response. Previous studies have established that Stat5a-/- and RANKL-/- mice share similar mammary gland phenotypes (14Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 20Fata J.E. Kong Y.Y. Li J. Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Moorehead R.A. Elliott R. Scully S. Voura E.B. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Khokha R. Penninger J.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To determine whether Stat5 expression is critical for RANKL expression and determine the relative effectiveness of Stat5a and Stat5b in RANKL induction, PMEC were transiently transfected with 1 and 2 μg/well of wt Stat5a or Stat5b expression vectors. PMEC transfection efficiency was >30% (27Hou Z. Srivastava S. Mistry M.J. Herbst M.P. Bailey J.P. Horseman N.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1910-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Empty vector was used as control. Cells were treated with or without 5 μg/ml oPRL for 24 h. RANKL expression was induced by PRL alone, and the PRL response was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by overexpression of Stat5a. In contrast, Stat5b overexpression did not cause a dose-dependent increase in RANKL expression. Basal RANKL expression was quieted by overexpression of Stat5, perhaps as a result of quenching of endogenous co-regulators (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that RANKL induction by PRL is mediated preferentially by Stat5a and offered a potential link by which Stat5a mediates alveolar morphogenesis. Prolactin Increases RANKL-Luciferase Activity in a Dose-dependent Manner in CHO-D6 Cells—The RANKL promoter has been extensively characterized, but there are no prior data regarding PRL regulation of the RANKL promoter or a mechanism of PRL action (20Fata J.E. Kong Y.Y. Li J. Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Moorehead R.A. Elliott R. Scully S. Voura E.B. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Khokha R. Penninger J.M.

Acta. 1999; 1445: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To address these questions, we transiently transfected a mouse RANKL-luciferase (RANKL-Luc) reporter construct containing residues to -965 from the transcription start site into CHOD6 cells, which have been previously used to study PRL-induced signaling (26Gao J. Hughes J.P. Auperin B. Buteau H. Edery M. Zhuang H. Wojchowski D.M. Horseman N.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 847-856PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brockman J.L. Schroeder M.D. Schuler L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The reporter construct is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 5A. After transfection the cells were treated for 24 h with various concentrations of PRL as shown in Fig. 5B. PRL treatment induced RANKL-Luc activity in a dose-dependent manner. To determine the sequences responsible for induction by PRL, we transiently transfected different deletion constructs of the RANKL reporter into CHOD6 cells and found that the region between -965 and -725 residues conveyed all the response to PRL (Fig. 5C). Sequence analysis of this region revealed that it contained a GAS-like site that previously had not been reported (Fig. 5A). To test whether this GAS site is essential for PRL response we mutated the site in the context of the RANKL promoter and tested the normal and mutated promoters in CHOD6 cells. And as shown in Fig. 5D, mutation of the GAS site in the RANKL promoter eliminated the PRL response. To further confirm that the RANKL GAS site binds to Stat5 protein, we conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using the normal and mutated GAS sequence with nuclear extracts of PRL-stimulated and unstimulated CHOD6 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the PRL-induced nuclear extract bound strongly with the normal GAS sequence (lane 2), whereas mutated GAS sequence failed to bind to the PRL induced nuclear protein (lane 5). The specificity of the binding was confirmed by competition with cold probe (lane 4) and Stat5 antibody (lane 3). The β-casein GAS sequence, which binds to Stat5 protein strongly, was used as a positive control (lanes 7 and 8). These data suggested that PRL could directly activate RANKL expression by activating the Jak2/Stat5 pathway. Dominant Negative Mutants of Jak2 and Stat5a Block PRL Induction of RANKL Expression—PRL induces its signal via Jak2, which binds to PRL receptor and phosphorylates multiple substrates, including Stat proteins. To investigate signaling involved in PRL induction of RANKL, CHOD6 cells were transiently cotransfected with RANKL-Luc reporter with Dn Jak2 mutants, which have been used previously and have been shown to effectively block Jak2 activation in our laboratory (26Gao J. Hughes J.P. Auperin B. Buteau H. Edery M. Zhuang H. Wojchowski D.M. Horseman N.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 847-856PubMed Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 7A showed that the PRL effect on the RANKL reporter construct activity was completely attenuated in cells cotransfected with either Dn Jak2Δ859 or Jak2KD, confir"

Our study provides a structural basis for understanding the mechanism of immunologic protection and for rational design of vaccines effective against flaviviruses. Flaviviruses are small (50 nm) positive-strand RNA viruses that contain a lipid-bilayer membrane. Forty species of the flavivirus family have been associated with human diseases, and most of them are transmitted to their vertebrate hosts by infected mosquitoes or ticks (1Burke D.S. Monath T.P. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1043-1125Google Scholar). Among these, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and dengue are the most important viral arboviruses in the world. Japanese encephalitis virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and is widely distributed in Asia, including Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Philippines, the far eastern former Soviet Union, all of Southeast Asia, and India (1Burke D.S. Monath T.P. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1043-1125Google Scholar). There are about 50,000 cases and 10,000 deaths reported annually throughout Asia, but these numbers are believed to be greatly underestimated. Like other flaviviruses, JEV 1The abbreviations used are: JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus; TBEV, tick-borne encephalitis virus; E protein, 53-kDa glycosylated envelope protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; TROSY, transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy.1The abbreviations used are: JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus; TBEV, tick-borne encephalitis virus; E protein, 53-kDa glycosylated envelope protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; TROSY, transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy. contains a single-stranded RNA genome of ∼11 kb in size. The virion of JEV contains three structural proteins, a 12-kDa nucleocapsid or core protein, a 8-kDa non-glycosylated membrane protein, and a 53-kDa glycosylated envelope protein (E), as well as seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) (2Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The E protein is the dominant antigen in eliciting neutralizing antibodies and plays an important role in inducing immunologic responses in the infected host (3McMinn P.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2711-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Structural elements of the E protein are also involved in viral attachment, fusion, penetration, hemagglutination, host range and cell tropism, and virus virulence and attenuation (1Burke D.S. Monath T.P. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1043-1125Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the TBEV E protein has been determined by x-ray crystallography (4Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure reveals that the E protein forms a head-to-tail dimer with 170 Å in length. Each monomer of the E protein is composed of three discernible domains. Domain III containing the C-terminal 100 amino acids forms an Ig-like β-barrel structure composed of seven antiparallel β-strands. This domain is connected by a flexible region to domain I in the center, which folds into an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. Domain I contains about 120 residues in three segments (residues 1-51, 137-189, and 285-302). The two long loops between these three segments form the dimerization domain II. Recently, the structure of the E protein dimer of TBEV has been used to fit into the outer layer of density in the cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of dengue virus (5Kuhn R.J. Zhang W. Rossmann M.G. Pletnev S.V. Corver J. Lenches E. Jones C.T. Mukhopadhyay S. Chipman P.R. Strauss E.G. Baker T.S. Strauss J.H.

The structure suggests that the fusion mechanism of flaviviruses involves the insertion of the distal β-barrels of domain II of the E protein into the cellular membrane. On the other hand, the mechanism of antibody-mediated neutralization of the flavivirus remains a matter of speculation. Mutations on domain III of the E protein leading to the escape from antibody neutralization have been reported for JEV (6Cecilia D. Gould E.A.

Synthetic peptides have also been used to map the linear epitopes of domain III (17Wu S.C. Lin C.W. Virus Res. 2001; 76: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies provide a detailed spatial configuration of the epitopes of domain III. To date, no structure has been reported for the E protein complexed with neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we have determined the solution structure of the domain III of the JEV E protein. In addition, we have identified the neutralizing epitopes of the JEV domain III to its monoclonal antibody (mAb E3.3) by comparing NMR chemical shifts of the free (14 kDa) and the antibody-bound (178 kDa) forms. Our results provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanism of immunologic protection and for rational design of vaccines effective against flaviviruses. Protein Preparation and Purification—The DNA fragments encoding residues 292-402 of the domain III of the JEV (CH2195LA) E protein were amplified by PCR. The amplified PCR products were subcloned into pET-22b vector. Plasmids encoding JEV domain III were introduced into Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3), and transformants were cultured overnight at 37 °C in SOB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The uniform 15N-labeled and/or 15N/13C-labeled samples were expressed in cells grown in M9 minimal media containing 15NH4Cl and/or (U-13C) glucose. For preparation of the (U-2H, 15N)-domain III for NMR spectroscopy, the protein was expressed in the M9 minimal media with 99% D2O in place of H2O and 15NH4Cl as a sole nitrogen source (18Leiting B. Marsilio F. O'Connell J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant from the centrifugation was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen Inc.) at 4 °C. Fractions containing the JEV domain III were pooled, concentrated, and added to a 1.6 × 60.0 cm Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, the protein was eluted with NMR buffer containing 50 mm K2HPO4 (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Purity of the protein was confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The final protein concentration for NMR study was 2 mm in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. To prepare D2O samples, concentrated protein solutions were lyophilized and redissolved in D2O. Monoclonal Antibody Preparation—The hybridoma cell line producing mAb E3.3 was prepared from BALB/c mice immunized with JEV Beijing-1 strain. The specificity of mAb E3.3 was demonstrated previously on JEV E protein (8Wu S.C. Lian W.C. Hsu L.C. Liau M.Y. Virus Res. 1997; 51: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Wu S.C. Lian W.C. Hsu L.C. Wu Y.C. Liau M.Y. Virus Res. 1998; 55: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), showing >95% plaque neutralization against Beijing-1 strain and blocking viral hemagglutination at the reciprocal titer of 320. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR data used in the structural analysis were acquired with Bruker Avance 600 or 500 MHz spectrometers equipped with triple resonance probes at 25 °C. TROSY spectra were performed on a Bruker Avance 800 MHz spectrometer with a sample (JEV domain III/mAb E3.3) concentration of 100 μm at 25 °C. 1H NMR data were referenced to the 1H resonance frequency of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid; 13C and 15N resonances were referenced indirectly by multiplying the proton frequency by 0.25144953 for 13C and 0.101329118 for 15N (20Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 21Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The NMR experiments performed included two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, 1H-13C HSQC, three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB for backbone assignments, 15N-TOCSY-HSQC, HCC(CO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, HBHA(CO)NH for side chain assignments (22Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed with the program XWIN-NMR 2.6 and NMRPipe and analyzed using NMRView 5.04. 3 J HNH coupling constants were estimated from the HNHA experiment. H/D exchange rates of the amide protons were determined by recording a series of HSQC spectra in several time intervals after the proteins had been dissolved in D2O. Experimental Restraints—NOE-based distance restraints were collected from analysis of three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra recorded with mixing times of 150 and 80 ms, respectively. NOEs were broadly categorized as “strong,” “medium,” and “weak,” corresponding to distance limits of 1.8-2.8, 1.8-3.4, and 1.8-5.0 Å, respectively. NOE restraints involving methyl group and pseudoatoms were corrected by relaxing 0.3 Å to take into account equivalent atoms. The ϕ and ψ angles were obtained based on 3 J HNHα coupling constants derived from the HNHA experiment and predicted from TALOS (23Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints were included in calculations only if the amide protons were slowly exchanging and if the β-strand inter-strand NOE cross-peaks were observed. Each hydrogen bond was enforced by two distance restraints of 1.8-2.3 Å (amide proton to carbonyl oxygen) and 2.8-3.3 Å (amide nitrogen to carbonyl oxygen). Structure Calculation—The structure calculations were carried out using the X-PLOR 3.851 (24Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A system for X-Ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) program on a SuSE Linux 7.3 PC equipped with an Intel Pentium 4 1.8 GHz CPU and 512 MB DDR-SDRAM. The structures were calculated and refined with ab initio simulated annealing protocol, “sa.inp,” and SA refinement protocol, “refine.inp” in X-PLOR 3.851. All force constants and molecular parameters, etc. were set to their default values, as in the original sa.inp and refine.inp protocols, with the exception of the timestep (ps), which was decreased to 0.001 ps throughout the calculations. Simulated annealing was performed using 9,000 steps at 1,000 K and 10,000 steps by gradually cooling to 100 K. Finally, these structures were energy-minimized using 500 steps of Powell energy minimization. The best 15 lowest energy structures were further analyzed with MOLMOL (25Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar) and PRO-CHECK-NMR (26Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). These final structures contained no distance constraint violations greater than 0.3 Å and no dihedral angle constraint violations greater than 5°. The coordinates of both the representative structure and the family of structures have been deposited at the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (access number 1PJW). Structure Determination—The JEV domain III is well behaved at millimolar concentrations and well suited for solution structural studies using modern NMR techniques. The backbone 1H, 15N, 13C, and 13CO assignments of the 111 residue JEV domain III are essentially complete. More than 85% of the side chain 1H resonances are assigned. A total of 763 NOE-derived distance constraints, including 205 intraresidue, 263 sequential, 43 medium (1 < i - j < 5), 206 long range (i - j ≥ 5), and 46 hydrogen bond distance restraints in conjunction with 194 backbone dihedral angles are used in the structure calculations. The overlay of the backbone atoms for the 15 lowest energy structures of the JEV domain III is shown in Fig. 1A. Fig. 1B shows the ribbon diagram of the lowest energy structure of the JEV domain III. The energetic and structural statistics are listed in Table I. The root mean square deviation calculated from the averaged coordinates for the JEV domain III is 0.68 Å for the backbone heavy atoms (N, C, and Cα) and 1.43 Å for all heavy atoms. Analysis of ϕ and ψ backbone angles is facilitated by using the program Procheck_NMR (26Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). Only 0.1% of the residues are in disallowed regions, and more than 98% of the residues are within most favored or additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.Table ISummary of structural constrains and structure statisticsNOE restraints763Intraresidues (i − j = 0)205Sequential (i − j = 1)263Medium range (2 ≤ i − j ≤ 4)43Long range (i − j > 4)206Hydrogen bond constraints46Dihedral anglesaDihedral angles were predicted from the program TALOS.194Structural Statistics (15 Structures)NOE violations, number > 0.3 Å0Dihedral angel violations, number > 5°0r.m.s.d.br.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. for geometrical analysisBond lengths (Å)0.0018 ± 0.00003Bond angles (degree)0.502 ± 0.0035Impropers (degree)0.378 ± 0.0026r.m.s.d. from experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.0214 ± 0.00065Dihedral angles (deg.)0.472 ± 0.082Atomic r.m.s.d. for proteincOnly residues 12-107 were shown.All heavy atoms1.428Backbone0.682Atomic r.m.s.d. for structured regiondResidues in the structured region are as follows: 308-316, 322-328, 339-343, 369-374, 381-386, 391-396.All heavy atoms1.278Backbone0.464Ramachandran statisticsMost favored region (%)72.0Additionally allowed (%)26.5Generously allowed (%)1.4Disallowed (%)0.1a Dihedral angles were predicted from the program TALOS.b r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.c Only residues 12-107 were shown.d Residues in the structured region are as follows: 308-316, 322-328, 339-343, 369-374, 381-386, 391-396. Open table in a new tab Structure Description and Homology—The JEV domain III forms a β-barrel type structure composed of six antiparallel β-strands resembling the immunoglobulin constant domain (Fig. 1B). The six β-strands consist of residues 308-316, 322-328, 339-344, 369-374, 381-386, and 391-396. A conserved disulfide bridge is found between residues Cys-304 and Cys-335. The top of the β-barrel is closed by the N-terminal residues and the loops between the β2-β3, β3-β4, and β5-β6 strands. The amino acid sequence of the JEV domain III is 37.1% identical and 65.0% similar to that of the TBEV domain III, and the global fold of the JEV domain III is similar to that of the TBEV domain III (4Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). In the JEV domain III, strands β1, β2, β3, β4, β5, and β6 correspond to strands A, B, C, E, F, and G of the TBEV domain III (4Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). However, there are localized differences between these two proteins. Formation of extra strands (Ax, Cx, Dx, and D in Fig. 2b of Rey et al. (4Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar)) has been observed in the TBEV domain III. These extra strands, except strand D, are all located in the loop regions on the top of the β-barrel. Strand D is found in the long loop region between strands β3 and β4. Since the x-ray structure of the TBEV E protein has been determined to be a head-to-tail dimer, contacts between domain III and domains I and II from the other subunit may force the loop regions to form more ordered conformations. We have used reduced spectral density functions to analyze the NMR relaxation rates and 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs of the JEV domain III (data not shown) (27Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Szabo A. Torchia D.A. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 28Lefevre J.F. Dayie K.T. Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the loop regions, especially the β3-β4 loop, undergo picosecond fast motions, as evident from the larger J(H) values. Thus, the ordered conformations are less favored in these loop regions of the JEV domain III. However, more ordered conformations could not be ruled out in the full-length JEV E protein. Epitope Mapping by NMR—Antibody-antigen interactions play important roles in the immune system. Identification of an epitope is the first step toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying antibody-antigen interactions. Series of short peptides encompassing the sequences of a protein antigen can be used to locate the antibody binding sites. However, exhaustive mutagenesis experiments are needed to identify the epitope if an epitope is comprised of discontinuous fragments. Alternatively, NMR can be used to map an epitope (29Tashiro M. Montelione G.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Saito N.G. Paterson Y. Methods (Orlando). 1996; 9: 516-524Google Scholar). Chemical shifts are highly sensitive to the local magnetic environment and are excellent probes for conformational change. Previously, the chemical shift perturbation method has been shown to accurately identify the epitopes of several antibody-bound antigens (29Tashiro M. Montelione G.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Huang X. Yang X. Luft B.J. Koide S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Ding W. Huang X. Yang X. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Koide S. Lawson C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). JEV domain III gives a well resolved 1H-15N HSQC spectrum in which backbone amide peaks for most of the residues can be identified (Fig. 2A). However, low sample concentrations due to the limited availability of mAb E3.3 and the size of the JEV domain III/mAb E3.3 complex (178 kDa) still hinder the NMR studies. Fortunately, with the deuteration of the protein sample (33Markus M.A. Dayie K.T. Matsudaira P. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1994; 105: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the recently developed TROSY-based NMR techniques (34Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 35Fiaux J. Bertelsen E.B. Horwich A.L. Wuthrich K. Nature. 2002; 418: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), most of the 1H-15N cross-peaks seen in the free JEV domain III remain resolved in the TROSY spectrum of the JEV domain III/mAb E3.3 complex (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the 1H-15N cross-peaks in the free and the antibody-bound forms show that complex formation causes significant chemical shift changes for a discrete set of resonances including residues 302-312, 322-339, 360-372, and 385-392 (Fig. 2B). The residues with significant chemical shift changes upon binding with mAb E3.3 are mapped onto the structure of the JEV domain III, as shown in Fig. 3A. Basically, the mapped epitopes are located on the top portion of the β-barrel including residues in the N termini, the β2-β3, β3-β4, and the β5-β6 loops. Residues close to the top portion of the β-barrel on the six β-strands are also found to have large chemical shift changes upon mAb E3.3 binding. The mapped epitopes of the JEV domain III are presented in the three-dimensional structure of the TBEV E protein to demonstrate the relative positions of the antibody binding sites of the domain III to domains I and II of the E protein (Fig. 3B). It has been suggested that the CFG strands of the TBEV domain III, which form the outer lateral surface of the dimer (Fig. 3B), may be the antigenic sites (4Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). However, our studies of the JEV domain III show that the top portion of the β-barrel, including residues in the N termini, the β2-β3, β3-β4, β5-β6 loops, and the adjacent residues on the six β-strands, are the major neutralizing antibody binding sites. Previously, mutations that lead to the escape from antibody neutralization have been reported for the JEV domain III (Fig. 4A) (6Cecilia D. Gould E.A. Virology. 1991; 181: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Seif S.A. Morita K. Matsuo S. Hasebe M.F. Igarashi A.

These mutation sites are all located in the N termini, the β2-β3, β3-β4, and the β5-β6 loops on the top of the β-barrel covered by the NMR mapped epitopes.Fig. 4A, a structure-based multiple sequence alignment of the domain III of JEV, West Nile (WN), Dengue, Dengue2, yellow fever (YF), and TBEV.

Rectangular bars denote regions mapped by chemical shift changes of the JEV domain III/mAb E3.3 complex. The color schemes of Fig. 3 are used.

The Dengue virus domain III is used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Site-directed Mutagenesis—To further confirm the NMR mapped epitopes, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis experiments on residues 337, 352, 360, and 387. Residues 337 and 360 are located in the β2-β3 and β3-β4 loops close to the top of the β-barrel but have not been reported to be involved in the neutralizing antibody binding. Residue 387, which has been suggested to be the antigenic site (17Wu S.C. Lin C.W. Virus Res. 2001; 76: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), is located in the β5-β6 loop. These three residues are chosen because they all exhibit significant chemical shift changes upon mAb E3.3 binding, and they are located in the three major antigenic loops (Fig. 2A). Although residue 352 is located in the β3-β4 loop, it does not show any chemical shift change upon mAb E3.3 binding. Thus, mutation of residue 352 is expected to have little influence on the antibody binding. Based on the Western blot analysis, the I337A, F360A, and R387A mutations all exhibit significant reductions of binding to the neutralizing antibody mAb E3.3 (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, the G352A mutation shows little change on binding to mAb E3.3 as compared with the wild type protein. The site-directed mutagenesis results correlate well with the NMR mapped epitopes on the JEV domain III. Biological Importance—The E protein of the flaviviruses is involved in viral attachment, fusion, penetration, hemagglutination, host range and cell tropism, and virus virulence and attenuation (1Burke D.S. Monath T.P. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1043-1125Google Scholar). Among the three structural domains, domain III is the major antigenic domain of the E protein. Single mutations in the domain III of a number of flaviviruses are responsible for changes in the above mentioned properties. Mutations leading to the escape from antibody neutralization or neutralizing epitopes mapped by phage-displayed peptide libraries have been reported on residues 306, 331, 333, and 386-390 of JEV (6Cecilia D.

Fig. 4A shows mutation sites that abolish binding of the corresponding neutralizing antibodies of various flaviviruses. Not surprisingly, most of the mutation sites are covered by the NMR mapped epitopes of the JEV domain III (Fig. 4A). Because of the sequence homology and the similar global fold between the JEV and TBEV domain III, a common three-dimensional structure of the domain III for all flaviviruses can be predicted. Moreover, because the mutation sites that abolish binding of the corresponding neutralizing antibodies of various flaviviruses are covered by the present NMR mapped epitopes, it can be anticipated that the neutralizing epitopes on the domain III of different flaviviruses are located within the similar regions. To further understand the mechanism of antibody-mediated neutralization of the flaviviruses, NMR structural studies and epitope mapping of the domain III of the dengue virus are currently under way in our laboratory. In conclusion, NMR structural studies and site-directed mutagenesis were performed to identify and characterize the neutralizing epitopes of the JEV domain III. Our results provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanism of immunologic protection and for rational design of vaccines effective against flaviviruses. We thank Dr. Yi-Ling Lin (Academia Sinica) for providing us the DNA strain of the dengue domain III and Dr. R. Weiseman (Bruker) for acquiring the TROSY spectra (800 MHz) for us. We also thank Drs. Shiou-Ru Tzeng and Ju-Pi Li for helpful discussions. This study was carried out on the 600 MHz NMR spectrometer at the Regional Instrument Center at Hsinchu, National Science Council, Taiwan."

Glucocorticoid suppresses gene expression by an essential skeletal tissue transcription factor, Runx2, in rat osteoblasts. We now report that estrogen enhances Runx2 activity in dose- and estrogen receptor-dependent ways independently of changes in Runx2 levels or its DNA binding potential. Estrogen receptor and Runx2 can be collected by co-immunoprecipitation. By two-hybrid gene expression analysis, high affinity complex formation involves portions of Runx2 outside of its own DNA binding domain and the DNA binding domain of the estrogen receptor. Consistent with this interaction, the stimulatory effect of estrogen on Runx2 activity is lost when the DNA binding domain of the estrogen receptor is eliminated. Unlike the stimulatory effect of estrogen and the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoid, androgen fails to increase Runx2 activity, whereas Runx2 potently suppresses gene expression induced by all three steroids. Finally, estrogen increases gene transcription by the transforming growth factor-β type I receptor gene promoter, which contains several Runx binding sequences, and enhances Smad dependent gene expression by transforming growth factor-β in osteoblasts. These results reveal that Runx2 can integrate complex effects on gene transcription in hormone-, growth factor-, and tissue-restricted ways. Steroids significantly effect skeletal integrity.

Bone is a dynamic tissue that forms and remodels throughout life. Osteoblast-dependent bone formation varies with age, with certain metabolic disease states, or with pharmacological intervention. When osteoclast-dependent bone loss predominates, the structural quality of bone is diminished. This is accompanied by an increase in fracture and pain and a decrease in mobility and function. Loss of bone integrity and its subsequent pathology may therefore follow disparities in growth regulators and molecular events that define the normally balanced bone remodeling cycle (1Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 2Masi L. Brandi M.L. Q. J. Nucl. Med. 2001; 45: 2-6PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rosen C.J.

Runx2, a member of the Runx family of nuclear transcription factors, first termed PEBP2α, CBFα, AML, or OSF, contains a Runt domain homologous to a transcription factor involved in body segmentation, sex determination, and neurogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster (4Adya N.

Runx2 levels increase greatly during osteoblast differentiation, whereas homozygous gene deletion of Runx2 limits bone formation, and few, if any, differentiated osteoblasts are found in Runx2-deficient mice (7Komori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Importantly, the Runt domain contains sequences essential for DNA binding, and this region seems to be required for heterodimerization with several other nuclear transcription factors. The carboxyl-terminal region of Runx contains a transactivation domain as well as a domain that targets its binding to the nuclear matrix. In many instances, Runx transcription factors are thought to increase gene expression through Runx-sensitive response elements (RE) 1The abbreviations used are: RE, response element; ER, estrogen receptor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; TβRI, TGF-β receptor type I; DBD, DNA binding domain; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; AR, androgen receptor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; ARE, androgen receptor response element; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; GRE, glucocorticoid receptor response element; ERE, estrogen receptor response element; AP-1, activator protein 1., although in some cases, Runx2 may also be inhibitory (6Ito Y.

This is controlled in part by the way hormone-activated steroid receptors complex with themselves or with other binding partners to form competent or inactive transcription factors. Like other transcription factors, the steroid hormone receptors contain domains important for DNA binding, dimerization, and gene transactivation. Some effects by steroid hormone require direct genomic interactions, and others occur through indirect effects on cellular signaling (9Sutter-Dub M.T.

Several studies suggest that transient exposure to or a low level of the adrenal steroid glucocorticoid permissively alters the expression of some genes associated with osteoblast function (15Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 16McCarthy T.L. Ji C. Chen Y. Kim K. Centrella M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, high levels of glucocorticoid, such as those commonly used therapeutically to suppress inflammatory disease or tissue rejection, cause generalized bone loss leading to fractures as well as gastrointestinal and immunological problems (17Bijlsma J.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 876: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Nishimura J. Ikuyama S. J. Bone. Miner. Metab. 2000; 18: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although in some instances glucocorticoid may enhance Runx2 mRNA expression, in vitro glucocorticoid in excess rapidly depletes the amount of functional Runx2 nuclear protein, with an accompanying inhibitory effect on Runx2-dependent gene expression (19Chang D.J.

This seems to reprise the downstream events that occur with glucocorticoid therapy or with Runx2 gene deletion in vivo (7Komori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and would essentially limit osteoblast activity in the adult remodeling skeleton. Bone loss also occurs after menopause or with sex steroid depletion. In ovariectomized animals, bone resorption rates increase, but the balance in bone remodeling can then be restored by hormone replacement therapy. This is believed to occur in part by way of an estrogen-dependent reduction in the expression of lymphokines associated with the development of bone-resorbing osteoclasts through inhibitory effects on transcription factor C/EBPβ (also termed NF-IL6) (21Suda T. Nakamura I. Jimi E. Takahashi N. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 22Greenfield E.M. Bi Y. Miyauchi A. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 1087-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Estrogen also regulates factors associated with bone formation. For example, estrogen suppresses IGF-I expression in osteoblasts stimulated with hormones that increase cAMP generation and activate transcription factor C/EBPδ by decreasing C/EBPδ-dependent activation of the IGF-I gene promoter (23McCarthy T.L.

However, estrogen may also enhance bone formation through inhibitory effects on osteoblast apoptosis or stimulatory effects on other osteoblast transcription factors (24Gohel A. McCarthy M.B.

This interaction has potent regulatory effects that can control Runx, steroid hormone, and growth factor activity in osteoblasts and may have important implications for therapies that use steroid hormones or steroid hormone analogues. Cell Cultures—Primary osteoblast-enriched cultures were prepared from parietal bones of 22-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Portage, MI) by methods approved by the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Bone sutures were dissected, and cells were released from the bone fragments by five sequential collagenase digestions. Cells pooled from the last three digestions express high levels of nuclear factor Runx2, parathyroid hormone receptor, type I collagen synthesis, and alkaline phosphatase activity (28Ji C.

Our studies also benefited from the generous gifts of reporter and expression plasmids from other investigators. Dr. Stuart Adler (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) provided an expression plasmid for human ERα and a reporter plasmid driven by estrogen RE. Dr. Chawnshang Chang (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY) provided an expression plasmid for rat androgen receptor (AR). Dr. Ronald M. Evans (Scripps Research Clinic, La Jolla, CA) provided MMTV-Luc, a reporter plasmid driven by glucocorticoid RE (GRE). Dr. Joan Massague (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) provided 3TP-Lux, a reporter plasmid with multiple AP-1 related RE and a minimal fragment of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 gene promoter. Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) provided reporter plasmid SBE4, driven by multiple Smad RE. Dr. Yoshiaki Ito (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) provided an expression plasmid for murine Runx2 (originally termed PEBP2-αA1). Dr. Ivan J. Sadowski (University of British Columbia, Canada) provided cloning vectors M1 with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) and MVN1 with the gene transactivation domain of Herpesvirus protein VP16. We used these vectors to create expression plasmids encoding either full-length ERα or Runx2, or specific fragments of these proteins, as indicated under “Results.” Dr. Richard A. Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) provided reporter plasmid 5XGAL4-E1b-Luciferase, with five GAL4 RE (5XGAL4). Transfections—Promoter-reporter constructs, gene expression plasmids, or empty parental vectors, were pre-titrated for optimal expression efficiency and transfected with reagent LT1 (Mirus). Cultures at 50–70% confluence were exposed to an optimal amount of expression plasmid (10–45 ng/cm2) or reporter plasmid (20–50 ng/cm2) in medium supplemented with 0.8% fetal bovine serum for 16 h, and then supplemented to obtain a final concentration of 5% serum. Cells were cultured for another 48 h, treated in serum-free medium, rinsed, and lysed. Nuclear-free supernatants were analyzed for reporter gene activity and corrected for protein content. To account for competition among plasmids for limiting transcriptional components, control cultures were transfected with a compensating amount of empty vector. Transfection efficiency was assessed in parallel in cells transfected with positive and negative reporter plasmids as described previously (16McCarthy T.L. Ji C. Chen Y. Kim K. Centrella M.

Protein Extracts—Cells were rinsed, harvested by scraping and centrifugation, and lysed in hypotonic buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100 as described previously. Nuclei and cytoplasm were separated by centrifugation. Nuclei were extracted in hypertonic buffer with glycerol and phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and the nuclear proteins released in this way were separated from insoluble material by centrifugation (16McCarthy T.L.

Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay—Double-stranded DNA probes were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. Overhangs were filled with dNTPs and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs). Nuclear extract was incubated on ice with 32P-labeled probe.

Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—Cell extracts were combined with pre-immune IgG or specific antibody and immunoprecipitates were collected with Protein A Sepharose (Pierce). Total cell extract or immunoprecipitates were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), probed with primary antibody, and visualized with secondary antibody and chemiluminescence (16McCarthy T.L.

SBE4 exhibits a high level of basal activity in fetal rat osteoblasts, and its activity is enhanced 50–100% by TGF-β1. In contrast, basal 3TP-Lux activity is minimal in osteoblasts and is highly enhanced by TGF-β1 treatment (38Ji C. Eickelberg O. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3873-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts were transfected, cultured to confluence, serum-deprived, and treated for 24 h with estradiol as indicated. Control or estradiol-treated cells were then challenged with maximally effective amount (120 pm) of TGF-β1 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) for a second 24-h period (31Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. J.

A significant difference was assumed by a p value of <0.05. ER-dependent Gene Expression in Cultured Osteoblasts— ERα expression parallels late stage osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in culture (39Bodine P.V. Henderson R.A. Green J. Aronow M.

Consistent with this, primary cultures of fetal rat osteoblasts express little or no endogenous ERα at a time in culture when they are susceptible to transfection with plasmids encoding steroid dependent reporters or regulatory gene products (Fig. 1A). Nonetheless, they respond rapidly and potently to estradiol after transfection with an expression plasmid encoding ERα (Fig. 1B). Therefore, these easily obtained and well characterized osteoblast cultures can be made estrogen responsive in vitro, replicating the hormone-sensitive status of osteoblasts that occur in more mature organisms in vivo (43Katzburg S. Ornoy A. Hendel D. Lieberherr M. Kaye A.M. Somjen D. J. Endocrinol. Investig. 2001; 24: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 44Katzburg S. Lieberherr M. Ornoy A. Klein B.Y. Hendel D.

Importantly, this osteoblast cell culture model provides a sensitive system to examine specific aspects of ERα on osteoblast activity uncomplicated by the presence of endogenous ERs. Estrogen Enhances Runx2 Activity—Earlier studies revealed that even in the presence of functional ERα, estradiol does not alter basal IGF-I expression. However, it dose dependently decreases the effect of hormones that enhance IGF-I synthesis by way of a C/EBP RE in exon I of the IGF-I gene (23McCarthy T.L. Ji C. Shu H. Casinghino S. Crothers K.

In direct contrast to its inhibitory effect on C/EBP activity, estradiol increased Runx dependent gene expression in osteoblasts. Treatment with estradiol at 0.1–10 nm significantly enhanced gene expression driven by plasmid SXN1C, where two copies of a Runx RE from the TβRI gene promoter were inserted into pGL3-promoter but had no effect on parental pGL3-promoter activity (Fig. 2A). Stimulation seemed to be largely the result of an increase in endogenous Runx2 activation because estradiol caused an analogous effect when osteoblasts were transfected to express plasmid M1-Runx2, in which Runx2 was tagged with the GAL4 DBD. In this context, M1-Runx2 can drive gene expression by co-transfected reporter plasmid 5XGAL4-E1b-Luciferase, which contains five GAL4 RE (5XGAL4), by 4–5-fold relative to empty M1 vector (37McCarthy T.L.

Therefore, estradiol enhanced Runx2 transcriptional activity, whether Runx2 used its own DBD to drive a native Runx RE or used the added GAL4 DBD to drive the 5XGAL4 RE system. These results are consistent with no obvious stimulatory effects by estradiol on total Runx2 levels in this short time frame or on the ability of Runx2 to associate with DNA that contains a consensus Runx RE (Fig. 2C).

We found heterodimers of ERα and Runx2 in extract from COS-7 cells co-transfected with plasmid MVN1-ERα, where ERα was tagged with the transactivation domain of Herpesvirus protein VP16, and plasmid M1-Runx2. Protein that co-precipitated with anti-VP16 antibody was reactive with anti-Runx2 antibody by Western blot, but only precipitating antibody was detected in extracts from cells transfected to express MVN1-ERα and parental plasmid M1 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, by the two-hybrid dependent gene expression assay performed in COS-7 cells co-transfected also with reporter plasmid 5XGAL4, the complex formed by MVN1-ERα and M1-Runx2 increased reporter gene expression by 3-fold relative to MVN1-ERα and parental plasmid M1. MVN1-ERα also associated with amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments of Runx2, as indicated in Fig. 3B, whereas no complex was apparent with the Runt domain of Runx2 by itself. Functional complexes that together activate the two-hybrid gene expression system occurred even in the absence of estradiol, as shown here, inasmuch as MVN1-ERα acquires an ancillary nuclear localization domain encoded by the MVN1 transfection vector (47Sadowski I. Genet Eng. 1995; 17: 119-148PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, in addition to COS-7 cells, similar complexes between MVN1-ERα and M1-Runx2 or its fragments occurred when the two-hybrid gene expression assay was performed in primary cultures of osteoblasts (Fig. 4A). To define the regions of ERα that associate with Runx2, MVN1 fusion proteins that contained fragments of ERα, as indicated in Fig. 4B, were then co-transfected with full-length M1-Runx2. Functional complex formation with Runx2 occurred with only discrete fragments of ERα. Notably, the C region or the DBD of ERα alone seemed to be a highly proficient binding partner by comparison with other ERα domains. Combined but Independent Effects by Estrogen and Protein Kinase A Activation on Runx2—Like their stimulatory effects on C/EBPδ, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and parathyroid hormone enhance Runx2 activity in a protein kinase A-dependent manner (37McCarthy T.L.

The PTP may also be instrumental in the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins, such as cytochrome c, in programmed cell death (10.Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Cell. 2003; 112: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Several pieces of evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, associated with deregulation of the PTP, may play an important role in injury following ischemia/reperfusion (3.Crompton M. Biochem.

The PTP inhibitor CsA has been found to delay/reduce glutamate-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cell death (13.Schinder A.F. Olson E.C. Spitzer N.C. Montal M. J.

Despite detailed functional characterization, much of the information on the molecular nature of the PTP relies on indirect evidence and its precise molecular nature still remains elusive. The PTP is assumed to be due to the formation of dynamic multiprotein complexes at OMM and IMM contact sites (3.Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 5.Zamzami N. Kroemer G. ).Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). These complexes are thought to involve the ANT in the IMM, in association with VDAC in the OMM, with a regulatory protein, Cyp-D, located in the matrix. Cyp-D is the target for CsA, and the only PTP regulatory protein identified so far with reasonable certainty (19.Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Several other proteins, including those of the Bcl-2 family, appear to participate in PTP regulation through poorly defined interactions (5.Zamzami N. Kroemer G. ).Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). CsA has become the standard pharmacological tool for the characterization of the PTP in isolated mitochondria, in living cells and in vivo. Other PTP inhibitors include ANT ligands such as ADP and BKA (1.Zoratti M Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 6.Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, the fact that the molecular target for most of the compounds reported to inhibit or induce PTP have not been directly identified, together with their poor specificity, has hampered progress in elucidating PTP structure and pathophysiological relevance. In this article, we report the identification of a new class of inhibitors of the PTP. We also took advantage of the fact that these compounds carry a reactive moiety to perform affinity-labeling experiments for identifying its binding protein on the PTP. These studies led to the identification of the isoform 1 of VDAC (VDAC1) as their molecular target, providing direct evidence that this protein is indeed a component of the PTP. Compounds and Chemicals—Ro 04-2843 (6-bromo-3-diethylamino-methyl-chroman-4-one), Ro 68-3406 (6-bromo-3-methylene-chroman-4-one), Ro 68-3400 (spiro[cyclopentane-1,5′-[5H]dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten]-2-one,10′,11′-dihydro-3-methylene) (see Fig. 1 for structures) were prepared at Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland. [3H]Ro 683400 (65 Ci/mmol, 1 Ci = 37 Mbq) was kindly prepared by Dr. Thomas Hartung (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd). [3H]Tetraphenylphosphonium ([3H]TPP, 24–29 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Switzerland). CsA, TFP, Ub0, and Ub5 were from Sigma; ATR and BKA from BioMol; Calcium-Green 5N, Rhodamine-123, and DIDS from Molecular Probes. Preparation of Rat Liver Mitochondria—Liver and brain mitochondria were prepared from male Albino RoRo rats or MoRo mice (RCC, Basel, Switzerland). For swelling experiments, liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation according to standard procedures (21.Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Brain mitochondria were isolated from rat and mouse forebrain on a Percoll gradient as described in Ref. 24.Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar. For affinity labeling experiments also liver mitochondria were purified on a Percoll gradient. Mitochondrial Swelling—Ca2+-induced swelling in energized mitochondria was assayed at 25 °C in 96 well-plates by measuring changes in absorbance at 540 nm by means of a SPECTRAMax 250 spectrophometer controlled by the SOFTmax PRO™ software (Molecular Devices). The incubation medium contained 0.2 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-MOPS, 1 mm Pi-Tris, 5 μm EGTA-Tris, pH 7.4. Succinate (5 mm, in the presence of 2 μm rotenone) or 5 mm glutamate and 2.5 mm malate, buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris, were used as respiratory substrates. After a ∼5 min preincubation with or without test compounds, swelling was induced by the addition of 20 μl of CaCl2 at final concentrations ranging from 40 to 80 μm. The final incubation volume was 0.2 ml and the concentration of mitochondria was ∼0.5 mg mitochondrial protein/ml. Absorbance readings were taken every 12 s and the plate was shaken for 3 s between readings to ensure O2 diffusion. Swelling experiments were also performed in fully de-energized liver mitochondria according to Ref. 25.Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar. EC50 values were determined from dose-response curves using at least 7 different inhibitor concentrations. Data, expressed as percentage changes in absorbance at 540 nm (ΔA540) versus baseline (no CaCl2) 30 min after the addition of CaCl2, were fitted to non-linear regression analysis using a four-parameter logistic equation using the SigmaPlot computer program. [3H]TPP Uptake and Oxygen Consumption—Isolated liver mitochondria (∼0.5 mg protein/ml) were incubated in a batch mode in the presence of 20 nm [3H]TPP for 15 min at 25 °C. Aliquots (100 μl) of the mixture were then distributed into 96-well plates containing 100 μl of the test compound and the incubation prolonged for 15 min at 25 °C. Samples were then filtered through 0.3% (v/v) polyethyleneimmine-treated GF/B glass fiber filters using a 96-channel cell harvester and the filters washed twice with 1 ml of buffer. 50 μl of MICROSCINT 40 (Packard) were then added to each well, before counting for radioactivity in a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard). Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled TPP or 1 μm FCCP. Oxygen consumption was determined polarographically using a Clark-type electrode Measurement of Ca2+Retention Capacity and of Δψm in Brain Mitochondria—Extramitochondrial Ca2+ was determined using a PerkinElmer LS-50B fluorimeter controlled by the FL WinLab computer program. The incubation medium contained 0.2 m sucrose, 1 mm Pi-Tris, 10 mm Tris-MOPS, 5 mm glutamate-Tris, 2.5 mm malate-Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 μm of the Ca2+ indicator Calcium Green-5N (21.Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The final volume was 2.5 ml, and the cuvette was thermostatted at 25 °C. Brain mitochondria were subjected to a train of 5 μm Ca2+ additions and fluorescence monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths of 505–535 nm. Calibration of Ca2+ signals was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions assuming a KD for the dye of 14 μm. For measurements of Δψm, 0.5 μm rhodamine-123 was added instead of Calcium Green-5N and fluorescence monitored at 503–525 nm excitation/emission wavelengths (20.Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Affinity Labeling of Mitochondria Using [3H]Ro 68-3400 —Percoll-purified mitochondria (∼30 μg of protein per sample) were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in the presence of 10 nm [3H]Ro 68-3400 in a final volume of 200 μl. After rinsing, mitochondria were solubilized in sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (1 h at 37 °C) and subjected to SDS-PAGE on Tris-glycine Novex precast gels (12% monomer concentration, Invitrogen). For fluorography, gels were soaked in Amplify™ (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed at –80 °C to x-ray BioMax MS film with BioMax MS intensifying screen (Kodak). Protein Purification and Identification—Mitochondria (∼5 mg of proteins) were labeled as described above in the presence of 20 nm [3H]Ro 68-3400 for 15 min at 25 °C, and solubilized with 3 ml of 3% Triton X-100 (Surfact-Amps X-100, Pierce) in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.8 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Roche Applied Science). Samples were then injected into a ceramic hydroxyapatite CHT-II 1 × 5 cm column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, containing 0.3% Triton X-100. The column was then eluted with NaPO4 gradient, containing 0.3% Triton X-100, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1 min) were collected and, an aliquot (5 μl) counted for radioactivity, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by staining and fluorography. Proteins in the radioactive fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and, after carboxamidomethylation, submitted to SDS-PAGE. After staining with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Novex) and destaining, gel spots were excised and protein analyzed after in-gel digestion using modified trypsin (Promega) by MALDI-MS as previously described (26.Fountoulakis M. Langen H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed in a time-of-flight PerSeptive Biosystems mass spectrometer equipped with a reflector. The peptide masses obtained were matched with the theoretical peptide masses of all proteins from all species in the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL data base (us.expasy.org/sprot/). The identity of some of the tryptic fragments was also confirmed by nanoelectrospray ionization tandem MS (nanoESI-MS/MS) by means of an API 365 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex) as previously described (27.Krapfenbauer K. Berger M. Friedlein A. Lubec G. Fountoulakis M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3532-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Yeast Methods—Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains lacking the Por1 gene (Δpor1) and containing plasmids mediating the expression of yeast (YVDAC1) and human VDAC1 (HVDAC1) were produced and mitochondria prepared as described (28.Blachly-Dyson E.

A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against HVDAC1 [anti-porin 31HL (Ab-4), Calbiochem], and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against YVDAC1 (29.Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were used for VDAC detection by immunoblot in yeast mitochondrial preparations. Screening and Identification of a New Class of PTP Inhibitors—In an effort to identify new inhibitors of the PTP, a compound library was screened using Ca2+-induced swelling of rat liver mitochondria energized with succinate as a functional assay. Compounds found to inhibit swelling were then counter-screened using uptake of the potentiometic probe [3H]TPP (31.Hoek J.B. Nicholls D.G. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1458-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to discard “false positives” (e.g. protonophores), which could have lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential and, thus, Ca2+-influx into mitochondria. Compounds that did not interfere with mitochondrial respiration at the concentrations inhibiting the PTP were then selected for further characterization. Among these substances, our attention focused on a class of compounds inhibiting the PTP in the low micromolar range and having common pharmacophoric elements. These compounds were β-aminoketone derivatives, typically exemplified here by Ro 04-2843 (Fig. 1 and Table I). However, as also reported for a class molecules of close chemical structure (32.Ward E.F. Garling D.L. Buckler R.T. Lawler D.M. Cummings D.P. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), compounds with this structure are not stable at neutral pH, undergoing decomposition with t½ of ∼30 min at pH 7.4. The corresponding enone decomposition product of Ro 04-2843, i.e. Ro 68-3406 (Fig. 1), was, therefore, prepared and found to still inhibit PTP (Table I and Fig 2B). Preparation of a number of derivatives led then to the identification of a number of PTP inhibitors, including Ro 68-3400 (Fig. 1), which was identified as being the most potent.Table IEffect of various inhibitors on Ca2+-induced PTP in rat liver mitochondriaEC50nμmRo 04-28431.83 ± 0.39(3)Ro 68-34061.21 ± 0.43(6)Ro 68-34000.19 ± 0.03(3)CsA0.30 ± 0.03(4)Ubo23.2 ± 2.3(4)ADPaThe experiments with ADP were performed in the presence of 1 μg/ml oligomycin.4.84 ± 0.73(3)BKA11.5 ± 4.21(4)TFP9.37 ± 3.32(3)a The experiments with ADP were performed in the presence of 1 μg/ml oligomycin. Open table in a new tab Properties of Ro 68-3400 as PTP Inhibitor in Liver Mitochondria—The inhibition of Ca2+-induced swelling in liver mitochondria energized with NADH-linked substrates (glutamate/malate) by Ro 68-3400 is shown in Fig. 2A. This compound inhibited PTP induced by addition of 40 μm Ca2+ with an EC50 of 98 ± 10 nm (Fig. 2B). Under similar conditions, CsA and Ro 68-3406 displayed EC50 values of 160 ± 9 and 930 ± 30 nm, respectively (Fig. 2B). Table I shows the EC50 obtained in succinate-energized mitochondria for Ro 68-3400 and related compounds in comparison to known PTP inhibitors. Ro 68-3400 was at least as effective as CsA at inhibiting PTP in liver mitochondria, and more potent than the other PTP inhibitors tested. While it has to be pointed out that the EC50 are relative values and depend on Ca2+ load as well as on respiratory substrates (see Ref. 20.Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the relative potencies of the various inhibitors were maintained at varying Ca2+ loads (data not shown). 2A. M. Cesura, E. Pinard, R. Schubenel, N. Hauser, V. Goetschy, E. Milanesi, P. Bernardi, and J. A. Kemp, manuscript in preparation. Ro 68-3400 and Ro 68-3406 were also effective at inhibiting PTP in de-energized mitochondria, a condition where interaction with sites indirectly modulating PTP can be excluded (25.Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 33.Linder M.D. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Kinnunen P.K. Bernardi P. Eriksson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 937-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with EC50 values of 0.37 and 2.8 μm, respectively (n = 2, 200 μm Ca2+). For comparison, under these conditions, the EC50 values of CsA and Ub0 were found to be 0.22 and 4.9 μm, respectively. At concentrations completely blocking PTP, Ro 68-3400 and Ro 68-3406 did not inhibit mitochondrial respiration (basal, ADP-induced and uncoupled), Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria or Cyp-D peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase enzymatic activity (data not shown). Effect of Ro 68-3400 on PTP in Brain Mitochondria—Ro 68-3400 inhibited swelling of brain mitochondria with a potency in the range of that observed for liver mitochondria (Fig. 3A). The effect of PTP inhibitors in brain mitochondria was also investigated by subjecting mitochondria to a series of 5 μm Ca2+ pulses and by monitoring extramitochondrial Ca2+ or Δψm using fluorescent probes (21.Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The effects of CsA and Ro 68-3400 in these experiments are shown in Fig. 3, B and C. Both Ro 68-3400 and CsA increased the ability of mitochondria to buffer Ca2+ until a threshold was reached at which no further Ca2+ could be taken up (Fig. 3B). At 1 μm (i.e. the maximal effective concentration observed for each inhibitor), both compounds approximately doubled the amount of Ca2+ taken up by brain mitochondria. Thus, control mitochondria were able to accumulate 530 ± 70 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein, whereas, in the presence of 1 μm CsA and Ro 68-3400, the Ca2+-buffering capacity increased up to 1130 ± 80 and 1200 ± 120 nmol of Ca2+/mg protein, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 3). The combination of Ro 68-3400 and CsA had an additive effect, mitochondria being able to accumulate up to 2050 ± 450 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein. In agreement with the finding that Ro 68-3400 does not inhibit Cyp-D enzymatic activity, this indicates that Ro 68-3400 acts at a site in the PTP other than Cyp-D. Virtually identical results were obtained from experiments where Δψm was monitored after a series of Ca2+ additions (Fig. 3C). Each Ca2+ addition caused reversible decreases in Δψm, until triggering of PTP completely collapsed Δψm and no further fluorescence increase could be observed after addition of the protonophore FCCP. Similar experiments using other known PTP inhibitors also showed that the effect of Ro 68-3400 (and of Ro 68-3406) was additive with that of BKA, ADP, TFP, and tamoxifen, suggesting that Ro 68-3400 acts at a site that is different from those acted upon by these compounds (data not shown).2 The only exception was Ub0, a previously characterized PTP blocker (20.Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) for which no such additive effect was seen. Ro 68-3400 and Ubiquinone Derivatives—The lack of additive effect with Ub0 suggested that the binding site of Ro 68-3400 might be related to the ubiquinone site reported to modulate the PTP (21.Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22.Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To address this, we investigated whether Ub5, an ubiquinone derivative able to relieve the inhibitory effect of Ub0 (21.Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), could similarly antagonize PTP inhibition by Ro 68-3400. As shown in Fig. 4A for rat liver mitochondria, Ub5 (50 μm) was able antagonize the inhibition by Ro 68-3400, shifting its EC50 from 290 nm to 2.4 μm (n = 2). Likewise, in rat brain mitochondria, inhibition of Ca2+-induced depolarization by 300 nm Ro 68-3400 was relieved by 50 μm Ub5 (Fig. 4B). Affinity Labeling of Mitochondria with [3H]Ro 68-3400: Identification of VDAC1 as a Component of the Permeability Transition Pore—The high potency displayed by Ro 68-3400 at inhibiting the PTP and the fact it contains a reactive moiety, prompted us to tritiate the compound and use it as affinity labeling probe. Fig. 5A shows the results obtained after labeling with 10 nm [3H]Ro 68-3400 of intact mitochondria isolated from rat brain and liver. A restricted number of proteins appeared to be labeled with a predominant band of ∼32 kDa present in both preparations. A protein of identical size was also primarily labeled in mitochondria from mouse brain and liver, and from SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (not shown). Increasing concentration of unlabeled Ro 68-3400 inhibited radioactivity incorporation into this band. Notably, its labeling did not reflect a higher relative abundance, since Coomassie Blue and/or silver staining did not reveal major protein bands that correspond to the labeled protein (see inset to Fig. 5B). This ∼32 kDa protein labeled by [3H]Ro 68-3400 in rat brain and liver mitochondria could be purified by a single FPLC chromatographic step using a hydroxyapatite column. As shown in Fig. 5B, most of the radioactivity eluted in the column front. SDS-PAGE analysis of these fractions, followed by silver staining and fluorography, showed the"

Thus, BEL is widely used to define biological roles of iPLA2 in cells. However, BEL is also known to inhibit another key enzyme of phospholipid metabolism, namely the magnesium-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase-1 (PAP-1). In this work we report that BEL is able to promote apoptosis in a variety of cell lines, including U937, THP-1, and MonoMac (human phagocyte), RAW264.7 (murine macrophage), Jurkat (human T lymphocyte), and GH3 (human pituitary). In these cells, long term treatment with BEL (up to 24 h) results in increased annexin-V binding to the cell surface and nuclear DNA damage, as detected by staining with both DAPI and propidium iodide. At earlier times (2 h), BEL induces the proteolysis of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 and increases cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. These changes are preceded by variations in the mitochondrial membrane potential. All these effects of BEL are not mimicked by the iPLA2 inhibitor methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate or by treating the cells with a specific iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide. However, propranolol, a PAP-1 inhibitor, is able to reproduce these effects, suggesting that it is the inhibition of PAP-1 and not of iPLA2 that is involved in BEL-induced cell death. In support of this view, BEL-induced apoptosis is accompanied by a very strong inhibition of PAP-1-regulated events, such as incorporation of [3H]choline into phospholipids and de novo incorporation of [3H]arachidonic acid into triacylglycerol. Collectively, these results stress the role of PAP-1 as a key enzyme for cell integrity and survival and in turn caution against the use of BEL in studies involving long incubation times, due to the capacity of this drug to induce apoptosis in a variety of cells.

Cooney E. Sofia M.J. Chakravarty P.K. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15046-15053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, this compound was found to potently inhibit myocardial calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) activity (2Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a finding that was corroborated by studies utilizing purified iPLA2 from P388D1 macrophages (3Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). BEL has proven to be exquisitely selective for iPLA2 versus other Ca2+-dependent PLA2 forms (including both secreted and cytosolic PLA2s) (2Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Due to this selectivity, BEL is frequently used to identify iPLA2 roles in cells (5Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 6Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, BEL has also been recently found to inhibit another enzyme of key significance in phosholipid metabolism, namely the magnesium-dependent cytosolic phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, also known as phosphatidate phosphohydrolase-1 (PAP-1) (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). PAP-1 from mammalian sources has yet to be purified, which has considerably hampered the study of biological role(s) of this enzyme in metabolism and cell activation. An Mg2+-dependent PAP has been purified from yeast (8Morlock K.R. McLaughlin J.J. Lin Y.P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3586-3593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its relationship, if any, to mammalian PAP-1 remains obscure. PAP-1 is known to be primarily involved in controlling cellular diacylglycerol (DAG) that acts as the precursor for triacylglycerol (TAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis in the Kennedy pathway (9Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Duffy P.A. Brindley D.N. Liscovitch M. Signal-Activated Phospholipases. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 139-164Google Scholar, 10Brindley D.N. English D Pilquil C. Buri K. Ling Z.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is likely that PAP-1 also participates in certain signaling events (9Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Duffy P.A. Brindley D.N. Liscovitch M. Signal-Activated Phospholipases. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 139-164Google Scholar, 10Brindley D.N. English D Pilquil C. Buri K. Ling Z.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a type of cell death that does not involve an inflammatory response and occurs in a tightly controlled manner. In contrast to necrosis, apoptosis involves activation of catabolic mediators and enzymes prior to cytolysis. Many cellular changes that take place during this form of death have an important role in the recognition and elimination of those cells by neighboring phagocyte cells (11Devitt A. Moffatt O.D. Raykundalia C. Capra J.D. Simmons D.L. Gregory C.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 12Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). One of these changes is the scrambling of cellular phospholipids (loss of bilayer asymmetry) and phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface (13Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar, 14Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. Van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be induced in cells by a death receptor (e.g. the tumor necrosis factor receptor) or by cytotoxic agents that cause a mitochondria-dependent cascade of events (15Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 16Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). In the death receptor-mediated apoptosis, a death-inducing signaling complex is formed by the death receptors, adapter proteins, and caspases (cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases) like caspase-8 and caspase-10 (15Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 16Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). In the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, major alterations in mitochondrial membrane function occur (16Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 19Castedo M. Ferri K. Roumier T. Métivier D. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 265: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has been found that mitochondrial membrane permeabilization is an early event of apoptosis (14Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. Van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), resulting in the release of proteins from the soluble intermembrane space in a nonspecific fashion. Cytochrome c is one of these proteins and, once released to the cytosol, interacts with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 to form a molecular caspase activation complex, the apoptosome, where caspase-9 is in its active form (20Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). There is also disruption of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential that often precedes nuclear DNA degradation, which is considered an irreversible event (21Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Caspase-8, caspase-10, and caspase-9 are believed to be the initiator caspases at the top of the caspase signaling cascade that culminates with the cleavage and activation of caspase-3, the principal effector caspase (18Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated iPLA2 in stimulus-induced cell proliferation (22Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Stevenson C. Eichman C. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35692-35698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Sánchez T. Moreno J.J. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 193: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). While studying the possible implications of iPLA2 in the serum-induced growth response of different cell lines of myelomonocytic origin, we found that BEL dramatically induces cell death by a mechanism that is clearly identifiable as a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis event. Importantly, the BEL effect appears to be unrelated to iPLA2 inhibition but appears to work through inhibition of PAP-1. Materials—[5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]AA (200 Ci/mmol) and [3H]choline chloride (80 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Ibérica (Madrid, Spain). BEL was from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Caspase-9 antibody, caspase-3 antibody, and PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Oligonucleotides were from MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). JC-1 was from Molecular Probes. Annexin-V FITC was from Pharmingen. The general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was from Calbiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—The following cell lines: U937, Jurkat, THP-1, MonoMac, and RAW264.7 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin 100 μg/ml. MonoMac cells were also supplemented with OPI medium (Sigma). GH3 pituitary cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were incubated for 24 h with or without the inhibitors, washed twice with cold PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 18 h. Cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS with 5 mm EDTA. RNA was removed by digestion with RNase A at room temperature. Staining was achieved by incubation with staining solution (500 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA) for 1 h, and cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry in a Coulter Epics XL-MCL cytofluorometer. Measurement of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was analyzed by labeling with the annexin-V FITC apoptosis detection kit (Pharmingen), which recognizes phosphatidylserine exposure on outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Apoptosis was also evaluated by DAPI staining. For this purpose, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized by 0.5% Triton-X-100 in PBS. Cells were then stained for 30 min with DAPI (1 μg/ml) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy to assess chromatin condensation. Experiments utilizing iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides were carried out exactly as described previously (24Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40384-40389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg/ml antisense or sense oligonucleotides were mixed with 10 μm LipofectAMINE, and complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 30 min. The complexes were then added to the cells, and the incubations were allowed to proceed under standard cell culture conditions for 48 h. iPLA2 Assay—Aliquots of cell homogenates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm EDTA and 100 μm labeled phospholipid substrate (1-palmitoyl-2-[3H]palmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine; specific activity, 60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in a final volume of 150 μm. The phospholipid substrate was used in the form of sonicated vesicles in buffer. Choline Incorporation into Phosphatidylcholine—Cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with 25 μm BEL at different time points, and 2 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline chloride was added for the last hour. Cells were then washed and lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:40:6:0.6) as a solvent system. Spots corresponding to phosphatidylcholine were scraped into scintillation vials, and the amount of radioactivity was estimated by liquid scintillation counting. AA Incorporation into TAG—Cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with 25 μm BEL or vehicle for 2 h. Cells were then exposed to 10 μm [3H]AA (0.5 μCi/ml) for different periods of time. Cells were washed, the lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar), and the lipids in the chloroform phase were separated by thin-layer chromatography with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1) as a mobile phase. The spots corresponding to TAG were scraped into scintillation vials, and the amount of radioactivity was estimated by liquid scintillation counting. Proliferation Assay—The CellTiter96 Aqueous One solution cell proliferation assay (Promega) was used, and the manufacturer's instructions were followed. Briefly, cells (10,000 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plates treated with vehicle or different concentrations of BEL. After 24 h, formazan product formation was assayed by recording the absorbance at 490 nm in a 96-well plate reader. Immunoblot Analyses—Cells were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer and 50 μg of cellular protein from each sample were separated by standard 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Dilution of both primary and secondary antibodies was made in PBS containing 5% defatted dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. After 1-h incubation with the corresponding primary antibody at 1:1000, blots were washed 4 times and the secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody was added for another hour. Immunoblots were developed using the Amersham ECL system. Mitochondrial Depolarization Measurements—After drug treatment for 24 h, cells were incubated with 7.5 μm JC-1 at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Depolarization was measured as decay of red fluorescence by flow cytometry analysis. Data Presentation—Assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times with similar results. Unless otherwise indicated, the data presented are from representative experiments. Effect of BEL on Cell Growth—Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of iPLA2 results in a decreased proliferative response of the cells to mitogens (22Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Stevenson C. Eichman C. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35692-35698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Sánchez T. Moreno J.J. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 193: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We began the current study by investigating the effect of the iPLA2 inhibitor BEL on the basal growth of U937 promonocytes (i.e. that normally induced by the serum present in the culture medium, in the absence of any other mitogenic stimulus). The continued presence of BEL for 24 h in the culture medium of U937 cells resulted in a marked inhibition of cell growth, as assessed by a colorimetric method (Fig. 1). At concentrations between 10 and 25 μm BEL, the reduction of growth was so intense that the absorbance readings fell well below the absorbance of control, BEL-untreated cells at time 0 (i.e. the absorbance reading that is obtained immediately after seeding the cells at the beginning of the experiment). This indicated that the number of live cells present in the BEL-treated wells at the end of the experiment was much less than that seeded at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment depicted in Fig. 1 was also repeated with other human monocyte-like cell lines such as MonoMac and THP-1 and also with the T-lymphocyte-like cell line Jurkat. Identical results to those shown in Fig. 1 were obtained. Effect of BEL on Cell Cycle and DNA—To analyze in more detail the effect of BEL on the U937 cells, cellular DNA was analyzed by propidium iodide staining. As shown in Fig. 2A, BEL clearly induced subdiploid events, characteristic of apoptotic cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased from 4% in control cells to 35% at 24 h, and 65% at 48 h. Typical apoptotic nuclei, exhibiting highly fluorescent, condensed chromatin, were also demonstrated by DAPI staining (Fig. 2B). Effect of BEL on Annexin-V Labeling—The above data indicated that there is cell damage after BEL treatment and that cellular DNA breakdown occurs. These events are characteristic of cell death by apoptosis. To further explore this possibility, experiments were carried out to study annexin-V labeling to the BEL-treated cells. Fig. 3A shows the time course of the effect of BEL on phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer membrane of the cells. Phosphatidylserine externalization is an early event in apoptosis, and as such, it was significantly detected after 9 h of treatment with BEL. Fig. 3B shows the concentration dependence of the BEL effect on phosphatidylserine exposure. Significant increases in annexin-V labeling were already observed at BEL concentrations as low as 10 μm. BEL Effect on Caspase Breakdown—One of the signature events of cell death by apoptosis is the activation of a cascade of proteolytic enzymes, the so-called caspases, which are synthesized as zymogens (procaspases) and undergo proteolytic maturation. Hydrolysis of procaspase-9 was detected in BEL-treated U937 cells (Fig. 4A). The caspase-9 active fragments of 35/37 kDa could be detected as early as 1 h after treatment with BEL (Fig. 4A). Caspase-9 is the initiator caspase implicated in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (26Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). The cleaved forms of caspase-3 could also be detected at 2 h (Fig. 4A), suggesting that apoptotic signals brought about by BEL activate the effector caspase-3 via a mitochondrial pathway. To confirm caspase-3 activation in BEL-induced apoptosis, cleavage of PARP was evaluated. PARP is known to be a caspase-3 substrate in vivo (27Soldani C. Scovassi A.I. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Cells not treated with BEL expressed the intact PARP 112-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 4A). In the BEL-treated cells a digestion fragment of 85 kDa was already detected at 2 h (Fig. 4A). Experiments were also carried out in the presence of Z-VAD-FMK, a general irreversible caspase inhibitor (28Zhu H. Fearnhead H.O. Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the presence of inhibitor, cell surface labeling with annexin-V was greatly diminished in the BEL-treated cells (Fig. 4B), thus confirming the involvement of caspases in the process under study. BEL Effects on Mitochondria—Early apoptotic pathways converge on mitochondrial membranes to induce their permeabilization. The outer membrane becomes protein-permeable, and the inner membrane keeps retaining matrix proteins but can dissipate the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (21Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). To confirm that BEL induces cell death through a mitochondrial pathway, changes in the mitochondria inner membrane potential were assessed. The dye JC-1 is commonly used to monitor these changes (29Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, control cells are stained red, whereas in the BEL-treated cells the staining shifts to green, which indicates a change in the mitochondrial membrane potential of these cells (19Castedo M. Ferri K. Roumier T. Métivier D. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 265: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analyses of BEL-treated cells at different time points revealed a decrease on red fluorescence that was already evident at 20 min (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these data suggest the involvement of mitochondria in BEL-induced apoptosis. Effects of BEL on Other Cell Types—To assess whether BEL-induced apoptosis was a general effect, several cell lines of different lineages were assayed for annexin-V binding after a 24-h treatment with BEL (Fig. 6). These cells included U937, MonoMac, and THP-1 (human monocyte) and RAW264.7 (murine macrophage), Jurkat (human T-lymphocyte), and GH3 (human pituitary). Although the extent of the effects observed varied from cell to cell, BEL treatment promoted significant increases in annexin-V binding in all cell types under study, indicating that apoptosis was triggered in all of them. Effect of Other iPLA2 Inhibition Strategies on Annexin-V Labeling—Since BEL inhibits both iPLA2 and PAP-1, it is important to determine which of these two enzymes is involved in BEL-induced apoptosis. Thus, different pharmacological approaches were undertaken to discriminate between the two enzymes. In the first series of experiments, the cells were treated with MAFP, an unspecific inhibitor of PLA2s that, like iPLA2, utilize a catalytic serine (5Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of the cells with 25 μm MAFP did not change annexin-V labeling of the cell surface. In vitro measurements confirmed that both MAFP and BEL strongly inhibited the iPLA2 activity of U937 cell homogenates under these conditions (Fig. 8A).Fig. 8Inhibition of iPLA2 in U937 cells. A, effect of treating the cells with 25 μm MAFP or 25 μm BEL on the iPLA2 activity of U937 cell homogenates. B, effect of an iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide on iPLA2 activity and iPLA2 protein expression (inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of an iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide on annexin-V labeling was evaluated next. The antisense oligonucleotide used is the human counterpart of the murine one that we and others (24Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40384-40389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 5276-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have successfully employed elsewhere. In the U937 cells, this antisense produced a 70–80% decrease of both immunoreactive iPLA2 protein and cellular iPLA2 activity (Fig. 8B). Under these conditions, the iPLA2 antisense did not affect annexin-V labeling of the U937 cell surface (Fig. 7). Collectively, these data indicate that iPLA2 inhibition does not lead to apoptotic cell death. Role of PAP-1—The effect of propranolol, a PAP-1 inhibitor that is structurally unrelated to BEL (33Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was studied next. Fig. 7 shows that propranolol mimicked the BEL effects on cells and significantly increased annexin-V labeling of the U937 cell surface. PAP-1 is a cytosolic enzyme that produces the DAG moieties utilized for the biosynthesis of PC and TAG in the Kennedy pathway (9Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Duffy P.A. Brindley D.N. Liscovitch M. Signal-Activated Phospholipases. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 139-164Google Scholar, 10Brindley D.N. English D Pilquil C. Buri K. Ling Z.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is well known that perturbation of PC homeostasis induces growth arrest and cell death (24Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40384-40389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 shows that BEL treatment of the cells resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the incorporation of [3H]choline into PC, indicating that cellular PC biosynthesis is depressed in the presence of BEL. When propranolol was used instead, essentially the same results were obtained (Fig. 9). In vitro measurements confirmed that both BEL and propranolol strongly inhibited PAP-1 activity in the cytosolic fraction of U937 cell homogenates (75 ± 8% inhibition over control for cells treated with 25 μm BEL and 72 ± 3% inhibition over control for cells treated with 150 μm propranolol; means ± S.E., n = 4). When cells are exposed to high, micromolar levels of exogenous fatty acids, incorporation into cellular lipids mainly occurs via the de novo pathway, which ultimately leads to accumulation of these fatty acids into TAG (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 35Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that this process is strikingly dependent on a functional PAP-1 that provides the DAG precursors for TAG synthesis (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 35Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 shows that the capacity of the cells to incorporate [3H]AA (10 μm) into TAG is greatly diminished by both BEL and propranolol, indicating again that the Kennedy pathway is blocked under these conditions. In the present work we have found that BEL, a compound that is widely used as an iPLA2 inhibitor, induces death in a number of cellular types. Staining of nuclei in BEL-treated cells with DAPI demonstrates features of apoptosis, a finding that is corroborated by flow cytometry studies with propidium iodide-labeled cells. In accord with these results, BEL induces an increase in the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the cells, as well as cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-9. The involvement of caspases in BEL-induced cell death was confirmed by studies utilizing the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. The finding that caspase-9 cleavage occurs is suggestive of the involvement of mitochondria. Assessment of changes in the mitochondria inner membrane potential with the dye JC-1 indicate that BEL induces apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial cell death pathway (36Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). Importantly, none of the aforementioned effects of BEL could be reproduced by MAFP, another iPLA2 inhibitor, or by treating the cells with a specific iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide, conclusively ruling out the involvement of iPLA2 in BEL-induced apoptosis. It is worth mentioning here that iPLA2 has been reported to be responsible for fatty acid liberation and, hence, destruction of membrane phospholipid during Fas-induced apoptosis of U937 cells (37Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 38Atsumi G. Murakami M. Kojima K. Hadano H. Tajima M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18248-18258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Whether these actions of iPLA2 during Fas-induced apoptosis are cause or consequence of the apoptotic process itself is not clear at this time. Our studies on different experimental settings appear to suggest that mitochondria-driven apoptosis can be triggered in the absence of iPLA2 activity. BEL-induced apoptosis was mimicked by the PAP-1 inhibitor propranolol (33Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting therefore that the effects of BEL may involve PAP-1 inhibition. PAP-1 is the enzyme that dephosphorylates phosphatidic acid to yield DAG. This is a key reaction in cellular phospholipid metabolism, because it provides the DAG necessary to maintain homeostatic PC biosynthesis in the cells. Thus, inhibition of PAP-1 will result in diminished cellular PC levels, a circumstance that we have confirmed to occur in the BEL-treated cells. PAP-1 inhibition under these conditions is also manifested by strong inhibition of fatty acid incorporation into TAG (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Perturbation of PC homeostasis is known to induce growth arrest and apoptotic cell death (34Cui Z. Houweling M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Evidence that reduced PC synthesis alone can cause apoptosis was first reported in a cell line with a temperature-deficient mutant of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the enzyme that produces CDP-choline to be used for PC synthesis (39Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Terce F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). More recently, synthetic analogues of lyso-PC that function as inhibitors of PC synthesis have been documented to induce apoptosis in fibroblast-like cells (40Gueguen G. Granci V. Rogalle P. Briand-Mésange F. Wilson M. Klaébé A. Tercé F. Chap H. Salles J.P. Simon M.F. Gaits F. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 447-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with all of these results, defective PAP-1 activity pinpoints a molecular basis that can explain BEL-induced apoptosis, i.e. diminished homeostatic lipid synthesis. Under these conditions, an hypothetical role for ceramides also merits consideration. Decreased synthesis of both DAG and PC in BEL-treated cells should necessarily impact negatively on sphingomyelin synthesis via the sphingomyelin synthase pathway, ultimately leading to early elevations of ceramide within the cells. Although the mechanism by which ceramide signals apoptosis remains a matter of controversy, ceramide has been found to increase during the initial phases of apoptosis (41Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1585: 114-125Crossref Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 42van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Luit A.H. Veldman. R.J. Verheij M. Borst J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Interestingly, natural ceramides appear to be able to increase the permeability of mitochondrial outer membranes, thus permitting the release of cytochrome c and other small proteins to the cytosol (43Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26796-26803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Given the powerful, iPLA2-independent effects of BEL described in this study, caution should be exercised when using this drug to study possible iPLA2 roles in apoptosis or other long term cellular responses. In addition to BEL, other inhibitors and/or alternative techniques to abolish iPLA2 should be utilized to complement the results obtained with BEL. It is important to note that even at times where no morphological alterations are readily visible, there is a cascade of biochemical events already going on in the cells, namely mitochondrial depolarization and the release and activation of cell death effectors. Moreover, BEL effects on lipid metabolism are readily detectable within 1-h exposure to the drug, the time at which both PC and TAG synthesis is severely depressed. Studies are currently under way to explore the effects of BEL derivatives with lower toxicity and to what extent can these compounds and other PAP-1 inhibitors be thought of as potential antitumoral agents. We thank Yolanda Sáez for expert technical assistance and Drs. Claus Kerkhoff, Carlos Villalobos, and Miguel Angel Gijón for providing us with some of the cell lines utilized in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2089302797,"Both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and NF-κB pathways function to promote cellular survival following stress. Recent evidence indicates that the anti-apoptotic activity of these two pathways may be functionally dependent. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation causes oxidative stress, which can lead to apoptotic cell death. Human skin cells (keratinocytes) are commonly exposed to UV irradiation from the sun. We have investigated activation of the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways and their roles in protecting human keratinocytes (KCs) from UV irradiation-induced apoptosis. This activation of PI3K preceded increased levels (3-fold) of active/phosphorylated Akt. UV (50 mJ/cm2 from UVB source) irradiation caused rapid recruitment of PI3K to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Pretreatment of KCs with EGFR inhibitor PD169540 abolished UV-induced Akt activation/phosphorylation, as did the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin. This inhibition of Akt activation was associated with a 3-4-fold increase of UV-induced apoptosis, as measured by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation ELISA. In contrast to Akt, UV irradiation did not detectably increase nuclear localization of NF-κB, indicating that it was not strongly activated. Consistent with this observation, interference with NF-κB activation by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of dominant negative IKK-β or IκB-α did not increase UV-induced apoptosis. However, adenovirusmediated overexpression of constitutively active Akt completely blocked UV-induced apoptosis observed with PI3K inhibition by LY294002, whereas adenovirus mediated overexpression of dominant negative Akt increased UV-induced apoptosis by 2-fold. Inhibition of UV-induced activation of Akt increased release of mitochondrial cytochrome c 3.5-fold, and caused appearance of active forms of caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3. Constitutively active Akt abolished UV-induced cytochrome c release and activation of caspases-9, -8, and -3. These data demonstrate that PI3K/Akt is essential for protecting human KCs against UV-induced apoptosis, whereas NF-κB pathway provides little, if any, protective role. Both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and NF-κB pathways function to promote cellular survival following stress. Recent evidence indicates that the anti-apoptotic activity of these two pathways may be functionally dependent.

These data demonstrate that PI3K/Akt is essential for protecting human KCs against UV-induced apoptosis, whereas NF-κB pathway provides little, if any, protective role. Human skin, unlike all other organs, is continuously and directly exposed to environmental influences. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is among the most ubiquitous damaging environmental factors from which human skin must protect itself. (1Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5332) Google Scholar). Solar UV radiation that reaches the surface of the earth is subdivided into three wavelength ranges: UVB (290-320 nm), UVA2 (320-340 nm), and UVA1 (340-400 nm). UVB wavelengths are the most energetic, and are responsible for sunburn. UVB is directly absorbed by DNA and protein, and as such accounts for much of the damaging biological effects of UV irradiation including cancer and premature skin aging (2Shea R. Parrish J. Goldsmith L. Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology of the Skin. Vol. II. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 910-927Google Scholar). Sunburned cells, which are induced in human skin by UVB irradiation, bear characteristic apoptotic cell morphology, and are the first evidence that UVB triggers apoptosis in skin cells (keratinocytes) (3Weedon D. Searle J. Kerr J. Am. J. Dermatopathol. 1979; 1: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). UV-induced apoptosis is an important process for eliminating UV-damaged skin cells that potentially could become cancerous. Two signaling pathways have been demonstrated to contribute to UV-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes (4Ziegler A. Jonason A. Leffell D. Simon J. Sharma H. Kimmelman J. Remington L. Jacks T. Brash D.

Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 2000; 16: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). UV-induced DNA damage leads to p53-mediated apoptosis (4Ziegler A. Jonason A. Leffell D. Simon J. Sharma H. Kimmelman J. Remington L. Jacks T. Brash D. Nature. 1994; 372: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Upon severe DNA damage, p53 up-regulates Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (8Miyashita T. Reed J. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Bax binds to the mitochondrial membrane and induces cytochrome c release, which subsequently activates caspase-9 and caspase-3 leading to downstream apoptotic responses (9Finucane D. Bossy-Wetzel E.

The other pathway by which UV induces apoptosis is through activation of the membrane death receptors Fas (CD95) (5Leverkus M. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp.

It is activated by the interaction of p85 subunit with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and insulin-like growth factor receptor (13Stein R. Waterfield M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Activated PI3K phosphorylates phosphotidylinositol (PI), PI 4-P, or PI 4,5-P2 at the 3′-position of the inositol head group to produce PI 3-P, PI 3,4-P2, and PI 3,4,5-P3, respectively (13Stein R. Waterfield M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The phospholipid products of PI3K activates phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and recruits Akt to plasma membrane through their pleckstrin homology domains (13Stein R. Waterfield M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is a serine/threonine protein kinase, originally identified as the oncogene transduced by the acute transforming retrovirus AKT8 (14Bellacosa A. Testa J. Staal S. Tsichlis P. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, Akt resides within the cytosol in an inactive state. After growth factor or cytokine stimulation, Akt translocates to the inner surface of the plasma membrane where PI 3 kinase-generated 3′-phosphoinositides reside, and Akt is phosphorylated at threonine 308 and serine 473 by PDK1 (15Alessi D.

Mutagenesis studies have revealed that phosphorylation of threonine 308 and serine 473 is required for Akt activation and mimicking phosphorylation partially activates Akt (18Alessi D. Andjelkovic M.

Akt was first demonstrated to promote cell survival in neurons by Dudek in 1997 (19Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E.

NF-κB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that regulates many genes involved in inflammation and immunity. NF-κB is regulated by exclusion from the nucleus by interaction with its inhibitor IκB. Exposure to a variety of stimuli, including cytokines/oxidative stress and UV irradiation stimulates phosphorylation by IκB by IκB kinase (IKK) complexes. Phosphorylation of IκB results in increase susceptibility to ubiquitin/proteasome degradation, thereby allowing NF-κB to localize to the nucleus and stimulates transcription of target genes. Recently it has been demonstrated that NF-κB stimulates expression of certain members of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) family of genes. IAP binds to and inhibits certain caspases and thereby blocks apoptosis. Recent evidence indicates that Akt can activate the NF-κB pathway through phosphorylation of IKK (26Madrid L. Mayo M.

This observation raises the possibility that the anti-apoptotic activities of the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways may be interdependent. UV irradiation has been demonstrated to induce phosphorylation/activation of EGFR (32Fisher G. Talwar H. Lin J. Lin P. McPhillips F. Wang Z. Li X. Wan Y. Kang S. Voorhees J. J. Clin.

UV activation of EGFR may stimulate PI3K and, consequently, Akt. Since PI3K/Akt is downstream of EGFR, UV irradiation has also been reported to activate NF-κB (35Piette J. Piret B. G B. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M. Legrand-Poels S. Bours V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1237-1245PubMed Google Scholar, 36Huang T. Feinberg S. Suryanarayanan S. Miyamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5813-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have investigated UV-induced PI3K/Akt activation, and the role of Akt versus NF-κB, in protecting keratinocytes against UV-induced apoptosis. Primary Human Keratinocyte and UV Irradiation—All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. Primary human keratinocytes were established from normal adult human skin, as previously described (37Fisher G. Tavakkol A. Leach K. Burns D. Basta P. Loomis C. Griffiths C. Cooper K. Reynolds N. Elder J. Livneh E. Voorhees J.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in modified MCDB 153 (EpiLife, Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland, OR). Cells at passage 3-5 were used for study. For UV irradiation, human keratinocytes in 100-mm dishes were placed in growth factor-free medium for 24 h, washed once with PBS, 3 ml of PBS added, and were irradiated with the dish lid removed. The light source was a Daavlin Spectra Lamp containing six FS24T12 UVB-HO fluorescent tubes. Kodacel TA 401/407 sheet was used to remove wavelengths below 290 nm (UVC). The resulting output consisted of 40% UVB, 27% UVA2, 19% UVA1, and 14% visible light as analyzed by Spectroradiometry OL 754 system (Optronic Laboratories, Orlando, FL). Irradiation intensity was monitored by IL1400A Radiometer/photometer and SEL 240/UVB/W photodetector (International Light Inc, Newburyport, MA). After irradiation, PBS was removed, and the original media were put back into the plates. In selected experiments, cells were pretreated with PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin (Sigma), or EGFR inhibitor PD169540 (Pfizer, Ann Arbor, MI), or caspase-8 inhibitor II (Z-IETD-FMK), caspase-9 inhibitor I (Z-LEHD-FMK), or caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 1 h prior to UV irradiation. Preparation of Whole Cell Homogenates or Cytosolic Protein—Whole cell homogenates or cytosolic lysates were prepared as previously described (38Li L. Lorenzo P. Bogi K. Blumberg P. Yuspa S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For whole cell homogenates, keratinocytes were washed once in PBS, and scraped into whole cell lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitors Na3VO4 (1 mm) and NaF (50 mm). Cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used as whole cell extracts for Western blot analysis. To prepare the cytosolic fractions, keratinocytes were trypsinized and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of hypotonic buffer, containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% digitonin with 1× protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and homogenized 10 times with a Dounce homogenizer (1Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5332) Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was utilized as cytosolic fraction. Protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment, keratinocytes were washed with PBS once and 1.5 ml ice-cold RIPA buffer, 1 × PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS containing [1× complete protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitors Na3VO4 (1 mm) and NaF (50 mm)] were added to the cells and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle and transferred to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared by adding 1.0 μg of normal rabbit IgG and protein G/A-agarose. The resulting supernatant was incubated with anti-p85 polyclonal antibody bound to agarose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with RIPA buffer. After final wash, pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 1× electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by Western analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out as described (39Wang H. Smart R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3497-3506PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extract proteins (50-100 μg) were separated on Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon™-P membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were probed with polyclonal antibody against phospho-Akt (serine 473), total Akt, caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), caspase-3, and caspase-8 (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). For cytochrome c Western blot analysis, 50 μg of cytosolic protein extract was separated on 14% Tris-glycine PAGE and transferred to Immobilon™-P membrane, and the membrane was probed with a monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (Clone 7H8.2C12, BD PharMingen). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemifluorescence (ECF) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and quantified by STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Detection of Apoptosis by ELISA and Flow Cytometry—Apoptosis was examined by analysis of DNA fragmentation using the Cell Death Detection ELISA following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). For flow cytometry, keratinocytes were collected by trypsin and washed once with PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50% cold ethanol and fixed at -20 °C. After fixation, cells were washed once with cold PBS, and incubated in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A for 20 min at 37 °C. Keratinocytes were then pelleted by centrifugation, and 250 μl of PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) was added to the pellet. Thirty minutes later, flow cytometric analysis was carried out using Beckman Coulter Elite Esp. Cell Sorter in the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at University of Michigan. Cells with DNA content less than that in untreated cells in G0/G1 were considered apoptotic. Measurement of Caspase-8 Activity—Keratinocytes were collected by trypsinization, washed once with PBS, and cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm EDTA) and homogenized. Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for measuring caspase-8 activity using an ELISA-based assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem). Measurement of NF-κB Activity—Human skin keratinocytes were transfected with pNF-κB-Luc (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using Fugen 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid DNA containing the β-galactosidase gene (pCMVβ, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) was used as an internal standard for transfection efficiency. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were sham- or UV-irradiated with UV (50 mJ/cm2) as described above. Alternatively, cells were treated with either IL-1β (10 ng/ml) or TNFα (10 ng/ml). Sixteen hours after treatment cells were harvested in lysis buffer (PharMingen International, San Diego, CA), and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activity was measured using an enhanced luciferase assay kit (PharMingen International) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots containing identical β-galactosidase activity were used for each luciferase assay. Infection of Human Keratinocytes with Adenovirus Constructs—Recombinant adenovirus constructs expressing constitutively active myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt), dominant negative Akt (dn-Akt, T308A, S473A), dominant negative IκB-α, and dominant negative IKK-β have been previously described (24Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 40Kennedy S. Kandel E. Cross T. Hay N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Dominant negative Akt was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Walsh (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) and dominant negative IκB-α and IKK-β were generously provided by Michael Karin (University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA). Adenovirus constructs were propagated in HEK 293 cells, and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation, followed by Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography (41Gerard R. Meidell R. Hames B. Glover D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 300-302Google Scholar). The amount of virus was estimated by absorbance at 260 nm. Human keratinocytes were infected with adenovirus at 5000 particles per cell in growth factor-free medium for 1 h. One hour later, media were removed and replaced with fresh growth medium (38Li L. Lorenzo P. Bogi K. Blumberg P. Yuspa S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, growth media were removed, and growth factor-free medium was added. Cells were utilized the following day. UV-induced Akt Phosphorylation Is Mediated by EGFR and PI3K in Human Keratinocytes—We initially characterized the kinetics and dose dependence of UV induction of Akt phosphorylation in primary human keratinocytes by Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes activated Akt phosphorylated at serine 473. Levels of phospho-Akt increased (2.5-fold) within 10 min, and were maximal (3-fold) at 15 min after UV irradiation (Fig. 1A). Phospho-Akt levels decreased, but remained modestly elevated 20-30 min post-UV irradiation. Total Akt levels were not altered by UV irradiation (Fig. 1A). Maximum UV-induction of Akt phosphorylation was observed at a dose of 50 mJ/cm2 (Fig. 1B). Above this dose, Akt phosphorylation decreased, as a result of excessive cellular damage. To investigate if UV-induced Akt activation is dependent on PI3K, human keratinocytes were treated with two PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin for 1 h prior to UV irradiation. LY294002 and Wortmannin abolished UV-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). UV has been shown to activate EGFR in human keratinocytes by a ligand independent mechanism (32Fisher G. Talwar H. Lin J.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). We examined if UV-induced activation of PI3K and Akt is mediated by EGFR. Activated EGFR is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues, which function as binding sites for SH2 domain of p85 subunit of PI3K (46Stover D. Becker M. Leiebetanz J. Lydon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 26: 15591-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Binding of p85 to EGFR is a hallmark of PI3K activation (47Tiganis T. Kemp B. Tonks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). UV irradiation induced binding of p85 to EGFR in human keratinocytes, as determined by Western analysis of p85 immunoprecipitates for EGFR (Fig. 1D). UV irradiation increased binding of p85 with EGFR within 5 min post-UV irradiation (Fig. 1D). The increased association of p85 with EGFR induced by UV irradiation was similar in magnitude to that observed following treatment of cells with EGFR (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, treatment of human keratinocytes with EGFR inhibitor PD169540 (48Fry D.W. Bridges A.J. Denny W.A. Doherty A. Greis K.D. Hicks J.L. Hook K.E. Keller P.R. Leopold W.R. Loo J.A.

These results indicate that UV-induced Akt phosphorylation is dependent on EGFR activation of PI3K in human keratinocytes. PI3K Inhibitor or EGFR Inhibitor Increases UV-induced Apoptosis in Human Keratinocytes—Akt has been shown to promote cell survival in a variety of cell types in response to growth factor or cytokine stimulation (49Datta S. Brunet A. Greenberg M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the role of Akt activation in UV-induced apoptosis, keratinocytes were pretreated with or without PI3K inhibitors or EGFR inhibitor prior to UV irradiation. UV irradiation of keratinocytes with 50 mJ/cm2 resulted in apoptosis of ∼20% of the cells, as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of keratinocytes with PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin, or EGFR inhibitor PD169540 resulted in UV-induced apoptosis of 60-70% of the cells. DNA fragmentation is an early and characteristic event of apoptosis. Therefore we also examined UV-induced DNA fragmentation in human keratinocytes. UV-induced DNA fragmentation was substantially increased in keratinocytes by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitors LY294002, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) and wortmannin. PD169540 also signi"

An important function of reticuloendothelial macrophages is phagocytosis of senescent red blood cells. The iron liberated from heme is recycled for delivery to erythrocyte precursors for a new round of hemoglobin synthesis. The molecular mechanism by which recycled iron is released from macrophages remains unresolved. We have investigated the mechanism of macrophage iron efflux, focusing on the role of ceruloplasmin (Cp), a copper protein with a potent ferroxidase activity that converts Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the presence of molecular oxygen. As shown by others, Cp markedly increased iron binding to apotransferrin at acidic pH; however, the physiological significance of this finding is uncertain because little stimulation was observed at neutral pH. Introduction of a hypoxic atmosphere resulted in marked Cp-stimulated binding of iron to apotransferrin at physiological pH. The role of Cp in cellular iron release was examined in U937 monocytic cells induced to differentiate to the macrophage lineage. Cp added at its normal plasma concentration increased the rate of 55Fe release from U937 cells by about 250%. The stimulation was absolutely dependent on the presence of apotransferrin and hypoxia. Cp-stimulated iron release was confirmed in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Stimulation of iron release required an intracellular “labile iron pool” that was rapidly depleted in the presence of Cp and apotransferrin. Ferroxidase-mediated loading of iron into apotransferrin was critical for iron release because ferroxidase-deficient Cp was inactive and because holotransferrin could not substitute for apotransferrin. The extracellular iron concentration was critical as shown by inhibition of iron release by exogenous free iron, and marked enhancement of release by an iron chelator. Together these data show that Cp stimulates iron release from macrophages under hypoxic conditions by a ferroxidase-dependent mechanism, possibly involving generation of a negative iron gradient.

Reticuloendothelial macrophages have a central role in regulating normal iron homeostasis (1Knutson M. Wessling-Resnick M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 61-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Macrophages in bone marrow, liver, and spleen recognize and phagocytose senescent or damaged erythrocytes, and the heme iron is processed and returned to circulation for reutilization by red cell precursors during erythropoiesis (2Noyes W.D. Bothwell T.H. Finch C.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1960; 6: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Macrophages may also utilize iron to generate toxic reactive oxygen species as a defense mechanism against pathogens (3Alford C.E. King Jr., T.E. Campbell P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Macrophage iron release appears to be tightly regulated. The relative amount of iron released, compared with the amount shunted for storage as ferritin, depends on iron status and is increased during iron deficiency. The rate of macrophage iron release is also regulated by, or at least coupled to, the rate of erythropoiesis. The reticuloendothelial system accumulates iron during several pathological states including chronic inflammation and renal failure, indicating an inability of the macrophage to release iron normally.Understanding the regulation of macrophage iron release has been an area of intense investigation during the past three decades. Several fundamental issues remain unresolved including the intracellular form of released iron, its mechanism of transport through the plasma membrane, the form of the emerging iron, and the mechanism of iron delivery to apotransferrin (4Brittenham G.M.

The rapid autoxidation of iron under physiological conditions, particularly in the presence of apotransferrin (which itself may have ferroxidase activity), may eliminate the need for Cp-dependent catalysis to oxidize and load iron into apotransferrin (10Rydén L. Lontie R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. Vol. III. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 37-100Google Scholar, 11Bates G.W. Workman Jr., E.F. Schlabach M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 50: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Mareschal J.C. Rama R. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In fact, the rate of iron binding by apotransferrin is too fast to measure by usual kinetic techniques at pH 7, thus in vitro studies of Cp-mediated iron loading into apotransferrin are done under acidic conditions that slow the reaction, generally at pH 5.5 to 6.0 (13Johnson D.A. Osaki S. Frieden E. Clin. Chem. 1967; 13: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is also difficult to reconcile the gradient mechanism with the inverse relationship between plasma Cp concentration and transferrin iron saturation, for example, newborns have very high transferrin iron saturation and low Cp, whereas their mothers have the opposite condition (14Shokeir M.H. Clin. Biochem. 1972; 5: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Likewise, the marked elevation of plasma Cp during the anemia of inflammation, when reticuloendothelial cell iron stores are elevated, remains paradoxical (15Roeser H.P. Lee G.R. Cartwright G.E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1973; 142: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The requirement for apotransferrin in macrophage iron release in vitro is also controversial; several investigators have shown a lack of stimulation by apotransferrin (16Esparza I. Brock J.H. Br. J. Haematol. 1981; 49: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Saito K. Nishisato T. Grasso J.A. Aisen P. Br. J. Haematol. 1986; 62: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas others have found a stimulatory effect (18Rama R. Sánchez J. Octave J.-N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 968: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, under some circumstances, Cp may enhance iron uptake by cells, possibly by a trivalent cation transporter on the cell surface (19Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Attieh Z.K. Mukhopadhyay C.K. Seshadri V. Tripoulas N.A. Fox P.L. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 2001; 140: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The role of plasma Cp in iron release by macrophages has not been investigated experimentally, and studies from non-macrophage cells are inconsistent. Young et al. (22Young S.P. Fahmy M. Golding S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported a 40% stimulation of iron release from human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells by Cp in the presence of apotransferrin. The mechanism of stimulation was not specifically investigated in detail, and in view of the comparable stimulation of iron release by either apo- or holotransferrin, an important role of iron loading to transferrin is unlikely. In other studies, Cp increased iron release from iron-loaded HepG2 cells (23Richardson D.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 134: 454-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and from central nervous system astrocytes (24Jeong S.Y. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27144-27148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), but the mechanism underlying the stimulation was unclear because it occurred even in the absence of apotransferrin. Interestingly, astrocyte Cp is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked suggesting that both free and membrane-bound forms of Cp are involved in iron transport processes. Three other laboratories reported that Cp did not increase iron release (even in the presence of apotransferrin) from HepG2 or erythroleukemic K562 cells (19Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Attieh Z.K. Mukhopadhyay C.K. Seshadri V. Tripoulas N.A. Fox P.L. J. Biol.

Placenta. 2000; 21: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or glioblastoma BT325 cells (21Qian Z.M. Tsoi Y.K. Ke Y. Wong M.S. Exp. Brain Res. 2001; 140: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In this report we rigorously investigate the requirements for Cp stimulation of iron binding to apotransferrin and iron release from myeloid cells. We show that Cp markedly enhances iron release from macrophages only in the presence of apotransferrin and only under hypoxic conditions. Regarding the mechanism of Cp-stimulated macrophage iron release, we show that the iron source is the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP), that Cp ferroxidase activity is required, and that development of a negative iron gradient is an essential feature of iron release from these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Purified human Cp was obtained from Vital Products (Boynton Beach, FL) and Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and homogeneity was verified by an absorbance ratio (610 nm/280 nm) greater than 0.04. Integrity of the protein was established by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stain; intact, 132-kDa protein was the predominant form, and the primary degradation product was the 115-kDa protein present in human serum (26Ehrenwald E. Chisolm G.M. Fox P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Cp mass was determined by nephelometry by the Reference Laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and metal content was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Cp contained 6.3 ± 0.3 copper atoms per molecule, and the iron content was below the instrument detection level (i.e. <0.1 atoms per molecule). Human apotransferrin and human holotransferrin were obtained from Sigma, and the mass determined nephelometrically. The iron content of apo- and holotransferrin was 0.060 ± 0.002 and 2.03 ± 0.02 atoms per molecule, respectively; the copper content of the transferrin preparations was negligible (i.e. <0.001 atoms per molecule). RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was selected for cell experiments because it does not contain iron, copper, or ascorbic acid, a metal ion reducing agent (27Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique. Wiley-Liss, New York2000Google Scholar). Reduced glutathione, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ferrous ammonium sulfate, ferric chloride, bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid, phorbol myristoyl acetate (PMA), desferrioxamine, and all other reagents were from Sigma. 55FeCl3 (9.1 mm, 20 mCi/mg) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A 55Fe-NTA solution was prepared by incubating 55FeCl3 (9.1 mm) and NTA (45.5 mm) for 1 h. The resulting 55Fe-NTA solution was mixed at a 1:9 molar ratio with unlabeled iron-NTA (prepared similarly) in serum-free medium containing ascorbate (100 μm) so that the final concentration of 55Fe-NTA was 10 μm. Iron solutions were freshly prepared before each experiment.Determination of Iron Binding by Apotransferrin—Iron binding to apotransferrin was measured by a modification of the method of Osaki et al. (5Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ferrous ammonium sulfate was dissolved in glycine (0.1 mm) buffer at pH 3.0. Apotransferrin and Cp were dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium (without phenol red dye) containing 20 mm Hepes at pH 7.4. Apotransferrin was used at 55 μm, the upper limit of the normal range in adult serum, as described previously (5Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Johnson D.A. Osaki S. Frieden E. Clin. Chem. 1967; 13: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For most experiments, the solutions were brought to 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 by bubbling with a mixture of N2, CO2, and 21% O2 + 79% N2 at the appropriate ratio using a 3-channel gas controller and mixer. In some experiments the O2 or CO2 concentration was varied independently. The solutions were added to a plastic cuvette in a final volume of 1 ml. The cuvette was sealed with parafilm and transferrin-bound iron was measured as A 460 nm at 2-s intervals. The data were fitted to a hyperbola by non-linear least square optimization, and the initial rate was determined from the fitted parameters.Determination of 55Fe Release from U937 Cells—U937 cells were grown to a density of about 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells (7 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate) were differentiated toward the macrophage lineage by incubation for 16 h with PMA (15 ng/ml). To load the cells with iron, the media and non-adherent cells were aspirated, and the adherent cells were washed and incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. The cells were incubated with 55Fe-NTA (10 μm) in the same medium containing ascorbate (100 μm) for 3 h (or in some experiments, 24 h) in a hypoxia chamber (Pro-Ox, Reming, Redfield, NY). The chamber was maintained at 37 °C with an atmosphere regulated to contain 1% O2 using an oxygen controller (Pro-Ox model 110, Reming), and with the remainder occupied by a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% N2. Cell viability after 3 and 24 h of hypoxia and normoxia was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion; no significant differences in viability were observed and cell viability was greater than 95% under all conditions. The medium was aspirated and the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μm EDTA to remove iron non-specifically bound to the cell surface, and twice with ice-cold PBS. 55Fe-NTA uptake was measured in triplicate wells by lysis in 20% Nonidet P-40 followed by liquid scintillation counting. To measure 55Fe release, test reagents (apotransferrin, Cp) were dissolved in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 mm Hepes at pH 7.4, and the solutions exhaustively bubbled with gases at the appropriate O2 and CO2 concentrations before addition (0.5 ml) to cells. The cells were placed in the hypoxia chamber for a 15-min iron release interval (unless otherwise noted). The medium was collected, centrifuged to remove suspended cells and cell debris, and the supernatant was collected and counted by liquid scintillation.Preparation of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages—C57BL/6J mice were injected with 0.5 ml of thioglycollate medium into the peritoneum. After 72 h, the mice were sacrificed and the peritoneum was injected with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. The peritoneal lavage was removed and the cells were centrifuged (1,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended (50,000 cells per well in a 12-well plate) in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Non-adherent cells were removed by rinsing with PBS.Determination of the Intracellular Labile Iron Pool by Quenching of Calcein Fluorescence—The intracellular LIP was determined by an assay based on quenching of calcein fluorescence by bound iron (28Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik Z.I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). PMA-treated U937 cells were iron-loaded by incubating for 3 or 24 h with unlabeled Fe-NTA (10 μm) and ascorbate (100 μm) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The entire experiment was done in a hypoxic atmosphere consisting of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing EDTA (100 μm) and then twice with ice-cold PBS. Fresh RPMI 1640 medium was replaced and the iron-loaded cells were permitted to release iron for 15 min in the presence of various test agents. The cultures were then washed and incubated with calcein (0.5 μm) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (without phenol red) for 10 min. The cells were washed and observed in an inverted fluorescent microscope, and the mean cellular fluorescence intensity (488 nm excitation/517 nm emission) in 15 or more cells was quantitated (Image Pro Plus). To determine the LIP size before the iron release period, one set of wells was examined immediately after calcein treatment. To provide a no-iron control, one set of wells for each treatment condition was incubated for 30 min with desferrioxamine (100 μm) to chelate all free and calcein-bound iron. The difference in intensity between a given cell treatment and cells treated with desferrioxamine gives a relative measure of the LIP.Preparation of Apo-Cp by Reductive Copper Chelation and Reconstitution of Holo-Cp—Apo-Cp was prepared by removal of copper by complexing with cyanide under reducing conditions as described by Musci et al. (29Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cp was dialyzed at 4 °C against sodium acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 5.9) containing ascorbate (10 mm) under anaerobic conditions achieved by continuous bubbling with N2 gas. Dialysis was continued until the “blue” coppers were reduced as shown by complete sample decolorization. Potassium cyanide (50 mm) was added and the dialysis continued for 5 h. The copper-cyanide complex and excess cyanide were removed by dialysis against sodium acetate (100 mm) containing cysteine (1 mm), and then by an overnight dialysis against buffer containing KCl (150 mm) and MOPS (50 mm, pH 7.0). Holo-Cp was reconstituted from apo-Cp as described (29Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A Cu2+-reduced glutathione complex was prepared immediately before use by addition of copper sulfate (0.1 mm) to reduced glutathione (0.3 mm) in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.0) containing ascorbate (100 μm). A 7-fold molar excess of the Cu2+-reduced glutathione complex was added to apo-Cp in KCl (150 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), and MOPS (50 mm, pH 7.0) for 4 h. Unbound copper was removed by overnight dialysis against PBS.RESULTSCp Increases Iron Binding to Apotransferrin under Hypoxic Conditions—Previous studies have shown that Cp stimulated iron binding to apotransferrin under non-physiological, acidic conditions (pH 5.5 to 6.0) (5Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Johnson D.A. Osaki S. Frieden E. Clin. Chem. 1967; 13: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We verified this observation and found that Cp increased the initial rate of binding of ferrous iron to apotransferrin in acetate-buffered solution at pH 6.0 by about 10-fold (Fig. 1A). A similar experiment over a range of pH showed that the stimulation of iron binding to apotransferrin by Cp decreased as the pH increased, and the stimulation at pH 7.4 was less than 20% (Fig. 1B). Essentially identical results were observed when acetate buffer was replaced with RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 20 mm Hepes (not shown). The decrease in the apparent stimulatory activity of Cp was most likely because of the high rate of iron autoxidation at physiological pH.To minimize iron autoxidation, and to replicate tissue conditions, iron binding to apotransferrin was measured at pH 7.4 under conditions of varying degrees of hypoxia. The gas phase included 5% CO2 because maximal iron binding to apotransferrin requires HCO3- anion, which serves as a bridging ligand between the protein and the iron, and completes the coordination requirements of the metal ion (30Aisen P. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. Vänngård T. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2484-2490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of iron binding to apotransferrin was essentially linear with respect to O2 concentration in the absence of Cp (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the rate of iron binding to apotransferrin in the presence of Cp increased dramatically as the O2 level was increased from 0 to 1% of the total applied gas. The rate of iron binding did not increase further even at an atmospheric O2 level of 21%. The net stimulation of iron binding to apotransferrin by Cp was about 10–15-fold at low O2 (1% or less), whereas the stimulation was 10–20% under normoxic conditions. To determine whether HCO3- anion influenced the stimulatory activity of Cp, an experiment was done in which the CO2 level was varied from 0 to 5% while the O2 level was maintained at 1%. Inclusion of 20 mm Hepes in the medium maintained the pH to within 0.05 units at all CO2 levels. Cp-independent and -dependent iron binding to apotransferrin both had an absolute requirement for CO2. Cp-dependent iron binding was halfmaximal at about 2% CO2 and near-maximal at about 5% CO2 (Fig. 2B). The dependence of iron binding on Cp concentration was determined under optimal conditions, i.e. 1% O2, 5% CO2, and pH 7.4. The initial rate of iron binding to apotransferrin increased almost linearly as Cp was increased up to its physiological plasma concentration of 300 μg/ml (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Influence of O2 and CO2 levels on Cp-stimulated binding of iron to apotransferrin. A, ferrous ammonium sulfate (60 μm) was added to apotransferrin (55 μm) in the presence (•) or absence (○) of Cp (120 μg/ml) in phenol red-free, RPMI 1640 medium at pH 7.4. The O2 level in the applied gas was varied from 0 to 21% while maintaining CO2 at a constant 5% level, the remainder was made up with N2. The initial rate of iron binding to apotransferrin was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, iron binding to apotransferrin was measured as in A except that CO2 levels were varied while maintaining a constant 1% level of O2, the remainder was N2. C, iron loading into apotransferrin was measured as a function of Cp concentration in 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cp Enhances Iron Release from Monocytic Cells—We investigated the influence of Cp on iron release from monocytic cells using the human promonocytic U937 cell line pretreated with PMA to induce differentiation toward a macrophage phenotype. Under hypoxic conditions, and in the presence of apotransferrin, a linear increase in cellular iron release was observed up to 300 μg/ml Cp, the mean plasma concentration in healthy adults (Fig. 3A). At its physiological plasma concentration, Cp stimulated iron release by almost 2.5-fold, and by about 3.5-fold at a concentration of 600 μg/ml, the extreme pathophysiological plasma concentration during a severe acute phase response. The small deviation from linearity when the concentration was increased to 600 μg/ml was probably not because of saturation of any Cp-mediated process (for example, binding to cell surface receptors or apotransferrin), but rather because of the fact that even in the short, 5-min release period used here, about 85% of the pre-loaded 55Fe-NTA was released from the cells (Fig. 3B). A control experiment showed that apotransferrin was required for the stimulation of iron release because Cp by itself had no significant influence on release from cells (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Stimulation of iron release from U937 monocytic cells by Cp. A, U937 cells (1 × 106 cells per well) in RPMI 1640 medium were incubated with PMA (15 ng/ml) for 16 h to induce differentiation toward the macrophage phenotype. The cells were iron-loaded by incubation with 55Fe-NTA (10 nmol) for 3 h in a hypoxic atmosphere maintained at 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. Cellular iron release was measured as a function of Cp concentration (○) in the presence of apotransferrin (55 μm) and in the same hypoxic atmosphere. After a 5-min release interval, the medium was collected (cells centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 rpm) and 55Fe determined by liquid scintillation counting and expressed as picomole/well. B, total 55Fe taken up by the cells during the uptake phase is indicated (open bar). As controls, iron release was measured in the presence of medium alone or in the presence of Cp (300 μg/ml) in the absence of apotransferrin (striped bars). C, iron release from U937 cells was measured after a 15-min release interval as a function of O2 level balanced by a gas mixture containing 5% CO2 and 95% N2 in the presence of apotransferrin (55 μm), and in the presence (•) or absence (○) of Cp (120 μg/ml). Iron release was measured as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We investigated the effect of O2 on basal and Cp-stimulated iron release from U937 cells. In the absence of Cp, iron release was slow, about 20 pmol/well, increasing gradually to more than 50 pmol/well at atmospheric O2 (Fig. 3C). Cp markedly stimulated iron release, particularly at low O2 levels. At 0.1 or 1% O2, Cp (at 120 μg/ml) increased cellular iron release by about 50 to 75% (Fig. 3C). The rate of iron release in the presence of Cp was maximal at 1% O2, and did not change as O2 was increased to 21%. These results were very nearly parallel to the Cp-mediated stimulation of iron binding to ap"
https://openalex.org/W2143010594,"Two thioredoxins have been described in Escherichia coli, TrxA and Trx2. Both thioredoxins are capable of reducing disulfide bonds using a conserved pair of cysteine residues present in a WCGPC motif. A number of unique structural and regulatory features distinguish the Trx2 subfamily from the much larger TrxA family. The Trx2 subfamily has an additional N-terminal domain of ± 30 residues, which contains two additional conserved CXXC motifs. Moreover, the gene coding for Trx2 is under control of the oxidative stress transcription factor OxyR in E. coli. This suggests that Trx2 may play a role in the cellular defense against oxidative stress. We show here that Trx2 contains zinc in a 1:1 stoichiometry, making it the first identified zinc-binding thioredoxin. The zinc atom is coordinated by the four cysteines of the two N-terminal CXXC motifs. The zinc center of Trx2 binds zinc with a very high affinity (Ka of >1018m–1). We show that in vitro oxidation of the zinc binding cysteines by H2O2 releases the zinc and induces a conformational change. The zinc-free protein conserves its reductase activity. Altogether, our results suggest that the zinc center might play the role of a redox switch, changing a yet to be identified activity.

Thioredoxins are small redox proteins present in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. All thioredoxins share a similar three-dimensional structure and possess a conserved WCGPC catalytic motif. The main function of thioredoxins is to reduce disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues of cytoplasmically localized proteins. These disulfides can occur either as part of a catalytic cycle (e.g. ribonucleotide reductase) or be caused by reactive oxygen species (1Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the course of the disulfide exchange reaction, the two catalytic cysteine residues of the WCGPC motif of thioredoxins are oxidized. They are then converted back to the reduced form by thioredoxin reductase, which draws electrons from NADPH (2Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Two thioredoxins have been described in Escherichia coli (1Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev.

Although the role of TrxA is thought to be central in controlling the redox equilibrium of the cytoplasm, trxA – strains do not have any apparent growth phenotype (1Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev.

Aslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) but requires overexpression to reduce DsbD (9Ritz D. Patel H. Doan B. Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For the majority of activities tested so far, Trx2 seems equivalent to TrxA. Trx2 has two striking characteristics that distinguish it from TrxA and suggest that it has a specific role to play. Trx2 contains an additional N-terminal domain of 32 residues. Interestingly, two CXXC motifs are present in this domain. A CXXC motif is present at the active site of thioredoxin-related proteins where it serves in thio-disulfide exchange. However, most of these CXXC motifs, even in very divergent thioredoxin-like proteins, also share a residue upstream the first cysteine; this residue is lacking in both CXXC motifs found in the N terminus of Trx2, leading to consider other possible roles for these CXXC motifs. CXXC are also found in metal-binding proteins including those that interact with copper, cadmium, iron, or zinc (10Romero-Isart N. Vasak M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 88: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These metals may play either structural or catalytic roles. For instance, in the case of the E. coli chaperone Hsp33, two adjacent CXC and CXXC motifs have been identified to coordinate zinc (11Graf P.C. Jakob U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1624-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, the zinc binding motif plays the role of a redox switch, leading to changes in protein conformation and activity upon exposure of Hsp33 to oxidative stress conditions. Under normal conditions, Hsp33 binds zinc via 4 reduced cysteine residues present in a CXC(27–32)CXXC motif (12Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The reduced protein is inactive. Active oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals oxidize the zinc binding cysteines. This leads to zinc release and conformational changes, which results in the dimerization of Hsp33 and the activation of its chaperone function (12Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The second interesting feature of Trx2 is its transcriptional regulation. The expression of Trx2 is under the control of the oxidative stress transcription factor OxyR. Whereas Trx2 has been shown to be 5-fold less abundant than TrxA under normal conditions (6Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), its concentration increases about 20-fold upon exposure of cells to oxidative stress (9Ritz D. Patel H. Doan B. Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2505-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Trx2 becomes even more abundant than TrxA. OxyR is a transcription factor that is activated during oxidative stress and induces the expression of several antioxidant genes including peroxidases (e.g. AhpCF, KatG, Tpx) and reducing proteins such as glutaredoxin 1 and glutathione reductase (14Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 15Pomposiello P.J. Demple B. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 109-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The control of Trx2 expression by OxyR suggests that Trx2 plays a specific role in response to oxidative stress, although trxC – strains do not show altered sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (9Ritz D. Patel H. Doan B. Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2505-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Trx2 contains an N-terminal zinc center, which is constituted by the four cysteines of the two additional CXXC motifs. Trx2 binds zinc with a very high affinity. Exposure of Trx2 to oxidative stress leads to the reversible oxidation of the zinc center and to the release of zinc. We show that this oxidation induces major conformational changes in the protein. Cloning—E. coli genomic DNA was amplified with Pfu polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR-amplified product was purified and cloned into a pET11a plasmid. The resulting plasmid pJFC67 was verified by sequence analysis and then introduced into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Expression and Purification of E. coli Trx2—BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmid pJFC67 were grown aerobically in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C until an OD600 of 0.8 was reached. Isopropylthiogalactoside (0.5 mm) and ZnCl2 (0.8 mm) were added and shaking was continued for 5 h to allow protein expression. Cultures were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm and 4 °C for 20 min. From this point on, all steps were performed at 4 °C. Bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0), and cells were disrupted by 2 passes through a French Press cell at 1200 PSI. The cell lysate was then centrifuged for 40 min (20,000 × g at 4 °C) and the resulting supernatant (≈25 ml) was diluted 3-fold with buffer A and applied onto a Q-Sepharose column (1.6 × 10 cm). The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A, and proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–400 mm in 250 ml of buffer A). The fractions containing Trx2 were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Amicon cell (YM-10 membrane), and loaded onto a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to perform a buffer exchange with buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0). The protein was then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with buffer B, and the protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–400 mm in 250 ml of buffer B). The fractions containing Trx2 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Amicon cell (YM-10 membrane). The Trx2 preparation was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.6 × 50 cm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was equilibrated in buffer B containing 200 mm KCl. The fractions containing Trx2 were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon cell (YM-10 membrane), and desalted using a PD10 column equilibrated with buffer B. The pure protein was stored in buffer B at –80 °C. The concentration of Trx2 was calculated using an extinction coefficient ϵ280 of 17,060 m–1 cm–1. Metal Analysis—For the determination of the metal content in Trx2, 2 different preparations of Trx2 (50 μm each) were separated from exogenous metals by gel filtration using a PD10 column. The PD10 columns were equilibrated with metal-free H2O prepared by incubation with Chelex 100 resin (BioRad). The samples were then analyzed using a Finnigan Element inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometer (ICP-HRMS), located in the Keck Elemental Geochemistry Laboratory of the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. The sample was concentrated 2-fold by ultrafiltration using a centricon (Millipore). The metal content of the protein-containing retentate was compared with that of the flow-through. Zinc, nickel, iron, cobalt, and manganese concentrations were measured. As additional controls, two buffer samples were analyzed using the same procedure. PAR-PMPS Assay—Zinc concentrations were determined using the zinc-complexing reagent PAR (4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol). PAR binds zinc to form a Zn(PAR)2 complex, which absorbs strongly at 500 nm (ϵ = 66,000 m–1 cm–1 in Hepes, pH 7.0). To determine the amount of zinc bound to the protein, p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid (PMPS) was added to release zinc from the zinc center and allow the formation of the Zn(PAR)2 complex. PMPS forms mercaptide bonds with thiols using the following reaction mechanism R-HgOH + P-SH → R-Hg-S-p + H2O where the R stands for the phenylsulfonic acid group of PMPS and the P stands for a protein. This reaction mechanism proceeds as a substitution reaction whereby the hydroxyl anion is displaced by the thiol-containing protein to form a mercuric sulfide derivative of the protein (R-Hg-S-P). If the thiols on the protein are involved in coordinating a metal such as zinc, this covalent modification leads to the release of the zinc. To determine the number of cysteines involved in zinc binding, defined amounts of PMPS were added and the changes in A 500 were recorded according to Jakob et al. (12Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The Ka of zinc binding was determined using competition experiments as previously described (12Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Three Different Redox Forms of Trx2—Freshly purified Trx2 was saturated with zinc and the 6 cysteines were in the reduced form (Trx26cysred) as determined using 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) as described (2Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). However, following purification, a slow oxidation of the two catalytic cysteines was observed over time. When needed, these two cysteines were reduced by incubation of Trx2 with 5 mm DTT for 30 min at 25 °C. 500 μl of the protein solution was then loaded onto a gel filtration column (NAP5, Amersham Biosciences) and Trx2 was eluted with 700 μl of the appropriate buffer. To prepare a completely oxidized Trx2 (Trx26cysox), the protein was incubated with a 40-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide at 43 °C for 2 h. Excess H2O2 was removed by gel filtration. The thiol content of the preparation was measured using DTNB. To prepare zinc-saturated Trx2 with both catalytic cysteines oxidized (Trx2catcysox), the protein was incubated with a 10-fold excess of GSSG for 10 min at 4 °C and gel filtrated as explained above. After the gel filtration, the zinc content was determined using the PAR-PMPS assay and the oxidation of the two catalytic cysteines was analyzed using HPLC. The oxidized (Trx22catcysox) and reduced forms of Trx2 (Trx26cysred) were separated on a C18 column (Phenomenex Prime-sphere, 250 × 4.60 mm) using a linear aqueous 39–51% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 24 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance was recorded at 214 and 280 nm. The zinc center of Trx2 is very stable and freshly purified Trx2 was saturated with zinc. However, after multiple freezing/thawing cycles, a slow decrease of the zinc content of the purified protein could be observed. When required, zinc-saturated Trx2 was prepared by incubating 50 μm Trx2 with 200 μm Zn2+ and 2 mm DTT at 25 °C for 15 min. The protein was then purified away from the unbound zinc by gel filtration. Preparation of Reduced, Zinc-free Trx2—Zinc-free Trx2 was prepared by incubating Trx2 (50 μm) with 2 mm hydrogen peroxide at 43 °C. After 2 h, 5 mm EDTA was added, and the preparation was applied onto a gel filtration column (NAP-5 column) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The zinc-free oxidized protein was then reduced with 2 mm DTT and loaded onto a second NAP-5 column equilibrated with the same buffer. Both buffer and DTT solution had been depleted from their metals by incubation with Chelex resin. After this treatment, Trx2 was reduced and contained less than 5% zinc. Proteolytic Digestion—The protease sensitivity of reduced Trx2 (Trx26cysred) was compared with that of oxidized Trx2 (Trx26cysox) by incubating 35 μm of each protein preparation with 3 μg of trypsin at 23 °C in 100 μl of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. At different time points, aliquots were taken and the tryptic digestion was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were then applied on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. CD Analysis—Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. 30 μm of Trx26cysred or Trx26cysox in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 was used (1-mm cuvettes). TrxB-mediated Reduction of Trx2—For the reduction of oxidized Trx2 (Trx26cysox) by TrxB, 10 to 20 μm of Trx2 were incubated at 30 °C with 50 μm NADPH and 10 nm TrxB in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8. The reduction was followed by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm using a Beckman DU600 spectrophotometer. At different time points, aliquots were taken for AMS trapping. AMS Trapping—AMS is a reagent that covalently reacts with free thiol groups, adding a 490 Da group. This leads to a major mobility shift respective of modified protein in SDS-PAGE gels. For AMS trapping, samples containing 25–75 μg of Trx2 were precipitated with 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were washed with acetone, dried, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm AMS, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Insulin Reduction Assay—Zinc-free or zinc-containing reduced Trx2 (1 μm) was incubated with 130 μm insulin and 0.6 mm DTT in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 at 25 °C. Precipitation of reduced insulin was monitored at 650 nm. Before the reaction, all reagents were depleted of their metals by incubation with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad). Sequence Analysis—One of the most striking differences between TrxA and Trx2 is the presence of an N-terminal domain containing two additional CXXC motifs arranged in the sequence CTHCX 16CGRC. These 2 cysteine motifs are present in addition to the CGPC active site motif that is conserved in all thioredoxins. To clearly distinguish between these three different CXXC motifs, we designated the N-terminal CTHC motif as CXXCn1, CGRC as CXXCn2 and the active site CGPC motif as CXXCactive. At the time of the identification of Trx2 (6Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the two additional cysteine motifs CXXCn1 and CXXCn2 were only found in one other thioredoxin from Corynebacteryum nephridii. However, only three bacterial genomes had been completely sequenced at that time, which prevented a more general sequence analysis. We used the BLAST algorithm to search for Trx2 homologues in finished and unfinished eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi). We found more than 20 other bacterial thioredoxins that contain a homologous amino-terminal domain (Fig. 1). In all these thioredoxins, the two additional CXXCn1 and CXXCn2 motifs are strictly conserved, strongly suggesting that these motifs are important for Trx2 function and/or regulation. In addition to these four cysteine residues, an asparagine found at position 12 of the E. coli Trx2 and an arginine found at position 13 are also absolutely conserved in Trx2 homologues. Noteworthy, the N-terminal domain of Trx2 including the CXXCn1 and CXXCn2 sequences is homologous to the N-terminal domain of the PqiA family of paraquat-inducible proteins (pfam04403.2). This is a family of unknown function membrane proteins, whose expression is under SoxR control (16Koh Y.S. Roe J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2673-2678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In analogy to OxyR, which is activated by oxidative stress, SoxR is a transcription factor that is activated under superoxide stress conditions (15Pomposiello P.J. Demple B. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 109-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Apart from the N-terminal domain, paraquatinducible proteins share no homology with thioredoxins. Trx2 Purification and Metal Analysis—The conservation of the two CXXCn1,n2 motifs suggested that they might play a role in Trx2 function, possibly either by conferring thiol-disulfide exchange reactions or by coordinating metals. To help determine the role of these conserved cysteines, we purified Trx2 to homogeneity using classical chromatography techniques. We decided against using His-tagged Trx2 because histidines are known to bind a number of different metals, which could interfere with the meaningful determination of the metal content of Trx2. After two anion exchange chromatography steps and one size exclusion chromatography, Trx2 was >95% pure (not shown). The average yield was ≈10 mg of pure Trx2 from 1 liter of culture. At the end of the purification, all cysteines of the protein were in the reduced state as determined using DTNB as described (2Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). To study the metal content of the protein, Trx2 (50 μm) was first separated from free metals by gel filtration against metalfree buffer and was then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometry (ICP-HRMS). We found that zinc is present in the protein in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry (1.03 zinc/protein). No other metals were detected in the protein preparation. The Four Cysteines Present in the N-terminal Domain of Trx2 Coordinate Zinc—Cysteines and histidines are frequently involved in zinc coordination. Trx2 contains 6 cysteine residues, 4 in the N-terminal domain and 2 in the thioredoxin domain, all of which are conserved. In addition, Trx2 contains two histidine residues, which both are located in the N-terminal domain but are not well conserved. To determine if and how many cysteine residues are involved in zinc binding, we used the PAR/PMPS assay (17Zhou Z.S. Peariso K. Penner-Hahn J.E. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15915-15926Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PAR is a dye that chelates zinc to form a red Zn(PAR)2 complex. This complex strongly absorbs at 500 nm and its formation can therefore be easily monitored. However, the affinity of PAR for zinc is lower than the affinity of many cysteine coordinating zinc centers (Ka = 2 × 1012m–1). Therefore, tightly bound zinc cannot be extracted by PAR. To be able to detect zinc bound to high affinity thiol centers, thiol-modifying reagents such as PMPS are used. PMPS reacts stoichiometrically with reduced cysteines to form mercaptide-thiol bonds using the following reaction mechanism R-HgOH + P-SH → R-Hg-S-p + H2O where the R stands for the phenylsulfonic acid group of PMPS and the P stands for a protein. If the thiols on the protein are involved in coordinating a metal such as a zinc, this covalent modification leads to the release of the zinc. The modification of the cysteine causes zinc release which immediately leads to the formation of the red Zn(PAR)2 complex. When freshly purified Trx2 was incubated with PAR, we did not observe a significant increase in A 500, indicating that PAR was unable to extract the zinc from the protein. Stepwise additions of a PMPS stock solution led to a progressive increase in A 500. When all 6 cysteines of Trx2 were titrated with PMPS, no further increase was observed (Fig. 2A). This indicated that all 6 reduced cysteines had to be modified by PMPS to completely release zinc. Noteworthy, a short lag phase was observed at the beginning of the titration, suggesting that at least one, possibly two, cysteine residues are more accessible to the PMPS titration solution than the zinc coordinating cysteines. These cysteines appear to be modified first by PMPS before the zinc coordinating cysteines were modified. To evaluate whether zinc is coordinated by the 4 N-terminal cysteines, Trx2 whose active site cysteines were oxidized (Trx22catcysox) was prepared by a short incubation with oxidized glutathione, allowing the transfer of one disulfide bond from oxidized glutathione to Trx2 via the following mechanism: Trx2(SH)2 + GSSG → Trx2S2 + 2GSH. When the four cysteines in the N-terminal domain were kept in the reduced state while both active site cysteines were oxidized, the titration of 4 thiol groups was sufficient to allow the complete zinc release (Fig. 2A). Importantly, disulfide bond formation in the active site did not change the total amount of zinc bound to the protein. These results suggested that zinc is coordinated by presumably all 4 cysteines in the N-terminal domain of Trx2 and that the two active site cysteines are not involved in zinc coordination. As shown in Fig. 2B, addition of DTT, which reduces the mercaptide-thiol bonds between PMPS and the cysteines in Trx2, allows Trx2 to quickly re-extract the zinc from the Zn-(PAR)2 complex, indicating that the zinc center can be reformed readily in vitro. Zinc is usually coordinated by four ligands. We therefore suggest that all four cysteines, which are highly conserved in the N-terminal domain, are involved in zinc coordination. Affinity Constant of Trx2 for Zn—A straightforward approach to determine the binding constant (Ka) of a protein for metals is to incubate the metal-containing protein with specific chelators whose binding constants are known. At equilibrium, the following Equation 1 applies (12Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), Ka(Trx2)=Ka(chelator)×[Trx2:Zn]×(chelatorfree][chelator:Zn]×[Trx2free](Eq. 1) where [Trx2:Zn] and [chelator:Zn] are the concentrations of zinc-containing Trx2 and zinc-bound chelator, respectively. We explored the use of two different zinc chelators, EDTA and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridyl-methyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). EDTA was not useful as a chelator because we found that EDTA binds to the Trx2-holoprotein to form a [Trx2-Zn-EDTA] complex (data not shown). We, therefore, used the metal chelator TPEN, which has a very high binding constant for zinc (Ka = 1016m–1). Zinc-saturated Trx2 (40 μmol; 1 Zn/molecule) was incubated with increasing concentrations of TPEN and allowed to equilibrate for 18 h. The samples were then gel filtrated against metal-free buffer to separate the protein from zinc-free and zinc-complexed TPEN. After this step, the protein concentration in the different samples was ∼10 μm. The amount of zinc, which remained bound to the protein via its 4 conserved cysteines after the incubation, was determined using the PAR/PMPS assay. As shown in Fig. 3, not even millimolar concentrations of TPEN could dissociate more than 60% of the zinc bound to 40 μm Trx2, showing that the zinc binding constant of Trx2 is even higher than that of TPEN. Using Equation 1, we determined the binding constant of Trx2 for zinc to be higher than 1018 at 23 °C and pH 7.0. Zinc Is Released upon Oxidation—Several zinc-binding proteins have been shown to release zinc upon oxidation. A recently reported example is the chaperone Hsp33 of E. coli. Under physiological conditions, Hsp33 is reduced and all 4 conserved cysteines are involved in the high affinity binding (Ka = 2.5 × 1017m–1) of zinc. Upon exposure of Hsp33 to oxidative stress (e.g. H2O2), however, 2 intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed and the zinc is released; this turns on the chaperone activity of the protein (13Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To test whether the zinc center of Trx2 is also oxidation sensitive, we incubated Trx2 with hydrogen peroxide. At different time points, aliquots were taken and the amount of zinc present in solution was determined using the PAR assay. To monitor the thiol/disulfide status of Trx2, AMS trapping experiments were performed in parallel. AMS is a 490 Da"
https://openalex.org/W2151006652,"The cannabinoid analog “abnormal cannabidiol” (abn-cbd) causes endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat isolated mesenteric arteries through a G protein-coupled receptor distinct from CB1 or CB2. We examined the actions of abn-cbd on the electrophysiology of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), using the whole cell version of the patch clamp technique. Voltage steps produced noninactivating outward currents, which were abolished by iberiotoxin or by chelation of intracellular calcium. The presence of a BKCa channel in HUVEC was documented by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Abn-cbd concentration dependently potentiated the outward current produced by a single voltage step. This potentiation was abolished by the cannabidiol analog O-1918 or by pertussis toxin but was unaffected by CB1 or CB2 antagonists. HU-210, a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist, had no effect on the outward current. Clamping [Ca2+]i did not prevent abn-cbd-induced increases in outward current. cGMP potentiated the outward current, and abn-cbd increased the cellular levels of cGMP. The increase in outward current produced by abn-cbd was blocked by KT-5823, an inhibitor of protein kinase G, or 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ), an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase. We conclude that a Ca2+-activated K+ current in HUVEC is potentiated by activation of a Gi/Go-coupled receptor distinct from CB1 or CB2, which signals through cGMP and protein kinase G to increase channel availability or the sensitivity of the channel to voltage and/or Ca2+. Because iberiotoxin also inhibited abn-cbd-induced relaxation of intact, but not of endothelium-denuded, rat mesenteric artery segments, modulation of endothelial BKCa channels may underlie the mesenteric vasodilator action of abn-cbd.

The marijuana plant contains more than 60 chemical substances of which Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol is the main psycho-active ingredient (1Gaoni Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1646-1647Crossref Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol produces many of its effects by activating receptors throughout the body. To date, two cannabinoid receptors have been cloned that belong to the superfamily of Gi/Go protein-coupled receptors. The CB1 receptor is expressed primarily in the brain (2Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I. Nature. 1990; 346: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar) but also in peripheral tissues (3Ishac E.J.N. Jiang L. Lake K.D. Varga K. Abood M.E. Kunos G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), whereas the CB2 receptor is expressed in immune cells (4Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4150) Google Scholar). More recently, a number of endogenous cannabinoid ligands have been identified that include, but are not limited to, anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (5Mechoulam R. Fride E. Di Marzo V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 359: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In addition to displaying well described neurobehavioral effects (6Dewey W.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1986; 38: 151-178PubMed Google Scholar), cannabinoid receptor agonists elicit prolonged hypotension and bradycardia (7Vollmer R.R. Cavero I. Ertel R.J. Solomon T.A. Buckley J.P. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1974; 26: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These effects are mediated by the CB1 receptor as shown by the use of the selective CB1 antagonist SR141716 (8Varga K. Lake K. Martin B.R. Kunos G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 278: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), or CB1 receptor-deficient mice (9Ledent C. Valverde O. Cossu G. Petitet F. Aubert J.F.

However, anandamide elicits prolonged vasodilation in the rat isolated mesenteric arterial bed, which, although partially sensitive to blockade by SR141716, is not mimicked by potent CB1/CB2 agonists (11Wagner J.A. Varga K. Járai Z. Kunos G. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 429-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and persists in mice deficient in CB1 and CB2 receptors (10Járai Z. Wagner J.A. Varga K. Lake K.D. Compton D.R. Martin B.R. Zimmer A.M. Bonner T.I. Buckley N.E. Mezey E. Razdan R.K. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14136-14141Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of an as yet undefined site of action. Abnormal cannabidiol (abn-cbd), 1The abbreviations used are: abn-cbd, abnormal cannabidiol; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; ICS, intracellular solution; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; PTX, pertussis toxin; ODQ, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one. a structural analog of the behaviorally inactive marijuana constituent cannabidiol, had been reported to lack behavioral effects but to cause profound hypotension in dogs (12Adams M.D. Earnhardt J.T. Martin B.R. Harris L.S. Dewey W.L. Razdan R.K. Experientia. 1977; 33: 1204-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Abn-cbd elicits endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the isolated mesenteric arterial bed of the rat and mouse, including mice lacking both CB1 and CB2 receptors (10Járai Z. Wagner J.A. Varga K. Lake K.D. Compton D.R. Martin B.R. Zimmer A.M. Bonner T.I. Buckley N.E. Mezey E. Razdan R.K. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14136-14141Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). More recently, a study of the responses of isolated segments of rat mesenteric arteries indicated that the endothelium dependent vasorelaxing effect of both anandamide and abd-cbd could be inhibited by another structural analog of cannabidiol, O-1918 (13Offertáler L. Mo F-M. Bátkai S. Liu J. Begg M. Razdan R.K. Martin B.R. Bukoski R.D. Kunos G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), as well as by pertussis toxin (13Offertáler L. Mo F-M. Bátkai S. Liu J. Begg M. Razdan R.K. Martin B.R. Bukoski R.D.

J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2046-H2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Vanilloid VR1 receptors, which mediate the endothelium-independent component of the vasodilator effect of anandamide (15Mukhopadhyay S. Chapnick B.M. Howlett A.C. Am. J.

Nature. 1999; 400: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar), do not have a role in this endothelium-dependent vasodilator response (10Járai Z. Wagner J.A. Varga K. Lake K.D. Compton D.R. Martin B.R. Zimmer A.M. Bonner T.I. Buckley N.E. Mezey E. Razdan R.K. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14136-14141Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 13Offertáler L. Mo F-M. Bátkai S. Liu J. Begg M. Razdan R.K. Martin B.R. Bukoski R.D. Kunos G. Mol.

Chapnick B.M. Howlett A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2046-H2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This has led us to postulate the existence of a novel, endothelial cannabinoid receptor coupled to Gi/Go, for which abn-cbd is a selective agonist and O-1918 is a silent antagonist (13Offertáler L. Mo F-M. Bátkai S. Liu J. Begg M. Razdan R.K. Martin B.R. Bukoski R.D. Kunos G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The mesenteric vasorelaxation produced by abn-cbd is independent of nitric oxide, but it is inhibited by charybdotoxin (13Offertáler L. Mo F-M. Bátkai S. Liu J. Begg M. Razdan R.K. Martin B.R. Bukoski R.D. Kunos G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 14Ho W.S.V. Hiley C.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 1320-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or iberiotoxin (14Ho W.S.V. Hiley C.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 1320-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of a Ca2+-activated K+ channel. The involvement of Ca2+-activated K+ channels in vasodilation has also been identified in rat coronary (17Price J.M. Hellermann A. Life Sci. 1997; 61: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and mesenteric arteries (18Andriantsitohaina R. Lagaud G.J. Andre A. Muller B. Stoclet J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1223-H1231PubMed Google Scholar). These latter studies have suggested that cGMP may act as the second messenger in this vasodilatory response either by acting directly on the Ca2+-activated K+ channel (17Price J.M. Hellermann A. Life Sci. 1997; 61: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or through the activation of protein kinase G (18Andriantsitohaina R. Lagaud G.J. Andre A. Muller B. Stoclet J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1223-H1231PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+-activated K+ currents in endothelial cells can be studied using the whole cell patch clamp technique (19Kestler H.A. Janko S. Haussler U. Muche R. Hombach V. Hoher M. Wiecha J. Res. Exp. Med. 1998; 198: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In an attempt to clarify the signaling by this putative endothelial cannabinoid receptor and its coupling to ion channels, we investigated the electrophysiological effects of abn-cbd in primary cultured human vascular endothelial cells. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were from the American Type Culture Collection (Arlington, VA) and maintained in primary culture as described (20Liu J. Gao B. Mirshahi F. Sanyal A.J. Khanolkar A.D. Makriyannis A. Kunos G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated onto 35-mm2 plastic culture dishes and maintained in EGM-2 BulletKit medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Plated cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h, at which point the medium was replaced by the extracellular solution (150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH). The cells underwent no more than six passages before use. Patch Clamp—Glass pipettes were made using TW150F-4 capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), backfilled with intracellular solution (ICS; 150 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH), giving a resistance of 1.5-2 MΩ. Chloride-coated silver wire connected the pipette filling fluid to the probe input. The probe of the patch amplifier (Axopatch 1D; Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) was mounted on a manipulator and connected through a digital interface (Digidata 1320A, Axon Instruments) to a computer. The software pCLAMP 8.1 (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition as well as for off-line data analysis. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C). Whole cell patch clamp measurements under voltage clamp were performed after Gigaseal formation (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar), followed by disruption of the membrane under the pipette by a suction pulse. The process was monitored by applying a test pulse (5 mV, 5 ms, 100 Hz) to the cell, which allowed the analysis of series resistance and enabled optimal capacitive transient cancellation. The cells were clamped at a holding potential of -60 mV, which is close to the resting membrane potential for these cells (19Kestler H.A. Janko S. Haussler U. Muche R. Hombach V. Hoher M. Wiecha J. Res. Exp. Med. 1998; 198: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Voltage steps were applied either as a single +100-mV step from holding or increasing voltage from -60 mV to +90 mV at 10-mV increments. For tail current analysis, a single test pulse of +100 mV was applied followed by increasing hyperpolarizing steps from +30 mV to -170 mV in 10-mV increments. For leak subtraction, four scaled replicas of the voltage step were applied prior to the actual step. Responses to these replicas, which reflect only passive membrane properties, were averaged and subtracted from the actual voltage response. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated from confluent cultures of HUVEC using the Snap Total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Five μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by random priming and incubation with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus transcriptase at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting single-stranded cDNA (5 μl) was then subjected to 35 cycles of PCR (Robocycler 96, Stratagene) under standard conditions. Briefly, the samples were denatured at 94 °C for 5 min and, after the addition of the polymerase, subjected to 35 cycles of amplification each consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 70 °C, with a 7-min extension at 72 °C during the last cycle. Each PCR mixture (100 μl) contained the cDNA template, 1 μm of the primers, 200 μm of dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25 °C), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 μm Taq polymerase (Promega). The forward versus reverse primers used to amplify a 119-bp segment of the BKCa channel mRNA were 5′-GGAGGATGCCTCGAATATCA-3′ versus 5′-AGCTCGGGATGTTTAGCAGA-3′, respectively. The amplicon was sized by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. RNA without reverse transcriptions did not yield any amplicons, indicating that there was no genomic DNA contamination. Measurement of Cellular Levels of cGMP—cGMP present in lysates of HUVEC was measured by immunoassay, using a commercial kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, aliquots of HUVEC were grown to confluency in 60-mm dishes. To prevent the breakdown of cGMP, 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine was added to the medium. Duplicate aliquots of cells were then incubated for an additional 4 min in the presence of vehicle, 10 μm abn-cbd alone, 10 μm abn-cbd in the presence of 10 μm O-1918, or 1 μm YC-1. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 0.1 n HCl. Protein concentration in the lysate was measured colorimetrically using the Bradford assay. The cGMP immunoassay was conducted following the manufacturer's instructions for the acetylated procedure, the sensitivity of which was 0.06 pmol/ml. Vasorelaxation in Rat Isolated Mesenteric Arteries—Third order segments of mesenteric arteries (2 mm long and 200-300 μm in diameter) were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) and mounted in a wire myograph as described elsewhere (13Offertáler L. Mo F-M. Bátkai S. Liu J. Begg M. Razdan R.K. Martin B.R. Bukoski R.D. Kunos G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Vasorelaxant responses were measured in vessels precontracted with 5 μm phenylephrine and expressed as a percentage of the phenylephrine-induced tone. Endothelial denudation achieved by rubbing the inside of the artery with the mounting wire was verified by the loss of acetylcholine-induced relaxation. Cumulative concentration-response curves for abnormal cannabidiol were determined in the absence and presence of 100 nm iberiotoxin in both intact and endothelium denuded preparations. Drugs—Abnormal cannabidiol ((-)-4-(3-3,4-trans-p-menthadien-(1,8)-yl)-olivetol; see Ref. 12Adams M.D. Earnhardt J.T. Martin B.R. Harris L.S. Dewey W.L. Razdan R.K. Experientia. 1977; 33: 1204-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and O-1918 ((-)-1,3-dimethoxy-2-(3-3,4-trans-p-menthadien-(1,8)-yl)-orcinol) were synthesized as described (13Offertáler L. Mo F-M. Bátkai S. Liu J. Begg M. Razdan R.K. Martin B.R. Bukoski R.D. Kunos G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). SR141716 (N-[piperidin-1-yl]-5-[4-chlorophenyl]-1-[2,4-dichlorophenyl]-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide HCl) and SR144528 (N-[(1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethyl bicyclo[2.2.1]-heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) were synthesized and provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. All other drugs were purchased from Sigma, except pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA), and HU-210 ((-)-11-OH-Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol dimethylheptyl; Tocris Cookson Inc., Ellisville, MO). The drugs were dissolved in EtOH and stored at -20 °C, with the exception of BAPTA, which was dissolved directly into ICS each day. Drugs were freshly diluted for the experiment and administered in the extracellular solution, superfused directly onto the cells with a fast perfusion system having an exchange time in the 100 ms range, with the exceptions of thapsigargin and BAPTA, which were added to the ICS, and pertussis toxin, which was added to the cell culture medium 2 h before recording. In certain experiments [Ca2+]i was adjusted to 100 nm, 250 nm, or 1 μm by the administration to the ICS of 4.4, 6.6, or 8.9 mm CaCl2, respectively, in the presence of 10 mm BAPTA. After each experiment, the superfusion apparatus was thoroughly washed with ethanol and distilled water to avoid any carry-over of ligands. Statistical Analyses—The values are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean. Student's unpaired t test was used to assess significant difference between values when comparing two groups. A one-way analysis of variance was performed, followed by a post hoc Dunnett test to assess significant differences between control and multiple test values. A Boltzman fit using the equation g = 1/[1 + exp - (V - V 1/2)/k], where g is conductance, V is membrane potential, V 1/2 is the activation midpoint, and k is the slope was used to calculate G max and V 1/2 in one experiment. Significance was assumed if p < 0.05. Role of BK Ca Channels in Voltage-activated K + Current in HUVEC—Voltage steps applied to HUVEC held at -60 mV produced noninactivating outward currents (Fig. 1a). Tail current analysis performed to determine the nature of the ion carrying this current (Fig. 1, b and c) revealed that its reversal potential (-105 ± 5 mV, n = 6) was similar to the value of -103 mV predicted for K+ using the Nernst equation. The role of K+ was further confirmed by the observed shift in the reversal potential to -87 ± 4 mV upon increasing extracellular [K+] to 5.0 mm (Fig. 1c; n = 3), which also was similar to the predicted value of -85 mV. Furthermore, these currents were abolished by charybdotoxin (100 nm; data not shown; n = 6) or by iberiotoxin (100 nm; Fig. 1d; n = 6). Although charybdotoxin is a relatively nonselective inhibitor of Ca2+-activated K+ channels and also inhibits delayed rectifying K+ channels (22Garcia M.L. Knaus H.G. Munujos P. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1-C10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the observed inhibition by the selective BKCa channel inhibitor iberiotoxin (23Garcia M.L. Galvez A. Garcia-Calvo M. King V.F. Vazquez J. Kaczorowski G.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 615-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) indicated the involvement of BKCa channels. The expression of BKCa channel mRNA in HUVEC was also confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1e). Abn-cbd Potentiates BK Ca Current in HUVEC—A single voltage step of +100 mV produced an average outward current density of 41 ± 9 pA/pF, which was significantly increased by abnormal cannabidiol (abn-cbd) to 80 ± 10 pA/pF at 10 μm (Fig. 2, a and b; n = 6, p < 0.01). The time required for the maximal increase in current was 54 ± 5 s. Iberiotoxin (100 nm) added to the medium at the peak of the abn-cbd-induced increase in current abolished the current completely (Fig. 2b). Sample traces of currents produced by increasing voltage steps (Fig. 2c), the voltage-current (Fig. 2d) and voltage-conductance relationships in the presence and absence of abn-cbd (Fig. 2e) are also shown. Abn-cbd produced a significant leftward shift in the conductance-voltage relationship, decreasing the V 1/2 from 43 ± 4 to 31 ± 3 mV. The slope values were 78.66 (95% confidence limits of 71.32 and 84.15) for control and 68.67 (60.49-75.88) in the presence of abn-cbd, which also increased the maximal conductance. Despite extensive washing of cells to remove abn-cbd, we did not observe reversal of the increase in current, which is similar to the lack of reversibility of abn-cbd-induced mesenteric artery relaxation, probably related to the highly hydrophobic nature of the compound. Abn-cbd-sensitive Non-CB1/Non-CB2 Receptor Is Coupled to Gi/Go—The increase in current produced by 10 μm abn-cbd was prevented by pre-exposure of cells to O-1918 for 2 min (10 μm; Fig. 3a) or to pertussis toxin (PTX) for 2 h (400 ng/ml; Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c illustrates the concentration dependence of the effect of abn-cbd on current density at a +100-mV step and its inhibition by O-1918 and by PTX as tested in six replicate experiments. The effect of abn-cbd remained unchanged in the presence of an antagonist of CB1 (SR141716, 1 μm; Fig. 4, a and c; n = 6) or CB2 receptors (SR144528, 1 μm; Fig. 4c; n = 6). Furthermore, the potent CB1/CB2 receptor agonist HU-210 (100 nm), which has no vasodilator activity in the rat mesentery (11Wagner J.A. Varga K. Járai Z. Kunos G. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 429-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on the outward current produced by voltage steps (Fig. 4, b and c; n = 6). None of the compounds examined evoked any currents by themselves on HUVEC held at -60 mV (data not shown), and the ethanol vehicle used did not affect the current produced by voltage steps or the current at the -60 mV holding potential (data not shown; n = 6).Fig. 4Lack of effect of CB1 and CB2 ligands on the increase in outward current by abn-cbd. a, sample traces (solid) and time course plot (dotted) showing the lack of effect of SR141716 (1 μm) on the increase in outward currents produced by abn-cbd (10 μm). b, sample traces and time course plot showing the lack of effect of HU-210 (100 nm) on patch-clamped HUVEC. c, lack of effect of SR141716 (1 μm) and SR144528 (1 μm) on the increase in outward currents produced by abn-cbd (10 μm) and HU-210 (100 nm) on patch-clamped HUVEC. *, significant difference from control (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further analyze the function of BKCa, HUVEC were exposed to the selective BKCa opener NS-1619 (10 μm) (24Olesen S.P. Munch E. Moldt P. Drejer J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 251: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). NS-1619 alone produced an outward current of 207 ± 20 pA (11 ± 3 pA/pF, n = 4), which was completely blocked in the presence of 100 nm iberiotoxin but was unaffected by 10 μm O-1918 (215 ± 18 pA or 12 ± 4 pA/pF; n = 4). NS-1619 also potentiated the current induced by a 100-mV voltage step from 38 ± 10 to 75 ± 12 pA/pF (p < 0.05, n = 4), and again, this effect was blocked by iberiotoxin but not by O-1918. The endogenous cannabinoid anandamide also increased the outward current evoked by a single voltage step of +100 mV, although its potency was lower than that of abn-cbd. At 10 μm, anandamide had no effect, but at 100 μm it significantly increased the average outward current density from 39 ± 7 to 74 ± 12 pA/pF (n = 6, p > 0.05). The response to 100 μm anandamide was partially inhibited by O-1918 (10 μm, n = 3) and by PTX (400 ng/ml, n = 3), with the maximal current density being reduced to 58 ± 10 and 55 ± 12 pA/pF, respectively (base-line current density was unaffected by either antagonist alone). Abn-cbd Modulates BKCa Current Independently of Changes in [Ca2+]i—Removal of calcium from the extracellular solution significantly reduced the outward current evoked by a +100-mV voltage step to 20 ± 7 pA/pF (n = 6, p < 0.01), which was then increased by abn-cbd (10 μm) from 20 ± 7 to 40 ± 17 pA/pF (n = 6, p < 0.01). The addition of BAPTA (10 mm) to the ICS significantly reduced the outward current produced by a +100-mV voltage step to 12 ± 3 pA/pF (n = 6, p < 0.01), which was not affected by 10 μm abn-cbd (n = 6). Removing extracellular calcium and adding BAPTA almost entirely abolished the outward current produced by a +100-mV voltage step, reducing current density to 8 ± 2 pA/pF. Abn-cbd (10 μm) produced no increase in the remaining outward current (n = 6). Clamping the [Ca2+]i at 100 nm by adding BAPTA (10 mm) and CaCl2 (4.4 mm) to the ICS significantly increased the outward current produced by a +100-mV step to 23 ± 9 pA/pF compared with the 12 ± 3 pA/pF current density produced in BAPTA alone (Fig. 5a; n = 6, p < 0.05). Similarly, clamping the [Ca2+]i at 125 nm, 250 nm, or 1 μm by adding BAPTA and CaCl2 to the ICS also produced further increases in the outward current produced by a +100-mV step (Fig. 5b). Despite the [Ca2+]i being clamped at various concentrations, abn-cbd (10 μm) still increased the outward current produced by a +100-mV step (Fig. 5c; n = 6, p < 0.01). Intracellular application of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (1 or 10 μm) evoked no currents in HUVEC held at -60 mV (data not shown), and thapsigargin did not affect the outward current produced by a +100-mV voltage step. Thapsigargin also had no effect on the increase in outward current produced by abn-cbd (n = 6 for both concentrations). Modulation of BK Ca Current via Guanylate Cyclase—cGMP (100 μm) added to the ICS significantly increased the outward current in response to a +100-mV voltage step from 41 ± 9 to 82 ± 12 pA/pF (Fig. 6d; n = 6, p < 0.01). Addition of the protein kinase G inhibitor KT-5823 (100 nm) to the extracellular solution of cells patched with cGMP in the ICS reduced the outward current evoked by a +100-mV voltage step back to control levels of 43 ± 7 pA/pF (Fig. 6b; n = 6). Similarly, the abn-cbd-induced increase in outward current evoked by a +100-mV voltage step was reversed by KT-5823 (100 nm; Fig. 6a; n = 6). The increase in current was also blocked by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (25Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Schmidt K. Mayer E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar), with 10 μm abn-cbd increasing the current from 43 ± 7 to 82 ± 9 pA/pF in the absence of ODQ but leaving it unchanged at 40 ± 8 pA/pF in the presence of 1 μm ODQ. YC-1 (1 μm), a stimulator of soluble guanylyl cyclase (26Ko, F. N., Wu, C. C., Kuo, S. C., Lee, F. Y., and Teng, C. M. Blood, 84, 4226-4233Google Scholar), increased the outward current evoked by a +100-mV voltage step to 84 ± 13 pA/pF (n = 6, p < 0.01), and this increase was insensitive to O-1918 (10 μm; Fig. 6d; n = 6). With the [Ca2+]i clamped at 250 nm by using a combination of BAPTA (100 mm) and CaCl2 (6.6 mm) in the ICS, both YC-1 (1 μm) and cGMP (100 μm) continued to increase the outward current evoked by a +100-mV voltage step, to 82 ± 11 and 79 ± 10 pA/pF, respectively (n = 6, p < 0.01). There was no additivity between the effects of cGMP and abn-cbd, with the average current density being 85 ± 10 pA/pF in the simultaneous presence of both compounds (n = 6; Fig. 6d). Similarly, in the combined presence of YC-1 (1 μm) and abn-cbd (10 μm), the average current density was increased to 84 ± 11 pA/pF (n = 6; Fig. 6d), showing no additivity. Because the above findings suggest that the abn-cbd-i"
https://openalex.org/W2012887640,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nhp6 protein contains a DNA-binding motif that is similar to those found in the high mobility group B family of chromatin proteins. Nhp6 bound to nucleosomes and made at least two changes in them: the nucleosomal DNA became more sensitive to DNase I at specific sites, and the nucleosomes became competent to bind Spt16-Pob3 to form yFACT·nucleosome complexes. Both changes occurred at similar concentrations of Nhp6, suggesting that they reflect the same structural reorganization of the nucleosome. Nucleosomes have multiple binding sites for Nhp6, and structural reorganization was associated with a concentration of Nhp6 about 10-fold higher than that needed for simple binding. We propose that the coordinated action of multiple Nhp6 molecules is required to convert nucleosomes to an alternative form as the first step in a two-step reorganization of nucleosomes with the second step being dependent on Spt16-Pob3. The presence of linker DNA had only subtle effects on these processes, indicating that both Nhp6 and yFACT act on core nucleosome structure rather than on the interaction between nucleosomes and adjacent DNA. These results suggest that Nhp6 and the related high mobility group B proteins may have a general role in promoting rearrangements of chromatin by initiating the destabilization of core nucleosomal structure.

These results suggest that Nhp6 and the related high mobility group B proteins may have a general role in promoting rearrangements of chromatin by initiating the destabilization of core nucleosomal structure. Nhp6 is a DNA-binding protein that is encoded by two similar genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NHP6A and NHP6B (1Kolodrubetz D. Burgum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3234-3239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nhp6A and Nhp6B proteins (93 and 99 total residues, respectively) are 88% identical and functionally redundant (2Costigan C. Kolodrubetz D. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Kolodrubetz D. Kruppa M. Burgum A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), so we refer here to both as Nhp6 protein. Nhp6 contains a single ∼70-residue high mobility group (HMG) 1The abbreviations used are: HMG, high mobility group; HMGB, high mobility group B; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. box motif of the type found in the HMGB family (4Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMG proteins are abundant constituents of chromatin that fall into several families with distinct DNA-binding motifs (5Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). HMG families are highly conserved and have been proposed to play many roles in chromatin function (5Bustin M. Mol. Cell.

Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Canonical HMGB proteins contain two tandem copies of the same HMG box motif, so Nhp6 is not a true representative of this family (4Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no yeast protein has the canonical HMGB structure, so Nhp6 is the closest relative of this conserved family in yeast and is likely to provide clues about the functions of the HMG box motif both in HMGB proteins and in other contexts. Haploid yeast cells contain about 70,000 copies of Nhp6 (8Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) for a total nuclear concentration of about 30 μm, roughly equivalent to nucleosomes. While abundant and conserved, Nhp6 is not essential for viability (2Costigan C. Kolodrubetz D. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, yeast cells lacking Nhp6 display severe defects including slow growth, temperature sensitivity, altered regulation of transcription, and an inability to tolerate mutations in a variety of transcription and replication factors (2Costigan C.

Nhp6 is therefore non-essential, but it is important for normal growth. Nhp6 supports the function of Spt16-Pob3, a heterodimer implicated in both DNA replication and regulation of transcription (10Formosa T. Workman J.L. Protein Complexes That Modify Chromatin. Vol. 274. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2002: 171-201Google Scholar, 11Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J.

Spt16 and Pob3 contain most of the sequences found in the components of the human FACT and frog DUF complexes (13Okuhara K. Ohta K. Seo H. Shioda M. Yamada T. Tanaka Y. Dohmae N. Seyama Y. Shibata T.

Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), but Pob3 lacks the HMG box motif found in the otherwise homologous FACT subunit SSRP1 (12Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Bruhn S.L. Pil P.M. Essigmann J.M. Housman D.E. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nhp6 appears to provide HMG box function for Spt16-Pob3 both in vivo and in vitro as cells lacking Nhp6 cannot tolerate mutations in SPT16 or POB3 (11Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 17Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21972-21979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and Spt16-Pob3 can only bind to and reorganize nucleosomes in vitro if Nhp6 is present (11Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Current data suggest that FACT family members, including Spt16-Pob3 with Nhp6 (SPN or yFACT), promote elongation by RNA and DNA polymerases by altering the structure of nucleosomes, making them less inhibitory to the passage of polymerases (14Orphanides G. Wu W.H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.-H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Nhp6 is more abundant than Spt16-Pob3 (8Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and nhp6-Δ mutations cause phenotypes distinct from defects in SPT16 or POB3. These observations suggest that Nhp6 may function both within yFACT and in other pathways. HMG box proteins have been considered to act as “architectural” factors that bend DNA and induce juxtaposition of non-contiguous DNA sequences (5Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 7Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Alternatively they have been proposed to reduce the overall stiffness of DNA by repeatedly binding to DNA and releasing it in a bent form, allowing the DNA to access a range of shapes more rapidly (8Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Ross E.D. Hardwidge P.R. Maher III, L.J. Mol. Cell.

This “shape chaperone” activity has been proposed to assist the formation of structures containing bent DNA, including nucleosomes (20Ross E.D. Hardwidge P.R. Maher III, L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6598-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Travers A.A. Ner S.S. Churchill M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we report that the converse may also occur as Nhp6 binding appears to destabilize nucleosomes, promoting conversion to an alternative form. The conservation of the HMG box motif among FACT members and the importance of Nhp6 in yFACT activity suggest that this motif plays an important role in FACT function. The distinct architecture of yFACT allowed us to examine the function of the HMG box motif separately from Spt16-Pob3 to ask how this module contributes to yFACT-mediated reorganization of nucleosomes. Here we show that increasing concentrations of Nhp6 made progressive changes in nucleosome structure. At an Nhp6 concentration about 10-fold higher than the concentration that produces Nhp6·nucleosome complexes, nucleosomes underwent a change that led to enhanced DNase I sensitivity at some sites and the ability to bind Spt16-Pob3. These results suggest a general role for Nhp6 and other HMG proteins in destabilizing nucleosomes to promote formation of alternative chromatin structures. Nucleosomes—DNA molecules containing the 146-bp sea urchin 5 S rDNA nucleosome positioning sequence (22Simpson R.T. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) were produced by PCR amplification using a template with the positioning sequence inserted between the EcoRI and XbaI sites in pBlueScript KS– (Stratagene, generously provided by J. Wittmeyer and B. Cairns). Primer sequences (available upon request) were designed that amplify the positioning sequence by PCR producing different flanking contexts as shown in Fig. 1. Products were end-labeled on one strand by digesting with an appropriate restriction endonuclease, treating with phosphatase, labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, and then digesting with a second endonuclease. Histone octamers were derived either from chicken erythrocytes (a gift from V. Ramakrishnan and V. Graziano, Ref. 23Graziano V. Gerchman S.E. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or from bacteria expressing recombinant yeast histones (constructs generously provided by J. Wittmeyer and B. Cairns). Nucleosomes were assembled by slow dialysis from high salt solutions and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (11Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y.

Binding Reactions and DNase I Digestions—Spt16-Pob3 was purified as the intact heterodimer from yeast cells overexpressing both proteins as described previously (19Wittmeyer J. Joss L. Formosa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8961-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nhp6 was purified from BL21-Codon-Plus(DE3)-RIL Escherichia coli (Stratagene) expressing NHP6A from plasmid pRJ1228 (Ref. 25Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, a generous gift from R. Johnson). Cultures growing in rich medium at 37 °C were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, harvested by centrifugation, suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl), and frozen. Cell suspensions were thawed, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), and the cells were lysed by sonication at 0 °C. Debris were removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid was added to the cleared supernatant with constant mixing to 2% (w/v). The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min, and then trichloroacetic acid was added to the supernatant to 10% (w/v). The precipitate was harvested by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min, rinsed with acetone, dried, and then dissolved in S buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 300 mm NaCl). After dialyzing twice against 1 liter of fresh S buffer, the sample was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap SP column (Amersham Biosciences), which was washed with S buffer and then eluted with a 25-ml gradient from 300 mm NaCl to 1 m NaCl in S buffer. Fractions containing Nhp6 were dialyzed against S buffer, concentrated, and stored at –70 °C. Working stocks of proteins were made by diluting concentrated stocks in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. For binding reactions, proteins were mixed with 5–10 fmol of DNA or nucleosomes in a 10-μl volume containing final concentrations of 1 mm Na2EDTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 120 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.9 mg/ml human serum albumin (Sigma), 12% (w/v) sucrose, and 2% (w/v) glycerol. After incubating for 10 min at 30 °C, products were separated by native PAGE for several hours at 100–200 V on 16- × 16- × 0.15-cm gels composed of 4% polyacrylamide (0.2% bisacrylamide), 5% (w/v) glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: B.23Google Scholar). Gels were dried, and labeled DNA was detected on a PhosphorImager (Storm 820, Amersham Biosciences). The amount of label in different regions of each lane was quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). In each case, the signal for a given form was determined and then normalized to the amount of signal in the entire lane to determine the percentage of the total DNA represented by the specific form. These values were then plotted to determine the point at which half of the maximum effect occurred as an estimate of the binding affinity. For DNase I digestions, 2 μl of a solution containing 100 ng of bovine pancreatic DNase I (Worthington), 60 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml human serum albumin, and 300 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added to 10 μl of a binding reaction and incubated for 3 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of a solution containing 6 μg of salmon testes DNA (Sigma), 3 mm Na2EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 100 mm NaCl at 0 °C. Samples were extracted with 150 μl of CHCl3 containing 125 volume of isoamyl alcohol, the aqueous phase was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 95% ethanol, and the DNA was recovered by centrifugation. DNA was dissolved in 76% formamide, 16 mm Na2EDTA, and 0.04% each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol FF dyes. Samples were incubated for several minutes at 65 °C and then subjected to electrophoresis through 0.4-mm gels consisting of 8% polyacrylamide (0.4% bisacrylamide), 7 m urea, and 70% Tris borate/EDTA (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: B.23Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in 12% methanol and 10% acetic acid, dried, and then autoradiographed. Where indicated, the 12-μl DNase I digestions were mixed with 32 μg of salmon testes DNA, and then nucleosomes were recovered after native PAGE by extracting gel fragments overnight at 37 °C with 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) followed by precipitation with ethanol. Nhp6 binds to DNA and to nucleosomes (11Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 25Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Nhp6 promotes formation of complexes between Spt16-Pob3 and nucleosomes and that the enhanced sensitivity to DNase I associated with these yFACT· nucleosome complexes is partially induced at a subset of sites by Nhp6 alone (11Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This suggests that Nhp6 converts nucleosomes to an altered form in which the DNA is locally more accessible to DNase I or is a more suitable substrate for this nuclease and that unlike free nucleosomes this form is competent to bind Spt16-Pob3. DNA is dramatically bent by Nhp6 binding (27Allain F.H. Yen Y.M. Masse J.E. Schultze P. Dieckmann T. Johnson R.C. Feigon J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2563-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and this could alter nucleosomes by disrupting local histone-DNA contacts. Nhp6 might bind to linker DNA and disturb contacts at the entry-exit points (linkers are defined here as the DNA extending beyond the 146-bp sea urchin 5 S rDNA nucleosome positioning sequence, Ref. 22Simpson R.T. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Alternatively Nhp6 could bind directly to the core DNA associated with the histone octamer, forcing this DNA into an aberrant shape incompatible with normal stable nucleosomal structure. These models make distinct predictions concerning the amount of Nhp6 required to alter nucleosomes and the effect of changing the size of the linkers. We therefore constructed nucleosomes with different linker configurations and tested them for the ability to bind Nhp6 or yFACT as well as for changes in sensitivity to DNase I. DNA and Nucleosomes Each Bind Multiple Monomers of Nhp6 —Nhp6 bound to either 149- or 237-bp linear double-stranded DNA fragments in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with an apparent Kd of about 7 nm (Fig. 2A and Table I). As previously noted by the Johnson laboratory (8Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), multiple binding forms were observed as the concentration of Nhp6 was increased (Fig. 2A). These intermediates have been shown to reflect the binding of integral numbers of Nhp6 monomers (28Yen Y.M. Wong B. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4424-4435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), showing that DNA molecules of this size contain multiple binding sites for Nhp6 that can be accessed simultaneously. Nhp6 contacts 10–15 bp of DNA (27Allain F.H. Yen Y.M. Masse J.E. Schultze P. Dieckmann T. Johnson R.C. Feigon J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2563-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), so the 149-bp substrate shown in Fig. 2A should be able to bind 10–15 monomers of Nhp6. Very high concentrations of Nhp6 caused progressively slower migration of the DNA even after binding was saturated (Fig. 2A). This appears to be an artifact caused by Nhp6 molecules migrating in this region of the polyacrylamide gels independently of DNA (not shown; nucleosomes displayed the same effect, see Fig. 2, B and C).

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but these proteins do not appear to form a stable complex under more physiological conditions (11Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Addition of Spt16-Pob3 to the Nhp6-DNA binding reactions caused a slight shift in the migration pattern of the DNA (Fig. 2A, arrows) toward a lower Nhp6 concentration. Spt16-Pob3 therefore causes a small decrease in the effective concentration of Nhp6 for binding DNA, consistent with the interpretation that Spt16-Pob3 and Nhp6 do not form a specific, independent, active complex analogous to human FACT. A comparable ladder of binding intermediates was observed with nucleosomes (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that nucleosomes also have multiple binding sites for Nhp6. Due to the smaller proportional change in mass and differences in migration properties caused by different linker configurations, distinct ladders were not always observed, making it difficult in some cases to clearly discriminate the unbound form. This contributes to a high variance in measurements of the affinity of Nhp6 for nucleosomes, but we observed an average affinity with different types of nucleosomes of about 22 nm for Nhp6 (Table I). Nucleosomes and free DNA therefore appear to have a similar number of binding sites for Nhp6, and the affinity of the first binding event is about 3-fold lower for nucleosomes than for free DNA. Linkers Do Not Promote Nhp6 or yFACT Binding—If linkers provide a more efficient binding site for Nhp6 than DNA within the nucleosomal core, then nucleosomes with linkers should have higher affinity for Nhp6 than nucleosomes without linkers. However, the presence or absence of linkers on nucleosomes made little, if any, change in their affinity for Nhp6 (Table I). If Nhp6 promotes yFACT·nucleosome complex formation by affecting nucleosomes specifically at entry/exit points, then linkers might promote complex formation without altering the overall affinity for Nhp6. We therefore compared the ability of Nhp6 to support the formation of yFACT complexes using nucleosomes with and without linkers. As shown in Table I, the presence of linkers did not enhance the formation of yFACT complexes. For example, nucleosomes formed with chicken histones formed half of the maximal level of complexes at 530 nm Nhp6 without linkers and 700 nm Nhp6 with linkers. Linkers are therefore either neutral, or they slightly inhibit the ability of nucleosomes either to bind Nhp6 or to form yFACT complexes. Formation of yFACT·Nucleosome Complexes Requires Multiple Nhp6 Molecules—If binding of a single monomer of Nhp6 to a nucleosome is adequate to convert the nucleosome to a state competent for recruiting Spt16-Pob3, then formation of yFACT·nucleosome complexes should occur at the same concentration of Nhp6 as simple binding. Instead half-maximal formation of yFACT complexes required about 10-fold more Nhp6 than that needed for simple binding (Table I). Fig. 2 (B–D) shows that yFACT·nucleosome complexes only began to accumulate after the concentration of Nhp6 reached a level sufficient to drive essentially all nucleosomes into complexes with multiple Nhp6 molecules. As with free DNA, addition of Spt16-Pob3 caused a decrease in the effective concentration of Nhp6, so the apparent affinity of Nhp6 for nucleosomes in the presence of Spt16-Pob3 was about 50 nm Nhp6 (Table I). In contrast, the overall average for half-maximal formation of yFACT·nucleosome complexes in the same experiments was 460 nm Nhp6 (Table I). The average ratio of Nhp6 required for yFACT complex formation to simple binding in 16 independent experiments was 11 (Table I). It therefore appears that binding a single Nhp6 molecule is not adequate to support the formation of a yFACT·nucleosome complex. Histone octamers purified from chicken erythrocytes may retain some of the covalent modifications that occur in vivo (6van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar), and chicken histones do not have the same sequences as yeast histones (∼70% identity for H2A-H2B and 90% identity for H3-H4, Ref. 29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Mutations in yFACT subunits cause synthetic effects when combined with mutations in either histones or histone-modifying enzymes (9Yu Y. Eriksson P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2350-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J.

Genetics. 2002; 162: 1557-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so Nhp6 and yFACT activities could be affected by either histone modifications or altered histone sequences. As shown in Table I, nucleosomes assembled using endogenous chicken histone octamers required somewhat higher levels of Nhp6 to form yFACT· nucleosome complexes than nucleosomes assembled with unmodified recombinant yeast histone octamers. For example, nucleosomes with linkers formed yFACT·nucleosome complexes with a half-maximum of 350 nm Nhp6 when yeast histones were used and 700 nm with chicken histones. This effect was small but consistent; an example of a single experiment in which the same DNA was assembled into yeast or chicken nucleosomes for direct comparison is shown in Fig. 3A. Simple binding of Nhp6 was similar for yeast and chicken nucleosomes, but yeast nucleosomes required 7-fold more Nhp6 to produce yFACT complexes, whereas chicken nucleosomes required 20-fold more (Table I). This suggests that increasing the concentration of Nhp6 causes progressive changes in nucleosomes, and the threshold level required to allow binding of Spt16-Pob3 is partly dependent on either the sequence of the histones or the presence of modifications. Spt16-Pob3 Binds with High Affinity—Spt16-Pob3 formed yFACT·nucleosome complexes in the presence of saturating amounts of Nhp6 with an overall apparent Kd of about 7 nm (Fig. 2D and Table I). Either the presence of linkers or the use of chicken histones caused a requirement for somewhat higher concentrations of Spt16-Pob3 relative to yeast nucleosomes without linkers (Table I and Fig. 3, B and C). The effects were small but reproducible within individual direct comparisons (Fig. 3B). We also noted that a smaller p"

Although the mechanism of preprotein import into chloroplasts has garnered considerable attention, less information is available on the assembly of the translocon itself. Toc34 and Toc75 are exclusively localized to the outer envelope membrane in approximately a 1:1 stoichiometry (16Schleiff E. Soll J. Kuchler M. Kuhlbrandt W. Harrer R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In contrast, Toc159 is found both in a soluble cytoplasmic form and integrated into the Toc complex in substoichiometric amounts relative to the other Toc components (16Schleiff E. Soll J. Kuchler M. Kuhlbrandt W. Harrer R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Toc complex assembly is dynamic and have led to the proposal that Toc159 may act as a cycling receptor that targets preproteins from the cytoplasm to the Toc translocon (17Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Previous studies have examined the structural features of Toc159 that are required for assembly into the Toc complex (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the GTPase domain (G-domain) of the Arabidopsis Toc159 orthologue, atToc159, mediates targeting of the receptor to the chloroplast surface via a direct interaction with the GTPase domain of atToc33, the Arabidopsis Toc34 orthologue (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Tight association of the Toc GTPases is triggered by conversion of atToc159 to its GDP-bound form via intrinsic GTP hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is required for insertion of the membrane anchor (M-domain) of the receptor into the outer membrane and results in the assembly of atToc159 into the Toc complex (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These studies highlighted the role for a GTP-driven switch in regulating assembly of the Toc translocon. In this report, we have investigated the roles of Toc34 and Toc75 in targeting Toc159 to the outer membrane. We demonstrate that the GTPase activity of atToc33 participates in atToc159 targeting, indicating that the coordinate activities of the two GTPases are required for Toc assembly. To define the minimal requirements of Toc159 targeting, we reconstituted Toc complex assembly in proteoliposomes containing Toc34 and/or Toc75. These studies confirm the role of Toc34 in docking of the Toc159 receptor at the membrane surface and demonstrate that Toc75 mediates the insertion of the M-domain of Toc159 into the membrane. Toc33/34 Mutations and AtToc159 Deletion Constructs—Point mutations were introduced into the conserved G1 motif of the GTP binding domain (amino acids 1–265) of atToc33 (atToc33G) (17Hiltbrunner A.

PCR primers were used that resulted in the following point mutations: codon GGC was changed to CGT resulting in a Gly to Arg mutation at amino acid 45; codon AAA was changed to AAT resulting in a Lys to Asn mutation at amino acid 49; and codon TCA was changed to CGA resulting in a Ser to Arg mutation at amino acid 50. The mutated PCR fragment was cloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pET21d, resulting in an in-frame fusion with a COOH-terminal hexahistidine tag, which gave rise to clone pET21d-atToc33GHis-G45R/K49N/S50R. Construction of pET21d-atToc159, pET21d-atToc159-A864R, pET21d-atToc159-K868R, pET21d-atToc159GHis, pET21d-atToc159GHis-K868R, and pET21a-atToc159MHis has been described previously (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A.

Protein was diluted to 2 μm and incubated with 1.0 μm [α-32P]GTP (150 mCi/μmol) and 10 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 25 °C. The radioactivity retained on the membrane with the protein was quantitated using scintillation counting. This concentration of [α-32P]GTP was chosen because it minimized the level of nonspecific binding observed in the assay. Nucleotide binding at this concentration gives <10% saturation but yields the highest signal to noise ratio.

Here, 1.6 μm purified atToc33GHis or atToc33GHis-G45R/K49N/ S50R was incubated with 2 μm [α-32P]GTP (150 mCi/μmol) and samples were resolved using TLC.

GTP hydrolysis activity of proteoliposomes containing psToc34 or psToc34-G48R/K52N/S53R was measured as described for purified atToc33GHis proteins, with the exception that the proteoliposomes were diluted to give a final protein concentration of 1.2 μm in a 50-μl reaction volume. Solid Phase Binding Assays—Direct interaction between atToc159 or atToc159G and atToc33GHis or atToc33GHis-G45R/K49N/S50R was measured using solid phase binding assays adapted from Smith et al. (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of purified, nucleotide-depleted atToc33GHis or atToc33GHis-G45R/K49N/S50R were bound to 8 μl of packed Ni-NTA resin in the presence of 0.1 mm GTP or GMP-P(NH)P, and incubated with 1–5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]atToc159 or [35S]atToc159G. To measure atToc159M binding to atToc33GHis, 6 μl of packed Ni-NTA resin was first saturated with 80 μg of atToc33GHis, and then incubated with 5–10 μl of in vitro translated [35S]atToc159M in the absence or presence of 20 μm purified atToc159MHis, or increasing concentrations of atToc159GHis. All eluted proteins from solid phase binding assays were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to detect the resin-immobilized proteins (data not shown). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were detected in dried gels using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant version 5.2 software. Chloroplast Isolation and Toc159M Targeting Assays—Intact chloroplasts were isolated from ∼2-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Wassilewskija) seedlings grown on 0.8% (w/v) phytagar plates containing Murashige and Skoog growth medium and 1% (w/v) sucrose, as described (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Smith M.D. Fitzpatrick L.M. Keegstra K. Schnell D.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Plant J. 2001; 27: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Targeting of atToc159M to chloroplasts was carried out using intact chloroplasts equivalent to 50 μg of chlorophyll in 100 μl of HS buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mm sorbitol) containing 50 mm KOAc and 4 mm MgOAc (import buffer). Targeting reactions were initiated with the addition of [35S]atToc159M in the absence or presence of 5 μm purified atToc159GHis, atToc159GHis-K868R, or atToc33GHis. Following the standard import reactions chloroplasts were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml thermolysin as described (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Smith M.D. Fitzpatrick L.M. Keegstra K. Schnell D.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Harford J.B. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. 14th Ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2002: 11.16.11-11.16.21Google Scholar). Reisolated chloroplasts were hypotonically lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and the total chloroplast membrane fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The membrane fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and [35S]atToc159M was detected and quantitated in dried gels using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant version 5.2 software. Reconstitution of Proteoliposomes—Liposomes were generated using azolectin (type IV-S, Sigma) and a method adapted from Hinnah et al. (10Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Azolectin was resuspended in 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 6.9, to give a final concentration of 50 mg/ml and pulse sonicated for 30 s to facilitate even dispersion. The liposomes were frozen at –80 °C for 1 h. Purified, urea-soluble psToc75, psToc34, or psToc34-G48R/K52N/S53R was diluted with an equal volume of 24 mm CHAPS, and incubated for 1 h on ice. The liposomes were thawed and added to the proteins at a ratio of 200 μl of liposomes/90 μg of protein. The mixture was pulse sonicated for 10 s, incubated for 1 h on ice, and dialyzed overnight into 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5. Proteoliposomes were recovered by centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 40 min, and resuspended in HS buffer, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Carbonate extraction of proteoliposomes was achieved by resuspending pelleted proteoliposomes containing psToc34 and psToc75 in 40 μlof 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and incubation for 20 min on ice. Proteoliposomes were recovered by centrifugation for 30 min at 18,000 × g, and the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Immunoprecipitation of Proteoliposome Proteins—Proteoliposomes were dissolved in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and applied to a column containing anti-psToc34 IgG coupled to Sepharose as previously described (9Ma Y. Kouranov A. LaSala S. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-psToc34 and anti-psToc75 (9Ma Y. Kouranov A. LaSala S. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). AtToc159 Proteoliposome Targeting Assays—Proteoliposome targeting assays were performed using 1–5 μl of freshly prepared proteoliposomes (corresponding to approximately 5 μg of protein) in import buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm GTP. Targeting reactions were initiated with the addition of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translation products and were incubated for 20 min at 26 °C in the dark. The reactions were stopped with the addition of ice-cold HS buffer and recovered by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The proteoliposomes were resuspended in 50 μl of HS buffer and incubated with or without thermolysin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice. Protease treatments were terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm in 1 ml of ice-cold HS buffer, and the liposomes were collected again by centrifugation. Finally, the proteoliposomes were resolved using SDS-PAGE and radioactive signals in dried gels were detected and quantitated using a Strom 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant version 5.2 software. Counts from proteolytic fragments of atToc159 (i.e. atToc159M) in thermolysin-treated proteoliposomes were normalized to reflect the number of methionine residues lost because of proteolysis. The GTPase Activity of AtToc33 Is Required for AtToc159 Binding—Our previous studies demonstrated that chloroplast binding and membrane insertion of atToc159 were promoted by its intrinsic GTPase activity and involved a direct interaction with atToc33 (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate whether GTP binding and the GTPase activity of atToc33 are also involved in atToc159 targeting, we studied the binding of atToc159 to a mutant of atToc33 with altered nucleotide binding and hydrolysis activities. The mutant, atToc33-G45R/K49N/S50R, contains three point mutations in the consensus G1 motif (P-loop) of the conserved GTP-binding site (Fig. 1A). A comparable mutant of pea Toc34, psToc34-G48R/K52N/S53R, previously was shown to inhibit GTP binding and hydrolysis (20Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6614-6620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To confirm the effects of the mutations, 29-kDa amino-terminal fragments of wild type atToc33 (atToc33GHis) and atToc33-G45R/K49N/S50R (atToc33GHis-G45R/K49N/S50R) containing hexahistidine tags and lacking the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane segment were expressed in E. coli, purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (Fig. 1B), and assayed for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. As predicted, the GTP hydrolytic activity (Fig. 1C) and GTP binding capacity (Fig. 1D) of atToc33GHis-G45R/K49N/S50R were reduced to 19% of wild type atToc33GHis levels. To examine the effects of the atToc33 mutations on atToc159 binding, we incubated in vitro translated full-length atToc159 or a deletion mutant corresponding to the atToc159 GTPase domain, atToc159G, with immobilized atToc33GHis or atToc33GHis-G45R/K49N/S50R in a solid phase binding assay. The assays were performed either in the presence of GTP or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GMP-P(NH)P. As previously shown, atToc33GHis binds both full-length [35S]atToc159 (17Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and [35S]atToc159G (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in the presence of GTP (Fig. 2, A, lane 2, and B, GTP). Binding is inhibited by GMP-P(NH)P (Fig. 2, A, compare lanes 2 and 5, and B) consistent with the proposal that GTP hydrolysis is required for high affinity binding (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The binding of atToc159 or atToc159G to atToc33GHis-G45R/K49N/S50R was decreased by 50 and 65%, respectively, relative to binding to wild type atToc33G (Fig. 2, A, compare lanes 2 and 3, and B, GTP). Binding to the mutant in the presence of GMP-P(NH)P was similar to the levels of binding in the presence of GTP (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 6, and B) and to the levels of binding to wild type proteins observed in the presence of GMP-P(NH)P (Fig. 2, A, compare lanes 5 and 6, and B, GMP-PNP). These results provide additional evidence that the binding of the Toc GTPases is nucleotide regulated and confirm a role for the GTPase activity of atToc33 in the binding of atToc159 to the Toc complex. The GTPase Domains of AtToc159 and AtToc33 Mediate Targeting of the Membrane Anchor of AtToc159 —The results presented in Fig. 2 and those of previous studies (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) provide convincing evidence that atToc159 targeting to the outer envelope membrane is mediated by a GTP-regulated cognate interaction between the atToc159 and atToc33 G-domains. We previously proposed that the binding of the G-domains and subsequent GTP hydrolysis results in the integration of the atToc159 M-domain into the outer envelope and assembly of functional Toc complexes (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This proposal predicts that the activities of the G-domains are required for specific targeting and integration of the atToc159 M-domain at the chloroplast surface. The complementary roles of the M-domain and G-domains in receptor binding are supported by the observation that full-length atToc159 binds with greater efficiency to both isolated chloroplasts (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and atToc33GHis (Fig. 2B) than either atToc159G or atToc159M alone. To test this hypothesis, we examined the role of the G-domains in M-domain targeting. As a first step, we studied the influence of atToc159G on the binding of in vitro translated M-domain ([35S]atToc159M) to isolated chloroplasts in trans. Isolated chloroplasts were incubated with [35S]atToc159M in the presence or absence of E. coli-expressed atToc159GHis, atToc159GHis-K868R, a mutant with reduced GTP binding and hydrolytic activity (15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), or atToc33GHis. The amount of bound [35S]atToc159M was determined after reisolation of the chloroplasts through a Percoll cushion. Integration of [35S]atToc159M into the outer membrane was assessed by treating equivalent samples of chloroplasts in the presence or absence of thermolysin. The ∼52-kDa M-domain is protected from proteolysis upon proper integration of atToc159 (14Chen K. Chen X. Schnell D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J.

Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the absence of any additions, atToc159M binds with low efficiency to isolated chloroplasts and remains protease sensitive (Fig. 3, A, lanes 2 and 3, and B). Previous studies have shown that this low level of binding represents a nonspecific interaction with the chloroplast surface (15Smith M.D."

Thus, “normoxia” for cells is an adjustable variable. In response to chronic moderate hypoxia, cells adjust their normoxia set point such that reoxygenation-dependent relative elevation of pO2 results in perceived hyperoxia. We hypothesized that O2, even in marginal relative excess of the pO2 to which cells are adjusted, results in the activation of specific O2-sensitive signal transduction pathways that alter cellular phenotype and function. Thus, reperfusion causes damage to the tissue at the focus of ischemia while triggering remodeling in the peri-infarct region by means of perceived hyperoxia. We reported first evidence demonstrating that perceived hyperoxia triggers the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to myofibroblasts by a p21-dependent mechanism (Roy, S., Khanna, S., Bickerstaff, A. A., Subramanian, S. V., Atalay, M., Bierl, M., Pendyala, S., Levy, D., Sharma, N., Venojarvi, M., Strauch, A., Orosz, C. G., and Sen, C. K. (2003) Circ. Res. 92, 264–271). Here, we sought to characterize the genomic response to perceived hyperoxia in CF using GeneChips™. Candidate genes were identified, confirmed and clustered. Cell cycle- and differentiation-associated genes represented a key target of perceived hyperoxia. Bioinformatics-assisted pathway reconstruction revealed the specific signaling processes that were sensitive to perceived hyperoxia. To test the significance of our in vitro findings, a survival model of rat heart focal ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) was investigated. A significant induction in p21 mRNA expression was observed in I-R tissue. The current results provide a comprehensive molecular definition of perceived hyperoxia in cultured CF. Furthermore, the first evidence demonstrating activation of perceived hyperoxia sensitive genes in the cardiac I-R tissue is presented.

Cellular oxygen (O2) concentrations are maintained within a narrow “normoxic” range to circumvent the risk of oxidative damage from excess O2 (hyperoxia) and of metabolic demise from insufficient O2 (hypoxia) (1Semenza G.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). pO2 ranges from 90 to below 3 torr in mammalian organs under normoxic conditions with arterial pO2 of about 100 torr or ∼14% O2 (2Porwol T. Ehleben W. Brand V. Acker H. Respir. Physiol. 2001; 128: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, “normoxia” for cells is an adjustable variable that is dependent on the specific localization of the cell in organs and functional status of the specific tissue. O2 sensing is required to adjust to physiological or pathophysiological variations in pO2. Current work in this field is almost exclusively focused on the study of hypoxia. Reoxygenation, on the other hand, has been mostly investigated in the context of oxidative injury. Ischemia in the heart results in a hypoxic area containing a central focus of near-zero O2 pressure bordered by tissue with diminished but nonzero O2 pressures. These border zones extend for several millimeters from the hypoxic core, with the O2 pressures progressively increasing from the focus to the normoxic region (3Rumsey W.L. Pawlowski M. Lejavardi N. Wilson D.F. Am. J. Physiology. 1994; 266: H1676-H1680PubMed Google Scholar). Moderate hypoxia is associated with a 30–60% decrease (∼1–3% O2)in pO2 (4Siaghy E.M. Devaux Y. Sfaksi N. Carteaux J.P.

During chronic hypoxia in the heart, cells adjust their normoxic set point such that the return to normoxic pO2 after chronic hypoxia is perceived as relative hyperoxia.

More than 90% of the interstitial cells of the myocardium are fibroblasts (5Eghbali M. Czaja M.J. Zeydel M. Weiner F.R. Zern M.A. Seifter S. Blumenfeld O.O. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1988; 20: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which actively cross-talk with myocytes to determine the quantity and quality of extracellular matrix. We have recently observed that CF, isolated from adult murine ventricle, cultured in 10 or 21% O2 (high O2, relative to the pO2 to which cells are adjusted in vivo), compared with 3% O2 (mildly hypoxic), exhibit reversible growth inhibition and a phenotype indicative of differentiation. We reported that marginal relative elevation in pO2, compared with pO2 to which cells are adjusted during chronic moderate hypoxia, serve as a signal to trigger CF differentiation and tissue remodeling. p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 was identified as a key mediator of signaling triggered by perceived hyperoxia (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, while acute insult during reperfusion may be lethal to cells localized at the focus of insult, sudden relative elevation of O2 tension in the surrounding peri-infarct ischemic tissue is expected to trigger phenotypic changes in the surviving fibroblasts that may be associated with tissue remodeling. Our current objective is 2-fold: (i) characterize the genomic responses to perceived hyperoxia in isolated cardiac fibroblasts using a DNA microarray approach and (ii) seek first in vivo evidence testing whether p21 expression is induced in the heart recovering from ischemia-reoxygenation. cardiac fibroblasts Microarray Suite, version 5.0 Data Mining Tool, version 2.0 ischemia-reperfusion. cardiac fibroblasts Microarray Suite, version 5.0 Data Mining Tool, version 2.0 ischemia-reperfusion. Experiments were performed using primary CF isolated from adult (5–6 weeks old) mouse ventricle using procedures described previously (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To identify sets of perceived hyperoxia sensitive genes in CF, we utilized the GeneChip™ approach (7Roy S. Khanna S. Bentley K. Beffrey P. Sen C.K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Roy S. Lado B.H. Khanna S. Sen C.K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CF were isolated and cultured in a moderately hypoxic condition at 3% O2 (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Five days after isolation, cells were split and exposed to either elevated (20% O2; widely interpreted as in vitro normoxia) or the same (3%) O2 tension for 20 h. Cells were harvested and the total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Targets were prepared for microarray hybridization according to previously described protocols (7Roy S. Khanna S. Bentley K. Beffrey P. Sen C.K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Roy S. Lado B.H. Khanna S. Sen C.K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To assess quality, the samples were hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to GeneChip™ test arrays. Satisfactory samples were hybridized to the mouse genome arrays (U74Av2) for the screening of over 12,000 genes and expressed sequence tags. The arrays were washed, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and were then scanned with the GeneArray scanner (Agilent Technologies) in our own facilities. To allow for statistical treatment, data were collected from three experiments. Raw data were collected and analyzed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite, version 5.0 (MAS) and Data Mining Tool, version 2.0 (DMT) software. Additional processing of data was performed using dChip software (9Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis scheme has been illustrated in Fig. 3. Statistical (t test) and comparison analysis were the two approaches utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (7Roy S. Khanna S. Bentley K. Beffrey P. Sen C.K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). t test was performed using DMT on absolute files generated from MAS. Genes that significantly (p < 0.05) changed (increased or decreased) in the perceived hyperoxia (20% O2) group compared with the 3% O2 group were selected. Next, dChip (version 1.3, Harvard University) software was used to further filter genes using following criteria: (i) fold change >1.2; (ii) t test, p < 0.05; and (iii) present call in all experimental (20% O2) samples for up-regulated genes and present call in all base-line (3% O2) samples for down-regulated genes. Using comparison analysis in MAS, nine pairwise comparisons were generated from three experiments of both 3 and 20% O2 groups. Average fold changes were calculated for both up- or down-regulated genes. Genes with 100% (9 out of 9 pairs) concordance in pairwise comparisons were selected. For data visualization, genes filtered using the statistical (t test) approach were subjected to hierarchical clustering using dChip (version 1.3) software. Functional categorization and pathway construction were performed using the following software/web resources: Gene Ontology Data Mining Tool (Affymetrix), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), GenMAPP (10Dahlquist K.D. Salomonis N. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Nat.

Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biology. 2003; http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/5/P3Google Scholar), and LocusLink (Swiss-Prot). Microarray data were verified using real-time PCR assay. mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR assay using double-stranded DNA binding dye SYBR Green-I as described previously (6Roy S. Khanna S.

F-actin (phalloidin, dilution 1:40, Molecular Probes), α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma), and p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunostaining and microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200M) were performed as described previously (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Collagen lattices were prepared using type I collagen from rat tail tendon as described previously (12Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). CF were suspended in collagen (1.25 mg/ml) and aliquoted into culture plates. Collagen matrices were incubated in a cell culture incubator for 45 min followed by overlying the gel with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum. Matrices were gently released after 24 h from the underlying culture dishes with a spatula and allowed to float in basal medium. Collagenase digestion was performed to harvest cells from collagen gel for gene expression studies. Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) of the heart. Parallel groups of rats were used as sham-operated controls. The studies were approved by the Animal Protection Committee of The Ohio State University. Rats were anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated on a positive pressure respirator with room air. The body temperature was maintained at 36–37 °C with a heated small animal operating table. A left thoracotomy was performed via the fifth intercostal space to expose the heart. A 30-min occlusion of left anterior descending coronary artery was followed by reperfusion. Laser Doppler flow measurement was used to verify I-R. Upon successful reperfusion, the thorax was closed, and negative thoracic pressure was re-established for survival. The rats were killed 2–7 days after reperfusion. For tissue harvesting, the infarcted I-R area was visualized under a dissecting microscope. Tissue samples were collected from infarcted (I-R) site as well as from a part of the left ventricle unaffected by I-R. As additional controls, tissues were collected from a location corresponding to the I-R and unaffected sites in sham-operated rats. These rats were exposed to all surgical procedures except I-R. Histochemistry—Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned (4 μm) followed by hematoxilin and eosin staining. Immunostaining—The sections were stained with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibodies to p21 (1:50; Pharmingen) or anti-ED-1 (1:100; Serotec) and either horseradish peroxidase (p21) or fluorescent (ED-1)-tagged secondary antibodies. The ED-1-stained sections were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear staining. Male C57BL6 mice (5 weeks) were exposed to pure oxygen (hyperoxia) environment for 36 h. Control mice were maintained under similar conditions in room air (normoxia). p21 mRNA levels in myocardial tissue were evaluated by real-time PCR. The effect of perceived hyperoxia on p21 mRNA expression in hearts subjected to ischemia and reperfusion was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science, (Chicago, IL). Wilcoxon test was employed to compare the difference between pair-matched normal-perfused and I-R myocardial tissue. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistics related to DNA microarray data processing are described above under “Data Analysis.” Under conditions of systemic normoxia, heart cells receive a limited supply of O2 representing less than 10% (13Winegrad S. Henrion D. Rappaport L. Samuel J.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Gonschior P. Gonschior G.M. Conzen P.F. Hobbhahn J. Goetz A.E. Peter K. Brendel W.

We have directly determined that mouse heart ventricular pO2 is in the range of 5% (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, in this work 3, 5, and 20% O2 are referred to as conditions representing mild hypoxia, normoxia, and perceived hyperoxia, respectively. Previously we have reported that the culture of isolated CF under room air (20% O2) conditions results in major phenotypic changes including increased cell size and differentiation to myofibroblasts. In addition, perceived hyperoxia induced the expression of p21 (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our current results with isolated cardiac fibroblasts demonstrate that the phenotype of freshly isolated CF may be preserved under standard culture conditions by controlling the ambient O2 condition to match the physiological pO2 to which the cells are adjusted to in vivo. Maintenance of CF at 5% O2 preserved cellular phenotype and did not result in the induction of the perceived hyperoxia-sensitive gene p21 (Fig. 1). Recently it has been identified that the study of fibroblasts in three-dimensional collagen matrices represents a powerful approach to model in vivo biology (12Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to investigative whether the perceived hyperoxia induced phenotypic changes manifest during three-dimensional culture of CF. Indeed, both cell size as well as p21 expression was clearly increased in CF cultured in three-dimensional collagen matrices (Fig. 2). Under conditions of perceived hyperoxia, CF grown in collagen matrices exhibit increased contractile properties indicative of differentiation to myofibroblasts (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings from our standard culture model are consistent with results obtained from three-dimensinal culture of CF.Fig. 2CF cultured in three-dimensional collagen matrices mimic the effect of oxygen observed in standard CF monolayer culture. Three-dimensional culture of CF in collagen gel was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, after isolation CF were cultured in either 5 or 20% O2 for 5 days. Cells were infected with adenoviral vectors carrying green fluorescent protein (Ad.GFP) gene followed by culturing the in three-dimensional collagen matrix. Images were collected 72 h after culture in three-dimensional collagen gels. B, for gene expression studies, cells were harvested from collagen gel after 72 h using collagenase digestion. RNA was extracted and p21 expression was determined using real-time PCR.

Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genome-wide effects of perceived hyperoxia, we conducted a DNA microarray analysis of O2-sensitive genes in CF. CF grown at 3 or 5% O2 exhibits comparable phenotype and growth pattern. Thus, we sought to compare the transcriptome of CF grown at 3% O2 with that of CF grown at 20% O2. The objective was to identify sets of O2-sensitive genes that would help us understand the biology of perceived hyperoxia. Three independent experiments were conducted so that appropriate data treatment could be possible. The data analysis design is illustrated in Fig. 3. Out of 12,488 probe sets screened, 5071 were present in CF at 3% O2. Exposure of CF to 21% O2 resulted in the detection of 5574 genes/expressed sequence tags as being present. Perceived hyperoxia resulted in the induction of 216 genes and down-regulation of 85 genes (Fig. 4). To obtain the biological significance of these findings, the genes sensitive to perceived hyperoxia were subjected to biological process categorization using Gene Ontology Data Mining (Affymetrix), GenMAPP, and DAVID. Fig. S1 illustrates the major functional categories identified using these approaches. Out of the 216 up-regulated probe sets uploaded, 109 had annotations for Gene Ontology biological process (Fig. S1A). For the 85 genes/expressed sequence tags down-regulated in response to perceived hyperoxia, 49 had annotations for Gene Ontology biological process (Fig. S1B). It was clear that among the annotated genes up-regulated in response to perceived hyperoxia, genes related to cell growth/maintenance and cell communications represent the largest functional categories. This finding is consistent with our previous results suggesting that perceived hyperoxia may play a key role in CF differentiation and tissue remodeling in the post-reoxygenation peri-infarct tissue. Next, genes sensitive to perceived hyperoxia were analyzed for cellular compartmentalization of their products using Gene Ontology Data Mining and DAVID. The major compartments affected are illustrated (Fig. S2). The total volume of up-regulated genes was roughly 2.5-fold higher than the down-regulated genes. Growth arrest and differentiation are largely driven by nuclear gene products. Consistently, genes with products associated with nuclear function were observed to be a large group sensitive to perceived hyperoxia. Of interest, genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins were specifically induced in response to perceived hyperoxia (Fig. S2). This finding is consistent with our claim that perceived hyperoxia potently influences cellular phenotype. To validate our DNA microarray results, the expression of select perceived hyperoxia sensitive genes were independently determined using real-time PCR. Using this approach, we typically find that the microarray approach underestimates the magnitude of change while reliably detecting the direction of change (Fig. 5A). To test the robustness of the findings, we conducted independent experiments with a more long-term O2 exposure design (Fig. 5B). These efforts led to successful verification of findings obtained from the experiments conducted for the microarray study (Fig. 5A). To obtain an understanding of how the perceived hyperoxia-sensitive genes are related with respect to signaling pathways, the candidate genes were mapped onto known pathways associated with cell cycle/death and cytoskeletal changes. GenMAPP, KEGG, and Gene Ontology tools were used to reconstruct the pathways. The relevant signaling pathways that were derived using this approach identified growth inhibition and fibroblast differentiation as two related outcomes that are induced by perceived hyperoxia (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Pathway construction based on GeneChip™ expression data. To obtain insights on perceived hyperoxia-induced changes in cell growth and differentiation on a pathway sense, the results of GeneChip™ analysis were mapped onto known pathways associated with cell cycle/death and cytoskeletal changes. GenMAPP, KEGG, and Gene Ontology were used to create the pathways. Genes shown in red ellipse are candidates identified using GeneChip™ assay that were up-regulated in 20% O2 compared with 3% O2. Green ellipses are genes that were down-regulated under conditions mentioned above. The expressions of candidates shown in red ellipse with blue outline have been independently verified using either real-time PCR or ribonuclease protection assay (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A.

The objective was to examine the post-reoxygenation tissue for the induction of p21, a key perceived hyperoxia-sensitive gene (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M.

The affected site was histologically characterized for reoxygenation injury and inflammation (Fig. 7). Staining of the affected site revealed increased presence of p21 in post-reoxygenation tissue (Fig. 8A). This finding was verified by real-time PCR (Fig. 8B). To obtain proof of principle that p21 expression in the heart is indeed sensitive to hyperoxia in vivo, male C57BL6 mice were exposed to a pure oxygen environment for 36 h. Control mice were maintained under similar conditions in room air. Evaluation of mRNA levels in myocardial tissue using real-time PCR showed multi-fold increase in the expression of p21 following hyperoxic insult (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Activation of p21 in myocardial tissue following ischemia/reperfusion and hyperoxic insult.A and B, occlusion (30 min) of left anterior descending coronary artery was followed by reperfusion for 7 days.

GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cardiac remodeling leads to changes in the extracellular matrix, and in some cases to cardiac fibrosis, a process involving myofibroblasts as an active component. Myofibroblasts are phenotypically distinct. They are larger and more stellate, proliferate slowly, and have the most prominent microfilament arrays. We have recently proposed that reoxygenation of an ischemic site, in addition to being a trigger for injury, may induce tissue remodeling. We observed that exposure to a higher pO2, relative to which cells are adjusted, induces the differentiation of CF to myofibroblasts. This is of significant relevance to cardiac tissue remodeling in the face of reoxygenationp (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the absence of robust in vivo models for chronic low flow we have turned toward the study of isolated CF, key players in tissue remodeling. The culture of isolated CF under conditions of O2-rich room air results in a clear switch of phenotype compared with the phenotype of freshly isolated CF. In this work we report direct evidence demonstrating that solely by maintaining the O2 ambience of the culture condition to a level closely matching in vivo ventricular pO2, such culture-dependent switch of phenotype may be prevented. These findings further support the contention that changes in O2 environment is a cue that CF sensitively responds to. Fibroblast biology in three-dimensional collagen matrices closely models in vivo situations (12Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, cells exhibit a distinct phenotype referred to as dendritic fibroblasts (12Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Our observation that perceived hyperoxia induces the expression of p21, increase in cell size, and differentiation to myofibroblast (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) has been confirmed in CF grown in a three-dimensional matrix. Indeed, myofibroblasts have been detected abundantly in healing myocardial reperfused infarcts (16Frangogiannis N.G. Michael L.H. Entman M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Application of the high density DNA microarray approach coupled with current bioinformatics tools enabled us to identify sets of O2-sensitive genes in CF and categorize them into functional groups. In addition, the candidate genes have been categorized with respect to the cellular localization of their products. That low O2 ambience serves as a cue to trigger angiogenesis is a well accepted notion. We have previously demonstrated that the sensing of O2 environment is not limited to hypoxia but extends to perceived hyperoxia as well (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our current report constitutes first evidence demonstrating that the culture of cells, isolated from an organ, at room air condition results in specific and significant genome-wide changes. As we strive to improve in vitro approaches to study cell biology relevant to in vivo conditions, a careful consideration of the O2-ambience is clearly warranted. Furthermore, the results provide a comprehensive definition to perceived hyperoxia establishing that cell communication and cell growth/maintenance are indeed the primary outcomes affected. Both of these processes are tightly linked to cellular differentiation and tissue remodeling (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N.

Am. 2000; 282: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently it has been proposed that many of the signaling pathways that control cellular decisions related to tissue remodeling are regulated by nuclear interactions of cell cycle proteins (18Nabel E.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, our results demonstrate that nuclear proteins represent one of the largest categories of products encoded by genes sensitive to perceived hyperoxia. Using the perceived hyperoxia-sensitive gene sets that we have identified previously (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A. Orosz C.G. Sen C.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and the sets identified in the current study, our pathway reconstruction results characterize the specific effects of perceived hyperoxia on cell cycle. Select candidate genes that have been verified using quantitative real-time PCR include p21 (6Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N.

The transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) supports p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (19Yoon H.S. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2767-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Tob is a member of the p53-independent, as well as -dependent, anti-proliferative family genes (21Tirone F. J.

A critical role of Tob in checking cell cycle is suggested by findings that mice lacking Tob are predisposed to a higher incidence of cancer (23Yoshida Y. Nakamura T. Komoda M. Satoh H. Suzuki T.

Gap junctions are widely distributed structures that mediate communication between cells. The channels that allow passage of small molecules between adjacent cells are made up of connexins that are encoded by a family of related genes. In the heart, connexins ensure electric and metabolic coupling between cells. Cell-cell communication is a key process during differentiation and typically it is down-regulated during cell proliferation. Gap junction gene A1 (Gja1) or connexin 43 is essentially required for coronary artery development and patterning (25Li W.E. Waldo K. Linask K.L. Chen T. Wessels A. Parmacek M.S. Kirby M.L. Lo C.W. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2031-2042PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a central remodeling role of this gene in the healing tissue is expected. In humans, defect in connexin 43 result in visceroatrial heterotaxia (26Britz-Cunningham S.H. Shah M.M. Zuppan C.W. Fletcher W.H. N. Engl. J.

Here we present first evidence demonstrating the induction of p21 in post-reoxygenated recovering myocardial tissue.

That low oxygen ambience serves as a cue to trigger angiogenesis is a well accepted notion. Our studies establish that the sensing of oxygen environment is not limited to hypoxia. Our studies demonstrate that in addition to being a trigger for injury as is widely recognized, reoxygenation insult has a built-in component of tissue remodeling induced by perceived hyperoxia. It is plausible that in the event of minor injuries that go unnoted in our daily lives, such remodeling serves to heal as a physiological reparative mechanism. Understanding of this physiological healing response may offer novel opportunities to manage more intense reoxygenation injuries. Download .pdf (.11 MB) Help with pdf files"

Rep. 1997; 72: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar) and is a major public health problem because chronic infection may lead to severe liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ∼9.6 kb and is a member of the Flaviviridae (2Choo Q.L. Richman K.H. Han J.H. Berger K. Lee C. Dong C. Gallegos C. Coit D. Medina-Selby R.

The genome encodes a polyprotein of some 3,000 amino acids, which is post-translationally cleaved by viral and cellular proteases to generate at least 10 viral proteins identified as structural proteins (C, E1, E2, and P7) and nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5a, and NS5b) (for a review see Refs. 4Reed K.E.

The translation of the HCV polyprotein is regulated by the highly structured 5′-noncoding region acting as an internal ribosome entry site (for a review see Ref. 6Rijnbrand R.C.A. Lemon S.M. Curr.

The HCV core protein is 191 amino acids in length and consists of three distinct predicted domains: an N-terminal two-third domain of highly positively charged amino acids, a C-terminal one-third domain of hydrophobic residues, and the last 20 or so residues serving as the signal peptide for the downstream protein E1 (7Grakoui A.

RNA. 2001; 7: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) stated that a cluster of unusually conserved synonymous codons in this core-coding region indicated a potential overlapping open reading frame. Specific IgGs for three of four peptides derived from this alternate reading frame protein were detected in chronic HCV sera. Xu et al. (15Xu Z. Choi J. Yen T.S. Lu W. Strohecker A. Govindarajan S. Chien D. Selby M.J. Ou J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3840-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) reported both the in vitro and the in vivo synthesis of a 17-kDa core protein resulting from a -2/+1 ribosomal frameshift that was named “F protein.” Here again, antibodies specific for this protein were detected in sera from HCV-infected patients. F protein might be related to a 16-17-kDa protein (P16) previously observed in mammalian cells expression studies in addition to P21 and P23 and initially thought to be a truncated form of core protein (18Lo S.Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. Ou J.H. Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). More recently, Choi et al. (19Choi J. Xu Z. Ou J.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported the possibility of multiple frameshifting events at or around codon 11 in core sequence of genotype 1a. In addition to the F protein caused by -2/+1 frameshifting, a 1.5-kDa protein could also be produced by -1/+2 frameshifting. We report here the production in Escherichia coli of alternative forms of the HCV core protein from genotype 1b resulting from a +1 ribosomal frameshift at codon 42 that can be followed by a rephasing in the 0 frame that bypass the stop codon at position 144. The exact positions of both of these recoding events were determined by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. The ability of the corresponding nucleotide sequences surrounding the shift sites to induce recoding in a eukaryotic translational context was demonstrated both by an in vitro transcription/translation assay in a reticulocyte lysate and by expression in culture cells. Finally, immunological analysis using various synthetic peptides revealed the presence of antibodies directed against the +1 core reading frame in several sera of HCV-positive patients of genotype 1a or 1b. However, the differences of reactivity against these peptides support our finding that the frameshifting site leading to F protein is different in genotypes 1a and 1b. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—A 507-bp fragment corresponding to amino acids 1-169 of the HCV core protein (CHCV1-169) was amplified by PCR from sequence with EMBL accession number D89872 encoded by the plasmid PCMV-C980 (a gift from Dr. Shimotohno) and two specific primers containing a NdeI site or a PstI site, respectively. The NdeI-PstI fragment was cloned into the expression vector pT7-7 (His6) (20Cortay J.C. Negre D. Scarabel M. Ramseier T.M. Vartak N.B. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14885-14891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHCV1-169 carrying a polyhistidine fused to the C terminus (CHCV1-169(His6)) was expressed from the resulting plasmid after transformation in the E. coli strain BL21 SI (Invitrogen) producing T7 RNA polymerase. E. coli BL21 SI was transformed with the plasmid, and transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium without NaCl until the culture reached an A 600 of 0.7. Expression was induced by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm. Incubation was continued for a further 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml benzonase. The cells were lysed using an SLM-Aminco French press at 1,200 p.s.i. followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 6 m urea, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% dodecylmaltoside (Buffer A), then homogenized by sonication, and centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was submitted to a second urea extraction as described above. Both supernatants were pooled and loaded over a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer A and then with 3 volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and the proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The fractions containing CHCV1-169(His6) were pooled and subjected to reversed phase HPLC on a VYDAC C8 column (300 Å, 10 μm, 10 × 250 mm) equipped with a C8 Aquapore guard column (Brownlee, 4.6 × 30 mm) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 10% trifluoroacetic acid at 1.5 ml/min flow rate. The linear gradient steps were performed using Waters 510 HPLC pumps as follows: 0 min, 25% acetonitrile; 0-5 min, 35% acetonitrile; 5-20 min, 50% acetonitrile; 20-50 min, 60% acetonitrile; and 50-60 min, 100% acetonitrile. Chromatography was monitored at 220 and 280 nm using a Waters 991 photodiode array detector. Proteins corresponding to the main peaks were lyophilized and identified by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. Mass Spectrometry and Peptide Sequencing—All liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analyses were carried out using a Sciex API 165 quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to an Applied Biosystem ABI 140D capillary LC system. The mass spectrometer was operated using two electrospray ionization sources (microspray and ionspray) in the positive ion mode. The microspray source was used for the direct infusion of protein solutions with 0.2 μl/min flow rate in a CH3OH/H2O (50/50, v/v) mixture containing 0.1% of HCOOH. LC/MS was carried out on a C18 HPLC microcolumn (Brownlee, 150 × 0.5-mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min connected to a 785A absorbance detector (Applied Biosystems) and an ionspray source. The V8-digested peptides were separated using mobile phases A and B with a four-step linear gradient of 10% B in the first 5 min, followed by 10-70% B in the next 60 min, and then 70-95% B for 10 min and hold at 95% B in the last 10 min (mobile phase A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; mobile phase B, 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN/H2O, (90/10, v/v). Absorbance detection was set at 214 nm. The scan range was set at m/z 700-2200. The peptides were sequenced by automatic Edman degradation using a Procise 492A liquid phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—A DNA fragment from nucleotide 100 to nucleotide 200 of the HCV core protein coding sequence was inserted into the unique NheI cloning site of the plasmid pQBI T7-GFP (Quantum Biotechnologies). This construct allows the expression, under the control of a T7 promoter, of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the C terminus of the inserted sequence (Fig. 1). The resulting plasmids were used for in vitro transcription/translation assays in reticulocyte lysates (TnT® T7 reticulocyte lysate; Promega) containing 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same constructions were made with a DNA sequence from nucleotide 412 to nucleotide 480 (Fig. 1). The resulting plasmids were used for in vitro transcription/translation assays in a reticulocyte lysate as described above. For immunoprecipitation, monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (monoclonal antibody 3E6; Q.BIOgene) was conjugated to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Antibody-conjugated beads were then equilibrated in nondenaturing lysis buffer (1% Triton (w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and added to 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate in 500 μl of nondenaturing lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. After repeated washing with wash buffer (lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton), the proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiographed, and scanned using a STORM 860 (Molecular Dynamics) PhosphorImager. Expression in Culture Cells—The DNA fragments described above and used to test the ability of the corresponding RNA sequences to direct frameshifting in a reticulocyte lysate assay were used for cellular expression. They were cloned into the unique NheI site of the plasmid pQBI25-fPA (Quantum Biotechnologies). These constructs allow the expression, under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, of GFP fused to the C terminus of the inserted sequence (Fig. 1). HeLa cells were grown and maintained in Glasgow minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). For transfection, the cells were washed, treated with trypsin and plated in an 8-chamber culture slide (Falcon) at the required density in a humidified CO2 incubator (5%) at 37 °C overnight. The cells were transfected by calcium phosphate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 16 h after transfection, the cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min, and the nuclei were stained in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Immunoblotting—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes with a blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. Monoclonal anti-core antibody (AbCys) (1/5,000 dilution) and phosphatase alkaline-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G IgG (H+L) (1/1,000 dilution; Bio-Rad) were used to detect the expression of HCV core protein. A SuperSignal® West HisProbe™ Kit (Pierce) was used to detect His6-tagged proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme Immunoassay—Three synthetic peptides encoded in the +1 ORF of core and predicted to be antigenic were obtained by chemical synthesis: peptide F1 (core (11-25), NVTPTAAHRTLSSRA), peptide F2 (Core (46-60), ARLGRLPSGRNLVEG), and peptide F3 (Core (106-120), GAPQTPGVGRVIWVR). For the enzyme immunoassay, the wells of a microtiter plate were coated with 0.5 μg of peptide and incubated with 10 μl of human serum and 90 μl of diluent at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed and subsequently incubated with 100 μl of a 1:3,000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human antibody (Pierce). The wells were washed again and allowed to react with 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and H2O2 for color development. The reaction was analyzed at 405 nm in a Dynex MRX microplate reader. Identification of Alternative Forms of HCV Core Protein—Expression of a plasmid coding for the HCV core protein fragment CHCV1-169(His6) led to the production of protein found predominantly in the inclusion bodies. The proteins were extracted with 6 m urea in the presence of 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the presence of polyhistidine fused to the C terminus permitted its purification on Ni-NTA-agarose. A second purification step on reverse phase HPLC permitted the separation of CHCV1-169(His6) (peak 5) from minor peaks (peaks 1-4) that represented about 35% of total protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Mass spectrometry analysis of peak 5 gave a molecular mass of 19,421 Da that corresponded to CHCV2-169(His6) (Table I) and thus indicated the removal of the N-terminal methionine residue. Analysis of minor peaks by immunoblotting showed that they all reacted with an antibody directed against the N terminus of the core protein (Fig. 2C) and with an anti-His6 antibody (Fig. 2D). Therefore, fractions 1-4 eluting earlier than CHCV2-169(His6) by reverse phase HPLC contained proteins harboring both the N and C termini of CHCV2-169(His6) but exhibiting a lower molecular mass. Mass spectrometry analysis gave molecular masses of 18,381 Da (peak 1), 18,282 Da (peak 2), 18,395 Da (peak 3), and 18,335 Da (peak 4) that were incompatible with proteolytic cleavages at the N terminus of CHCV2-169(His6) and represent alternative forms of CHCV2-169(His6) as demonstrated below. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis also revealed that some of these proteins formed dimers that were resistant to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, B-D, lanes 1-3).Table IMass determination and amino acid sequencing of endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage productsCHCV(2-169)His6 (molecular mass 19,421 Da)aFragments of CHCV(2—169)His6 (peak 5) and of peak 3 (i.e. DFCHCV protein) resulting from 3 h of endoproteinase GluC proteolysis were submitted to LC/MS analysis and peptide sequencing as described under “Experimental Procedures”DFCHCV (peak 3) (molecular mass 18,395 Da)aFragments of CHCV(2—169)His6 (peak 5) and of peak 3 (i.e. DFCHCV protein) resulting from 3 h of endoproteinase GluC proteolysis were submitted to LC/MS analysis and peptide sequencing as described under “Experimental Procedures”MasssequenceMassSequence determinedbThe sequence underlined is coded by the +1 ORF.

The sequence in bold italics was deduced from tryptic cleavage analysis by LC/MS (see the text) Open table in a new tab Alternative Core Proteins Result from Multiple Recoding Events—To obtain the full-length amino acid sequences, the protein eluting at peaks 1-4 from the HPLC chromatography (Fig. 2A) and CHCV2-169(His6) (Fig. 2A, peak 5) were submitted to V8 proteolysis. The patterns of V8 proteolysis of these proteins were very similar but were very different from that of CHCV2-169(His6) (result not shown). LC/MS analysis revealed that V8 fragments obtained from CHCV2-169(His6) had molecular masses identical to those predicted from their amino acid sequences (Table I). In the case of the alternative protein, the presence of a 1974-Da fragment corresponding to the C terminus of CHCV2-169(His6) confirmed the previous finding concerning the reactivity of this protein with an anti-His6 antibody (Fig. 2D). In contrast, fragments of 6539 and 9920 Da were not consistent with V8 proteolysis fragments of CHCV2-169(His6). Each of these two fragments was submitted to chemical amino acid sequencing. As shown in Table I, the 6539-Da fragment corresponded to the first 40 amino acids of CHCV2-169(His6) followed by 18 amino acids resulting from a +1 ribosomal frameshift in the core protein coding sequence. This frameshifting occurred at codon 42 in the core protein coding sequence and resulted in the reading of a GGU codon coding for Gly in the +1 ORF instead of the reading of an AGG codon coding for Arg in the 0 ORF (Fig. 3). The 9920-Da fragment was too long for complete sequencing but sequencing of its N terminus gave the sequence GDNLSPRL, corresponding to the continuation of translation in the +1 ORF (Table I). The presence of the 1,974 Da fragment corresponding to the C terminus in the 0 ORF strongly suggested the occurrence, in the 9,920 Da fragment, of a translational event leading to rephasing in the 0 ORF. This rephasing event should have occurred before or at the termination codon at position 144 in the +1 ORF. To test this hypothesis, extensive tryptic cleavage of the 9920-Da fragment was carried out, and the peptide mixture was analyzed by LC/MS. All of the fragments could be attributed to sequences in the 0 or +1 ORF except for a fragment at m/z 1,009.6 for [M+H]+ corresponding to the peptide straddling the rephasing site in the 0 ORF. Looking at the collision source fragmentation, we observed abundant and characteristic y ion fragments at m/z 896.5 (y10), 809.4 (y9), 738.5 (y8), 641.5 (y7), 544.4 (y6), and 431.4 (y5) according to the notation proposed by Roepstorff and Fohlman (21Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar). These fragment ions corresponded to the amino acid sequence LSAPPL, which matched the predicted sequence LSAPPLGGAAR resulting from a -1 frameshift. The molecular mass of 9920 Da is consistent with the occurrence of a -1 frameshift at the UAG termination codon in the +1 ORF. This frameshift results in the reading of a CUA codon coding for Leu and allows translation to continue in the 0 ORF, leading to the recurrence of the usual C-terminal core protein sequence in the alternative protein (Fig. 3). In conclusion, the protein eluted at peak 3 results both from a +1 frameshift at codon 42 and a -1 frameshift at codon 144, leading to an alternative core protein containing the first 42 amino acids of the core protein, 101 residues coded by the +1 ORF, and then residues 144 to the His6 tag of the core protein. This protein is thus an alternative form of core and was named DFCHCV (double frameshifted core) protein. The other minor protein fractions eluting from HPLC chromatography (Fig. 2A, peaks 1, 2, and 4) were also submitted to extensive tryptic cleavage, and peptide mixtures were submitted to LC/MS. All of the fragments, including that corresponding to the +1 frameshift site at codon 42 could, in all cases, be attributed to sequences present in the DFC protein except for the fragment straddling the -1 frameshift site. As reported in Table II, the protein from peak 1 contained a tryptic peptide that could be attributed to two +1 frameshift events at codons 144 and 145 in the +1 ORF. The protein from peak 2 contained a tryptic peptide that could be attributed to a +2 frameshift event at codon 144 in the +1 ORF. Finally, the fraction from peak 4 contained a tryptic peptide that could be attributed to the same -1 frameshift, as observed in DFC protein (at codon 144) together with the bypass of the codon 145 or 146 (both of them coding for Gly). All of these events lead to a rephasing in the 0 ORF of the core coding sequence. Integration of the peaks from the reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 1) gave the following ratios: 68% for CHCV2-169(His6), 9% for peak 1, 3% for peak 2, 18% for peak 3, and 2% for peak 4. It is worth mentioning that the alternative core protein resulting from the +1 frameshift only (i.e. ending at the termination codon in the +1 ORF without occurrence of the -1 frameshift) was found in the flow through fraction of the Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography as expected because it did not harbor the C-terminal His6 tag. It was characterized by immunoprecipitation (using an anti-core antibody directed against the N terminus of core protein) followed by reverse phase HPLC purification and mass spectroscopy (data not shown). The ratio of this protein fraction was estimated to be equivalent to the sum of fractions from peaks 1 to 4.Table IIAmino acid sequences observed in alternative core proteins at the second frameshift site (termination codon 144 in the +1 ORF) Sequences Including the Shift Sites Direct Recoding Both in a Eukaryotic in Vitro Transcription/Translation Assay and in Culture Cells—To test the ability of the sequence including codon 42 (nucleotides 126-128) to direct +1 frameshifting in a eukaryotic translational context, the core DNA sequence from nucleotides 100 to 200 was inserted into a plasmid upstream from the gene coding for GFP used as a reporter protein. Three constructs were made for which the DNA coding for GFP was fused in the three reading frames with regard to the upstream inserted sequence (Fig. 1). As can be seen in Fig. 4A, expression of the resulting plasmids in a reticulocyte lysate yielded a large amount of fused GFP cloned in the 0 frame (lane 4). Interestingly, a low but detectable amount of fused GFP cloned in the -1 frame attests for the occurrence of a +1 frameshifting (lane 3). In contrast, no fused GFP cloned in the +1 frame was detected (lane 5). These results are to be compared with a blank without plasmid (lane 1) and with the control GFP plasmid (lane 2). The amount of +1 frameshifting was determined to be 1.9% when compared with the product of the control GFP plasmid taken as 100% (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 2, respectively). The core DNA sequence used in the in vitro reticulocyte lysate assay described above were cloned into a plasmid, permitting the production of fused GFP under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 1). As can be seen in Fig. 5, the results obtained confirmed those obtained in the reticulocyte lysate assay. The sequence used to test the occurrence of a +1 frameshifting led to the production of GFP in the cells when the protein was cloned either in the -1 frame (Fig. 5A) or in the 0 frame (Fig. 5B) but did not lead to the production of GFP when it was cloned in the +1 frame (Fig. 5C). Hence this sequence is able to direct +1 ribosomal frameshifting in a cellular context.Fig. 5Cellular expression of the GFP fusion constructs.

PABP is composed of two parts: the highly conserved N terminus, containing 4 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) responsible for poly(A) and eIF4G binding; and the more variable C terminus, which includes the recently described PABC domain, and promotes intermolecular interaction between PABP molecules as well as cooperative binding to poly(A). Here we show that, in vitro, GST-PABP represses the translation of reporter mRNAs containing 20 or more A residues in their 5′-untranslated regions and remains effective as a repressor when an A61 tract is placed at different distances from the cap, up to 126 nucleotides. Deletion of the PABP C terminus, but not the PABC domain alone, significantly reduces its ability to inhibit translation when bound to sequences distal to the cap, but not to proximal ones. Moreover, cooperative binding by multiple PABP molecules to poly(A) requires the C terminus, but not the PABC domain. Further analysis using pull-down assays shows that the interaction between PABP molecules, mediated by the C terminus, does not require the PABC domain and is enhanced by the presence of RRM 4. In vivo, fusion proteins containing parts of the PABP C terminus fused to the viral coat protein MS2 have an enhanced ability to prevent the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter mRNAs containing the MS2 binding site at distal distances from the cap. Altogether, our results identify a proline- and glutamine-rich linker located between the RRMs and the PABC domain as being strictly required for PABP/PABP interaction, cooperative binding to poly(A) and enhanced translational repression of reporter mRNAs in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2016084261,"Modulation of the cytoskeletal architecture was shown to regulate the expression of CTGF (connective tissue growth factor, CCN2). The microtubule disrupting agents nocodazole and colchicine strongly up-regulated CTGF expression, which was prevented upon stabilization of the microtubules by paclitaxel. As a consequence of microtubule disruption, RhoA was activated and the actin stress fibers were stabilized. Both effects were related to CTGF induction. Overexpression of constitutively active RhoA induced CTGF synthesis. Interference with RhoA signaling by simvastatin, toxinB, C3 toxin, and Y27632 prevented up-regulation of CTGF. Likewise, direct disintegration of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin B interfered with nocodazole-mediated up-regulation of CTGF expression. Disassembly of actin fibers by cytochalasin D, however, unexpectedly increased CTGF expression indicating that the content of F-actin per se was not the major determinant for CTGF gene expression. Given the fact that cytochalasin D sequesters G-actin, a decrease in G-actin increased CTGF, while increased levels of G-actin corresponded to reduced CTGF expression. These data link alterations in the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton to the expression of CTGF and provide a molecular basis for the observation that CTGF is up-regulated in cells exposed to mechanical stress.

These data link alterations in the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton to the expression of CTGF and provide a molecular basis for the observation that CTGF is up-regulated in cells exposed to mechanical stress. In closing wounds or developing fibrotic tissue fibroblasts are exposed to massive mechanical stress, which leads to alterations in cell morphology and reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The impact of morphological changes on gene expression has been analyzed in model systems such as the one described by Grinnell et al. (1Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Lin Y.C. Skuta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 918-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), where fibroblasts are cultured in collagen gels under stressed or relaxed conditions. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) 1The abbreviations used are: CTGF, connective tissue growth factor, CCN2; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; DRB, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAP, mitogen-associated protein.1The abbreviations used are: CTGF, connective tissue growth factor, CCN2; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; DRB, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAP, mitogen-associated protein. was among those genes that showed the most striking up-regulation by mechanical stress when cDNA assays were used to compare gene expression in fibroblasts cultured under mechanically stressed conditions and cells cultured in relaxed collagen I gels (2Kessler D.

Cell Res. 2002; 274: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CTGF is a cysteine-rich secreted protein, which functions as modulator of complex cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, adhesion, and migration (4Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Because high levels of CTGF are observed during wound healing and in fibrotic lesions, and CTGF induces the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, it is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis (5Ihn H. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2002; 14: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The fibrogenic growth factor transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is one of the major inducers of CTGF expression, but other mediators implicated in organ injury and wound healing such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), serotonin, or angiotensin II can also directly increase CTGF levels (e.g. see Refs. 6Hahn A. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Lanz T. Zenkel S. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37429-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Eberlein M.

Grondin J.M. Yee J. Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or by static pressure (10Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Nakaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16797-16803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) likewise increased CTGF expression, pointing to changes in the cell architecture as modulator of CTGF gene expression. An intact actin cytoskeleton proved to be necessary for the induction of CTGF by exogenous stimuli as shown by cytochalasin D treatment, which directly interrupts filamentous actin. Pretreatment of mesangial cells or renal fibroblasts with cytochalasin D reduced the inducibility of CTGF by LPA or TGFβ (6Hahn A. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Lanz T. Zenkel S. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37429-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Eberlein M. Abdel Wahab N. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the Rho family, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (11Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 12Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Inhibition of RhoA signaling rapidly disassembles actin stress fibers, leaving cortical actin fibers intact. Furthermore, inhibition of the activity of RhoA by C3 exotransferase or inhibition of the downstream Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) by the compound Y27632 prevented induction of CTGF by TGFβ or LPA (7Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Eberlein M. Abdel Wahab N. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data support a role of the actin cytoskeleton in the regulation of CTGF expression not excluding other signaling pathways. The actin cytoskeleton is closely linked to the microtubule network, regulating cell motility and maintenance of cell shape (13Small J.V. Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Rottner K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Formation of actin stress fibers was observed upon disruption of microtubuli by drugs like colcemid or vinblastine (14Enomoto T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Liu B.P. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the presence of inhibitors of RhoA, stress fiber formation was prevented establishing RhoA as a link between micotubules and actin fibers. Direct evidence for RhoA activation by microtubule destabilizing agents was obtained in Swiss 3T3 cells (16Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar), and this activation was possibly mediated by p190RhoGEF which binds to microtubules (17van Horck F.P.

These results lead to the hypothesis that alterations in the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton might be molecular mechanisms underlying the up-regulation of CTGF observed in cells under pressure (2Kessler D. Dethlefsen S. Haase I. Ploman M. Hirche F. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36575-36585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 3Schild C. Trueb B. Exp.

In the present study, we show that disruption of microtubules by low concentrations of colchicine or nocodazole strongly up-regulates CTGF expression. This enhanced up-regulation was dependent on RhoA activity and actin dynamics. Opposite effects of the actin depolymerizing agents cytochalasin D and latrunculin B were observed and further substantiate the complex interactions between actin structures and CTGF gene expression. Our data support the notion that under pathophysiological conditions RhoA plays a central role in integrating signals of profibrotic stimuli and mechanical forces to up-regulate proteins such as CTGF. Materials—Nocodazole, colchicine, paclitaxel (taxol), jasplakinolide, PD98059, cytochalasin D, latrunculin B, and DRB (5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside) were obtained from Merck Biosciences, Bad Soden, Germany. Accutase™ was from PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria. Y27632 was kindly provided by Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Osaka, Japan, simvastatin by Merck Sharp and Dohme, München, Germany. Simvastatin was dissolved in ethanol and activated as described by Jakobisiak et al. (18Jakobisiak M. Bruno S. Skierski J.S. Darzynkiewicz Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3628-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Toxin B from clostridium difficile and C3 toxin from clostridium limosum were kindly provided by Drs. F. Hofmann and K. Aktories, Freiburg, Germany (19Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). For delivery of C3 toxin into cells, the C2IN-C3 fusion toxin was used together with the C2II binding component of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin (20Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Immortalized human renal fibroblasts (21Müller G.A. Frank J. Rodemann H.P. Engler-Blum G. Exp. Nephrol. 1995; 3: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (7Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Eberlein M. Abdel Wahab N. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Goppelt-Struebe M. Hahn A. Iwanciw D. Banas B. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 3: 176-179Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were characterized in detail and shown to maintain many characteristics of primary fibroblasts (21Müller G.A. Frank J. Rodemann H.P. Engler-Blum G. Exp. Nephrol. 1995; 3: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to the experiments, cells at subconfluence were serumstarved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 1 day. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed by standard techniques as described previously (23Stroebel M. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22952-22957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed with cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Non-aPrimer kit from Appligene, Heidelberg, Germany. A cDNA specific for CTGF was kindly provided by N. Abdel-Wahab, London, UK (24Wahab N.A. Yevdokimova N. Weston B.S. Roberts T. Li X.J. Brinkman H. Mason R.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The blots were analyzed by phosphorimager or autoradiography. Quantitative analysis of the autoradiographs was performed by densitometric scanning. All values were corrected for differences in RNA loading by calculating the ratio of CTGF to 18 or 28 S rRNA expression. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (25Eberlein M. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Goppelt-Struebe M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). CTGF was detected in cellular homogenates. In brief, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped in 90 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride). Lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min to collect supernatants. 30 μg of total protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto fluorotrans transfer membrane (Pall, Biosupport Division, Dreieich, Germany). The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal anti-CTGF, monoclonal anti-RhoA, and polyconal anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). The peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Freiburg, Germany), and the anti-goat secondary antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Overexpression of RhoA—The human renal fibroblasts were transfected with Exgen (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) following the instructions of the manufacturer. RhoA V14 cDNA (constitutively active RhoA) was kindly provided by K. Aktories, Freiburg, Germany. It was cloned as a BamHI/EcoRI frament into pcDNA 3.1 and as a Hin-dIII/EcoRI fragment into pEGFP-C3 vectors. Empty vectors were used as control. 24 h after transfection, cellular homogenates were obtained and analyzed for CTGF expression by Western blot analysis Immuncytochemistry—Actin filaments were stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) as described previously (7Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Eberlein M. Abdel Wahab N. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were cultured and growth arrested on glass 8-well multitest glass slides (ICN) placed in a Petri dish. After treatment with the stimuli, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 7 min at room temperature before staining with rhodamine phalloidin. Actin fibers were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Microtubules were detected with anti-tubulin (Tebu, Frankfurt, Germany) and anti-Cy2-conjugated antimouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) as secondary antiboy. Tubulin structures were analyzed by confocal laser microscopy. Detection of Active RhoA—Recombinant GST-TRBD fusion protein encoding the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin, amino acids 7–89, was used as an activation specific probe for RhoA-GTP (26Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of GTP-bound RhoA, stimulated fibroblasts were washed with ice-cold TBS (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and lysed in 500 μl of Rho-RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenized cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay, Pierce (Sankt Augustin, Germany). Aliquots of the cell lysates (1 mg of protein) in 500 μl of Rho-RIPA buffer were mixed with 20–40 μg of GST fusion protein immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and the mixture was rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 300 μl each of wash buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were resuspended in SDS-gel loading buffer, proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Equal loading of GST fusion proteins and protein transfer were controlled by Ponceau S staining, Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Precipitated RhoA proteins were detected by using anti-RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) and ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Morphological Changes Induced by Nocodazole or Colchicine—To detect the influence of microtubule disrupting agents on the cytoskeletal architecture of immortalized human renal fibroblasts, the cells were incubated with low concentrations of colchicine (1 μm) or nocodazole (1 μm). The actin cytoskeleton was visualized by rhodamine phalloidin staining, and the microtubules were detected by immunocytochemistry. Treatment for 1 h disrupted microtubular structures and increased cell spanning actin stress fibers (Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence images showed that tubulin was no longer detected in fine elongated fibers but appeared as patches distributed within the cytosol. Actin stress fibers, which were sparsely visible in resting fibroblasts, were markedly intensified after disruption of the microtubules, pointing to an interaction of the microtubule system and the actin cytoskeleton in these cells. Characterization of CTGF Up-regulation by Microtubule Disrupting Agents—Next, it was investigated whether disruption of the microtubular network modulated CTGF expression. CTGF mRNA was rapidly up-regulated when the fibroblasts were treated with nocodazole or colchicine (1 μm) for 1–5 h (Fig. 2A). Maximal CTGF mRNA levels were obtained after 1 to 2 h, and comparative analysis revealed the nocodazole-mediated increase being more rapid than the colchicine-mediated upregulation of CTGF mRNA (Fig. 2B). CTGF mRNA levels remained elevated for several hours. Consistently, a long lasting increase of CTGF protein was detectable in the cellular homogenates, which contained intracellular protein and secreted CTGF protein that remained attached to the cells (Fig. 2C). Induction of CTGF expression was dependent on the nocodazole concentration, stimulation still being detectable at 0.1 μm nocodazole (Fig. 2D). Induction of CTGF by colchicine or nocodazole was not restricted to the human fibroblast cell line but also observed in other cell types, such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts, primary cultures of mesangial cells, or endothelial cells (data not shown). In contrast to the microtubule disrupting agents nocodazole and colchicine, there was no significant effect of paclitaxel (taxol), a microtubule stabilizing agent, on CTGF expression measured from 1–5 h (Fig. 2E and data not shown). Furthermore, stabilization of the microtubuli by paclitaxel prevented induction of CTGF by nocodazole or colchicine (Fig. 2E), indicating that disruption of the microtubuli was essential for the induction of CTGF. The rapid induction of CTGF mRNA within 1 h suggested transcriptional regulation. This was supported by the use of DRB, an inhibitor of transcription. When DRB was added after 1 h during the initial phase of increased synthesis of CTGF mRNA, the further increase was blunted (Fig. 3). DRB added during the phase of mRNA decrease (after 3 h, as shown in Fig. 3) did not affect the stability of the mRNA. RhoA as a Mediator of CTGF Expression—Previous studies had shown that Rho proteins are involved in the regulation of CTGF induction by external stimuli (6Hahn A. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Lanz T. Zenkel S. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37429-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here we show that pretreatment of the cells with simvastatin, which interferes with protein isoprenylation, or toxinB, which inactivates proteins of the Rho family, prevented the induction of CTGF expression by nocodazole or colchicine (Fig. 4A). Specific inhibition of ROCK by the compound Y27632 similarly reduced CTGF expression, indicating that the RhoA-ROCK pathway serves as a linker between disruption of microtubular structures and CTGF gene expression. CTGF mRNA levels in the presence of 1 μm nocodazole were reduced to 23 + 11% (means ± S.D., n = 4) by pretreatment with 10 μm Y27632. Specific inhibition of RhoA signaling by C3 toxin decreased colchicine-mediated induction of CTGF (Fig. 4B). In line with data in the literature, C3 toxin proved to be less effective than Y27632, possibly due to its poor penetration of the cells even as C2-C3 complex (27Galle J. Mameghani A. Bolz S.S. Gambaryan S. Gorg M. Quaschning T. Raff U. Barth H. Seibold S. Wanner C. Pohl U. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In accordance with this interpretation, changes in the actin cytoskeleton were less pronounced with C3 exotoxin than with Y27632 (data not shown). Involvement of RhoA in CTGF expression was confirmed by overexpression of constitutively active RhoA (RhoA V14). Two different constructs were used for transfection, resulting in essentially the same results (Fig. 4C). The transfection process per se led to an increase in CTGF expression which was increased 3-fold by the overexpression of active RhoA for 24 h. Essentially the same data were obtained in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, data not shown). In contrast to the RhoA signaling pathway, only a minor contribution of p42/44 MAP kinase signaling was observed. Pretreatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm) reduced CTGF induction by about 20% and completely inhibited CTGF protein expression together with Y27632 (Fig. 4D). To analyze whether disruption of microtubules by nocodazole or colchicine resulted in activation of RhoA, the GTP-bound form of RhoA was detected by an in vitro pull down assay with GST-Rhotekin as binding partner. As a positive control, the cells were stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid for 4 min (Fig. 5A). Treatment of the fibroblasts with nocodazole or colchicine for 10 min resulted in a marked activation of RhoA. To separate the effects of activated RhoA on gene expression and stress fiber organization, the cells were treated with Y27532 for only 15 min. This time period was sufficient to completely disintegrate all stress fibers, which are detectable in nontreated cells as shown in Fig. 5B. Additionally, pretreatment with Y27632 for 15 min was also sufficient to prevent induction of CTGF gene expression (Fig. 5C). Therefore, it was not possible to separate RhoA-ROCK-mediated changes in the actin cytoskeleton from RhoA-mediated gene expression by kinetic experiments. However, the results clearly demonstrated that activation of RhoA and its downstream signaling were essential for the induction of CTGF gene expression by nocodazole or colchicine. Fibroblasts are adherent cells, and the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be intimately linked to focal contacts in cells grown in cell cultures dishes. To investigate the role of adherence in CTGF expression, the fibroblasts were detached from the culture dishes by accutase, which also prevented re-adherence. After 5 min of detachment, the cells were stimulated with nocodazole. The detachment proved to be sufficient to slightly up-regulate CTGF within 30 min (Fig. 6). Treatment of the detached cells with nocodazole further up-regulated CTGF, indicating that attachment of the cells was not a prerequisite for CTGF induction by disruption of microtubuli. At the protein level, a 3-fold increase was observed after 1 h of treatment (3.0 ± 0.6, means ± S.D., n = 3 independent experiments). A partial inhibition was observed when the cells were pretreated with C3 toxin or Y27632 prior to the detachment, indicative of additional signaling pathways involved in CTGF up-regulation under these conditions. Modulation of CTGF by Changes in the Actin Cytoskeleton—To more directly evaluate the modulation of CTGF gene expression by alterations of the actin cytoskeleton, cells were treated with jasplakinolide, which stabilizes actin stress fibers independently of the activation of RhoA (28Bubb M.R. Spector I. Beyer B.B. Fosen K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of jasplakinolide resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in CTGF mRNA expression concomitant with a stabilization of the actin filament network (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin B reduced basal CTGF expression by about 50% (reduction to 52 ± 8%, means ± S.D. in n = 3 independent experiments) and prevented nocodazole-mediated up-regulation of CTGF (Fig. 7B). Disruption of the cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D, however, transiently increased CTGF (Fig. 6C). Maximal expression was observed after 1 h (4.7 + 1.7-fold induction by 1 μm cytochalasin D, means ± S.D. in n = 6 independent experiments). Treatment of the cells with 2 μm cytochalasin D led to a similar stimulation, while lower concentrations of cytochalasin D (0.5 μm) were slightly less effective (data not shown). The different effects of latrunculin B and cytochalasin D on CTGF expression suggested that structured F-actin per se was not essential for CTGF expression, because stress fibers were disintegrated by both compounds as shown by fluorescence staining (Fig. 7, B and C). Compared with latrunculin B, cytochalasin D-mediated disruption of stress fibers was accompanied by an aggregation of actin within the cytosol. The current studies show that regulation of CTGF is modulated by changes in the microtubular as well as actin fiber network, thereby connecting expression of CTGF to changes in cell morphology. Up-regulation of CTGF mRNA and protein was observed within 1 h after treatment of the cells with low concentrations of nocodazole or colchicine. Kinetics were consistently faster with nocodazole than with colchicine, but no functional differences were observed between both drugs. Stabilization of the microtubules by paclitaxel completely prevented up-regulation of CTGF relating the effect of both drugs to the disruption of the microtubular network. Prolonged incubation with colchicine or nocodazole led to apoptosis of the fibroblasts, 2C. Ott, D. Iwanciw, A. Graness, K. Giehl, and M. Goppelt-Struebe, unpublished results. which was not observed during the short period of time necessary to induce CTGF expression. There are few examples documented in the literature linking microtubule disruption to gene expression. Expression of the early response gene cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) was reported to be sensitive to chemical disruption of microtubuli but also to stabilization of the microtubule by paclitaxel (29Subbaramaiah K. Hart J.C. Norton L. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14838-14845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In contrast to these data, CTGF expression was inhibited rather than stimulated by paclitaxel in our experiments with renal fibroblasts (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, p42/44 MAP kinase signaling was implicated in Cox-2 expression. Depending on the stimulus used, p42/44 MAP kinase may be involved in CTGF induction as shown for angiotensin II (8Iwanciw, D., Rehm, M., Porst, M., and Goppelt-Struebe, M. (2003) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar) or TGFβ (30Leask A. Holmes A. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13008-13015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p42/44 MAP kinase only partially inhibited induction of CTGF by microtubule-interfering agents (about 20%, Fig. 4D), arguing against an important role for p42/44 MAP kinase under these conditions. Microtubule disruption was further related to the activation of protein kinase A, mediating Cox-2 expression in keratinocytes (29Subbaramaiah K. Hart J.C. Norton L. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14838-14845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) or IL-1 synthesis in monocytes (32Manie S. Schmid-Alliana A. Kubar J. Ferrua B. Rossi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13675-13681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, it has been shown before that activation of protein kinase A by forskolin interferes with CTGF induction (7Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Eberlein M. Abdel Wahab N. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Iwanciw, D., Rehm, M., Porst, M., and Goppelt-Struebe, M. (2003) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Similarly, depolymerization of the microtubules may activate NF-κB signaling (33Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), but activation of NF-κB by TNFα has been shown to inhibit CTGF expression (34Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15220-15225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Release of Smads from microtubule was observed upon colchicine treatment and related to TGFbeta induction (35Dong C. Li Z. Alvarez Jr., R. Feng X.H. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), but we found no activation of a plasmid containing a luciferase reporter fused to Smad-binding elements (SBE-Lux) by nocodazole or colchicine in the human fibroblasts used in this study.2 Taken together, these data suggested that other signaling pathways than those described in the literature so far were essential for the induction of CTGF by microtubule disruption in fibroblasts. Previous studies had been indicative of a role for the small GTPase RhoA in CTGF induction (25Eberlein M. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Goppelt-Struebe M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and this was confirmed in the present study by overexpression of constitutively active RhoA. Activation of RhoA was observed within minutes after incubation of the cells with nocodazole or colchicine and confirmed the link established between microtubules and RhoA activation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (16Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Activation of RhoA and Rho-associated kinase was of particular functional relevance for the induction of CTGF by disruption of the microtubuli, as shown by C3 toxin and more importantly by the specific Rhoassociated kinase inhibitor Y27832. Pretreatment of the cells with Y27632 was sufficient to blunt nocodazole- or colchicine-induced CTGF expression. The concurrent interference with gene expression and the disintegration of the actin stress fibers by Y27632 did not allow us to separate these processes, and cytoskeleton-independent signaling pathways cannot be fully excluded. On the other hand, the importance of the actin cytoskeleton was further supported by the effect of jasplakinolide, which stabilized actin fibers and increased CTGF expression, whereas latrunculin B, which leads to actin depolymerization, decreased CTGF expression. The stimulating effect of cytochalasin D, which also rapidly disintegrated actin stress fibers, was unexpected. In cardiomyocytes and in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, cytochalasin D was shown to activate RhoA (16Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 36Wei L. Wang L. Carson J.A. Agan J.E. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Schwartz R.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Inhibition of RhoA signaling via Rho-associated kinase by 10 μm Y27632 partially inhibited cytochalasin D-mediated CTGF induction,2 but did not reach statistical significance, arguing against a pronounced role of RhoA in cytochalasin D-mediated induction of CTGF expression. Both cytochalasin D and latrunculin B enhance the cellular content of G-actin (37Cipolla M.J. Gokina N.I. Osol G. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); however, the availability of G-actin as modulator of gene expression seems to be different upon treatment with both agents; cytochalasin D was shown to sequester and thus reduce the effective level of G-actin, thereby activating a subset of genes regulated by serum response factor (38Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 39Gineitis D. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24531-24539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The published promoter sequence of CTGF does not contain a serum response element, and thus far, CTGF transcription has not been characterized as being dependent on activation by serum response factor, suggesting a different molecular mechanism of cytochalasin D action. Furthermore, RhoA activation has been linked to serum response factor activation via diaphanous-related formins (mDia1 and mDia2) rather than Rho-associated kinase (40Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism responsible for the increased CTGF mRNA levels has not yet been unraveled, sequestration of G-actin by cytochalasin D is in agreement with up-regulation of CTGF being regulated by decreased levels of G-actin. CTGF has been shown to be up-regulated in fibroblasts embedded in attached collagen gels (3Schild C. Trueb B. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These cells are under tension and show large cell spanning stress fibers (41Tomasek J.J. Halliday N.L. Updike D.L. Ahern-Moore J.S. Vu R.V. Liu R.W. Howard E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7482-7487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Microtubules have not been investigated under those experimental conditions, but cross-talk between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton is observed in locomotion of cells with microtubules exerting a relaxation response opposing actin contraction (13Small J.V. Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Rottner K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Under physiologic conditions, microtubules act in concert with signals from extracellular matrix to modulate actin fibers. As a model system, chemical depolymerization of microtubules is sufficient to elucidate diverse pleiotropic effects on cells, including the stabilization of actin fibers as summarized in Ref. 42Zhang Q. Magnusson M.K. Mosher D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar. High concentrations of colchicine or nocodazole (10 μm) were shown to induce the development of focal adhesions and to activate adhesion-dependent signal transduction in fibroblasts (31Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Interestingly, up-regulation of CTGF was also observed in detached cells (Fig. 6), indicative of CTGF induction being at least in part independent of cell adhesion. In line with our results Ren et al. (16Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) showed activation of RhoA by colchicine in the absence of adhesion. However, the reduced effect of the inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase suggests that additional signaling pathways play a role in CTGF induction under these experimental conditions. Taken together, our data are in agreement with an inverse correlation between the availability of G-actin and CTGF expression. Interference with the microtubular network or treatment of the cells with jasplakinolide reduced G-actin levels by stabilization of actin fibers, whereas latrunculin had the opposite effect. Consequently, disruption of the microtubuli or stabilization of actin stress fibers induced CTGF expression, whereas disruption of actin fibers was inhibitory. Recently, decreased levels of G-actin were observed in vascular smooth muscle cells in response to increased vascular pressure (37Cipolla M.J. Gokina N.I. Osol G. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our finding that CTGF expression is sensitive to the availability of G-actin may thus relate to the increased synthesis of CTGF in fibroblasts under tension. The expert technical assistance of M. Rehm (Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg) and A. Mansard (Universität Ulm) is highly acknowledged."
https://openalex.org/W2014496171,"The intracellular ability of the “10–23” DNAzyme to efficiently inhibit expression of targeted proteins has been evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies. However, standard conditions for kinetic measurements of the DNAzyme catalytic activity in vitro include 25 mm Mg2+, a concentration that is very unlikely to be achieved intracellularly. To study this discrepancy, we analyzed the folding transitions of the 10–23 DNAzyme induced by Mg2+. For this purpose, spectroscopic analyzes such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescence anisotropy, circular dichroism, and surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed. The global geometry of the DNAzyme in the absence of added Mg2+ seems to be essentially extended, has no catalytic activity, and shows a very low binding affinity to its RNA substrate. The folding of the DNAzyme induced by binding of Mg2+ may occur in several distinct stages. The first stage, observed at 0.5 mm Mg2+, corresponds to the formation of a compact structure with limited binding properties and without catalytic activity. Then, at 5 mm Mg2+, flanking arms are projected at right position and angles to bind RNA. In such a state, DNAzyme shows substantial binding to its substrate and significant catalytic activity. Finally, the transition occurring at 15 mm Mg2+ leads to the formation of the catalytic domain, and DNAzyme shows high binding affinity toward substrate and efficient catalytic activity. Under conditions simulating intracellular conditions, the DNAzyme was only partially folded, did not bind to its substrate, and showed only residual catalytic activity, suggesting that it may be inactive in the transfected cells and behave like antisense oligodeoxynucleotide.

Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). It is capable of cleaving single-stranded RNA at specific sites under simulated physiological conditions and can be used to control even complex biological processes such as tumor angiogenesis. For example, DNAzymes to β1 and β3 mRNA reduced expression of targeted integrin subunits in endothelial cells and blocked proliferation, migration, and network formation in a fibrin and Matrigel™ matrix (2Cieslak M. Niewiarowska J. Nawrot M. Koziolkiewicz M. Stec W.J. Cierniewski C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6779-6787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a cell culture system, a 10–23 deoxyribozyme designed against 12-lipoxygenase mRNA specifically down-regulated expression of this protein and its metabolites, which are known to play a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis (3Liu C. Cheng R. Sun L.Q. Tien P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similarly, the DNAzyme to VEGFR2 mRNA cleaved its substrate efficiently and inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells with a concomitant reduction of VEGFR2 mRNA and blocked tumor growth in vivo (4Zhang L. Gasper W.J. Stass S.A. Ioffe O.B. Davis M.A. Mixson A.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5463-5469PubMed Google Scholar).The origins of the DNAzyme catalytic activity are not yet fully understood, but the observed rate enhancements probably are generated by a number of factors, including metal ion and nucleobase catalysis and local stereochemical effects. The 10–23 DNAzyme has been developed using an in vitro selection strategy on the basis of its ability to cleave RNA in the presence of Mg2+ (1Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). It has a catalytic domain of 15 highly conserved deoxyribonucleotides flanked by two substrate-recognition domains and can cleave effectively between any unpaired purine and pyrimidine of mRNA transcripts. Like many other enzymes catalyzing phosphoryl-transfer reactions, it is recognized as a metalloenzyme requiring divalent metal, preferentially Mg2+ ions, for catalytic activity. Divalent cations play a crucial role in these mechanisms, as evidenced by a number of observations. For example, addition of La3+ to the Mg2+-background reaction mixture inhibited the DNAzyme-catalyzed reactions, suggesting the replacement of catalytically and/or structurally important Mg2+ by La3+ (5He Q.C. Zhou J.M. Zhou D.M. Nakamatsu Y. Baba T. Taira K. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The function of divalent metal cations in DNAzyme activity is very complex and includes (i) stabilization of the transition state of reaction. The divalent metal cation dependence of the enzyme was described as being the evidence supporting a chemical mechanism involving metal-assisted deprotonation of the 2′-hydroxyl located adjacent to the cleavage site (6Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13330-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It also includes (ii) neutralization of negative charges of phosphate groups, thus facilitating DNA-RNA interactions. High resolution x-ray crystal structures of Mg2+ and Ca2+ salts of the model B-DNA decamers CCAACGTTGG and CCAGCGCTGG revealed sequence-specific binding of Mg2+ and Ca2+ to the major and minor grooves of DNA, as well as nonspecific binding to backbone phosphate oxygen atoms. This accounts for the neutralization of between 50 and 100% of the negative charges of phosphate groups (7Chiu T.K. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 25: 915-945Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). (iii) Some of these bound cations may also play a purely structural role by inducing proper folding of the DNAzyme molecule, thus helping to organize the enzyme into its active conformation. There are several reports showing that Mg2+ helps to stabilize different types of double-stranded DNA structures (8Welche J.B. Duckett D.R. Lilley D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4548-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Soyfer V.N. Potaman V.N. Triple-helical Nucleic Acids. Springer, New York1966: 360Google Scholar) and can induce bending or enhance curvature in DNA (10Brukner I. Susic S. Dlakic M. Savic A. Pongor S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 26-32Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mg2+ and other divalent cations enhance end-to-end DNA interactions, particularly in the case of fragments with self-complementary ends (11Dahlgreen P.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11372-11378Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These structural effects of cations may be even more profound in a single-stranded and flexible DNAzyme molecule.Mg2+-dependent cleavage has special relevance to biology because it is compatible with intracellular conditions, raising the possibility that DNA enzymes might be made to operate in vivo (12Scott W. Klug A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 220-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, at the present time, it is hard to explain their intracellular catalytic activity, keeping in mind the catalytic dependence upon high concentrations of Mg2+, which is unlikely to be achieved in cytoplasm. To address the question of their intracellular catalytic activity, we attempted to correlate changes in the catalytic activity and configuration of the DNAzyme induced by gradually bound Mg2+. To characterize structural changes in the DNAzyme, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, which allowed us to monitor general folding of the molecule based on the measurements of distances between fluorophores linked to 5′ and 3′ side bases, and surface plasmon resonance analysis of the DNAzyme binding to its RNA substrate. Structural changes induced by cations in DNAzymes were also monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence anisotropy analysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthesis of DNAzyme to β3 mRNA—DNAzyme was chemically synthesized on a solid support using an ABI-394 DNA synthesizer, as described previously (13Cierniewski C.S. Babinska A. Swiatkowska M. Wilczynska M. Okruszek A. Stec W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This particular DNA sequence (5′-GAGTCCCATAg1g2c3t4a5g6c7t8a9c10a11a12c13g14a15AAGACTTGAG-3′) was used previously to analyze the enzymatic activity, specificity, exonuclease resistance, and ability to inhibit expression of β3 integrins in endothelial cells (2Cieslak M.

For BIAcore experiments, the inactive DNAzyme, β3DE(15)In, with a single substitution (G6 → A) in the reactive loop and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide β3(1245–1265) containing both flanking arms of the β3DE (5′-GAGTCCCATACAAGACTTGAG-3′) were synthesized. Two analogues of β3DE(15)In and β3(1245–1265) were produced as well, which contained the modified oligonucleotides such as phosphorothioates or 2′-O-methyl-substituted residues introduced at both 5′ and 3′ sides. Hence, S-β3DE(15)in and S-β3(1245–1265) have two phosphorothioate substitutions, whereas MeO-β3DE(15)in and MeO-β3(1245–1265) contain two 2′-O-methyl-substituted residues at both their 5′ and 3′ sides, respectively. An additional mutated DNAzyme (MeO-β3DE(11)) with a downsized catalytic loop of a deoxyribozyme from 15-mer to 11-mer (5′-GAGTCCCATAg1g2c3t4a9c10a11a12c13g14a15AAGACTTGAG-3′) was synthesized and used as a control. DNAzymes with the 11-mer catalytic loop were described to be Ca2+-dependent deoxyribozymes and showed significantly reduced binding affinities and catalytic activities in the presence of Mg2+ (14Okumoto Y. Sugimoto N. J. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 82: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All deoxyoligonucleotides were purified by HPLC and ion exchange chromatography (to 98%), and their purity was checked by PAGE under denaturing conditions.The doubly labeled β3 DNAzymes with the 15-mer and 11-mer catalytic loops were synthesized by the solid-state phosphoramidite approach on an ABI 392 synthesizer, starting from fluorescein CPG support (CPG, Inc.). The 2′-O-Me RNA cyanoethyl phosphoramidites (Glen Research) were used for introduction of 2′-O-Me nucleotide units flanking the sequence from the 3′ and 5′ ends. The synthesis was terminated with the addition of rhodamine cyanoethyl phosphoramidite (CPG, Inc.). Oligonucleotides were cleaved from the solid support and deprotected by brief (4 h at 55 °C) treatment with 30% ammonia. Pure product was isolated by preparative HPLC on a Hamilton PRP1 column. The peak fractions were evaporated to dryness, redissolved in water, and then ethanol-precipitated.The synthetic, biotinylated (at the 3′ end) 21-mer RNA (biotin-CUCAGGGUAUGUUCUGAACUC) used in BIAcore experiments was purchased from Bionovo (Poland). Its sequence corresponded to the 1245–1265 fragment of β3 mRNA. After synthesis, the product was purified by HPLC and its purity was checked by PAGE.Preparation of Target RNA Substrates and Kinetic Analysis—Aliquots of RNA substrates (20 μl, 5 μm) dissolved in a T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer were mixed with [γ-32P]ATP (2 μl, 20 μCi) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (3 units). Reaction was carried out for an h at 37 °C. All reported kinetic values were determined in multiple turnover reactions. Vmax and Km values were determined from the y intercept and slope, respectively, of the best-fit line to a Lineweaver-Burke plot of 1/V versus 1/[S]. Reactions (10 min at 37 °C; total volume = 20 μl) were carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 15 mm MgCl2, 0.01% SDS, DNAzyme (0.0125 μm) with the radiolabeled RNA substrate used in a wide range of concentrations. The cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and the products were separated by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions. Amounts of the product were evaluated by use of a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from freshly collected umbilical cords by collagenase treatment (15Jaffe E.A. Minich R. Adelman B. Becker C.G. Nachman R.L. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becher C.G. Minich C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5984) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in gelatin-coated 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and were maintained at confluence in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), fungizone (2.5 mg/ml), heparin (90 μg/ml), l-glutamine (1 mm), sodium bicarbonate (2 mg/ml), 20% fetal bovine serum, and epidermal growth factor (40 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Primary cultures were harvested at confluence with trypsin/EDTA and transferred into gelatin-coated dishes. For the experiments, confluent cultures were used at the second passage.For microscopic examination, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well on Thermanox cover-slips in 8-well tissue culture chamber slides (NUNC) with detachable chambered upper structures. Before performance of assays, the serum-containing medium was changed to a serum-free medium (Opti-MEM). The cultures were gently rinsed three times with the medium and preincubated with fluorophore-labeled MeOβ3DE(15) (0.5 μm) for 6 h in the presence of Lipofectin (5 μg/ml). After that time, the transfection mixture was replaced by normal serum-containing medium, and cells were grown for another 18 h. Attached, treated intact cells were maintained in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Two control assays were carried out using either untreated cells or cells exposed to 0.25 μm fluorescein. After incubation, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with freshly prepared 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted in 2.5% DABCO™ in glycerol, and processed for microscopy.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence emission spectra were measured on an LS-50 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and spectra were corrected for lamp fluctuations and instrumental variations. Polarization artifacts were avoided by setting excitation and emission polarizers to magic angle conditions (54.74°). All of the fluorescence measurements were performed at the temperature of 23 ± 1 °C. Emission spectra, excitation spectra, and luminescence intensity were recorded with 5-nm band passes for both the excitation and emission monochromators. A cut-off filter in the emission beam was used to eliminate second-order wavelength interference. The excitation wavelengths used were 494 nm and 560 nm for fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated constructs, respectively. Emission spectra were corrected for the blank contribution and for the instrument response and normalized to the DNA concentration in a quartz cell with a 1-cm path length. Excitation and emission spectra were automatically corrected for lamp intensity variations. Buffers were degassed by bubbling nitrogen to prevent quenching of fluorescence by dissolved oxygen. The fluorescence emission signals were stable to photobleaching under the experimental conditions of measurement. The apparent interchromophore separation, R, the distance separating the energy donor and acceptor was calculated by the Forster equation: r = R0(1/E – 1)1/6, where E is the efficiency of energy transfer from donor to acceptor. E = 1 – FDA/FD and R0 is the distance for 50% transfer efficiency E. FDA and FD are the fluorescence intensities of the donor in the presence and absence of the acceptor, respectively. FDA and FD were measured at 520 nm, the emission maximum for fluorescein.The fluorescence anisotropy of the fluorescein and rhodamine probes attached to the DNAzyme (Fluo-MeO-β3DE(15)-Rhod, Fluo-MeO-β3DE(11)-Rhod) was monitored in an LS-50 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with an automatic anisotropy measuring device. The anisotropy r is defined asr=(IVV-G×IVH)/(IVV+2×G×IVH)(Eq. 1) where I is fluorescence intensity. The first and second indices refer to the orientation of excitation and emission polarizers, respectively. G is the correction factor. The cell holder was thermostated at 21 °C.Analysis of Fluorescence Data—Efficiencies of energy transfer were determined from enhancement acceptor fluorescence (17Clegg R.M.

The emission at a given wavelength (v1) of a double-labeled sample excited primarily at the donor wavelength (v′) contains emission from the donor, emission from directly excited acceptor, and emission from acceptor excited by energy transfer from the donor, i.e.F(v1,v')=[S]·ϵD(v')·ϕD(v1)·d+·{(1-EFRET)·a++a-+ϵA(v')·ϕA(v1)·a++ϵD(v')·ϕA(v1)·EFRET·d++a+}=FD(v1,v')+FA(v1,v')(Eq. 2) where [S] is the concentration of DNAzyme, d+ and a+ are the molar fraction of DNAzyme molecules labeled with donor and acceptor respectively, and a– is the molar fraction of DNAzyme molecules unlabeled with acceptor. Superscripts D and A refer to donor and acceptor, respectively. ϵD(v′) and ϵA(v′) are the molar absorption coefficients of donor and acceptor, respectively, and φD(v1) and φ (v1) are the fluorescent quantum yields of donor and acceptor, respectively. Thus the spectrum contains the components due to donor emission [FD(v1,v′), i.e. the first term containing φD(v1)] and those due to acceptor emission [FA(v1,v′), i.e. the latter two terms containing φ (v1)]. The first stage of the analysis involves subtraction of the spectrum of DNA labeled only with donor, leaving just the acceptor components, i.e. FA(v1,v′). The pure acceptor spectrum thus derived is normalized to one from the same sample excited at a wavelength (v″) at which only the acceptor is excited, with emission at v2. We then obtain the acceptor ratio(ratio)A=FA(v1,v')/FA(v2,v'')={EFRET·d+·[ϵD(v')/ϵA(v'')+ϵA(v')/ϵA(v'')]}·[ϕA(v1)/ϕA(v2)](Eq. 3) EFRET is directly proportional to (ratio)A and can be easily calculated because ϵD(v′)/ϵA(v″) and ϵA(v′)/ϵA(v″) are measured from absorption spectra, and φA(v1)/φA(v2) is unity when v1 = v2.Analysis of Circular Dichroism—The circular dichroism spectra of MeO-β3DE (1 μm), free or in the complex with the substrate (2 μm), was measured in a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing increasing concentrations of MgCl2 at 21 °C. In control experiments, 0.1 m and 1 m NaCl were used. Before measurement, the complex was allowed to form by heating the solution at 95 °C for 2.5 min followed by gradual cooling. Measurements were made in a quartz cuvette (5-mm path length) with a CD spectrometer (model CD6, Jobin Yvon) from 200 to 320 nm in triplicate. The spectra were obtained by smoothing the averaged spectra with a calculator.Surface Plasmon Resonance—The kinetic parameters (association and dissociation rate constants, kon and koff, respectively) and the affinity constant (KD) between DNAzyme and the mRNA substrate were measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcoreX (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, avidin was covalently attached to carboxymethyl dextran chips (CM5, BIAcore) previously activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed at 37 °C using 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing divalent cations at the indicated concentrations. 15 μl of 5′ end-biotinylated RNA at 100 nm in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was injected at the flow rate of 5 μl/min and consequently immobilized on the bound avidin to give a response of ∼500 resonance units, an arbitrary unit specific for the BIAcore instrument. The levels of immobilized RNA were within the low levels that have to be used to ensure that the observed binding rate will be limited by the reaction kinetics rather than by the mass transport effects of the injected DNAzyme (19Bondeson K. Frostell-Karlsson A. Fagerstam L. Magnusson G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In typical experiments, DNAzyme flowed in two channels of the sensor; the first one contained the RNA substrate attached to avidin, and the second was without the RNA substrate. The latter was used to correct SPR traces and remove the background binding between DNAzyme and the immobilized avidin on the dextran. The concentration of the injected DNAzyme was in the range 20–200 nm, and the flow rate was 5 μl/min. The amount of ligand bound to immobilized RNA substrate was monitored by measuring the variation of the surface plasmon resonance angle as a function of time. Results were expressed in resonance units. In preliminary experiments, the data obtained for at least three different concentrations of DNAzymes were fitted to several models; the best fits (χ2 = 1.4) were obtained by assuming a one-to-one interaction. Then, the association rate constant, kon, and dissociation rate constant, koff, were determined separately from individual association and dissociation phases, respectively. The overall affinity constant, KA, was derived from kon/koff. The sensor chip was regenerated with three 10-μl pulses of 12.5% formamide.RESULTSEnzymatic Characteristics of the DNAzyme to β3 Integrin Subunit—The 10–23 DNAzyme used in these studies was designed to cleave β3 integrin subunit mRNA, and preliminary characterization was done in our recent work (2Cieslak M. Niewiarowska J. Nawrot M. Koziolkiewicz M. Stec W.J. Cierniewski C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6779-6787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Standard conditions for kinetic measurements of the catalytic activity of DNAzyme in vitro include 25 mm MgCl2 (20Kumar P.K.R. Zhou D.-M. Yoshinari K. Taira K. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Catalytic RNA, Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Vol. 10. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 217-230Google Scholar). Under such conditions, the 10–23 DNAzyme shows optimal enzymatic activity, whereas its mutant MeO-β3DE(11) with the shortened catalytic loop is inactive (Fig. 1A). In this experiment, enzymatic reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0–25 mm MgCl2, under multiple turnover conditions. The 32P-labeled mRNA substrate was mixed with the DNAzyme β3DE in the molar ratio of 80:1 and incubated at 37 °C; aliquots were withdrawn after 10 min. The cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and products were separated by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions. Amounts of the product were evaluated by use of a PhosphorImager. Fig. 1B shows a composition of cleavage mixtures obtained after a 60-min incubation of 32P-labeled mRNA substrates with 0.025 μm β3DE added at a molar ratio ranging from 5:1 to 80:1. Each of the DNAzymes, unmodified (β3DE) and modified (MeO-β3DE), cleaved the substrate at the predicted site. Interestingly, DNAzyme with the 2′-MeO residues showed a significantly higher enzymatic activity than β3DE, as evidenced by the catalytic efficiency kcat/Km of 3.62 × 106 and 1.09 × 106m–1 min–1, respectively.Study of Ion-induced Folding of the DNAzyme by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—To follow the folding transitions of the DNAzyme induced upon binding of Mg2+ ions, FRET was utilized. For this purpose, β3DE with the 15-mer and 11-mer catalytic loops was modified by attachment of the donor and acceptor fluorophores, rhodamine and fluorescein, to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the flanking arms, respectively. Next, a series of experiments were designed to analyze whether the fluorophores attached to the terminal bases affect the ability of the oligodeoxynucleotide construct to function as an active DNAzyme species. As seen in Fig. 2A, incubation of the Fluo-MeO-β3DE(15)-Rhod with the 32P-labeled substrate in the presence of 25 mm Mg2+ under multiple-turnover conditions at 37 °C leads to cleavage at the correct site. When such a construct was incubated with endothelial cells, it remained resistant to intracellular nucleases and, even after 24 h, was located exclusively within the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear organelles. The cellular uptake, intracellular distribution, and stability of the Fluo-MeO-β3DE(15)-Rhod were the same as those recently reported for another 10–23 DNAzyme (21Dass C.R. Saravolac E.G. Li Y. Sun L.Q. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cellular transport of the Fluo-MeO-β3DE(15)-Rhod as a function of the external oligonucleotide concentration was non-linear, being more efficient at concentrations below 2 μm. The punctate fluorescence distribution observed even after 24 h of exposure to the DNAzyme seems to suggest that endosomal vesicles are the primary targets of the probes under study (Fig. 2B). Fluo-MeO-β3DE(15)-Rhod could be detected intracellularly, both when emission of either fluorescein or rhodamine was measured and both fluorophores showed full colocalization. Thus, the attached fluorophores did not influence the enzymatic activity and biological properties of the DNAzyme, including the ability to interact with cellular components responsible for its transport. Transfection of endothelial cells with the DNAzyme (5 μm) efficiently reduced expression of β3 integrin subunit measured at the level of β3 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 2C) and at the cellular surface by flow cytometry (not shown). Although MeO-β3DE(11)-Rhod had the same cellular distribution as MeO-β3DE(15)-Rhod, it did not show any biological activity detectable at the level of β3 mRNA or β3 expression at the cell surface. These data provide the evidence that the 10–23 DNAzyme has an intracellular catalytic or antisense activity, even at the much lower cation concentrations than those normally used in in vitro analysis.Fig. 2Biological activity of Fluo-MeO-β3DE-Rhod.A, DNAzyme activity of the fluorophore-labeled construct identical to that used for the FRET analysis. The cleavage activity was examined after incubation of Fluo-MeO-β3DE-Rhod with a 20-fold excess of 5′-32P-labeled RNA substrate in the presence of 15 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. A sample was removed at different time points (lanes 1-5). B, the fluorescence image of endothelial cells treated with Fluo-MeO-β3DE-Rhod. Endothelial cells, exposed to 0.5 μm of the fluorophore-labeled construct for 24 h at 37 °C and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The punctate fluorescence distribution within the cytoplasm was detected by monitoring both fluorescein and rhodamine attached to DNAzyme. C, the reduced expression of β3 mRNA in HUVECs treated with MeO-β3DE when compared with unchanged expression in untreated cells. β3 mRNA was evaluated by relative quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA as an intrinsic control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both Fluo-MeO-β3DE(15)-Rhod and Fluo-MeO-β3DE(11)-Rhod were next used to measure energy transfer resulting from a dipolar coupling between the transition moments of the two fluorophores, fluorescein as the energy donor and rhodamine as the energy acceptor. When the fluorescence spectrum of one fluorophore (the donor) overlaps with the excitation spectrum of another fluorophore (the acceptor), the excitation of the donor"

Our results indicate a remarkably high instrinsic helix propensity of the helix 1 region. In particular, these peptides retain significant helicity under a wide range of conditions, such as high salt, pH variation, and presence of organic co-solvents. As evidenced by a data base search, the pattern of charged residues present in helix 1 generally favors helical structures over alternative conformations. Because of its high stability against environmental changes, helix 1 is unlikely to be involved in the initial steps of the pathogenic conformational change.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5149) Google Scholar). Its cellular form, PrPC, is a highly conserved cell surface glycoprotein of 230 amino acids expressed in all of the mammals studied so far as well as in several species of fish and birds (2.Wopfner F. Weidenhofer G. Schneider R. von Brunn A. Gilch S. Schwarz T.F. Werner T. Schatzl H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1163-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3.Suzuki T. Kurokawa T. Hashimoto H. Sugiyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The physiological function of PrPC is not yet fully understood. PrPC seems to be involved in the maintenance of proper presynaptic copper levels as well as in protecting neurons from oxidative stress (4.Brown D.R. Brain. Res. Bull. 2001; 55: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5.Martins V.R. Linden R. Prado M.A. Walz R. Sakamoto A.C. Izquierdo I. Brentani R.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, the physiological function of PrPC could be associated with higher neurological functions such as learning and memory (5.Martins V.R. Linden R. Prado M.A. Walz R. Sakamoto A.C. Izquierdo I. Brentani R.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). According to the protein-only hypothesis, disease is caused by accumulation of a misfolded pathogenic isoform, PrPSc, which is the result of an irreversible large scale conformational change of PrPC. Although PrPC is largely α-helical and soluble in polar solvents and sensitive to protease K digestion, PrPSc consists mostly of β-sheets, is soluble only in nonpolar, denaturing solvents, and is resistant to digestion with protease K (6.Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They possess a high degree of structural conservation consistent with the high sequence identity of these proteins. Prion proteins consist of a flexible NH2-terminal domain spanning residues 23–124 (huPrPC-numbering scheme), which is largely disordered. This region includes an octapeptide sequence that is repeated four times from residues 60 to 92 and that is likely to bind copper (4.Brown D.R. Brain. Res. Bull. 2001; 55: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This part also contains the palindromic sequence, AGAAAAGA, which may be involved in fibrillogenesis (12.Jobling M.F. Stewart L.R. White A.R. McLean C. Friedhuber A. Maher F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Barrow C.J. Collins S.J. Cappai R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain (residues 125–231) adopts a well defined tertiary structure containing three α-helices and a short anti-parallel β-sheet. This globular domain can further be divided into two subdomains, one long hairpin subdomain (helix 1 and the β-sheet) and one purely α-helical subdomain (helices 2 and 3) (13.Jamin N. Coic Y.M. Landon C. Ovtracht L. Baleux F. Neumann J.M. Sanson A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known regarding the structural properties of PrPSc. Epitope mapping of the PrPSc-specific monoclonal antibody 15B3 suggests a structural rearrangement of the sequence of helix 1 during the conversion reaction (14.Hornemann S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Glockshuber R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A recent low resolution model derived from electron-crystallographic data proposes incorporation of the unstructured domain and the long hairpin subdomain into a left-handed β-helix while the helical subdomain is supposed to retain its structure (15.Wille H. Michelitsch M.D. Guenebaut V. Supattapone S. Serban A. Cohen F.E. Agard D.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3563-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These data suggest that helix 1 has to undergo a major structural rearrangement from an α-helix into a structure involving a significant amount of β-sheet (Scheme 1). In addition, helix 1 possesses several other unique features. Helix 1 extends from Asp-144 to Met-154 in the mean NMR structure of human prion protein (8.Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). 6 of these 11 residues are charged at neutral pH making helix 1 the most hydrophilic helix in all of the known protein structures (16.Morrissey M.P. Shakhnovich E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11293-11298Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, helix 1 has very few long range interactions. Moreover, it has a significant number of solvent-accessible backbone hydrogen bonds (17.Fernandez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4165-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the basis of computational studies, it has been hypothesized that helix stabilization occurs electrostatically via two intrahelical salt bridges and a charge distribution interacting favorably with the intrinsic dipole moment of the helix (16.Morrissey M.P. Shakhnovich E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11293-11298Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To further investigate the intrinsic conformational propensity of the sequence of helix 1, we conducted NMR spectroscopic and computational studies of several synthetic peptides encompassing helix 1 and flanking sequences. Peptides—All of the peptides were purchased from Jerini AG (Berlin, Germany) as high pressure liquid chromatography-purified freeze-dried powder containing trifluoroacetate as counterions. Peptides were protected by an NH2-terminal acetyl group and by amidation at the COOH terminus to exclude charge effects from free termini. The peptides under investigation were as follows: huPrP-(110–157) (Ac-KHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPIIHFGSDYEDRYYRENMHRY-NH2); huPrP-(140–158) (Ac-HFGSDYEDRYYRENMHRYP-NH2); and huPrP-(140–166) (Ac-HFGSDYEDRYYRENMHRYPNQVYYRPM-NH2). NMR-Spectroscopy—For the preparation of NMR samples, the freeze-dried peptides were dissolved in H2O/D2O (9:1) buffered by 25 mm sodium acetate for pH 4.5 samples or 10 mm potassium phosphate for pH 6.5 samples. 0.1% sodium azide was used to prevent bacterial growth in the sample. Undissolved material was removed by centrifugation, and the pH value of the solution was readjusted. Samples contained 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as internal reference for proton chemical shifts. Peptide concentrations were determined photospectrometrically using a molar absorption coefficient ϵ280 of 1280 cm–1 per tyrosine residue (18.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 400 and DRX600 spectrometers with proton frequencies of 400 and 600 MHz, respectively. Quadrature detection in f1 was achieved using States-time-proportional phase incrementation or the echo-anti-echo method. The solvent signal was suppressed by the WATERGATE W5 method (19.Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 20.Liu M. Mao X. Ye C. Huang H. Nicholson J.K. Lindon J.C. J. Magn. Reson.

Two-dimensional 1H-1H TOCSY (22.Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar) spectra with mixing times of 40 and 80 ms, respectively, and two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY (23.Bodenhausen G. Kogler H. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 58: 370-388Google Scholar) spectra with mixing times of 150 and 300 ms, respectively, were recorded at 283 K. The temperature was calibrated with methanol (24.Van Geet A.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 679-680Crossref Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Data were processed with the software package NDEE (Spin Up Inc., Dortmund, Germany). Typically, a sine-squared window function shifted by π/3 was applied in both dimensions with zero-filling to 1024 data points in f1 and 4096 data points in f2. Base-line correction (25.Friedrichs M.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was performed using home-written software. Sequential assignments were achieved using the main-chain-directed strategy devised by Wüthrich et al. (26.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Assignment of secondary structure elements was achieved using the 1Hα chemical shift index (CSI) method described by Wishart et al. (27.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Random coil chemical shifts derived from Ac-GGXGG-NH2-type model peptides acquired under acidic conditions and their corresponding correction factors correcting for effects from the local amino acid sequence were employed (28.Schwarzinger S.

J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For studies at higher pH values, random coil chemical shifts for Asp and Glu were taken from Ac-GG(D/E)AGG-NH2 peptides measured at pH 5 (30.Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J810 instrument using quartz cells with path lengths of 0.1 and 1 mm, respectively. Samples were prepared from the NMR samples by dilution with appropriate buffers. Spectra were taken at 283 K. Typically, four scans over the wavelength range 200–260 nm were acquired with a stepwidth of 0.5 nm, an integration time of 4 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Helix contents were estimated from the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm (31.Chen Y. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Pattern Search—Proteins containing a pattern of charged residues similar to that of huPrP helix 1 were identified by a pattern search against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) filtered at 95% sequence identity (PDB95) using the program PATTINPROT (npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=/NPSA/npsa_pattinprot.html). In addition to the pattern [DE]-X-X-[DE]-[RK]-X-X-[RK] present in huPrP, three additional patterns generated by permutation of the charged residues ([DE]-X-X-[RK]-[RK]-X-X-[DE],[RK]-X-X-[DE]-[DE]-X-X-[RK],and[RK]-X-X-[RK]-[DE]-X-X-[DE]) were used as input. All four patterns are formed by two overlapping subpatterns, each containing a positively and a negatively charged residue four positions apart in sequence. In addition, the patterns [DE]-X-X-[DE]-[RK]-X-X-[RK]-[DE], [DE]-X-X-A-[RK]-X-X-[RK]-[DE], and [DE]-X-X-[DE]-[RK]-X-X-[RK]-A were used to assess the effect of point mutations on helix propensity. Secondary structure of the residues forming these patterns was analyzed using home-written software that correlates the PATTINPROT output (PDB code and sequence position of the pattern) with the secondary structure of the corresponding residues obtained from dictionary of secondary structure of proteins analysis (32.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12317) Google Scholar). The type of secondary structure and the accessible surface area for each position of the pattern and the flanking residues were calculated. Stability of Helix 1 Is Independent of Neighboring Sequences—The effect of flanking sequences on the conformational properties of helix 1 in the three peptides, huPrP-(110–157), huPrP-(140–158), and huPrP-(140–166), was analyzed by means of CD and NMR spectroscopy. Because of the low solubility of huPrP-(110–157) and huPrP-(140–166) at near-neutral pH values, investigations had to be carried out at pH 4.5. Information on the preference for a particular secondary structure was determined using 1Hα chemical shifts (27.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar, 28.Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R. Chung J. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In all of the three peptides, chemical shift analysis indicates the presence of helical conformation in the region 145–155, which is in good agreement with the position of helix 1 in the solution structure of huPrP-(90–231) (Table I). 1Hα chemical shifts for helix 1 in the three peptides show no significant differences, implying that the sequences flanking helix 1 neither contribute to its stability nor to its conformational preference. However, sequences adjacent to helix 1 behave as free flight random coils. In particular, the sequence 129–131, forming β-strand 1 in the native PrPC structure, does not show any sign of populating an extended conformation (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, the NH2-terminal alanine-rich region, which is thought to play a key role in fibril formation (33.Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Lloyd D.H. Gabriel J.M. Holtzman D.M. Cohen F.E. Fletterick R. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10940-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), does not populate extended conformations nor does it form helical conformations as might be expected from the high content of alanine residues. An exception from random coil behavior is found for the sequence prior to the NH2 terminus of helix 1 in which a small population of extended conformation can be found. However, the absence of tertiary NOE-cross-peaks in the peptides suggests high conformational flexibility.Table IAverage helix content of the investigated peptidesCDaEstimated from [θ]222 nm (31).NMR (total)bEstimated from the average secondary structure shift for all of the residues.NMR-(144-154)cEstimated from the average secondary structure shift for residues 144-154.AGADIRdCalculated by AGADIR (40, 41, 42).huPrP-(110-157), pH 4.50.040.140.430.04huPrP-(140-158), pH 4.50.070.270.460.1huPrP-(140-166), pH 4.50.060.210.460.07huPrP-(140-158), pH 2.00.080.170.270.03huPrP-(140-158), pH 6.50.140.340.580.14huPrP-(140-158), pH 4.5, 250 mm NaCln/a0.240.410.1huPrP-(140-158), pH 4.5, 500 mm NaCln/a0.280.450.09huPrP-(140-158)D147A, pH 4.50.130.340.520.11huPrP-(140-158)E152A, pH 4.50.090.290.440.07huPrP-(110-157), 40% acetonitrile0.080.030.37n/ahuPrP-(110-157), 40% TFE0.11n/an/an/ahuPrP-(140-158), 40% TFE0.320.370.66n/aa Estimated from [θ]222 nm (31.Chen Y.

Open table in a new tab CD spectra of the peptides huPrP-(140–158) and huPrP-(140–166) show a broad negative band at 208 nm with a shoulder at 216 nm, indicating the presence of some regular secondary structure, whereas the spectrum of huPrP-(110–157) resembles more that of a random coil (Table I, full spectra are shown in supplemental information). The helix content of the peptides, as estimated from the residual ellipticity at 222 nm, amounts to 4% for huPrP-(110–157), 7% for huPrP-(140–158), and 6% for huPrP-(140–166) (Table I). CD spectroscopy shows consistently lower helix content than NMR spectroscopy because the CD signal represents an average over the entire peptide while NMR reports the helix content at a particular position. In addition, the high number of tyrosine residues in the peptides may lead to non-trivial CD spectra, thereby causing misestimation of secondary structure content (34.Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Padmanabhan S. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 5560-5565Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To further explore the conformational properties as a function of varying environment, peptides were investigated in the presence of the organic co-solvents trifluorethanol (TFE) and acetonitrile. TFE is known to stabilize the helical conformation of peptides (35.Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), whereas acetonitrile has been shown to enhance fibril formation in peptides (36.Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T.L. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), presumably by favoring extended conformations. To test whether helix 1 can be further stabilized, huPrP-(140–158) was studied in the presence of 40% TFE at pH 6.5. Judged by the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm in the CD, the helix content of the peptide has nearly tripled compared with the TFE-free sample at pH 6.5. This finding was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy indicating helical conformation for residues 144–156 with an upfield deviation of the 1Hα resonances, which is on average ∼0.5 ppm larger than that for the TFE-free sample (Fig. 1C). These observations show that the apparent rise in helix content indicated by CD spectroscopy is attributed to the higher population of helical conformers for residues 145–156 rather than to elongation of helix 1. Because huPrP-(110–157) contains the first β-strand and the potentially amyloidogenic palindrome AGAAAAGA in addition to helix 1, this peptide was investigated in the presence of 40% acetonitrile. However, no evidence for the peptide populating extended conformations (Table I) could be obtained. 1Hα chemical shifts still show helical conformation for residues 145–156 (Fig. 1C), but the 1Hα resonances are slightly shifted to lower field compared with the acetonitrile-free sample, indicating destabilization of the helical conformation. Although this finding holds true for the entire sequence, low field shifts were too small to be classified as extended conformations. Interactions Contributing to the Stability of Helix 1—The sequence of helix 1 exhibits several features that potentially stabilize helical conformations, either by electrostatic (charge-charge or charge-dipole) or by aromatic interactions. Residue Asp-144 acts as a N-cap for the helix stabilizing it by forming a hydrogen bond to an exposed backbone amide located NH2-terminally of the helix (37.Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three negative charges (Asp-144, Glu-146, and Asp-147) stabilize helix 1 through favorable electrostatic interactions with the helix dipole. Similarly, the COOH terminus is stabilized by the positive charges of Arg-151, His-155, and Arg-156. In addition, three pairs of oppositely charged amino acids (Asp-147/Arg-151, Asp-144/Arg-148, and Arg-148/Glu-152), each spaced four residues apart in sequence, potentially stabilize helix 1 by the formation of intrahelical salt bridges (38.Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Because the stability of helix 1 proved to be insensitive to its immediate sequence neighborhood, further investigations were conducted using the shortest and most soluble peptide, huPrP-(140–158). The contribution of charged residues to helix stability was addressed by changing the pH to 2.0 and 6.5, respectively. CD and NMR spectra at pH 6.5 are similar to those recorded at pH 4.5. Only very small 1Hα shifts to a higher field point toward a marginally more stable helical conformation at pH 6.5 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, spectra recorded at pH 2.0 exhibit a marked decrease in helix content (Table I). However, the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm as well as the 1Hα chemical shifts shows that the peptide retains some residual helicity even under acidic conditions. Chemical shift analysis reveals that no shortening of helix 1 occurs and that no part of the helix is preferentially destabilized. Instead, destabilization to approximately the same extent is observed over the entire helix (Fig. 2A). However, over the whole pH range investigated, no indications for population of extended conformers could be found. None of the NOESY spectra shows long range interactions, again indicating high conformational flexibility. This pH dependence of helix stability can be attributed to the change in the charge distribution of the peptide. At pH 6.5, all of the acidic and basic residues of the peptide are charged. The negative charges of Asp-144, Glu-146, and Asp-147 as well as the positive charges of Arg-151 and Arg-156 can exert their stabilizing influence on the helix macrodipole. Furthermore, i,i+4 spaced oppositely charged residues potentially form stabilizing salt bridges. Lowering the pH to 4.5 did not lead to significant destabilization, indicating that aspartate and glutamate residues are still carrying negative charges. At pH 2.0, all of the acidic residues are protonated, reducing salt bridges to charge-dipole interactions and charge-dipole to dipole-dipole interactions. This reduction of the strength of attractive electrostatic interactions in combination with repulsion by positively charged residues is suggested to be responsible for the decrease in helix content at pH 2.0. In particular, the putative salt bridges Asp-147/Arg-151 and Arg-148/Glu-152 are of interest with respect to the stability of helix 1. Therefore, huPrP-(140–158) was investigated at pH 4.5 in the presence of 50, 250, and 500 mm NaCl, respectively. No changes were observed with 50 mm NaCl compared with the salt-free peptide (data not shown). 1Hα chemical shifts also indicate helical conformation for residues 145–155 at both higher concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 2B). However, the population of the helix is nearly identical to that of the salt-free sample. In particular, the conformation of residues potentially involved in intrahelical salt bridges is not influenced by NaCl concentrations up to 500 mm. This might be because of the mutual cancellation of two opposite effects. Whereas increasing the salt concentration stabilizes helices by screening the helix macrodipole (39.Scholtz J.M. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5102-5104Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), solvent-exposed interactions between charged side chains are weakened at higher ionic strengths. To probe for the role of the putative salt bridges without being influenced by the abovementioned effects, we mutated amino acids contributing to the putative intrahelical salt bridges to huPrP-(140–158)D147A and huPrP-(140–158)E152A. The CD spectrum of huPrP-(140–158)E152A is virtually identical to the spectrum of the wild-type sequence, whereas the spectrum of huPrP-(140–158)D147A even exhibits an increase in helix population as judged from the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm (Table I). CD results are in good agreement with 1Hα chemical shifts analysis. Shifts for residues 145–155 of huPrP-(140–158)D147A (Fig. 2C) are nearly identical to the wild-type peptide with the exception of residues Tyr-145, Glu-146, and Ala-147, which are shifted to slightly higher field, indicating a marginally higher population of helical conformers. Similarly, the helix extends from Tyr-145 to His-155 in huPrP-(140–158)E152A. Again, 1Hα secondary chemical shifts are comparable with those of the wild-type peptide with the exception of a small downfield shift of approximately 0.05 ppm at the site of the mutation, indicating slight destabilization of the helix at this position (Fig. 2C). Helix content and relative secondary shifts for both mutations are consistent with predictions made by AGADIR (Table I) (40.Munoz V. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 41.Munoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 42.Munoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Disruption of salt bridges by mutation causes destabilization of the helix, which is compensated for by the high helix propensity of the substituent alanine. The effects of the mutations are confined to the immediate vicinity of the site of mutation (Fig. 2). Because the effects at the sites of the mutations are also rather small, indicating practically no change in helix population, experimental helix propensity scales (43.Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can be employed to estimate the stabilizing energy contributed by the amino acid residue exchanged. Exchange of a charged glutamate with alanine should result in a stabilization of 0.3–0.6 kcal/mol in the absence of additional interresidual interactions. The fact that only a small local destabilization of helix 1 in the E152A peptide was observed therefore implies the existence of a helix-stabilizing interaction in the wild-type peptide"
https://openalex.org/W2002321751,"Leukocyte-platelet interaction is important in mediating leukocyte adhesion to a thrombus and leukocyte recruitment to a site of vascular injury. This interaction is mediated at least in part by the β2-integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and its counter-receptor on platelets, glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα). High molecular weight kininogen (HK) was previously shown to interact with both GPIbα and Mac-1 through its domains 3 and 5, respectively. In this study we investigated the ability of HK to interfere with the leukocyte-platelet interaction. In a purified system, HK binding to GPIbα was inhibited by HK domain 3 and the monoclonal antibody (mAb) SZ2, directed against the epitope 269–282 of GPIbα, whereas mAb AP1, directed to the region 201–268 of GPIbα had no effect. In contrast, mAb AP1 inhibited the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction. Binding of GPIbα to Mac-1 was enhanced 2-fold by HK. This effect of HK was abrogated in the presence of HK domains 3 or 5 or peptides from the 475–497 region of the carboxyl terminus of domain 5 as well as in the presence of mAb SZ2 but not mAb AP1. Whereas no difference in the affinity of the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction was observed in the absence or presence of HK, maximal binding of GPIbα to Mac-1 doubled in the presence of HK. Moreover, HK/HKa increased the Mac-1-dependent adhesion of myelomonocytic U937 cells and K562 cells transfected with Mac-1 to immobilized GPIbα or to GPIbα-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Finally, Mac-1-dependent adhesion of neutrophils to surface-adherent platelets was enhanced by HK. Thus, HK can bridge leukocytes with platelets by interacting via its domain 3 with GPIbα and via its domain 5 with Mac-1 thereby augmenting the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction. These distinct molecular interactions of HK with leukocytes and platelets contribute to the regulation of the adhesive behavior of vascular cells and provide novel molecular targets for reducing atherothrombotic pathologies.

Multicellular interactions between leukocytes and the vessel wall are important in inflammatory processes or vascular remodeling. Leukocyte recruitment to vascular endothelium requires multistep adhesive and signaling events including selectin-mediated rolling, leukocyte activation, and integrin-mediated firm adhesion and diapedesis (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6400) Google Scholar). Leukocytes express members of the β2-integrin family including LFA-1 (αLβ2, CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18), and p150,95 (αXβ2, CD11c/CD18), as well as β1-integrins that interact with endothelial counterligands such as ICAM-1, 1The abbreviations used are: ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GPIbα, glycoprotein Ibα; HK, single chain high molecular weight kininogen; HKa, two-chain (kinin-free) high molecular weight kininogen; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. surface-associated fibrinogen, or vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (2Languino L.R.

After denudation of the endothelial cell lining at sites of vascular injury, leukocyte infiltration occurs through interactions with deposited platelets and fibrin (5Marcus A.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 261-269PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo studies demonstrated an association of both cell types within atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions, or in areas of ischemia-reperfusion injury (6Rinder C.S. Bonan J.L. Rinder H.M. Matthew J. Hines R. Smith B.R. Blood. 1992; 79: 1201-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar). Reminiscent of the leukocyte-endothelium interactions, a sequential adhesion process including leukocyte attachment to and transmigration across surface-adherent platelets has been proposed. Platelet P-selectin-mediated initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes through their P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 is followed by Mac-1-dependent firm adhesion and transplatelet migration (8McEver R.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Recent work indicated junctional adhesion molecule-3 and glycoprotein (GP) Ibα on platelets as potential counter-receptors for Mac-1 (9Santoso S. Sachs H.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T.

Furthermore, ICAM-2 and αIIbβ3-associated fibrinogen have also been proposed to mediate Mac-1-dependent platelet-leukocyte interactions (11Diacovo T.G. de Fougerolles A.R. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12Weber C. Springer T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar); however, the exact contribution of each system remains to be elucidated. High molecular weight kininogen (HK) and especially two-chain kinin-free kininogen (HKa) were previously reported to regulate adhesive events (13Chavakis T. Preissner K.T. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2003; 1: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F. Hammes H.P. Muller-Esterl W. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 514-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initially identified as a non-enzymatic cofactor in the initiation of the contact phase (15Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HK appears to be associated with vascular injury, inflammation, or activation of complement in humoral immune defense. In particular, kallikrein can liberate the short lived vasodilator peptide bradykinin from HK thereby generating two-chain kinin-free HKa (15Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Domains 3 and 5 in HK mediate the interactions with cell surfaces (15Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H.

Apart from heparan sulfate proteoglycans, the binding protein for globular C1q (denoted gC1qR), the urokinase receptor or cytokeratin-1 serve as HK-binding proteins on endothelial cells (16Renné T.

Moreover, domain 5 of HK binds to the β2-integrin Mac-1 on granulocytes and competes for fibrinogen and ICAM-1 binding in vitro and serves to regulate the Mac-1-dependent leukocyte recruitment in vivo (21Chavakis T.

On platelets, cell-associated thrombospondin as well as GPIb mediate the binding of HK (22DeLa Cadena R.A. Wyshock E.G. Kunapuli S.P. Schultze R.L. Miller M. Walz D.A. Colman R.W. Thromb.

Whereas binding to GPIbα has been mapped to the region Lys270-Gln292 of HK domain 3, multiple binding sites for HK have been proposed within the GPIbα molecule, among others the region 269–282 that contains three sulfated tyrosine residues, which is recognized by the mAb SZ2 (23Bradford H.N. DeLa Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the region 201–268 of GPIbα recognized by mAb AP1 mediates the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction (10Simon D.I. Chen C.P. Xu H. Li C.Q. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. Ballantyne C.M. Zhang L. Furman M.I.

These diverse observations prompted us to define the role and influence of HK on the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction. Our results demonstrate that HK enhances the binding between leukocytes and platelets by bridging Mac-1 and GPIbα and thereby provide new insights into the regulatory role of HK for leukocyte-platelet interactions. Reagents—Single and two-chain HK and HKa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The purified HK and HKa (>95%) appeared as a major band of 140 and 110 kDa, respectively, on non-reduced SDS gels. HK was digested with plasma kallikrein (HK to kallikrein = 100:1, mol/mol) for 20 min at 37 °C. The resulting HKa was composed of two bands of 62 and 46 kDa when analyzed by reduced SDS-gel electrophoresis. Biotin-labeled HK and HKa were produced as previously described (21Chavakis T.

CHO cells stably expressing GPIbβ/GPIX were kindly provided by Dr. José A. López (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). GPIbα full-length cDNA was cloned into pZeoSV2+ expression vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and a stable cell line expressing GPIbα/Ibβ/IX was generated by selecting positive clones with Zeocin™. All culture media were from Invitrogen. Flow Cytometry—100-μl cell suspension (CHO cells, CHO cells stably expressing GPIbβ/GPIX, or CHO cells stably expressing GPIbα/Ibβ/IX) were incubated with 20 μl of mAb (0.02 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min, washed twice, and labeled with 100 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:80 dilution; Dako). Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% BSA and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur™ (BD Biosciences). Cell Adhesion Assay—Adhesion of neutrophils, U937 cells, or K562 cells to immobilized ligands, surface-adherent platelets, or CHO cells was carried out as previously described (9Santoso S. Sachs H.J.

Briefly, plates were coated with glycocalicin (10 μg/ml) or non-transfected CHO cells, GPIbβ/GPIX-transfected CHO cells or GPIbα/Ibβ/IX-transfected CHO cells were grown to confluency onto 96-well plates. Human platelets (1.5 × 107/well) were added to microtiter plates precoated with 0.2% gelatin. After 1 h at 37 °C unbound platelets were removed. Fluorescence labeled neutrophils, U937 cells, or K562 cells (105/well) were washed twice followed by no pretreatment or stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (50 ng/ml) or the β2-integrin stimulating mAb Kim185 (10 μg/ml). Cells were washed and added to immobilized glycocalicin, platelets, or CHO cells at 37 °C for 60 min in the absence or presence of inhibitors, as indicated in the figure legends. After washing, adhesion of neutrophils, U937, or K562 cells was quantified as the percentage of total cells added using a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Neufahrn, Germany). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for Ligand-Receptor Interactions—A previously outlined procedure was used (9Santoso S. Sachs H.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 21Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Pixley R.A. May A.E. Isordia-Salas I. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T.

Med. 2002; 8: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, Maxisorp plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with Mac-1 (5 μg/ml) dissolved in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Mn2+, pH 7.2, or with glycocalicin (5 μg/ml) in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 3% BSA. Binding of biotin-labeled HK or HKa (10 nm each) to immobilized Mac-1 or glycocalicin was tested (same buffers as above but supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA, 10 μm Zn2+) in the absence or presence of competitors. After incubation for 2 h at 22 °C and a washing step, bound biotin-labeled HK or HKa was detected by 1:2000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Binding of biotin-glycocalicin (0–500 nm) to immobilized Mac-1 was performed in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Mn2+, pH 7.2, supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA without or together with 10 μm Zn2+ and in the absence or presence competitors. After the incubation period bound biotin-glycocalicin was detected by 1:2000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Bound streptavidin or secondary antibody were quantified using 2,2′-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline 6-sulfonic acid as substrate (Roche Diagnostics) in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) at 405 nm. Nonspecific binding to BSA-coated wells was used as blank in all cases and was subtracted to calculate specific binding. Characterization of the Interactions between HK and Mac-1 or HK and GPIbα—We have previously demonstrated that binding of HK/HKa to Mac-1 is predominantly mediated by domain 5 (21Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Pixley R.A. May A.E. Isordia-Salas I. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) while binding of HK/HKa to GPIbα is mediated by domain 3 of HK (23Bradford H.N. DeLa Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Zn2+, HK and HKa bound to both immobilized glycocalicin and Mac-1 (Fig. 1). Binding of HK/HKa to glycocalicin was inhibited by HK domain 3 but not by HK domains 5 or 6. Moreover, mAb SZ2, directed against the 269–282 region within GPIbα that contains three sulfated tyrosine residues, prevented the binding of HK/HKa to glycocalicin, whereas the antibody AP1 recognizing an epitope within the 201–268 region of GPIbα, previously reported to mediate the binding of GPIbα to Mac-1 (10Simon D.I. Chen C.P. Xu H. Li C.Q. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. Ballantyne C.M. Zhang L. Furman M.I. Berndt C. Lopez J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) was not effective in this respect (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the interaction between HK/HKa and immobilized Mac-1 was blocked by domain 5 but not domains 3 or 6 of HK. In addition, peptides from the 475–497 region (HK475, HK483) of HK domain 5 inhibited binding of HK/HKa to Mac-1, whereas scrambled peptides from the same region (HK475M, HK483M) or peptides from other regions of domain 5 (HK406, HK440; not shown) had no effect (Fig. 1B). Thus, binding of HK to Mac-1 is mediated by the 475–497 region of HK domain 5, whereas binding of HK to GPIbα is mediated by domain 3. In GPIbα the 269–282 region participates in the binding to HK, whereas the epitope recognized by the mAb AP1 does not. Effect of HK on the Interaction between Mac-1 and GPIbα— Because Mac-1 directly interacts with GPIbα and HK binds to both adhesion receptors, we tested the effect of HK on the interaction between both molecules. As previously shown, an epitiope within the 201–268 region in GPIbα mediates binding to Mac-1 (10Simon D.I. Chen C.P. Xu H. Li C.Q. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. Ballantyne C.M. Zhang L. Furman M.I. Berndt C. Lopez J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Indeed, binding of GPIbα to Mac-1 was inhibited by mAb LPM19c against Mac-1 and mAb AP1 directed to the 201–268 region of GPIbα but not by mAb SZ2 directed to the 269–282 region of GPIbα. In the presence of HK or HKa (data with HKa not shown) binding of glycocalicin to immobilized Mac-1 was significantly increased about 2-fold. Whereas mAb LPM19c completely abolished the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction both in the absence or presence of HK, mAb AP1 provided a complete inhibition of the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction in the absence of HK but only a 50% inhibition in the presence of HK. In contrast, the effect of HK on the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction was prevented in the presence of mAb SZ2 (Fig. 2A). The enhancement of the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction by HK was prevented by both domains 3 and 5 but not by domain 6. Moreover, the peptides HK475 and HK483 also reversed the effect of HK on the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction. In contrast, domains 3 and 5 as well as the peptide HK475 and HK483 did not affect the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction in the absence of HK (Fig. 2B). Taken together, HK binds with its domains 3 and 5 to GPIbα and Mac-1, respectively, and thereby augments the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction. To evaluate better the effect of HK on the interaction between Mac-1 and GPIbα, increasing concentrations of biotin-glycocalicin (0–500 nm) were bound to immobilized Mac-1 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of HK (0–500 nm). In the presence of HK the amount of bound glycocalicin was almost doubled (Fig. 2C). Scatchard analysis indeed revealed a doubling of maximal binding of glycocalicin to Mac-1 in the presence of HK (B max,HK250/B max,noHK = 2.08), whereas there was no significant difference in the affinity of the Mac-1-glycocalicin interaction in the absence or presence of HK (Kd of biotinylated glycocalicin to Mac-1 in the absence of HK, 0.312 ± 0.02 μm, whereas in the presence of 250 nm HK, 0.292 ± 0.012 μm). Reversing the assay (i.e. binding of Mac-1 or its ligand binding I-domain to immobilized glycocalicin in the absence or presence of HK) essentially lead to the same result, namely a doubling of maximal binding (data not shown). Thus, the number of GPIbα binding sites in the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction is approximately doubled in the presence of HK. HK Enhances the Neutrophil-Platelet Binding via Mac-1-GPIbα Interactions—Adhesion of myelomonocytic U937 cells to immobilized glycocalicin is mediated by Mac-1, as it was abolished in the presence of mAb LPM19c (not shown). U937 cell adhesion to glycocalicin was stimulated about 2-fold in the presence of HK or HKa. The isolated domains 3 and 5 of HK but not domain 6 reversed the pro-adhesive effect of HK, whereas they did not affect adhesion in the absence of HK (Fig. 3). To corroborate these results further, we investigated the adhesion of U937 cells to non-transfected CHO cells, to CHO cells transfected with GPIbβ/GPIX, or to GPIbα/Ibβ/GPIX-transfected CHO cells. The expression level of GPIX was comparable in the CHO cells stably expressing GPIbβ/IX and the CHO cells expressing GPIbα/Ibβ/IX. Also, the expression level of GPIbα was comparable with the level of GPIX in the cotransfected cells (Fig. 4A). No appreciable adhesion of U937 cells to untransfected CHO cells or CHO cells expressing GPIbβ/IX was noted both in the absence or presence of HK. In contrast, Mac-1-dependent adhesion to the CHO cells expressing GPIbα/Ibβ/IX was detected. Here, cell adhesion was doubled in the presence of HK. Thus, HK enhances Mac-1-dependent adhesion to cells expressing the GPIbα-Ibβ-IX complex only through its interaction with GPIbα (Fig. 4B). Moreover, HK and HKa dose dependently stimulated the adhesion of phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated U937 cells to GPIbα-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 5A). Analogous to the results obtained with purified components, U937 cell adhesion to GPIbα-transfected CHO cells was completely abolished by a blocking mAb against Mac-1 independent of the presence of HK/HKa. Moreover, anti-GPIbα mAb AP1 blocked U937 cell adhesion to GPIbα-transfected CHO cells completely in the absence of HK but only partially (about 50–60% inhibition) in the presence of HK or HKa, whereas anti-GPIbα mAb SZ2 only inhibited the stimulatory effect of HK on U937 cell adhesion. Strikingly, HK-stimulated adhesion of U937 cells to GPIbα-transfected CHO cells was almost completely abolished by combining the inhibitory action of both mAbs, AP1 and SZ2 (Fig. 5B). The isolated domains 3 and 5 of HK but not domain 6 reversed the proadhesive effect of HK, whereas they did not affect cell adhesion in the absence of HK (Fig. 5C). Similar results were obtained when we investigated the adhesion of Mac-1-transfected K562 (stimulated with the β2-integrin activating mAb Kim185) to immobilized glycocalicin or to GPIbα-transfected CHO cells (data not shown). In this system, LFA-1-transfected K562 cells did not adhere to CHO cells or GPIbα-transfected CHO cells in the absence or presence of HK (data not shown).Fig. 5Effect of HK on Mac-1-dependent adhesion to cells bearing GPIbα. A, the adhesion of U937 cells to CHO cells expressing GPIbα/Ibβ/IX was studied in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of HK (filled circles) or HKa (open squares). B, the adhesion of U937 cells to CHO cells expressing GPIbα/Ibβ/IX was studied in the absence (filled bars) or presence of HK (gray bars, 250 nm) without (–) or together with mAb LPM19c, AP1, SZ2, or a combination of both AP1 and SZ2 (each mAb 20 μg/ml). C, the adhesion of U937 cells to CHO cells expressing GPIbα/Ibβ/IX was studied in the absence (filled bars) or presence of HK (gray bars, 250 nm) without (–) or together with domain 3 (D3), domain 5 (D5), or domain 6 (D6) (each 500 nm). The number of adherent cells is expressed as percent of total added cells. Data are mean ± S.D. (n = 3) of a typical experiment, and similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As, the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction mediates the binding between neutrophils and platelets, we sought to determine the effect of HK on the adhesion of neutrophils isolated from human healthy donors to washed, surface-adherent platelets. Neutrophil adhesion to surface-adherent platelets was mediated by Mac-1 and was enhanced in the presence of HK (Fig. 6). Whereas domains 3 and 5 as well as antibody SZ2 reduced the increased adhesion of neutrophils to platelets in the presence of HK, they hardly affected adhesion in the absence of HK; in contrast, mAb AP1 reduced neutrophil adhesion to platelets more efficiently in the absence of HK (Fig. 6). Taken together, HK/HKa can provide an intercellular bridge between Mac-1 on leukocytes and GPIbα on platelets. Leukocyte binding to platelets enables the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of vascular injury after denudation of the endothelial cell lining. Leukocyte-platelet interactions are largely controlled by the degree and duration of adhesive contacts between both cell types. A sequential adhesion model of leukocyte attachment to and transmigration across surface-adherent platelets has been proposed, including P-selectin-mediated initial rolling (8McEver R.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and the subsequent Mac-1-dependent firm adhesion and transplatelet migration (32Diacovo T.G. Roth S.J. Buccola J.M. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 146-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Evangelista V. Manarini S. Rotondo S. Martelli N. Polischuk R. McGregor J.L. de Gaetano G. Cerletti C.

Blood. 1997; 89: 166-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among others, GPIbα is an important platelet counter-receptor for Mac-1. Through its propensity to interact with both, Mac-1 and GPIbα, HK was shown in the present study to augment leukocyte-platelet interactions by bridging the two adhesion receptors. These data provide new insights into the regulatory role of HK on adhesive events between vascular cells with potential implications in atherothrombotic disease. The following features are consistent with a specific modulatory role of HK on the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction. (i) HK domain 5, and particularly the region 475–497, interacts with Mac-1, whereas HK domain 3 directly binds to GPIbα. The binding site for GPIbα in HK was shown to be within the region 270–292 of HK domain 3 (23Bradford H.N. DeLa Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding sites for Mac-1 and HK in GPIbα are distinct, as binding GPIbα to Mac-1 and HK is inhibited by mAb AP1 (recognizing an epitope within the region 201–268 of GPIbα) and mAb SZ2 (recognizing the region 269–282 of GPIbα), respectively (10Simon D.I. Chen C.P. Xu H. Li C.Q. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. Ballantyne C.M. Zhang L. Furman M.I. Berndt C. Lopez J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 23Bradford H.N. DeLa Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Consequently, HK promotes the interaction between isolated Mac-1 and GPIbα in a purified system, the Mac-1-dependent adhesion of myelomonocytic U937 cells to immobilized glycocalicin, and provides an intercellular bridge between Mac-1 on neutrophils and GPIbα on platelets. These results were corroborated using Mac-1- and GPIbα-transfected cells. Whereas no significant difference in the affinity of the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction was observed in the absence or presence of HK, maximal binding of glycocalicin to immobilized Mac-1 doubles in the presence of HK. Thus, the number of GPIbα binding sites in the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction doubles in the presence of HK. Therefore, we conclude that Mac-1 simultaneously binds to HK and GPIbα, with a bound HK molecule binding another molecule of GPIbα. (iii) The stimulatory effect of HK on the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction was blocked in the presence of isolated domains 3 or 5 that compete for HK binding to GPIbα and Mac-1, respectively. In contrast, neither isolated domains of HK affected the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction in the absence of HK. (iv) Whereas mAb AP1 completely abolished the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction in the absence of HK, it only provided a partial inhibition in the presence of HK. In contrast, mAb SZ2 inhibited the stimulatory effect of HK on the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction, although it did not affect this interaction in the absence of HK. Strikingly, the combination of both antibodies completely abolished Mac-1-GPIbα interaction in the presence of HK. The results with the mAbs strengthen the hypothesis that HK doubles the binding sites of the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction. Thus, in the presence of HK additional binding sites on Mac-1 and GPIbα are engaged, augmenting cell-cell adhesion between leukocytes and platelets. Although it was previously shown that HK also binds to GPIX (23Bradford H.N. DeLa Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this interaction is not sufficient to enhance the adhesion between Mac-1-bearing cells and platelets or cells that express GPIX. Thus, HK enhances Mac-1-dependent adhesion to platelets or cells expressing the GPIbα-Ibβ-IX complex only through its interaction with GPIbα. The hypothesis that HK dimers or oligomers may be formed that promote the bridging between the two adhesion receptors needs further experimental proof. Besides HK, which regulates the Mac-1-GPIbα interaction and thereby leukocyte-platelet interactions, additional Mac-1-dependent and -independent binding sites on platelets have been described previously. Other potential Mac-1 ligands present on the platelet membrane include junctional adhesion molecule-3 (9Santoso S. Sachs H.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp.

Further detailed functional analysis needs to be performed to clarify the contribution of each platelet-associated Mac-1 ligand in leukocyte-platelet interactions. Also Mac-1-independent interactions contribute to leukocyte-platelet aggregate formation including thrombospondin bridging between GPIV receptors on platelets and monocytes (37Silverstein R. Asch A.S. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) or binding of P-selectin on activated platelets to leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (38Skinner M.P. Lucas C.M.

Apart from its role as precursor of bradykinin, which serves important vasodilator functions in vascular homeostasis, HK exerts regulatory activities on hemostasis as well as on cell adhesion with several implications in inflammatory cell recruitment or angiogenesis (21Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Pixley R.A. May A.E. Isordia-Salas I. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Colman R.W. Jameson B.A. Lin Y. Johnson D. Mousa S.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 543-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HK and especially HKa and domain 5 were previously described to exert anti-adhesive properties (14Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F. Hammes H.P. Muller-Esterl W. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 514-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is not necessarily contradictory to the pro-adhesive effect of HK and HKa, described here. In fact, the data presented here help to explain the anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory role of the isolated domain 5 observed in an acute peritonitis model in vivo (21Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Pixley R.A. May A.E. Isordia-Salas I. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Namely, isolated domain 5 may be anti-inflammatory not only by interfering with the Mac-1-ICAM-1 interaction but also by abrogating the HK-stimulated Mac-1-dependent leukocyte binding to platelets. Furthermore, HK was previously described to regulate platelet aggregation. Domains 3 and 5, as well as fragments thereof inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and interfere with ligand binding to αIIbβ3-integrin, respectively (24Kunapuli S.P. Bradford H.N.

However, the present work indicates that the antithrombotic properties of these domains might also be attributable to their ability to interfere with Mac-1-GPIbα-dependent leukocyte-platelet interactions. In the present work the whole molecule, HK or HKa, has proadhesive functions, whereas isolated domains 3 and 5 are anti-adhesive. This is in accordance with previous reports comparing the actions of the whole HK versus an isolated fragment or domain. In particular, isolated domain 5 inhibited platelet aggregation and prolonged bleeding time in vivo, whereas HK or HKa failed to do so (40Chavakis T. Boeckel N. Santoso S. Voss R. Isordia-Salas I.

Moreover, HK is proangiogenic as opposed to the anti-angiogenic actions of the isolated domain 5 (26Colman R.W. Jameson B.A. Lin Y. Johnson D. Mousa S.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 543-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, HK interacts with platelet GPIbα and leukocyte Mac-1 via its domains 3 and 5, respectively, providing an intercellular bridge between both adhesion receptors. HK thereby potentially contributes to the accumulation of leukocytes to surface-adherent platelets at sites of vascular injury after denudation of the endothelial cell lining, which is relevant within atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions, or in areas of ischemia-reperfusion injury. HK may provide a novel molecular target for reducing inflammatory cell recruitment in atherothrombotic vascular pathologies. The excellent technical assistance of T. Schmidt-Wöll, S. Werth, and U.

https://openalex.org/W2146034424,"Leishmania major 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase is a crescent-shaped molecule comprising three domains. The N-terminal and central domains are similar to the thiosulfate sulfurtransferase rhodanese and create the active site containing a persulfurated catalytic cysteine (Cys-253) and an inhibitory sulfite coordinated by Arg-74 and Arg-185. A serine protease-like triad, comprising Asp-61, His-75, and Ser-255, is near Cys-253 and represents a conserved feature that distinguishes 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferases from thiosulfate sulfurtransferases. During catalysis, Ser-255 may polarize the carbonyl group of 3-mercaptopyruvate to assist thiophilic attack, whereas Arg-74 and Arg-185 bind the carboxylate group. The enzyme hydrolyzes benzoyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide, an activity that is sensitive to the presence of the serine protease inhibitor Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, which also lowers 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase activity, presumably by interference with the contribution of Ser-255. The L. major 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase is unusual with an 80-amino acid C-terminal domain, bearing remarkable structural similarity to the FK506-binding protein class of peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase.

Sulfurtransferases (EC 2.8.1.1–5) catalyze the transfer of sulfane sulfur from a donor molecule to a thiophilic acceptor.

Nevertheless, despite intensive study, the biological functions and identification of the physiological substrates of sulfurtransferases remain uncertain.The archetypal sulfurtransferase is rhodanese, a thiosulfate: cyanide sulfurtransferase (TST) 1The abbreviations used are: TSTthiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferaseMST3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferaseLmMSTL. major 3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferasepNAp-nitroanilideSeMetselenomethionineBisTris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneBz-benzoyl-TLCKNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketoneTPCKtosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketoner.m.s.d.root mean square deviationFKBPFK506-binding proteinMIPmacrophage infectivity potentiator proteinPPIasepeptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase.1The abbreviations used are: TSTthiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferaseMST3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferaseLmMSTL. major 3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferasepNAp-nitroanilideSeMetselenomethionineBisTris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneBz-benzoyl-TLCKNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketoneTPCKtosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketoner.m.s.d.root mean square deviationFKBPFK506-binding proteinMIPmacrophage infectivity potentiator proteinPPIasepeptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase. able to catalyze the transfer of the thiosulfate sulfur to cyanide in vitro. The related 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferase (MST)), first discovered in rat liver (14Meister A. Fed. Proc. 1953; 12: 245Google Scholar), catalyzes reactions similar to those catalyzed by rhodanese, but uses 3-mercaptopyruvate in preference to thiosulfate as the donor in the two-step reaction,HSCH2COCOO-+E↔CH2COCOO-+ESStep 1 ES+CN-↔E+SCN-Step 2 where E represents the free enzyme and ES the enzyme-sulfur adduct.Crystal structures of rhodaneses have been elucidated and analyzed in detail (15Gliubich F.

Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of two domains that, despite a low level of sequence identity, are structurally homologous. Each domain, often referred to as a rhodanese domain, is constructed from a five-stranded β-sheet core surrounded by five α-helical sections. The active site, with a catalytic cysteine, is situated in a cleft formed at the interface of the domains, although it is mainly constructed from residues associated with the C-terminal domain. For that reason, this domain is often termed the active domain, whereas the N-terminal domain is described as inactive.Rhodanese-related enzymes are composed of either two rhodanese domains or a single, catalytically active rhodanese domain (1Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21Spallarossa A. Donahue J.L. Larson T.J. Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Structure. 2001; 9: 1117-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The rhodanese-like domain has been observed in association with other protein domains, e.g. in mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (22Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rink M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23Hofmann K. Bucher P. Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The similarity between rhodanese and this phosphatase extends from the overall fold to spatial conservation of the active-site cysteine utilized by both enzymes. This suggests that the rhodanese fold is optimized for activation of a catalytic cysteine.Although there is no structure yet available for any MSTs, several observations suggest that they are evolutionarily and structurally related to TSTs (1Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Ogata K. Volini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8087-8093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nagahara N. Ito T. Minami M. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1277-1286PubMed Google Scholar). The two types of enzyme catalyze the sulfurtransferase reaction via the formation of a persulfide sulfur covalently bound to the thiol of a catalytic cysteine and display significant levels of sequence similarity, and some are immunologically cross-reactive. However, the different preferred in vitro sulfur donors suggest that the enzymes have different in vivo substrates and physiological roles.Despite the presence of a conserved catalytic cysteine, suggestive of a similar mechanism, the amino acid composition and location of charged residues in the active site of TSTs and MSTs are distinct (21Spallarossa A. Donahue J.L. Larson T.J. Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Structure. 2001; 9: 1117-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In TSTs, two large and basic residues within the hexapeptide motif Cys-Arg-Lys-Gly-Val-Thr follow the catalytic cysteine. In MSTs, the Arg-Lys pair is replaced by a Gly-Ser or Gly-Thr combination. Mutation of these particular residues to those observed in the other family of enzymes results in partial conversion to that activity, i.e. MST becomes more rhodanese-like and vice versa (24Nagahara N. Okazaki T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16230-16235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Nagahara N. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27395-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Studies on the sulfurtransferase SseA, an Escherichia coli protein involved in serine sensitivity, have reinforced the observation that the sequence following the active-site cysteine can distinguish sulfurtransferases as TSTs or MSTs (26Colnaghi R. Cassinelli G. Drummond M. Forlani F. Pagani S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but the structural consequences of such non-conservative amino acid differences to the active site of MST were unclear.Williams et al. (27Williams R.A.M. Kelly S.M. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1480-1486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) recently identified and characterized a cytosolic MST from the parasitic trypanosomatid Leishmania major (LmMST). Expression of this enzyme is up-regulated in L. major promastigotes during conditions of oxidative stress, suggesting an involvement in detoxification of peroxides; and, in common with E. coli and mammalian MSTs (28Nandi D.L.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), LmMST is able to utilize thioredoxin as the thiophilic acceptor. It was also reported that LmMST can fold independently (27Williams R.A.M. Kelly S.M. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1480-1486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), in contrast to many other sulfurtransferases, which require molecular chaperones to assist such a process (31Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the unusual 80-amino acid C-terminal extension in LmMST may play a part in the folding process, particularly as short truncations of this region resulted in misfolded protein (27Williams R.A.M. Kelly S.M. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1480-1486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The availability of a stable and active recombinant enzyme allowed us to initiate a crystallographic study to delineate structure-activity relationships in an MST with the aims of characterizing the active site, investigating the roles of the two residues immediately following the catalytic cysteine, determining the structure of the C-terminal extension, and providing an MST model for detailed comparisons with TSTs. A number of assays using peptidyl-p-nitroanilide (pNA) substrates were carried out seeking to identify additional enzyme activities.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample Preparation and Crystallization—Recombinant LmMST was expressed and purified according to Williams et al.

Initial crystallization trials used the sparse matrix approach (32Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar), applying the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique with reagents from Hampton Research. Crystals were grown overnight under Crystal Screen I condition 46 (18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 200 mm calcium acetate) at 20 °C. Optimization of these conditions resulted in crystals with approximate dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm3 from a drop consisting of 1 μl of protein (3.5 mg/ml) and 1 μl of reservoir (14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 80 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 160 mm calcium acetate). Crystals were cryoprotected with 20% glycerol and maintained at -170 °C for transportation to beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), where data were measured.Native crystals of LmMST diffracted to 2.7-Å resolution and display the tetragonal space group P42212 with unit cell lengths of a = 109.6 and c = 67.3 Å. The asymmetric unit contains a single polypeptide with an approximate molecular mass of 42 kDa, a solvent content of ∼49%, and Vm = 2.4 Å3/Da.The methionine auxotrophic strain of E. coli, B834(DE3), was heat shock-transformed with the plasmid carrying the gene for LmMST (27Williams R.A.M.

Bacteria were cultured in M9 minimal medium containing selenomethionine (Se-Met). Expression of LmMST was induced at mid-log phase with 0.6 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cell growth continued overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 × g, resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 5 mm benzamidine) and, following the addition of deoxyribonuclease I and lysozyme, were lysed using a French press. Insoluble debris was separated by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing soluble LmMST was passed through a 0.2-μm syringe filter and then applied to a Ni2+-resin column (HiTrap, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. Following a wash with 20 mm BisTris propane and 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.5) using a BioCAD 700E (Applied Biosystems), the product was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient from 0 to 500 mm. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing LmMST were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mm NaCl. The sample was then subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a 5-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed with 25 mm BisTris propane (pH 8.0), and MST was found in the flow-through and wash fractions. These fractions were passed over a second Ni2+-resin column to concentrate the protein, and LmMST was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient from 0 to 500 mm. Fractions containing LmMST were again pooled and dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mm Na2S2O3. The dialyzed protein was concentrated (Centricon-10/Microcon-10, Millipore Corp.) to ∼3.5 mg/ml for use in crystallization experiments. SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to assess purity, and the latter technique was also used to confirm full incorporation of 12 SeMet residues. Crystals of the SeMet MST protein grew under the same conditions as, and are isomorphous with, the native crystals, but diffracted to higher resolution.Data Collection and Processing—Data were measured at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (beamline ID14 EH2). A single SeMet derivative crystal was soaked in a solution of 70% reservoir and 30% glycerol for 10 s and flash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at -170 °C. The wavelength used was 0.933 Å, and a highly redundant data set (180 × 1° oscillations; Data set 1) was measured on an ADSC Quantum4 detector, processed, and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (33Otwinowski Z.

Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar) positioned a polyalanine model of bovine rhodanese (Protein Data Bank code 1ORB) (16Gliubich F. Gazerro M. Zanotti G. Delbono S.

The results from all of these programs were combined to produce a polyalanine model of LmMST onto which side chains were assigned using O (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 40: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). A subset of data (5%) was set aside for the calculation of Rfree (41Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used as a guide for the refinement. The Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients derived from the DM calculations were included as phase restraints in the early stages of refinement. Several rounds of refinement with CNS (crystallography and NMR system) (42Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar) interspersed with rounds of model building produced a model for LmMST. The electron and difference density maps were noisy, especially at the selenium positions, and the highly redundant data set displayed evidence of radiation damage; so a truncated data set based on the first 70° of data was prepared and used to complete the refinement (Data set 2) (see Table I). Further refinement with the addition of water molecules and ions completed the analysis. Residues 1–6 and 239–243 are disordered. The stereochemistry of the model was assessed with PROCHECK (see Table I for details) (44Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and secondary structure was assigned using PROMOTIF (45Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—The serine protease activity of LmMST was assayed with various peptidyl-pNA substrates (benzoyl (Bz)-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA, Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA, Bz-Arg-Arg-pNA, and Bz-Arg-pNA, each dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) in a reaction mixture of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 75 μg of LmMST. The reaction was started by the addition of pNA substrate diluted to a final concentration of 3 mm in the assay mixture at 37 °C and was monitored continuously for 30 min by detecting the release of pNA spectrometrically at 420 nm. The molar extinction coefficient was taken as 9.5 × 103 cm-1m-1. Trypsin (Promega) was used as the control. Sulfurtransferase activity was measured using 3-mercaptopyruvate as substrate and lead acetate to trap the H2S released (27Williams R.A.M. Kelly S.M. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1480-1486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inhibition of these activities was assayed following a 30-min preincubation of LmMST at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing the appropriate concentration of the following inhibitors: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.1-5 mm), TLCK (7-400 μm), TPCK (10-100 μm), and E-64 (l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane; 1-50 μm).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure Determination—Recombinant LmMST has been cloned, expressed, and purified, and ordered crystals (diffracting to 2.7-Å resolution) have been obtained and characterized. The crystals are tetragonal and display space group P42212 with a = 109.6 and c = 67.3 Å, and the asymmetric unit contains a single polypeptide. Attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement were unsuccessful; therefore, experimental phase information was sought from a SeMet derivative. The SeMet LmMST crystallized isomorphously and provided improved diffraction to 2.1-Å resolution (Table I). Initial phase information was obtained using a single wavelength anomalous dispersion approach with a highly redundant (oscillation range of 180°) data set. Density modification produced an electron density map (Fig. 1) into which the molecular model was constructed, and then refinement was initiated. Because of the effects of radiation damage, a modified data set (the first 70° of oscillation data) was used to complete the refinement. A sulfite is bound in the active site, and the catalytic Cys-253 is persulfurated, likely consequences of the Na2S2O3 that was included during the enzyme purification and in the protein solutions from which crystals were grown. Cys-331 is also persulfurated; Cys-80 appears as an arsenocysteine, a consequence of the crystallization conditions containing cacodylate, and has been modeled in two orientations, each of occupancy 0.5 (see Table I for further details).Shape, Fold, and Secondary Structure—Monomeric LmMST is a crescent-shaped molecule with approximate dimensions of 70 × 50 × 40 Å (Fig. 2a) and comprising N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain of ∼160 residues exhibits the rhodanese-like domain fold with a five-stranded parallel β-sheet (β1, β2, β4, β5, and β6) surrounded by five α-helices (α1–α5) and a small section of 310-helix (θ1) (Fig. 2, a and b). In addition, a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β3 and β7) is placed on one side of the parallel β-sheet. The N-terminal domain is connected to the central domain via an extended section of polypeptide on the outer surface of the protein. The central domain (residues 167–288) also exhibits a rhodanese-like fold, this time a four-stranded parallel β-sheet (β8, β9, β12, and β13) surrounded by four α-helices (α6–α9) and two small sections of 310-helix (θ2 and θ3). A small two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β10 and β11) is also present in this domain. The sulfurtransferase active site is positioned between the two rhodanese-like domains and is described below. Two proline residues (positions 290 and 291) produce an ∼90° bend between helices α9 and α10. Helix α9 completes the central domain, and helix α10 represents the start of the C-terminal domain (residues 290–370). This third domain comprises a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β14, β15, β16, and β17) with an α-helix (α11) between strands β15 and β16 and an extended loop between strands β14 and β15 (Fig. 2, a and b).Fig. 2a, stereo view ribbon diagram of LmMST. The inactive N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains are labeled, and the secondary structure associated with each is colored navy blue and red, slate blue and maroon, and cyan and magenta, respectively. The sulfite binding in the active site and the persulfurated cysteines in the active site (Cys-253) and C-terminal domain (Cys-331) are depicted in ball-and-stick representation. Helices are numbered in white, and strands in yellow. The loop between Gln-238 and Ala-244 is disordered. Figs. 2a, 3, 4, and 6 were prepared using MOLSCRIPT (63Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar). The overall sequence identity within the MST family is only ∼20%, although higher values are observed when comparing the MSTs of trypanosomatids (27Williams R.A.M. Kelly S.M. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H.

The conservation of amino acid residues is pronounced in and around the active site and at the core of the rhodanese-like domains. The active-site Cys-Gly-Ser-Gly-Val-(Thr/Ser) motif (residues 253–258 in LmMST) is strictly conserved in all MSTs. The alignment of LmMST with r"

Recombinant and tissue-extracted forms of bovine opticin were subjected to biochemical and biophysical characterization. Following SDS-PAGE the predominant component produced by both forms was a broad band between 45–52 kDa. There was evidence for two-stage processing and, additionally, a proteolytic cleavage product of ∼25 kDa. Deconvolution of circular dichroism spectra revealed β-sheet (41%), β-turn (21%), and α-helix (10%), and thermal denaturation experiments showed a transition with a midpoint of 47 °C. Weight-averaged molecular mass measurements using both light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that opticin exists in solution as a stable dimer of ∼90 kDa, which can be dissociated into a monomer by denaturation with 2.5 m guanidine hydrochloride or during SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Opticin remains a dimer after removal of the amino-terminal region by O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase digestion, suggesting that dimer formation is mediated by the leucine-rich repeats. Dimerization could have a number of functional consequences, including divalent ligand interactions.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). They contain a varying number of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that contain the consensus sequence LXXLXLXXNXL, where X is any amino acid, L is leucine, isoleucine or valine, and N can be asparagine, cysteine or threonine. The LRRs are generally flanked by 4 cysteine residues at the amino-terminal end and two at the carboxyl-terminal end. The SLRPs have been subdivided into three classes depending upon the number of LRRs, the spacing of the four amino-terminal cysteine residues, and the number of exons encoding the gene (1Iozzo R.V.

The class I and II SLRPs possess ∼12 LRRs, whereas the class III members, including opticin (3Reardon A.J. Le Goff M. Briggs M.D. McLeod D. Sheehan J.K. Thornton D.J. Bishop P.N. J. Biol.

Opticin was first identified in a 4 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) extract of collagen fibrils from the vitreous humor of the eye (3Reardon A.J. Le Goff M. Briggs M.D. McLeod D. Sheehan J.K. Thornton D.J. Bishop P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2123-2139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Opticin expression is largely confined to the eye and, in the mouse, was localized specifically to the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body (8Takanosu M. Boyd T.C. Le Goff M. Henry S.P. Zhang Y. Bishop P.N. Mayne R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2202-2210PubMed Google Scholar). However, expressed sequence tag analyses of adult human iris and retinal pigment epithelium/choroid (available at neibank.nei.nih.gov/index.shtml) suggest that opticin is a very common transcript in these tissues (9Wistow G.

Sci. 2000; 41: 2059-2066PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recently published immunolocalization data suggests the presence of opticin in a number of ocular tissues, including the cornea, iris, ciliary body, vitreous, choroid, and retina (12Friedman J.S.

Opticin, epiphycan, and osteoglycin/mimecan possess very similar LRR domains with 73% of amino acids showing identity or similarity between the three protein sequences. However, the regions amino-terminal to the 4 cysteine clusters are more diverse. The amino-terminal region of opticin contains a cluster of sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides (3Reardon A.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2123-2139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), epiphycan/PG-Lb has an amino-terminal dermatan sulfate side chain and two O-linked oligosaccharides (5Johnson H.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18709-18717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas osteoglycin/mimecan bears N-linked keratan sulfate side chains that are attached in the LRR domains (7Funderburgh J.L.

Although there is a body of data concerning the physical properties of the class I and II SLRPs, little is known about the class III members. Here we show that opticin has a similar secondary structure and thermal denaturation profile to class I and II SLRPs and that it exists as a stable dimer in solution. Cloning and Sequencing of Bovine Opticin cDNA—A custom oligo(dT) primed Uni-ZAP™ cDNA library was prepared by Stratagene from RNA extracted from whole fetal bovine eyes. Part of the coding region of bovine opticin was amplified from the library by PCR using the primers 5′-atga(ag)g(tc)tcctggctttcctg-3′ and 5′-tccaggcggatgtcttccag-3′, which were designed by aligning the human and mouse opticin cDNA sequences. The 3′ end of the cDNA sequence was obtained by 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using oligo(dT)-primed total RNA extracted from fetal bovine eyes. The sense primer 5′-agttcctctacctggcggata-3′ was designed in the coding region of the bovine opticin cDNA. This primer was used in conjunction with primers complementary to the 3′ adaptor end added during the 3′ rapid amplification (Invitrogen). PCR products were cloned using the TA Cloning® method (Invitrogen) and sequenced using M13R and M13(-20) primers with ABI Prism™ dye terminator cycle sequencing reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The products were analyzed on an ABI 377 machine. The 5′ end of the open reading frame was completed after identifying a bovine opticin expressed sequence tag sequence (AW430351). The translation of this sequence was used to interrogate various proteomics tools at the ExPASy web site (ca.expasy.org). Construction of Expression Vector—Bovine ciliary body RNA was used as a template for an oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA generated was used for a polymerase chain reaction with the primers 5′-ctagctagcatctctctcagaggagagggaag-3′ and 5′-cgcggatccgcacgtgcgtgtgcat-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 85–109 and 1120–1135 of the opticin cDNA sequence (Fig. 1) with the addition of NheI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified cDNA was digested with the restriction enzymes NheI and BamHI and cloned into the pCEP-Pu expression vector (13Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This vector is a modified version of the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) incorporating the BM40 signal peptide, which was used to replace the opticin signal peptide. The resultant fusion protein, after removal of the signal peptide, was predicted to contain three amino-terminal vector-derived amino acids (i.e. APL). Protein Expression and Purification—The expression vector was transfected into 293-EBNA cells (human embryonic kidney cells, Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and after 24 h transfectants were selected by the addition of puromycin (5 μg/ml). Upon confluency, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium without fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated in this medium for 48 h, the conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the protease inhibitors EDTA (5 mm, final concentration) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm, final concentration) were added. Purification of Recombinant Bovine Opticin—Conditioned medium (2–4 liters) was applied at a flow rate of 5 ml/min to a 30-ml Fast Flow DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (Tris buffer). The column was washed with 0.2 m NaCl in Tris buffer (TBS) containing 0.2% CHAPS and then with TBS alone. The column was then eluted with 0.7 m NaCl in Tris buffer. The fraction containing opticin was diluted to a final NaCl concentration of 0.1 m and applied to a 3-ml Jacalin lectin-Sepharose (Sigma) affinity column equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl in Tris buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer prior to elution with 1 m melibiose in 0.1 m NaCl, Tris buffer. The effluent from this column was applied directly to a 1.5-ml Fast Flow DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in TBS. The column was washed with TBS and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.7 m NaCl in Tris buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and those containing opticin were identified by SDS-PAGE with silver staining and Western blotting. The opticin was stored in frozen (–70 °C), concentrated aliquots and not subjected to lyophilization during any of the experiments. Purification of Opticin from Bovine Vitreous Humor—Frozen bovine vitreous humor from 100 bovine eyes was thawed, and the collagen fibrils were pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was initially washed with Tris buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-ethyl-maleimide, 5 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The pellet was then washed three times with 5-liter volumes of 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA in Tris buffer and subsequently with 5 liters of 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA in Tris buffer. The pellet was then extracted with 4 m GdnHCl in Tris buffer. This extract was dialyzed into 175 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, prior to application to a Jacalin lectin-Sepharose column and subsequent purification as described above for recombinant opticin. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was undertaken using 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen) with the MOPS buffer system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Silver staining of gels and peptide mass mapping of excised bands was performed as previously described (3Reardon A.J. Le Goff M. Briggs M.D. McLeod D. Sheehan J.K. Thornton D.J. Bishop P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2123-2139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Three rabbit polyclonal antisera were used to probe nitrocellulose membranes following Western blotting. The antiserum OPT-C was generated using a peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal human peptide sequence CLPRLPIGRFT, OPT-N was generated against an amino-terminal bovine peptide sequence SLSEEREGDPYAILHLGD, and OPT-A was generated against the human peptide sequence VLNPDNYGEVIDLSNYEELTDYGDQLPEVK (see Fig. 2). In addition, membranes were probed with biotinylated Jacalin (Artocarpus integrifolia) lectin and streptavidin-peroxidase (Sigma). For all blots a Chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy and Melting Temperature—CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco JA-810 spectropolarimeter on samples exchanged into 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Sample protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Bio-Rad) (14Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Estimation of secondary structure content was performed using the CONTIN/LL, SELCON3, and CDSSTR programs (15Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The melting temperature was determined by monitoring the ellipticity at 205 nm between 25 and 60 °C. Multiangle Laser Light Scattering Analysis—Samples of purified recombinant bovine opticin were applied onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) running at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with either TBS containing 1 mm EDTA or 2.5 m GdnHCl in Tris buffer (Tris-GdnHCl). The column eluant was passed through an in-line DAWN DSP laser photometer (laser wavelength 488 nm) and a Wyatt/Optilab 903 interferometric refractometer (Optichem, Clywd, UK) equilibrated at 25 °C. Light scattering intensity and eluant refractive index (concentration) were analyzed using ASTRA™ software (Optichem) to give a weight-averaged molecular mass (M̄ W). A value for dn/dc of 0.17 ml/g was used for opticin as previously established for decorin core protein (16Zangrando D. Gupta R. Jamieson A.M. Blackwell J. Scott P.G. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Following Superose 12 chromatography, 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. O-Sialoglycoprotein Endopeptidase Digestion—Following Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography a 1-ml opticin-containing fraction was digested with O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.57 from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Ontario, Canada) at a 1:1 (w/w) enzyme/substrate ratio for 3 h at 37 °C. The digestion products were then re-chromatographed on the Superose 12 column. Analysis of Molecular Characteristics using Size Exclusion Chromatography—Samples of purified recombinant opticin were applied to a HR 10/30 Superose 12 gel filtration column. The column had been calibrated with the globular proteins cytochrome c, β-lactoglobulin dimer, alcohol dehydrogenase, and catalase, of which both the molecular weights and hydrodynamic radius (R H) are known. The samples were run at 0.2 ml/min in 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and the distribution coefficient (K av) and corresponding R H were estimated from the calibration. Sedimentation Equilibrium—An Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) was used at a rotor speed of 8000 rpm at 20 °C using six-sector cells. Absorption optics at 230 nm were used. Equilibrium was established within 20 h and confirmed by successive overlay scans at 2-h intervals. Using the XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (version 6.03, Beckman/Microcal) for a single ideal species, M̄ W was determined. Sedimentation Velocity—The sedimentation coefficient for opticin was obtained from velocity experiments using the Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge. The experiments were performed using double sector cells and a rotor speed of 35,000 rpm, with 15 scans at 20-min intervals at a wavelength of 230 nm. The sedimenting boundary was analyzed using the velocity analysis program, and the resulting apparent sedimentation coefficient was corrected to standard conditions of water at 20 °C (17Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. Wiley, New York1961: 381Google Scholar) using a partial specific volume (v̄) of 0.721 ml/g, obtained by protein sequence analysis and assuming 20% glycosylation (18Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—Bovine opticin cDNA consists of a minimum of 1689 bp and has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 321 amino acids (Fig. 1). The amino-terminal end of the mature protein (i.e. ASL...) has been determined previously by Edman degradation sequencing (3Reardon A.J. Le Goff M. Briggs M.D. McLeod D. Sheehan J.K. Thornton D.J. Bishop P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2123-2139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the same or equivalent position was predicted to be the most likely start of the mature bovine, human, and mouse proteins using the SignalP V1.1 program (Fig. 2). Consequently, the unmodified mature bovine opticin protein core has a molecular mass of 33,578 Da and a pI of 5.19. Alignment of the bovine, human (3Reardon A.J. Le Goff M. Briggs M.D. McLeod D.

Behal A. Touchman J.W. Bouffard G. Smith D. Peterson K. Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 205-220PubMed Google Scholar), and dog (19Pellegrini B. Acland G.M. Ray J. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) protein sequences revealed an overall amino acid sequence identity or similarity of 79%, increasing to 93% when just the LRR domains and carboxyl-terminal regions were compared (Fig. 2). A region containing 12 Ser or Thr residues between 71 and 103 in the bovine sequence was predicted to contain 5 O-glycosylation sites in among 12 Ser/Thr residues using the NetOGlyc 2.0 program (20Hansen J.E. Lund O. Tolstrup N. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Brunak S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Although the number and positions of the Ser and Thr residues differ between species, this region is present in all of them (Fig. 2) and, at least in human and mouse genomic sequences, is contained within a single exon (i.e. exon 3). The Sulfinator program (21Monigatti F. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Jung E. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) predicts that Tyr61 is sulfated and that the equivalent Tyr residue is sulfated in all four species. Purification and Comparison between Recombinant and Extracted Bovine Opticin—The sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides of opticin were utilized to purify both recombinant and extracted opticin with sialylation contributing anionic charge for ion-exchange chromatography and Jacalin lectin binding to the core Gal(α1–3)GalNAc- of the O-linked oligosaccharides. During the second DEAE ion-exchange step the opticin eluted from the column between 0.25 and 0.7 m NaCl, and fractions eluting between 0.35 and 0.7 m NaCl were deemed pure. The recovery of purified recombinant opticin was between 0.5 and 0.75 μg/ml of conditioned culture medium. Analysis of the tissue-extracted and recombinant opticin by SDS-PAGE and silver staining in both cases revealed a rather broad band of reactivity in the 45- to 52-kDa region, with the extracted protein(s) migrating somewhat faster than the recombinant protein(s) (Fig. 3). The OPT-C antiserum appeared to detect the same components as the silver stain. However, the OPT-N antiserum appeared to detect only the slower migrating protein in both the extracted and recombinant preparations. Because the OPT-N antiserum recognizes the amino-terminal region of the mature protein, we surmise that the faster migrating components in the 45- to 52-kDa regions are proteolytically cleaved forms lacking the amino-terminal region. In addition, a minor ∼25-kDa component was observed in both the tissue-extracted and recombinant opticin that was recognized by OPT-C, but not OPT-N, suggesting that it represents the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule. Peptide mass mapping demonstrated that this ∼25-kDa component contains the opticin LRR domain (data not shown), but the sequence of the amino-terminal end of this component could not be identified. Mass mapping of peptides produced by trypsin, with and without reduction of disulphide bonds, confirmed that the two carboxyl-terminal cysteines form a disulfide bridge. A minor ∼90-kDa component was observed in the recombinant opticin that probably represents a small amount of opticin dimer that is resistant to cleavage during SDS-PAGE (including after analysis under reducing conditions; data not shown), possibly due to non-disulfide cross-link formation (see “Discussion”). Circular Dichroism and Melting Temperature Determination—The circular dichroism spectra for tissue-extracted and recombinant opticin were very similar (Fig. 4A). They both demonstrated three Cotton effects, including minima at 217 and 195 nm, and a weak maximum at 204 nm. Three deconvolution programs, including CONTIN/LL, SELCON3, and CDSSTR, were used to estimate secondary structure. All three methods gave generally similar results, but CDSSTR gave the best fit to the data. The data for extracted and recombinant opticin were virtually identical, and average values for secondary structure composition from CDSSTR analysis were 41% β-sheet, 21% β-turn, and 10% α-helix. The melting temperature of both extracted and recombinant opticin were determined by monitoring ellipticity at 205 nm (Fig. 4B). The thermal denaturation curves were similar, and both showed a single, cooperative, transition with a mid-point (T m) of about 47 °C. Interestingly, there appeared to be a slight decrease in ellipticity at 38–40 °C when compared with 35 °C, suggesting that subtle changes in secondary structure occur around physiological temperatures. MALLS of Recombinant Opticin—Recombinant opticin (between 0.5 and 1 mg) was subjected to Superose 12 size exclusion chromatography in TBS and the column effluent passed in-line through a differential refractometer and multi-angle laser light scattering detector. A single major refractive index peak was observed eluting at ∼11 ml, and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that this peak contained the opticin (data not shown). However, a large light scattering signal was associated with a small amount of material in the void volume of the column that spilled over into the opticin-derived light scattering peak and interfered with the M̄ W estimations. Therefore, a 1-ml fraction that straddled the opticin-derived refractive index peak (at ∼11 ml) was collected and rechromatographed on the Superose 12 column (Fig. 5A). This step minimized the spillover of light scattering from the void volume and allowing a more accurate M̄ W estimation. A refractive index peak was observed at 10.4 ml, and the M̄ W of the material that eluted between 10 and 12 ml (i.e. the opticin) was calculated using the ASTRA™ software. This experiment was repeated four times (using two different preparations of recombinant opticin), and the opticin concentration within the analyzed peaks (calculated from the refractive index) was between 0.2 and 1 μm. The average M̄ W obtained for four different experiments was found to be 88.4 ± 3.7 kDa (Table I). Because the monomer molecular mass is ∼45 kDa (from SDS-PAGE or analysis of compositional analysis), opticin appears to behave as a dimer under these conditions. Only a single refractive index peak (at 10.4 ml) was observed, so there was no evidence of dissociation of the 88.4-kDa material into monomer-sized material at this concentration.Table ISummary of M̄w and shape data for opticinPhysical propertyValue ± S.D.Weight-averaged molecular mass from MALLS, M̄ w (kDa)88.4 ± 3.7Weight-averaged molecular mass from sedimentation equilibrium, M̄ w (kDa)90.6 ± 7.8Sedimentation coefficient, s 20,w (s)3.41 ± 0.05Partial specific volume, v̄ (ml/g)0.721Translational frictional ratio, f/f 02.05 ± 0.03Hydrodynamic radius from gel filtration, R H (nm)6.9 ± 0.13Hydrodynamic radius from sedimentation velocity, R H (nm)6.0 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab Experiments were then undertaken to determine the M̄ W of opticin in chaotrophic concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. The initial opticin-containing peak after the first round of Superose 12 chromatography was dialyzed into Tris-GdnHCl and reanalyzed on the same column equilibrated in Tris-GdnHCl (Fig. 5B). This time a single peak was observed at 11.75 ml (Fig. 5B). The M̄ W was calculated of the material between 11.3 and 12.2 ml and found to be 43 kDa, i.e. similar to that of an opticin monomer. In a further experiment, the opticin-containing peak following the first round of chromatography was digested with O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase prior to re-analysis on the Superose 12 column in TBS. This enzyme cleaves peptide bonds near Ser or Thr residues that are substituted with sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides (22Jiang P. Mellors A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A peak was observed at 12.9 ml, and the M̄ W of the material that eluted between 12.3 and 13.7 ml was calculated to be 63 kDa, i.e. larger than that of the opticin monomer (Fig. 5C). This material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE along with intact opticin for comparison, and the resultant polyacrylamide gel was either silver stained or Western blotted and probed with OPT-A, OPT-C, and Jacalin lectin (Fig. 5D). Following SDS-PAGE the pooled fractions between 12 and 14 ml migrated to ∼32 kDa, and peptide mass mapping of the silver-stained band (data not shown) demonstrated that this component contained the LRR domain of opticin. Both the full-length and the enzyme-digested fragment of opticin were recognized by OPT-C and the Jacalin lectin. However, only the undigested opticin was recognized by OPT-A. Taken together these results confirmed that the O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase digestion had cleaved opticin within the O-glycosylated domain thus removing the amino-terminal part of the protein. The rest of the molecule, which was composed mainly of LRRs, remained dimerized. Analytical Ultracentrifugation and Gel Filtration Chromatography—The recombinant opticin was again subjected to an initial Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography step, and the material that eluted from the column between 10 and 12 ml (i.e. the opticin) was analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium. This experiment was undertaken three times using opticin at a concentration of ∼50 μg/ml (i.e. ∼1 μm for the monomer). Analysis of the sedimentation equilibrium data from the three experiments gave an M̄ W for opticin of 90.6 ± 7.8 kDa, which compares well with the value obtained from light scattering and is double that of the opticin monomer (Table I). The gross conformation of the opticin dimer was estimated from the sedimentation coefficient by calculating the corresponding frictional ratio f/f 0. The frictional ratio is the relationship between the translational frictional coefficient and the corresponding coefficient of an anhydrous sphere of the same molecular weight and is give by Equation 1, ff0=M(1-υ¯ρ)NA(6πηs20,w)4πNA3υ¯M(Eq. 1) where N A is Avogadro's number and ρ an"

In mammals, there are three E protein family genes, E2A (encoding three alternatively spliced variants, E12, E47, and E2-5), E2-2 (ITF2), and HEB (14Massari M. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). The E proteins bind to a consensus “E-box” recognition sequence, present in the transcriptional control regions of numerous cellular genes, either as a homodimer or, more commonly, as a heterodimeric partner with a member of the much larger family of tissue-specific, Class B bHLH proteins. Id proteins lack a basic, DNA-binding domain, and they heterodimerize avidly (via their HLH domain) with bHLH E proteins (13Benezra R. Davis R. Lockshon D. Turner D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar) to prevent the latter from binding to DNA (1Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Massari M. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Since E proteins are obligate heterodimerization partners for tissue-specific bHLH proteins, this provides a common mechanism of negative regulation of transcription underlying cell fate decisions in multiple lineages (2Benezra R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8288-8289Crossref Google Scholar). Id proteins readily associate with and inhibit the DNA binding function of bHLH proteins in vitro and will inhibit their E-box-dependent gene regulatory and biological functions in vivo (1Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Benezra R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8288-8289Crossref Google Scholar). However, essentially nothing is known about how the opposing functions of Id proteins and their heterodimerization target bHLH E proteins are integrated at the level of the subcellular architecture. In particular, it is unclear precisely how, in a physiological context, Id proteins are able to overcome the large DNA-binding free energy of bHLH-bHLH homo-/heterodimers in order to sequester them as Id-bHLH heterodimers. To address these issues, we have used fluorescence microscopy techniques (fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP), fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)) (15Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) with constructs expressing proteins tagged with either enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) or enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) to study “real time” diffusion dynamics and heterodimeric interactions of Id and bHLH protein in single living cells. Our results show that bHLH protein is localized within distinct chromatin-associated foci, where it exists in dynamic equilibrium between the DNA-bound and non-DNA-bound state. Id proteins disrupt this chromatin compartmentalization of bHLH proteins. This suggests that Id proteins act by sequestering pools of transiently diffusing nucleoplasmic bHLH protein and preventing reassociation with chromatin domains. This would provide a mechanism through which Id proteins could overcome the large DNA-binding free energy of bHLH proteins without stabilization of Id-bHLH heterodimers by higher order oligomeric structure and thereby function as potent transcription factor antagonists. DNA Constructs—cDNA constructs encoding full-length Id3 and E47 proteins (inserted in the vector, pcDNA3; Invitrogen) have been described previously (16Wilson J.W. Deed R.W. Inoue T. Balzi M. Becciolini A. Faraoni P. Potten C.S. Norton J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8803-8810PubMed Google Scholar, 17Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding fusions of Id3 and E47 with the enhanced green fluorescence protein variants, EYFP and ECFP, were generated by joining the coding regions at the N and C termini of the fluorescent protein moiety, in frame, onto the C- or N-terminal coding region of the Id3 or E47 genes. A mutant version of E47 that is defective in DNA binding (E47-EYFP-bm) was generated by mutating six amino acid residues in the basic, DNA-binding domain of full-length E47 as described previously (16Wilson J.W. Deed R.W. Inoue T. Balzi M. Becciolini A. Faraoni P. Potten C.S. Norton J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8803-8810PubMed Google Scholar). The ΔN-E47 construct was generating by deleting the coding sequence from residue 1 to 475, leaving the DNA-binding and HLH regions intact. To construct the E-box-Luc reporter plasmid (pT81-4xE), synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides containing four tandem repeats of the E-box sequence (upper strand, 5′-CAACACCTGCTGCCTCCCAACACCTGCTGCCTCCCAACACCTGCTGCCTCCCAACACCTGCC-3′) were ligated to the BamHI/XhoI sites upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter of the pT81 plasmid (12Roberts C.E. Deed R.W. Inoue T. Norton J.D. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DNA construction and PCR mutagenesis was performed by standard recombinant DNA procedures. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—Human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum either on glass cover slips, in plastic flasks, or in 12-well plates. DNA-mediated transfection was performed by the standard calcium phosphate method as described previously (16Wilson J.W. Deed R.W. Inoue T. Balzi M. Becciolini A. Faraoni P. Potten C.S. Norton J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8803-8810PubMed Google Scholar). For reporter gene assays, cells were transfected in 12-well plates with a total of 6.0 μg of DNA. DNA inputs were normalized with the addition of empty vector, pcDNA3. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and preparation of extracts and the luciferase assay were performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For normalization of transfection efficiencies, Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-TK; Promega) was included in the transfections. In some experiments, cells were lysed in situ on glass cover slips (18Mancini M.G. Liu B. Sharp Z.D. Mancini M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 322-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, Roche Applied Science complete protease inhibitor mixture, pH 6.8). For immunofluorescence detection of E47, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained using anti-E47 antibody (sc 349; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by detection with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (F0205; DAKO) (17Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was then performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 attached to an Olympus IX70 microscope fitted with a PlanApo ×60 oil immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4). EYFP was excited with the 514-nm argon line, and emission was detected via a 545/20 filter. ECFP was excited with the 457-nm argon line, and emission was detected via a 488/10 filter. Images were acquired sequentially to prevent bleed-through of the two probes. EYFP-tagged proteins were used for FRAP measurements. A single image z section was taken before a short bleach pulse (typically 0.5-1 s) in a region of interest (ROI), and then typically 60 images were acquired at either 1- or 2-s time intervals. Bleaching was performed using the 514-nm laser line, set at 100% laser power, and subsequent images were collected using no more than 4% laser power. Nontransfected cells and fixed transfected cells were used for control experiments. Pixels in the ROI were analyzed to determine mean and S.E. of the fluorescence signal at each time point; these data were then fitted by a single exponential to obtain the time constant (τ). Data was analyzed using in-house software. Routinely, data from 20-30 cells were collected for each experiment. FRAP was also performed by conventional fluorescence microscopy using a Physitemp model TS-4 microscope, as described previously but with the mechanical beam splitter replaced by an electro-optic modulator (19Ladha S.

The 514-nm argon laser line was used to excite EYFP, and emission was detected via a 550LP dichroic filter. FRAP measurements were recorded and analyzed as previously described (19Ladha S. Mackie A.R. Harvey L.J. Clark D.C. Lea E.J.A. Brullemans M. Duclohier H. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1364-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and fast diffusion data were also fitted by a single exponential in the same way as for confocal FRAP data. FRET was measured by a variant of the confocal FRAP method (20Day R.N. Periasamy A. Schaufele F. Methods. 2001; 25: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Cells expressing Id3-EYFP and E47-ECFP were initially imaged sequentially by 457- and 514-nm excitation, and YFP fluorescence in a ROI was then bleached by several scans at maximum 514-nm laser power. The ECFP fluorescence postbleach image was then obtained. Pixels in areas showing ECFP enhancement were analyzed to obtain the mean signals pre- and postbleach (excluding areas of high and low signal from “hot spots” and nucleoli). The value postbleach/prebleach of these signals provides the FRET ratio. Control areas in the same images quantify the reduction of the ECFP signal caused by the 457-nm laser. Electrophoretic Mobility Band Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using lysates from transfected cells essentially as described previously (22Inoue T. Kamiyama J. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32309-32317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of cell lysate was mixed with labeled probe (∼0.5 ng; 10,000 cpm) in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). After a 20-min incubation, competitor lysate (2 μg) was added and the binding reaction terminated at time intervals by loading of the mix onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with immediate electrophoresis. The μE5 E-box double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (GGCCAGAACACCTGCAGACG-3′) (23Jacobs Y. Xin X.Q. Dorshkind K. Nelson C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 4087-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was end-labeled using the MEGALABEL DNA 5′-end labeling kit (Takara, Tokyo). Quantitation of band intensities was performed using a BAS2000 image analysis system (Fuji Film). Fluorescence-tagged E47 and Id3 Proteins Retain Their Gene-regulatory Functions—The bHLH E protein, E47, and its potent Id antagonist, Id3, have been widely studied at a molecular and cellular level as a model for Id-bHLH interactions (1Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Id3 will also inhibit gene regulatory programs and biological responses of E proteins functioning in heterodimeric mode with Class B bHLH proteins, exemplified by MyoD (24Atherton G. Travers H. Deed R. Norton J.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A depicts the structures of fluorescent proteins generated by fusing the coding regions of the EYFP and ECFP genes onto the N- and C-terminal residue of E47 and onto the C-terminal residue of Id3. Since the size of the fluorescent protein (FP) tags was large, compared with the size of native proteins, particularly for Id3 (119 amino acid residues for Id3 versus 240 residues for EYFP/ECFP; see Fig. 1A), we tested fusion constructs for functional activity. In in vitro band shift assays, both N- and C-terminal fusions of native E47 bound to an E-box probe, whereas, as expected (16Wilson J.W. Deed R.W. Inoue T. Balzi M. Becciolini A. Faraoni P. Potten C.S. Norton J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8803-8810PubMed Google Scholar), the E47 mutants in which the basic DNA-binding domain was disrupted (FP-E47bm and E47bm-FP in Fig. 1) did not. Fluorescently tagged Id3 also inhibited E-box probe binding of both wild type and FP fusions of E47, with efficiency comparable with that of wild type Id3 (data not shown). In transfected cells, expression of fluorescently tagged Id3 elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of E47-mediated transactivation of an E-box reporter gene construct (Fig. 1B). As shown for E47-EYFP in Fig. 1C, FP-tagged E47 was only slightly impaired in its ability to transactivate the E-box reporter (Fig. 1, compare B and C), and this activity could be competed using either wild type or FP-Id3 with comparable efficiency (Fig. 1C). In the following experiments, we used fusions of E47 in which the FP tag was located at the C terminus of the protein. Subnuclear Localization of E47—By virtue of the nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS in Fig. 1A), bHLH proteins, exemplified by E47, are localized to the cell nucleus. E47 is known to be associated with a variety of transcriptional coactivators within macromolecular complexes in chromatin (see Ref. 25Bradney C. Hjelmeland M. Komatsu Y. Yoshida M. Yao T-P. Zhuang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2370-2376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and references therein). We initially examined the subnuclear distribution of endogenous E47 protein by immunofluorescence staining in fixed cells using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2 (middle panel), endogenous E47 was found to be localized to numerous discrete foci, superimposed on a diffuse background throughout the nucleoplasm, but largely excluded from the nucleolar regions. This nuclear “speckled” distribution pattern is characteristic of that described for several other transcription factors (18Mancini M.G. Liu B. Sharp Z.D. Mancini M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 322-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Grande M.A. van der Kraan I. de Jong L. van Driel R. J.

An identical subnuclear distribution was seen in live cells expressing E47 protein, tagged with a fluorescent EYFP (E47-EYFP) or ECFP (E47-ECFP) moiety either as a homodimer (Fig. 2, third panel) or as a heterodimer with co-expressed Class B bHLH protein, MyoD (data not shown). Nuclear E47-ECFP did not co-localize with EGFP-tagged splicing factor, ASF/SF2 (30Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) or with chromatin-associated BRG1 (31Khavari P.A. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), but, as with other transcription factors (26Grande M.A. van der Kraan I. de Jong L. van Driel R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it displayed a minor co-localization (2-5%) with nascent transcriptional complexes, as detected by immunostaining of incorporated bromouridine triphosphate (data not shown). Rapid Exchange between Nuclear Pools of E47—To investigate whether nuclear pools of E47 localized in discrete subnuclear foci were exchangeable, the diffusion dynamics of E47-EYFP was studied in live cells using FRAP and FLIP techniques. In these and subsequent fluorescence dynamics experiments, transfected cells expressing a range of fluorescence intensities from dim (nearly physiological) to bright were analyzed. In all cases, the diffusion dynamics were not affected by expression level of exogenous protein. Fig. 3A shows the results of a typical FRAP experiment. Following photobleaching of a small ROI in the nucleus, there was a rapid fluorescence recovery (t = 10 ± 4 s) commensurate with the kinetics of fluorescence loss (t = 9 ± 3 s) from unbleached areas (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the localization of the E47-associated subnuclear structures themselves remained unchanged and exhibited only small displacements when observed over several minutes (Fig. 3A). Control cells within the same image frame showed no changes in fluorescence during the experiment (data not shown), demonstrating that the decrease was not due to bleaching during image acquisition. Repetitive bleaching of the ROI resulted in a complete loss of fluorescence (Fig. 3A , last panel), indicating the absence of any significant immobile fraction of E47-EYFP. Thus, FRAP and FLIP analysis show that essentially all of the nuclear pool of bHLH protein is freely exchangeable and in constant flux over a time scale of tens of seconds. This implies the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between the DNA-bound and -unbound nuclear pools of E47 protein. Since assembly of a functional bHLH homo-/heterodimer complex with DNA requires a functional DNA-binding domain, we also examined the subnuclear distribution and diffusion dynamics of the E47-EYFP-bm mutant (Fig. 1A) in which the DNA-binding domain is rendered nonfunctional. As shown by the example in Fig. 3C, the E47-EYFP-bm mutant displayed a distinctive pattern of subnuclear compartmentalization composed of much larger spherical structures than seen with wild type protein. Moreover, FRAP analysis showed that, in contrast to wild type protein, the DNA-binding mutant was completely immobile over a period of at least 5 min (Fig. 3C). Thus, although DNA binding function is not an absolute requirement for association with chromatin, it is required for correct subnuclear compartmentalization of the bHLH protein. Dynamic Equilibrium between DNA-bound and Free bHLH Protein Demonstrable in Vitro—Since the above diffusion dynamics data in intact live cells implied the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between the DNA-bound and -unbound nuclear pools of E47 protein, we sought to determine whether this was an inherent characteristic of the interaction between bHLH E protein and its cognate E-box-containing DNA that could be recapitulated in a cell-free system. As shown in Fig. 4, we employed a “competition” band shift assay under conditions of limited μE5 E-box probe input between two bHLH E proteins (wild type E47 and ΔN-E47), whose complexes with E-box DNA probe could be distinguished by electrophoretic mobility. The truncated, ΔN-E47 lacks most of the N-terminal region but still retains a DNA-binding domain. The addition of ΔN-E47 to preformed wild type E47-DNA complex led to the gradual appearance of ΔN-E47 complex with a corresponding loss of wild type E47-DNA complex (Fig. 4A). The time constant for the rate-limiting dissociation (off rate) of wild type E47-DNA complex in this experiment was (t = 40 s). Wild type E47 was similarly able to exchange with preformed ΔN-E47-DNA complex, with comparable kinetics (Fig. 4B). Thus, in an in vitro cell-free system, in the absence of any nuclear compartmentalization, a dynamic equilibrium between DNA-bound and free bHLH protein is clearly demonstrable. Id Protein Disrupts the Subnuclear Architecture of bHLH Protein and Dramatically Affects Its Nuclear Dynamics Properties—Previous immunofluorescence studies using fixed cells have shown that Id proteins, in contrast to bHLH proteins such as E47 that are localized to the nucleus, are distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm; co-expression of these proteins leads to nuclear sequestration of Id protein, presumably as an Id-bHLH heterodimer (17Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These findings were confirmed in live cells in which fluorescence-tagged E47 (E47-EYFP) and Id (Id3-ECFP) proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 5A). Significantly, in the presence of co-expressed Id protein, the subnuclear structural compartmentalization of E47 was completely abolished; the E47 acquired a diffuse distribution pattern throughout the nucleus, indistinguishable from that of nuclear Id protein alone (Fig. 5A). Co-expression of wild type Id3 protein also disrupted the subnuclear compartmentalization of E47-EYFP, whereas a mutant of Id3 that does not interact with bHLH protein because of a proline insertion in the H1 region of the HLH domain (17Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) had no effect (data not shown). We used FRET analysis to show that this disruption of nuclear compartmentalization of E47 in live cells was associated with direct physical interaction between the fluorescence-tagged E47 and Id protein (Fig. 5, B and C). As with other nuclear proteins that are physically associated with chromatin/nuclear matrix structures (18Mancini M.G. Liu B. Sharp Z.D. Mancini M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 322-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), E47 (E47-EYFP) was retained in cells for several minutes following disruption with mild nonionic detergent, Triton X-100 (Fig. 6A , top panel). The addition of DNase I led to a rapid loss (within 2 min) of E47-EYFP protein from cells, consistent with a chromatin association of E47. However, in contrast to E47-EYFP alone, E47-EYFP/Id3-ECFP heterodimer was rapidly lost following detergent lysis, with kinetics indistinguishable from Id3-EYFP (or Id3-ECFP; data not shown) (see Fig. 6A). Confocal FRAP measurements revealed that the recovery time of E47-EYFP as a heterodimer with Id3-ECFP occurred too rapidly for accurate measurement. By using conventional FRAP, we determined that the recovery of the heterodimer is 100-fold faster than E47-EYFP protein alone (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained in experiments using the E47-EYFP-bm mutant (data not shown). The t for Id3-EYFP was 0.10 ± 0.04 s, and t for Id3-ECFP in the presence of E47-EYFP was 0.13 ± 0.04 s. A similar value was obtained for E47-EYFP in the presence of Id3-ECFP (t = 0.14 ± 0.03 s). The theoretical ratio of t values for an Id3-ECFP/E47-EYFP heterodimer to an Id3-ECFP monomer is calculated to be 1.50, assuming free diffusion and spherical structures. The difference in diffusion between Id3-EYFP and Id3-EYFP/E47-ECFP (Fig. 6B) is therefore consistent with the formation of a heterodimer, with no evidence for the existence of a significant contribution from more slowly diffusing species that would correspond to higher order oligomers. Accumulating data highlight the importance of the dynamic behavior of individual components of the transcriptional apparatus within a highly organized subnuclear architecture in the regulation of transcription (30Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 32Misteli T. Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 33Carmo-Fonseca M.

For example, the glucocorticoid receptor (27McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 35Becker M. Baumann C.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reportedly undergo ligand-dependent intranuclear redistribution into discrete foci representing transcriptional complexes. The pools of nuclear receptor in these foci undergo rapid (within seconds) exchange with a more highly mobile fraction in the nucleoplasm. In the present study, we found that the nuclear pools of the prototype bHLH E protein, E47, display a comparable pattern of spatiotemporal dynamics, with no significant immobile fraction. As the third largest family of transcription factors in eukaryotes (40Tupler R. Perini G. Green M.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), with over 200 distinct members (14Massari M. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), bHLH proteins display considerable molecular “promiscuity” in their heterodimeric interactions, and this affords a high level of combinatorial diversity for fine tuning of gene expression programs in cell fate determination and differentiation (14Massari M. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). The rapid exchange of E47 between chromatin domains is therefore particularly noteworthy, since this would facilitate a commensurately rapid change in bHLH dimer composition on multiple gene regulatory sequences in a coordinated fashion. Indeed, consistent with in vitro DNA-binding kinetic studies (41Spinner D.S. Liu S.H. Wang S.W. Schmidt J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we observed a dynamic equilibrium between distinct bHLH E proteins and the formation of protein-E-box DNA complexes in a cell-free system. However, because of macromolecular crowding effects (42Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar) within the confines of the chromatin architecture, the kinetics of bHLH protein-E-box DNA interaction in living cells is likely to be quite different from that observed in vitro. Under conditions in which heterodimeric interaction between Id and bHLH protein was directly demonstrable in live cells by FRET analysis, our studies showed that the subnuclear architecture and diffusion dynamics of bHLH protein were dramatically altered by association with Id protein. When co-expressed with antagonist Id protein, the chromatin-associated sublocalization of bHLH protein was abolished, and there was an accompanying 100-fold increase in its nuclear mobility demonstrable by FRAP as the bHLH protein acquired the diffuse nuclear distribution pattern of Id protein. bHLH-bHLH dimer interactions are strongly stabilized as a ternary complex by DNA binding (43Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 44Wendt H. Thomas R.M. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5735-5743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Maleki S.J. Royer C.A. Hurlburt B.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10888-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In order to efficiently sequester bHLH proteins as Id-bHLH heterodimers, Id proteins must be able to overcome the large DNA-binding free energy of bHLH proteins. Based on kinetic reassociation studies employing synthetic peptides in vitro (which show that Id-bHLH complexes are stabilized by adopting a higher order oligomeric state), it has been proposed that Id-bHLH heterodimer formation is favored through adoption of higher order structures (46Fairman R. Beran-Steed R.K. Anthony-Cahill S.J. Lear J.D. Stafford W.F. DeGrado W.F Benfield P.A. Brenner S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10429-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is therefore significant that we did not observe any evidence for a higher order oligomeric state of Id-bHLH heterodimers in live cells that would explain the ability of Id proteins to overcome the large DNA-binding free energy of bHLH proteins, as observed in vitro. Because Id proteins lack a basic, DNA-binding domain, they are widely accepted to function as dominant negative antagonists of bHLH proteins through a mechanism involving inhibition of DNA-binding activity (through the formation of Id-bHLH heterodimers) (1Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Benezra R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8288-8289Crossref Google Scholar, 13Benezra R. Davis R. Lockshon D. Turner D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 14Massari M. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). However, our studies of Id/bHLH proteins in live cells show that inhibition of DNA binding per se does not fully account for the functional attributes of Id proteins. In common with wild type E47, a DNA binding-defective E47 mutant (that still localized to chromatin, albeit as an immobile pool in larger subnuclear structures) could also be rendered freely diffusible by co-expression with Id protein. The observation that Id protein disrupts the chromatin-associated, subnuclear compartmentalization of bHLH proteins represents a novel facet of Id protein function that might also explain the ability of these proteins to overcome the high DNA-binding free energy of bHLH proteins without invoking stabilization of Id-bHLH heterodimers by higher order structure. By sequestering transiently diffusing nucleoplasmic bHLH protein into Id-bHLH heterodimers that are evidently excluded from chromatin structures, Id proteins would be able to prevent DNA binding and thereby accomplish a rapid (within seconds) inhibition of bHLH transcription factor activity. It would be of particular interest in future studies to investigate the kinetics of this process, directly in vivo and/or by using a reconstituted in vitro system. Id proteins represent the prototype of transcriptional modulators that function by dominant negative inhibition of DNA binding. Other examples include some members of the bHLH (47Narumi O. Mori S.

The way in which the function of Id proteins is integrated at the level of the subnuclear architecture as shown in the present study may also be relevant to these other transcription factor antagonists, in providing a general mechanism through which they can overcome the high DNA-binding free energy of their target proteins.

Here, further, we show that phospholipase (PLC)-γ1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 783 and condenses at the HBMEC membrane beneath the E. coli entry site. Overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) form of PLC-γ, the PLC-z fragment, in HBMEC inhibits PLC-γ1 activation and significantly blocks E. coli invasion. PI3K activation is not affected in PLC-z/HBMEC upon infection, whereas PKC-α phosphorylation is completely abolished, indicating that PLC-γ1 is downstream of PI3K. Concomitantly, the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 is blocked in HBMEC overexpressing a dominant negative form of the p85 subunit of PI3K but not in HBMEC overexpressing a dominant negative form of PKC-α. In addition, the recruitment of PLC-γ1 to the cell membrane in both PLC-z/HBMEC and DN-p85/HBMEC is inhibited. Activation of PI3K is associated with the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which in turn recruits PLC-γ1 to the cell membrane via its interaction with pleckstrin homology domain of PLC-γ1. Utilizing the pleckstrin homology domains of PKC-δ and Btk proteins fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), which specifically interact with PIP2 and PIP3, respectively, we show herein that E. coli invasion induces the breakdown of PIP2 at the plasma membrane near the site of E. coli interaction.

This elevation in Ca2+ levels is completely blocked both in PLC-z/HBMEC and DN-p85/HBMEC, but not in DN-PKC/HBMEC.

Hansen N. Fanaroff A.A. Wright L.L. Carlo W.A. Ehrenkranz R.A. Lemons J.A. Donovan E.F. Stark A.R. Tyson J.E. Oh W. Bauer C.R. Korones S.B. Shankaran S. Laptook A.R. Stevenson D.K. Papile L.-A. Poole W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). One of the most important events in E. coli meningitis is the invasion and transcytosis of the human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) 1The abbreviations used are: HBMEC, human brain microvascular endothelial cell; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C; DN, dominant negative; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3, inositol triphosphate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAG, diacylglycerol; cfu, colony-forming unit(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; SH, Src homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; TBST, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20; NA, numeric aperture. by the bacteria to disseminate into the central nervous system. Adherence of E. coli to the surface of endothelial cells via S-fimbriae is followed by the interaction of OmpA (an outer membrane protein of E. coli K1) with its receptor, a gp96-like protein, which initiates the invasion process (2Stins M.F.

This interaction induces the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and the actin-associated protein, paxillin, which are necessary for cytoskeletal rearrangements in HBMEC (6Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase activation requires the physical association of PI3K; thus, overexpression of a dominant negative form of PI3K (either p85 or p110) significantly blocks E. coli invasion of HBMEC (7Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36769-36774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, invasive E. coli induces the phosphorylation and activation of PKC-α, which is recruited to the membrane where it interacts with an actin regulatory molecule, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (8Sukumaran S.K. Prasadarao N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12253-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Sukumaran S.K. Quon M.J. Prasadarao N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50716-50724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Activated PKC-α has been reported to bind to and activate caveolin-1, an integral component of caveolae, which facilitates the transcytosis of bacteria in endothelial cells. The activation of PKC-α is regulated by the mobilization of intracellular calcium by IP3 (inositol triphosphate), a breakdown product of membrane-bound lipid PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) (10Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The major enzyme that regulates these events is phospholipase C (PLC). Several forms of PLC with different molecular masses, substrate specificity, and Ca2+ requirements have been purified from various mammalian cells (10Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 11Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Four different families of PLC (β, γ, δ, and ϵ) are present in cells, and all of them possess two conserved X and Y regions, responsible for substrate recognition and catalytic activity, respectively. In addition, γ-type molecules contain a unique structure (Z region) containing two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain (12Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of cells with various growth factors, the SH2 domains of PLC-γ bind the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues of growth factor receptor, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ (10Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 11Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 12Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except PLC-ϵ, the other three PLC isoforms also contain PH domains. There is now good evidence that PH domains of signaling molecules are involved in targeting to cell membranes (13Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

The most convincing examples of highly specific, physiologically relevant PH domain targets are observed with PLC-δ PH domain binding to PIP2 as well as IP3 and binding of PH domain of Ser/Thr kinase Akt/PKB/Rac to PI(3,4)P2. The PLC-γ PH domain binds to PIP3, the production of which is regulated by PI3K (10Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 11Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 14Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). PI3K converts PI(4,5)P2 into PI(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane, which has affinity for PLC-γ and thus anchors it. PIP3 also binds to the c-SH2 of PLC-γ. This process is crucial for the positioning of the enzyme in close proximity to its substrate PI(4,5)P2 (16Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kazlauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23750-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). There are two types of PLC-γ: PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2. It has been demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Tyr-783 of PLC-γ1 is crucial for stimulation of enzymatic activity, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr-753, Tyr-759, and Tyr-1217 is important for PLC-γ2 activity (17Kim H.K.

Because the E. coli invasion of HBMEC is governed by the activation of both PI3K and PKC-α, we hypothesized that PLC-γ would play a role in the invasion process. Here we show that PLC-γ1 is activated during E. coli invasion of HBMEC, which is recruited to the membrane beneath the bacterial entry site. Expression of outer membrane protein A (OmpA) on E. coli is necessary for the activation of PLC-γ1. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of PLC-γ in HBMEC significantly abolishes the accumulation of phosphorylated PLC-γ1 beneath the bacteria and subsequent invasion. Our studies also suggest that PLC-γ1 activation is downstream of PI3K but upstream of PKC-α. Furthermore, we show that E. coli invasion of HBMEC mobilizes intracellular calcium as well as calcium influx from extracellular medium in a PLC-γ1-dependent manner. Bacteria—E. coli E44 is a rifampin-resistant mutant of E. coli K1 strain RS 218 (serotype O18:K1:H7), which was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a neonate with meningitis and invades HBMEC in vitro (3Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Weiser J.N. Stins M.F. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 146-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E91 is a non-invasive derivative of E44 in which the ompA gene has been disrupted, resulting in lack of OmpA expression. Bacteria were grown in brain heart infusion broth (Difco Labs) with appropriate antibiotics. Materials—Tissue culture dishes containing a glass coverslip in the middle were obtained from Mattek Corp. (Ashland, MA). Antibodies to PLC-γ, phospho-PLC-γ1 (Tyr-783), and phospho-PLC-γ2 (Tyr-1217) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Fura 2/AM and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies and rhodamine phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody was obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). Normal goat serum and the Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were obtained from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA). The PepTag nonradioactive PKC assay was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent was obtained from Pierce. The mammalian expression vectors for pXf-PLC-z and pXf-control have been described previously, which provide methotrexate resistance to transfected cells (19Kassis J. Moellinger J. Lo H. Greenberg N.M. Kim H.G. Wells A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2251-2260PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors containing PHPLC-δ-GFP and PHBtk-GFP were kindly provided by Dr. Tamas Ballas (15Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Dominant negative (DN) constructs of p85 and PKC-α have been described previously (7Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A.

HBMEC Culture Maintenance and Transfections—HBMEC were isolated and cultured as described previously (20Stins M.F. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5522-5525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HBMEC cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% Nu-serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), essential amino acids, and vitamins. HBMEC were transfected with mammalian expression vectors using LipofectAMINE-plus. Briefly, DNA-LipofectAMINE-plus in RPMI 1640 was added to 50% confluent HBMEC monolayers. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with RPMI 1640, and complete medium was added. After 48 h, the complete medium was replaced with medium containing either G418 (400 μg/ml) or methotrexate (1200 nm/ml) and maintained at least for 4 weeks before performing the invasion experiments. E. coli Invasion Assays—Confluent HBMEC in 24-well plates were incubated with 1 × 107 E. coli in experimental medium (1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 and M-199 containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) for 90 min at 37 °C. The monolayers were washed three times with RPMI 1640 and incubated in experimental medium containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml) for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. The monolayers were washed again and lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100. The intracellular bacteria were enumerated by plating on sheep blood agar plates. In parallel experiments, total cell associated bacteria was determined as described above except that the gentamicin step was omitted. In some experiments, HBMEC were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min prior to the addition of bacteria. The effects of these inhibitors on HBMEC viability were assessed using trypan blue exclusion method, and effects on bacterial viability were tested by quantitative culture (3Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Weiser J.N. Stins M.F. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 146-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of HBMEC Membranes—Confluent monolayers of HBMEC grown on collagen-coated dishes (60-mm diameter) were washed with RPMI 1640, and E. coli suspended in experimental medium was added. Following stimulation for different time periods (0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min), the cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and placed on ice. The cells in each 60-mm dish were harvested by scraping into 2 ml of ice-cold cell homogenization buffer (buffer A) consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were subjected to mild sonication, and a portion of this cell lysate was centrifuged at low speed (5,000 × g) to remove cell debris. The supernatant was the subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g) to pellet the membrane fraction, which was then solubilized in Tris buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Both the membrane fractions and the cell lysates were used for the PepTag assay and immunoprecipitation studies. PepTag Assay for Non-radioactive Detection of PKC Activity—The PepTag (Promega) assay utilizes a florescent peptide substrate that is highly specific to PKC according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Phosphorylation by PKC changes the net charge of the peptide substrate from +1 to -1, thereby allowing the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated versions of the substrate to be separated using agarose (0.8%) gel electrophoresis. The phosphorylated species migrates toward the positive electrode, whereas the non-phosphorylated substrate migrates toward the negative electrode. HBMEC total lysates or membrane proteins (10-25 μgin10 μl) were incubated with the PKC reaction mixture (25 μl) according to the protocol from the manufacturer at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by placing the tubes in a boiling water bath. After adding 80% glycerol (1 μl), the samples were loaded onto an agarose gel (0.8% agarose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and separated at 100 V for 15 min. The peptide bands were visualized under UV light. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—HBMEC in 60-mm dishes were exposed to bacteria for varying time periods in infection medium and the harvested by scraping on ice into 2 ml of cell homogenization buffer A. The cells were subjected to mild sonication, and the total cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein content was determined. For immunoprecipitation, 300-500 μg of protein was incubated with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated for 1 h with protein A-agarose. The immune complexes were washed four times with the cell lysate buffer, and the proteins bound to agarose were eluted in SDS sample buffer and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBST. The blot was washed with TBST and further incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the blot was washed four times with TBST for a total time of 1 h, developed with SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent, and exposed to x-ray film to visualize the proteins. The protein bands on the x-ray films were quantitated on a Bio-Rad densitometer using Alpha-imager software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Francisco, CA). Immunofluorescence Staining—HBMEC were grown in 8-well chamber slides coated with collagen and infected with E. coli as described above. The monolayers were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the monolayers were incubated with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and further incubated with the primary antibody in 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to the fluorochromes Cy3 or FITC for 30 min at room temperature. F-actin was detected by incubating the cells with rhodamine phalloidin for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed again, the chambers were removed, and the slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) anti-fade solution containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were viewed with a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) DMRA microscope with Plan-apochromat 40×/1.25 NA and 63×/1.40 NA oil immersion objective lenses. Image acquisition was with a SkyVision-2/VDS digital CCD (12-bit, 1280 × 1024 pixel) camera in unbinned or 2 × 2-binned models into EasyFISH software, saved as 16-bit monochrome, and merged as 24-bit RGB TIFF images (Applied Spectral Imaging Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Estimation of Intracellular Calcium Levels Using Fura-2/AM—HBMEC plated in a dish containing a glass coverslip at the center were washed with Ringer's solution (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgSO4,5mm KCl, 12 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose). Fura-2/AM and Pluronic (Molecular Probes) were added to the HBMEC monolayer in equal proportions at 37 °C for active uptake of Fura-2/AM by the cells (21Pallone T.L. Silldorff E.P. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F852-F860Google Scholar). The cells were then rinsed with Ringer's solution containing 1 mm calcium and maintained in the same medium. The cells were infected with 1 × 107 E. coli K1, and the change in the ratio of the intensities of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm was monitored over a period of 40 min. After 40 min, ionomycin (1 μm) was added and cells were monitored over a period of 1 h. Fura-2 experiments were performed on a Nikon Instruments (Melville, NY) Diaphot TMD 300 inverted microscope, using a Nikon Fluor 40×/1.3 NA Ph4DL oil immersion objective lens. A Hamamatsu Corp. (Bridgewater, NJ) ORCA-100 (C4742-95-12NR) 12-bit digital camera was operated in 4 × 4 binning mode, with typical exposure times of 100 ms/channel. The microscope was equipped with a Ludl Electronics Products Ltd. (Hawthorne, NY) Mac2000 XYZ stage and focus controller. The imaging rig was controlled by MetaMorph 4.5 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Inhibition of PLC-γ Blocks OmpA+ E. coli Invasion of HBMEC—Our previous studies demonstrated that PKC-α plays an important role in the cytoskeletal rearrangements observed during OmpA+ E. coli invasion of HBMEC (8Sukumaran S.K. Prasadarao N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12253-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the activation of PKC-α is regulated by PLC-γ via mobilization of calcium and production of DAG. In this context, we decided to test the role of PLC-γ in bacterial invasion of HBMEC using specific inhibitors of PLC (22Xie Z.Z. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20421-20424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). OmpA+ E. coli invasion of HBMEC was significantly blocked in a dose-dependent manner when the cells were pretreated with a cell permeable PLC inhibitory compound, U-73122. This result was in direct contrast to that obtained using a control inactive analogue compound, U-73343. At 2 μm, U-73122 blocked the invasion by more than 50% and a concentration of 4 μm caused >80% inhibition of invasion when compared with the invasion of U-73343-treated cells (10,535 + 1,200 cfu/well with U-73343 versus 2,100 + 650 cfu/well with U-73122, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The extent of binding of the bacteria to HBMEC treated with either inhibitor remained the same. The inhibitors were neither cytotoxic nor exerted any anti-bacterial effect. These results suggest that E. coli invasion into HBMEC requires the activity of PLC. E. coli Induces the Phosphorylation on Tyr-783 and Hence the Activation of PLC-γ1—Having demonstrated the importance of PLC in E. coli invasion of HBMEC, we proceeded to examine the activation of PLC-γ and which isoform of PLC-γ was involved. It is widely reported that phosphorylation at tyrosine 783 of PLC-γ1 and at tyrosines 753, 759, and 1217 of PLC-γ2 bring about their activation (11Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Thus, we used antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated form of tyrosine 783 of PLC-γ1 and tyrosine 1217 of PLC-γ2 for immunoblotting. HBMEC were infected with either OmpA+ or OmpA- E. coli for varying periods of time, and the total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PLC-γ antibody (recognizes both PLC-γ isoforms). The immune complexes were subjected to Western blotting with phospho-PLC-γ1 antibodies. An increase in phosphorylation on Tyr-783 of PLC-γ1, but not PLC-γ2, was observed in the cell lysates of HBMEC infected with OmpA+ E. coli. This change was observed at 5 min of infection with peak activation at 15 min, followed by a slight decline at 30 min after infection (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no phosphorylation at tyrosine 1217 of PLC-γ2 (only antibody available to phospho-PLC-γ2 is to tyrosine 1217) was detected under the same conditions. To ensure no other change in phosphorylation on PLC-γ2 had been missed, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLC-γ2 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). Despite the presence of significant amounts of PLC-γ2, no change in phosphorylation was observed after infecting with either the bacteria (Fig. 2B). In addition, no significant levels of phospho-PLC-γ1 were observed in OmpA- E. coli-treated HBMEC at any time point. These blots, when stripped and reprobed with anti-PLC-γ, indicated that equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane. Densitometric scanning of the bands in these blots (from Fig. 2A) showed that a 10-fold increase in phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 by 15 min after infection (Fig. 2C). The densities of the bands were linear up to 100,000 units according to the calibration curve obtained by scanning an immunoblot containing increasing concentrations of actin. These results suggest that E. coli interaction with HBMEC induces the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 at Tyr-783, thereby activating it. To further confirm that the inhibition of E. coli invasion into U-73122-treated HBMEC was the result of inhibition of PLC-γ1 activity, cell lysates of OmpA+ E. coli-infected HBMEC pretreated with either U-73122 or its inactive analog U-73343 were analyzed by Western blotting. The results demonstrate that the pattern of phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in the U-73343-treated cells is similar to that of the pattern observed in untreated control cells, but not in the U-73122-treated HBMEC (Fig. 2D). As mentioned, the activation of PLC-γ1 includes its recruitment to the cell membrane for PIP2 hydrolyzing activity. Therefore, membrane fractions of HBMEC infected with either OmpA+ or OmpA- E. coli were prepared and subjected to Western blot analyses with anti-PLC-γ and anti-phospho-PLC-γ1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2E, HBMEC membranes infected with OmpA+ E. coli exhibited significant amounts of PLC-γ with a concomitant increase in the levels of phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. In contrast, membrane proteins from HBMEC infected with OmpA- E. coli contained neither PLC-γ nor phospho-PLC-γ1. To further confirm the recruitment of phospho-PLC-γ1 to the HBMEC membrane, we analyzed the OmpA+ and OmpA- E. coli-infected HBMEC by immunocyto-chemistry using anti-phospho-PLC-γ1 antibody. In addition, the cells were stained for actin with rhodamine phalloidin to examine the spatial relationship of actin rearrangements with phospho-PLC-γ1. As shown in Fig. 3, control uninfected HBMEC showed actin stress fibers throughout the cell, whereas the staining of phospho-PLC-γ1 was punctate and very weak (panels A-D). After infection with OmpA+ E. coli, actin was rearranged to condense beneath few groups of bacteria (Fig. 3, E-H). The bacteria, which did not induce any condensation of actin, might be in the process of adherence. These results are in agreement with our previous studies, which showed that OmpA+ E. coli induces actin nucleation beneath the bacterial entry site. The same monolayers, when stained for phospho-PLC-γ1, showed intense staining beneath groups of bacteria in OmpA+ E. coli-infecte"
https://openalex.org/W1978512775,"The intracellular signaling pathway(s) through which second messenger ceramides induce gene expression in human cells has not yet been characterized. In the present study, ceramide-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which requires activation of transcription factor activator protein 2 (AP-2), was found to be mediated through a mitochondrial pathway. Inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain (e.g. rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, and antimycin A) reduced ceramide-induced ICAM-1 expression. Stimulation of human keratinocytes with cell-permeant ceramides at concentrations that did not induce apoptosis (no activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9 and no nucleosomal fragmentation) but caused AP-2 activation and ICAM-1 induction released cytochrome c (cyt c) from mitochondria into the cytoplasm of cells. This cyt c release was an indispensable prerequisite for effective ceramide signaling, because its inhibition by modulating the mitochondrial megachannel with bonkrekic acid or carboxyatractyloside prevented ceramide-induced AP-2 activation and ICAM-1 expression. Analysis of the interaction between cyt c and AP-2 revealed that cyt c oxidized AP-2 and that this redox regulation greatly enhanced the DNA binding capacity of AP-2. Mitochondria thus have a previously unrecognized function in signaling ceramide-induced transcription factor activation and gene regulation.

This cyt c release was an indispensable prerequisite for effective ceramide signaling, because its inhibition by modulating the mitochondrial megachannel with bonkrekic acid or carboxyatractyloside prevented ceramide-induced AP-2 activation and ICAM-1 expression. Analysis of the interaction between cyt c and AP-2 revealed that cyt c oxidized AP-2 and that this redox regulation greatly enhanced the DNA binding capacity of AP-2. Mitochondria thus have a previously unrecognized function in signaling ceramide-induced transcription factor activation and gene regulation. Ceramides play a well recognized role as second messenger in the stress response of human cells to a variety of different stimuli including the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1, γ-radiation, and solar UV B (290–320 nm) and A (320–400 nm) radiation (1Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 2Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 3Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G. Schmitt H. Sies H. Piette J. Krutmann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previous research has focused on the mechanisms by which ceramides are being generated under these conditions. It has been shown that ceramides can be produced enzymatically, either through de novo synthesis involving the enzyme ceramide synthase (4Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedmann A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) or through hydrolysis of cell membrane sphingomyelin by acid or neutral sphingomyelinases (1Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 2Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence has been provided for a third pathway, in which singlet oxygen mediates the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of ceramide from cell membrane sphingomyelin (3Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G. Schmitt H. Sies H. Piette J. Krutmann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Relatively little is currently known about the intracellular signaling pathways that allow ceramides to up-regulate transcriptional expression of genes. By stimulating NHEK with cell-permeant ceramides (e.g.d-erythro-sphingosine, N-acetyl-(C2-ceramides) 1The abbreviations used are: C2-ceramided-erythro-sphingosine, N-acetyl-C6-ceramided-erythro-sphingosine, N-hexanoyl-ICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule-1AP-2activator protein-2NHEKnormal human epidermal keratinocyte(s)cyt ccytochrome cBkabonkrekic acidCatcarboxyatractylosideIFN-γinterferon-γMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidefpufootprinting unitRTreverse transcriptionTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingGSSGglutathione disulfide.1The abbreviations used are: C2-ceramided-erythro-sphingosine, N-acetyl-C6-ceramided-erythro-sphingosine, N-hexanoyl-ICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule-1AP-2activator protein-2NHEKnormal human epidermal keratinocyte(s)cyt ccytochrome cBkabonkrekic acidCatcarboxyatractylosideIFN-γinterferon-γMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidefpufootprinting unitRTreverse transcriptionTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingGSSGglutathione disulfide. or d-erythrosphingosine, N-hexanoyl-(C6-ceramides)) it has recently been observed that ceramide-induced expression of the human ICAM-1 gene is mediated through activation of AP-2, indicating that ceramides are capable of activating transcription factors in human cells through a yet unknown mechanism (3Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G. Schmitt H. Sies H. Piette J. Krutmann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).In addition to regulating gene expression, second messenger ceramides have also been shown to induce apoptosis in human cells (5Kolesnick R.N. Haimowitz-Friedmann A. Fuks Z. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Ceramide-induced apoptosis was found to be due to the release of cyt c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm (7Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25447-25580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (739) Google Scholar) and the subsequent activation of caspases (8Rippo M.R. Malisan F. Ravagan L. Tomassini B. Condo I. Costantini P. Susin S.A. Rufini A. Todaro M. Kroemer G. Testi R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2047-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which ceramides cause cyt c release from mitochondria is not known, but it has been suggested that ceramides are able to exert direct effects on mitochondria. Studies employing isolated mitochondria have demonstrated that ceramides affect the mitochondrial electron transport chain (9Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung-Kim C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which plays a critical role in controlling the release of cyt c through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore/mitochondrial megachannel into the cytoplasm (10Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 11Martinou J.-C Nature. 1999; 399: 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is currently not known whether mitochondria are involved in an analogous fashion in ceramide-induced transcription factor activation and gene expression. In this regard, it is of interest that induction of apoptosis requires ceramide concentrations that are severalfold higher than those necessary to induce gene regulatory effects (12DiNardo A. Benassi L. Magnoni C. Cossarizza A. Seidenari S. Giannetti A. Br. J. Dermatol. 2000; 143: 491-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cutler R.G. Mattson M.P. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This suggested to us the possibility that stimulation of human cells with nonapoptogenic ceramide concentrations could have more subtle effects on mitochondrial functions, which would lead to gene induction rather than apoptosis. In the present study, we have tested this hypothesis by studying the role of mitochondria in ceramide-induced AP-2 activation and ICAM-1 expression in NHEK. As UVA radiation may exert other effects on mitochondria (14Berneburg M. Grether-Beck S. Kürten V. Ruzicka T. Briviba K. Sies H. Krutmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15345-15349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) we did not expose cells to UVA irradiation to induce an endogenous ceramide release. Instead, synthetic short chain ceramides were employed, which permeate through the cytoplasmic membrane and have been successfully used in previous studies to address mechanistic questions (15Mathias S.

Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was obtained from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). C2-ceramide (d-erythro-sphingosine, N-acetyl-), C6-ceramide (d-erythro-sphingosine, N-hexanoyl-), bonkrekic acid, carboxyatractyloside, camptothecin, N-oleoylethanolamine, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine were delivered by Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Ceramides were dissolved in ethanol as stocks (10 mm) and added to the culture medium in dilutions of 1:1000 to obtain a final concentration of 10 μm. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Human recombinant AP-2 was obtained from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Staurosporine was purchased from Alexis (Gruenberg, Germany).Differential RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Total RNA Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Expression of ICAM-1 was measured by differential reverse transcriptase-PCR using the RT-PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and a specific primer pair for ICAM-1 (5′-TGACCAGCCCAAGTTGTTGG-3′, 5′-ATCTCTCCTCACCAGCACCG-3′). Semiquantitative analysis of the RT-PCR products was done using ion exchange chromatography connected to an on-line UV spectrophotometer (absorption at 260 nm) (22Ahrens C. Grewe M. Berneburg M. Grether-Beck S. Quillet X. Mezzina M. Sarazin A. Lehmann A.R. Arlett C.F. Krutmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6837-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Henninger H.P. Hoffmann R. Grewe M. Schulze-Specking A. Decker K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1993; 374: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Gene expression was assessed in cells treated with 10 μm C6-ceramide or 1000 units/ml IFN-γ. The effect of inhibitors of mitochondrial respiratory chain such as rotenone (2.5 μm), thenoyltrifluoroacetone (20 μm), or antimycin A (1 μm) on gene expression was analyzed in both types of stimulations. N-Acetylcysteine (20 μm) was added to cells in order to increase the endogenous glutathione level.Gel Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the Dignam protocol as described (25Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Skastry B.S. Roeder R.G.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The AP-2 consensus oligonucleotide (top strand, 5′-GACCCTCTCGGCCCGGGCACCCT-3′) was deduced from the ICAM-1 promoter (26Stade B.G. Messer G. Riethmueller G. Johnson J.P. Immunobiology. 1990; 182: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Specificity controls were performed as done before (19Grether-Beck S. Olaizola-Horn S. Schmitt H. Grewe M. Jahnke A. Johnson J.P. Briviba K. Sies H. Krutmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 14586-14591Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For assays using the recombinant AP-2 protein, the gel electrophoresis standard buffer was diluted four times.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Release of cyt c from mitochondria was analyzed in cytosolic extracts prepared as described in detail. In order to separate intact cells into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (27Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 235-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NHEK were harvested using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and washed. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and disrupted with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and a tight pestle (B-type). After centrifugation, a one-eleventh volume part of buffer B (0.3 m HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 0.03 m MgCl2, 1.4 m KCl) was added, and the extract was centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C at 355,000 × g. Supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer D (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol). Proteinase inhibitor Complete™ containing EDTA (Roche Applied Science) was added to all of the buffers used. The purified cytosolic extract was analyzed for protein content and stored at –80 °C. The purity of all fractions regarding mitochondrial contamination was controlled by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B) for the mitochondrial marker protein cyt c oxidase subunit II (28Capaldi R.A. Marusich F.M. Taanman J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), yielding a specific band at 18 kDa (29Taanman J.W. Burton M.D. Marusich F.M. Kennaway N.G. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The anti-cyt c oxidase subunit II monoclonal antibody (clone 12C4) was obtained from Molecular Probes Europe (Leiden, The Netherlands).For detection of cyt c in the cytosolic fraction immunoprecipitation technique was used according to Ref. 30Bonifacino J.S.

One hundred μg of cytosolic extract were adjusted to 1 ml using buffer A, 5 μg of mouse anti-human cyt c antibody MAB898 (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) was added, and the extract was incubated on a rotating platform using end-over-end inversion at 4 °C overnight. After the addition of 7 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (heavy + light chain, Zymed Laboratories Inc., Zytomed GmbH, Berlin, Germany), the incubation was continued for another 30 min. Fifty μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) were added, and the extract was further incubated for 30 min. The extract was centrifuged for 30 s at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was washed three times using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to a new reaction tube. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS gel sample buffer (20 mm dithiothreitol, 6% SDS, 0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and bromphenol blue) by vortexing and then incubated for 3 min at 95 °C. The immunoprecipitate was fractionated through SDS-PAGE (16% polyacrylamide) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and immunoblotted on nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-blot; Bio-Rad). Human recombinant cyt c (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) served as control on gels. Detection of cyt c was done using anti-holo-cyt c antibody (clone 2CYTC-199, R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). The cyt c was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences).Apoptosis Assays—Detection of nucleosomal fragmentation was assessed using Cell Death Detection ELISAplus (Roche Applied Science). The enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm of cell lysates at 0.5, 16, and 24 h after stimulation with 10–100 μm C6-ceramide or 5 μm camptothecin was detected by biotinylated anti-histone and peroxidase-coupled anti-DNA-antibodies and was calculated by using the formula: absorbance of sample cells/absorbance of control. For detection of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), cells were stained according to the manufacturer's description by the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were fixed with 100 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde for 60 min at room temperature, washed once, resuspended in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice, and washed again twice. Cells were incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C in the dark in a humidified atmosphere. After washing twice, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a FACS-can (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells treated with DNase I (9 units/sample) served as positive controls.Effector caspase 3 was analyzed by fluorometric immunoabsorbent enzyme assay (FIENA; Roche Applied Science) in NHEK stimulated with either 10 μm C6-ceramide or 2–4 μm staurosporine. Caspase 8 and caspase 9 were detected by colorimetric activity assays (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) in NHEK stimulated with 10 μm C6-ceramide or 1–4 μm staurosporine. Camptothecin and staurosporine served as positive controls to induce apoptosis.Viability Using MTT Assay—Cytotoxicity of ceramide and/or of substances that modulate the mitochondrial megachannel such as bonkrekic acid (5 μm) or carboxyatractyloside (20 μm) was evaluated using the MTT colorimetric assay according to Ref. 32Mosmann T. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 517-527Crossref Scopus (45551) Google Scholar. Briefly, NHEK were seeded in 96-well plates at 15,000 cells/200 μl in each well. The next day, the cells were treated with the substances of interest for 16 h. After 16 h, the medium was exchanged, 25 μl of MTT (2 mg/ml phosphate-buffered saline) were added, and the mixture was incubated for another 3 h. Finally, solutions were removed, formazan crystals were dissolved in 200 μl of Me2SO, and absorption was measured using a microplate reader (Labsystems, Global Medical Instruments Inc., Albertsville, MI) at 540 nm. Viability was calculated as a percentage of control from three individual experiments (33Knaapen A.M. Albrecht C. Becker A. Hohr D. Winzer A. Haenen G. Borm P.J.A. Schins R.F.P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Assay of Cytochrome c Reduction—AP-2 oxidation by cyt c (from horse heart, purity 95%; Sigma) was determined in vitro by monitoring the changes in absorption A550 on a DU-70 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter GmbH, Unterschleissheim, Germany) with the bandwidth 0.5 nm (34Ghafourifar P.

Ten μm cyt c solution in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0 (35Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was analyzed in the presence or absence of different amounts of transcription factor human recombinant AP-2 (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) quantified in footprinting units (fpu) or bovine serum albumin (molecular biology grade). The footprinting units are defined as the amount of protein required to give a full DNase I protection pattern on the SV40 early promoter (i.e. depending on the lot 0.5 fpu/μl, meaning ∼20–150 ng of protein). Calculation of cyt c in the reduced form according to the Lambert-Beer law was done by using the extinction coefficient (36Dutton P.L. Petty K.M. Bonner H.S. Morse S.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 387: 536-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) of cyt c, 19 mm–1 cm–1 at 550–540 nm.Glutathione Assay—Determination of total glutathione content was done using the 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-glutathione disulfide (GSSG) reductase recycling assay for GSSG (37Sacchetta P. DiCola D. Federici G. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All samples including the standards were assayed in duplicate. A graph of the rate of change of absorbance versus the amount of GSSG was drawn, and the values for the samples were calculated using a linear regression program. Concentrations are obtained by multiplying with the appropriate sample dilution factor.Determination of Ceramides—Lipid extracts based on 500 μg of protein were prepared as described in Ref. 3Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G. Schmitt H. Sies H. Piette J. Krutmann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar. Briefly, lipids extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were hydrolyzed in mild alkaline, and the lower lipid phase was evaporated. The lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol and resolved by analytical high performance thin layer chromatography using a CAMAG Automated Multiple Development 2 device (CAMAG, Berlin, Germany) (3Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G. Schmitt H. Sies H. Piette J. Krutmann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed after postchromatographic derivatization with manganese chloride dipping (3Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G. Schmitt H. Sies H. Piette J. Krutmann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Colored lipids were detected by a CAMAG TLC Scanner III using CATS software 4.06 (CAMAG, Berlin, Germany) in absorption mode at 550 nm with a tungsten lamp, monochromator bandwidth of 20 nm, and slit width of 0.45 × 6 mm. Quantification was performed using a second-order polynomial calibration curve with four standard mixes in the range 50–1000 ng.RESULTSInhibition of Ceramide-induced ICAM-1 Expression by Mitochondrial Inhibitors and Depletion of the Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain—To determine whether mitochondria are involved in ceramide-induced ICAM-1 expression in NHEK, cells were ceramide-stimulated in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors that prevent electron flow between certain complexes of the respiratory chain. The optimal effective nontoxic concentrations for preincubation with these inhibitors were determined by dose effect studies with NHEK (data not shown). Significant inhibition of ceramide-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression was achieved upon treatment of cells with the complex I inhibitor rotenone (38Driscoll K.E. Carter J.M. Howard B.W. Hassenbein D. Janssen Y.M. Mossman B.T. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the complex II inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone (39Quillet-Mary A. Jaffrezou P.-J. Mansat V. Bordier C. Naval L. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), and the complex III inhibitor antimycin A (40Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Oridate N. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6380-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). These inhibitory effects were specific, because identical concentrations of these inhibitors did not affect interferon-γ-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression in the same cells (Fig. 1D). The involvement of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in ceramide-induced ICAM-1 expression was corroborated in experiments in which epithelial cells (Rho 0 cells) were used from which mitochondrial DNA had been depleted through repetitive treatment with ethidium bromide (21Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Rho 0 cells constitutively expressed ICAM-1 mRNA, and this expression could be up-regulated upon stimulation of cells with IFN-γ, whereas ceramide stimulation failed to do so (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicate that ceramide-induced ICAM-1 expression requires a functionally active mitochondrial electron transport chain.Fig. 1Abrogation of ceramide-induced expression of ICAM-1 mRNA in NHEK by inhibitors for mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I (rotenone), II (thenoyltrifluoroacetone), and III (antimycin A).A, ICAM-1/β-actin expression in NHEK after stimulation of cells with 10 μm C6-ceramide (black circles), after preincubation with 2.5 μm rotenone (gray squares) for 60 min, or after preincubation with 2.5 μm rotenone (gray circles) for 60 min and stimulation with 10 μm C6-ceramide.

Incubation with inhibitors alone is shown in A–C. Results represent one of three essentially identical experiments.

These results indicated that the electron flow proximal to the ubiquinone complex was of particular relevance to ceramide-induced gene regulation. Electron entry from complex I to ubiquinone is important for the transition of cyt c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm (41Corsini E. Schubert C. Marinovich M. Galli C.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 720-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether ceramide-induced ICAM-1 expression might be associated with a release of mitochondrial cyt c into the cytoplasm. The immunoblots in Fig. 2A show that stimulation of NHEK with cell-permeant ceramides at concentrations that induced AP-2 activation and ICAM-1 expression caused the time-dependent release of mitochondrial cyt c into the cytoplasm of the cells. The cyt c signal detected in the cytosolic fraction of ceramide-stimulated cells was not due to a mitochondrial contamination, becaus"
https://openalex.org/W1999979786,"Crystal structures of the class II major histocompatibilty complex (MHC) protein, HLA-DR1, generally show a tight fit between MHC and bound peptide except in the P6/P7 region of the peptide-binding site. In this region, there is a shallow water-filled pocket underneath the peptide and between the pockets that accommodate the P6 and P7 side chains. We investigated the properties of this pocket with the idea of engineering substitutions into the corresponding region of peptide antigens to increase their binding affinity for HLA-DR1. We investigated d-amino acids and N-alkyl modifications at both the P6 and P7 positions of the peptide and found that binding of peptides to HLA-DR1 could be increased by incorporating an N-methyl substitution at position 7 of the peptide. The crystal structure of HLA-DR1 bound to a peptide containing a P7 N-methyl alanine was determined. The N-methyl group orients in the P6/P7 pocket, displacing one of the waters usually bound in this pocket. The structure shows that the substitution does not alter the conformation of the bound peptide, which adopts the usual polyproline type II helix. An antigenic peptide carrying the N-methyl modification is taken up by antigen-presenting cells and loaded onto endogenous class II MHC molecules for presentation, and the resultant MHC-peptide complexes activate antigen-specific T-cells. These results suggest a possible strategy for increasing the affinity of weakly immunogenic peptides that might be applicable to the development of vaccines and diagnostic reagents.

Class II major histocompatibilty complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibilty complex; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; IL, interleukin.1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibilty complex; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; IL, interleukin. proteins are heterodimeric cell surface proteins that serve as restricting elements for the cell-mediated immune system. Class II MHC proteins bind peptides produced by endosomal proteolysis and present them at the cell surface for recognition by CD4+ T-cell receptors (1McFarland B.J. Katz J.F. Beeson C. Sant A.J.

Peptides isolated from class II MHC proteins found in antigen-presenting cells usually contain 15–20 residues (3Rudensky A. Preston-Hurlburt P. Hong S.C. Barlow A. Janeway Jr., C.A.

Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The central region of these peptides interact directly with class II MHC proteins, with specific recognition of an ∼9-residue stretch (5Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Within this binding frame, strong side chain preferences are found in certain positions with weaker preferences at others. Approximately one-third of total peptide surface area in the central region of the peptide is accessible to solvent for recognition by the T-cell receptor.The binding of peptides to human and mouse class II MHC has been investigated by x-ray crystallography (5Stern L.J.

Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). The structures reveal several conserved side chain binding pockets within the overall peptide-binding groove (Fig. 1A). Generally, these pockets accommodate the side chains of peptide residues at the P1, P4, P6, and P9 positions with smaller pockets or shelves in the binding site accommodating the P3 and P7 residues (the pockets are numbered along the peptide relative to a large usually hydrophobic pocket near the peptide-binding site). The pockets correspond to positions where strong side chain-binding preferences are observed in studies of MHC-peptide interaction (16Hammer J. Takacs B. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Allelic differences in the residues lining the pockets determine the peptide binding specificity (or motif) of the various class II MHC alleles. For example, in HLA-DR1 (DRB1*0101), a common human class II MHC protein, the P1 pocket shows a strong preference for large hydrophobic side chains (Trp, Tyr, Phe, Leu, and Ile), the P6 pocket has a strong preference for small residues (Gly, Ala, Ser, and Pro), and the P4 and P9 pockets have weaker preferences for residues with some aliphatic character (5Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 16Hammer J. Takacs B. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).Structures of HLA-DR peptide complexes generally show a tight fit between MHC and peptide. A prominent exception to this is a relatively large region underneath the peptide between the P6 and P7 pockets (Fig. 1). The conformation of peptides bound to class II MHC proteins is tightly restricted to a polyproline type II-like conformation, probably as a result of 12–15 conserved hydrogen bonds between the MHC and peptide main chain (17Jardetzky T.S. Brown J.H. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and a peptide side chain from a conventionally bound peptide is not likely to bind in this region. Crystal structures of HLA-DR1-peptide complexes reveal that several water molecules were tightly bound underneath the peptide between the P6 and P7 pockets. Four water sites in this region were observed to be variously occupied in lower resolution structures (2.5–2.8 Å) (5Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L.

At a higher resolution (1.93 Å), all four waters were observed (19Sundberg E.J. Sawicki M.W. Southwood S. Andersen P.S. Sette A. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)As part of an effort to explore ways to increase the binding affinity of antigenic peptides, we attempted to modify known antigenic peptides to take advantage of the P6/P7 void by displacing bound water molecules. We wanted to introduce relatively small alterations in the peptide, because the expected application of such modified peptides generally would require cross-reactivity with the native sequence and because T-cell antigen receptors are very sensitive to structural changes in a MHC-bound peptide. Single amino acid substitutions at a T-cell contact residue can abrogate T-cell recognition (20Krieger J.I. Karr R.W. Grey H.M. Yu W.Y. O'Sullivan D. Batovsky L. Zheng Z.L. Colon S.M. Gaeta F.C.

Modifications of the peptide backbone of class II MHC-binding antigens also have been reported in an effort to increase bioavail-ability or serum half-life and include alkylation, peptide-bond reduction, and incorporation of peptoid, azapeptide, dipeptide mimetic substitutions, and d-amino acids (8Bolin D.R.

In general, peptides carrying one or more of these modifications are less effective T-cell activators as compared with a peptide that does not include the modification (23Cotton J. Herve M.

Crystal structure analysis of MHC-peptide complexes carrying the modification (P7 amide N-methylation) confirms that waters were displaced without significant conformational alteration, and T-cell activation studies show that the modification does not affect interaction with the T-cell receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—For peptide-binding experiments, the extracellular portion of HLA-DR1 was produced from a recombinant baculovirus-infected SF9 insect cells as soluble empty αβ heterodimers as described previously (28Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 68: 465-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For x-ray crystallography experiments, extracellular portion of HLA-DR1 was produced by expression of isolated subunits in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies followed by refolding in vitro in the presence of peptide as described previously (29Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Refolded HLA-DR1 protein was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the conformation-specific monoclonal antibody LB3.1 and gel filtration in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.8. The protein concentration was measured by UV absorbance at 280 nm using ϵ280 of 54375 M-1 cm-1 for empty DR1. SEC3–3B2 was expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli and isolated from the periplasmic fraction as described previously (30Andersen P.S. Lavoie P.M. Sekaly R.P. Churchill H. Kranz D.M. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 473-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SEC3–3B2 is a variant of the SEC3 protein that binds with a higher affinity to the MHC class II molecule, HLA-DR1 (30Andersen P.S. Lavoie P.M. Sekaly R.P. Churchill H. Kranz D.M. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 473-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized using solid-phase Fmoc chemistry on an Advanced ChemTech 357 synthesizer. All of the peptides were synthesized containing an acetylated N terminus and an amidated C terminus to prevent possible effects of charged termini in the binding site with the exception of N-biotinylated peptides, which were produced by coupling aminocaproyl-(LC)-biotin succinimide ester (Pierce) to the N terminus of the resin-bound, side chain-protected peptide. The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin by a 3-h treatment at room temperature with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/dithiothreitol/triisopropylsilane (88:5:5:5:2.5). The solution of peptides was filtered into cold diethyl ether, and the precipitated peptides were filtered, washed with ether, and dried in vacuum. The crude peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac-C18). The purity and homogeneity of each peptide was checked by high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac-C18) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptide concentration was measured by absorbance using high pressure liquid chromatography-UV detection at 280 and 254 nm for peptides containing Tyr and Phe residues, respectively. N-Methyl amino acids were purchased as protected amino acid precursors and coupled in the usual manner. For the other N-substitutions, the N-substituted residue was generated piecemeal on the resin with conventional Fmoc/1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxy-benzotriazole chemistry used to make the fore and aft parts of the peptide following a “submonomer” strategy used previously for generating N-substituted glycines (31Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 32Figliozzi G.M. Goldsmith R. Ng S.C. Banville S.C. Zuckermann R.N. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 437-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the N-alkyl residue, the glycine backbone was first introduced using bromoacetic acid coupled twice with 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide and then the N-substitution was added as an alkylamine (or Boc-aminoalkylamine) by nucleophilic displacement for2hat37 °C. The next amino acid was coupled using a PyBrop/diisopropylethylamine activation strategy with triple coupling for 120 min. The remainder of the sequence was prepared normally. We attempted similarly to prepare N-substituted alanines using bromopropionic acid, but we were unable to efficiently couple the subsequent residue. The N-alkyl peptides were deprotected and purified in the usual manner.IC 50 Determination—A competition assay was used to determine binding affinities of peptides. Peptide-free DR1 produced in insect cells (10 nm) was mixed with biotinylated Ha-(306–318) probe (10 nm) and varying concentrations of unlabeled competitor peptide. The mixtures were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.02% NaN3 followed by detection of bound biotinylated peptide using an immunoassay that employed an anti-DR1 capture antibody LB3.1 and streptavidin-Eu detection (33Tompkins S.M. Rota P.A. Moore J.C. Jensen P.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 163: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). IC50 values were obtained by fitting a binding curve to the plots of fluorescence versus concentration of competitor peptide. The K D of the biotinylated Ha probe peptide is ∼10 nm (34Roche P.A. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1849-1856PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zarutskie J.A. Sato A.K. Rushe M.M. Chan I.C. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Stern L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5878-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).HA1.7 T-cell Hybridoma Activation Assay (IL-2 Production)—We used a mouse T-cell hybridoma transfected with a chimeric T-cell receptor carrying human variable α and β domains from the well characterized HLA-DR1-restricted Ha-peptide-specific human T-cell clone HA1.7 (36Lamb J.R. Fledmann M. Nature. 1982; 300: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and murine constant domains. The T-cell hybridoma was developed as an indicator cell for productive MHC-T-cell receptor interactions and produces IL-2 upon receptor engagement (37Boen E. Crownover A.R. McIlhaney M. Korman A.J. Bill J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2040-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In some experiments, HA1.7 hybridoma cells were incubated with purified MHC-peptide complexes immobilized on the polystyrene assay plate for 24 h at 37 °C. Culture supernatant was tested for IL-2 production using a murine IL-2 detection sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PeproTech). In other experiments, antigen-presenting cells pre-pulsed with peptide were used as stimulators. For antigen-presenting cells, we used LG2, a DR1+ homozygous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line. Live or fixed (1% paraformaldehyde) LG2 cells (5.0 × 104 cells/well) were pulsed with varying concentrations of peptide (10-9 to 10-5m) in serum-free medium in a round-bottom 96-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C. The peptide was washed away, and the LG2 cells were resuspended in suspension-minimal essential medium (used for routine passage of HA1.7 hybridoma cells). HA1.7 hybridoma cells were added to wells (105 cells/well) with peptide-pulsed LG2 cells and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Supernatant was tested for IL-2 production as described above.Crystallization—HLA-DR1-peptide bound complex was prepared by incubating purified empty HLA-DR1 (1–5 μm) with at least 5-fold molar excess peptide for 3 days at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% sodium azide. The complex was purified by gel filtration to remove aggregates and free peptide. Purified HLA-DR1/peptide complex was mixed in equimolar ratio with purified SEC3–3B2. Crystals of HLA-DR1/Ac-FVKQNAAAL-NH2/SEC3–3B2 were grown by the vapor diffusion method in hanging drops. The crystals grew at 4 °C under the following conditions: 2–6% polyethylene glycol 4000, 10% ethylene glycol, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2–5.6, and 1μl of precipitant solution mixed with 1μl of 8 mg/ml protein complex. For x-ray diffraction experiments, the crystals were soaked for ∼1 min in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 25% ethylene glycol in the mother liquor and then flashcooled in liquid nitrogen.Data Collection and Processing—A high resolution data set (2.1 Å) was collected for a single crystal (200 μm × 150 μm × 150 μm) on a Mar345 image plate detector using CuKα radiation from a rotating anode source. Collected data were processed and scaled using Denzo, Scalepack, and the CCP4 package (38Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar, 39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). An overall isotropic B factor was estimated to be 21.6 Å from a Wilson plot.Structure Determination—The structure of the complex was determined by molecular replacement. HLA-DR1/TPI23–37/SEC3–3B2 (Protein Data Bank code 1KLU) was used as the search model to find a molecular replacement solution (19Sundberg E.J. Sawicki M.W. Southwood S. Andersen P.S. Sette A. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The peptide and waters were removed from the model. Refinement was carried out using CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). After initial rigid-body refinement, three rounds of refinement included minimization, B-factor, and minimization. After each round, the protein was inspected using program O and XtalView (41Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar, 42McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Waters were added to the refined molecule using CNS. N-terminal acetyl group, C-terminal amide group, and the N-methyl group at the P7 position were included in the peptide model using data generated by the Dundee PRODRG server (43van Aalten D.M.F. Bywater R. Findlay J.B.C. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. J. Computer Aided Molecular Design. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The final model was verified for distortions on the secondary structures features using Procheck (44Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).RESULTSd-Amino Acids in P6 and P7 Positions—To investigate the binding properties of the HLA-DR1 P6/P7 pocket, we initially substituted d-amino acids into the P6 and P7 positions of a known HLA-DR1-binding peptide and measured the effects of the substitutions on peptide binding affinity using a competition assay. Naturally occurring l-amino acid containing sequences orient the P6 and P7 residues into the side chain-binding pockets that flank this region (P6 and P7, Fig. 1, A and B), leaving the P6/P7 pocket open to be filled by several water molecules (Fig. 1C). We reasoned that a peptide containing a d-amino acid at either position might be able to position a side chain into the pocket. The template peptide NH2-FVKQNAA-CONH2 was designed as a scaffold for the substitutions. The peptide is based on the central region of the viral peptide PKYVKQNTLKLAT (Ha306–318) (5Stern L.J.

The original peptide length was reduced from 13 residues, 11 of which are bound by HLA-DR1, to 7 residues, to emphasize the interactions of interest in the P6/P7 region while maintaining the original binding frame that places an aromatic residue in the P1 position. The five N-terminal residues FVKQN of the scaffold peptide correspond to the native Ha sequence with the exception that an original tyrosine at position 1 was changed to phenylalanine to reduce the relative importance of the P1 pocket while maintaining the original binding frame. The Ala-Ala sequence at positions 6–7 was originally Thr-Leu. These were substituted to alanine to provide a rational basis for comparison of the d-amino acids. Finally, the N and C termini were acetylated and amidated, respectively, to prevent ionization of the termini that might disrupt the conserved hydrogen-bonding arrangement that constrains the peptide in the binding site. Effects of introduction of peptide d-amino acids to the MHC-peptide binding affinity have been investigated previously by other groups (24Hill C.M. Liu A. Marshall K.W. Mayer J. Jorgensen B. Yuan B.

Substitutions with d-amino acids were made at position 6 holding position 7 constant with l-alanine (Fig. 2A) and conversely at position 7 holding position 6 constant with l-alanine (Fig. 2B). 19 d-amino acids were tested at each position (d-analogs of all naturally occurring amino acids with the exception of d-Ile and d-Cys were included in the library along with d-ornithine). Of the 38 d-amino acid substitutions tested, only d-Pro at position 7 was found to increase the binding affinity of the base peptide. The peptide Ac-FVKQNAP-NH2 (where P = d-proline) exhibited IC50 of 8 μm (K d ∼4 μm, see “Experimental Procedures”), binding 20–100-fold more tightly than the other sequences.Fig. 2Effect of D-amino acids at position 6 or 7 of the Ha peptide analogue. A, competitive-binding analysis of peptides with d-amino acids at the P6 position. A fixed concentration of peptide-free HLA-DR1 and biotinylated Ha peptide was incubated with increasing concentrations of Ac-FVKQNxA peptides having various d-amino acid residues at the P6 position (see “Experimental Procedures”). After binding for 3 days at 37 °C, the amount of bound bio-Ha peptide/HLA-DR1 complexes was measured using a streptavidin europium assay. B, competitive-binding analysis of peptides with d-amino acids at P7. Of 38 d-amino acid residues tested at P6 and P7, only d-Pro (P7) substantially increased the binding affinity of the base peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We confirmed this result in the context of a different base peptide, YTALAAA (Fig. 3). This peptide binds ∼103-fold more tightly than FVKQNAA, because it carries the residues most favorable for HLA-DR1 binding at the key P1, P4, and P6 positions (16Hammer J. Takacs B. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) as well as a threonine at position 2, which can make a favorable interaction with the MHC backbone (11Fremont D.H. Dai S. Chiang H. Crawford F. Marrack P. Kappler J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). P3 and P5, both alanines in this peptide, are primarily T-cell contacts and do not contribute significantly to the MHC-peptide binding affinity (18Hennecke J. Wiley D.C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). YTALAAP binds tightly to HLA-DR1 relative to the already tightly binding YTALAAA, indicating a positive contribution to the binding of d-Pro at position 7 in this peptide, similarly to that observed for FVKQNAP (Fig. 3). As similar effects were observed for d-Pro at position 7 in the context of two completely different sequences, we concluded that the incorporation of an alkyl group at the nitrogen group of the P7 residue can increase peptide binding to HLA-DR1.Fig. 3Effect of peptide extension beyond D-Pro at position 7.

The reaction catalyzed by ThrS is one of the most sophisticated among reactions catalyzed by PLP-dependent enzymes and is expected to proceed through all the intermediates utilized by PLP-dependent enzymes (4Metzler D.E.

Maurer W. Hanke C. Grafe S. Ehlert S. Messerschmidt A. Clausen T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Class I ThrS from plants has an additional N-terminal domain binding S-adenosylmethionine, which is the allosteric activator of threonine synthesis. ThrSs from bacteria or fungi belonging to classes I and II lack the S-adenosylmethionine binding domain. Class II ThrS is characterized by an additional C-terminal extension of about 50 residues. The structure of the apo form of ThrS has been solved at 2.25 Å resolution (8Thomazeau K. Curien G. Dumas R. Biou V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homo dimer, and the folding of the subunit is similar to those of the fold-type II PLP-dependent enzymes, tryptophan synthase β-subunit (9Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), threonine deaminase (10Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiao G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D.

The active site structure including the cofactor PLP remains unsettled because of the lack of PLP, although the PLP binding site is assessed. Recently, the structure of the unliganded yeast ThrS (yThrS) in the PLP form has been solved at 2.7-Å resolution (12Garrido-Franco M. Ehlert S. Messerschmidt A. Marinkovic‘ S. Huber R. Laber B. Bourenkov G.P. Clausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12396-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a monomer and is folded into a structure similar to those of fold-type II enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase (13Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (14Yao M. Ose T. Sugimoto H. Horiuchi A. Nakagawa A. Wakatsuki S. Yokoi D.

The location of PLP and the interactions of the active site residues with PLP were uncovered. Substrate binding and catalysis were examined on the basis of the enzyme-substrate complex modeled into the active site. ThrS from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (tThrS), which has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, has 351 residues per subunit, with a subunit molecular weight of 37,000. Sequence alignment showed that tThrS belongs to the class I subfamily, and the sequence identities of tThrS with respect to Arabidopsis thaliana ThrS (aThrS, class I subfamily) and yeast ThrS (yThrS, class II subfamily) are 32 and 14.2%, respectively. We have determined the structures of the unliganded tThrS in the PLP form and tThrS in the complex with the substrate analogue, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) where the ester oxygen of the terminal phosphate in HSerP is replaced by a methylene group. The enzyme exists as a dimer, and the subunit structure was shown to be similar to those of aThrS, yThrS, and other fold-type II enzymes. The unliganded structure of tThrS was compared with that of the complex to reveal the conformational change from the open to the closed form approximated as a rigid body rotation of 25° at the domain level upon the substrate binding. The active site closure plays important roles in substrate recognition and the catalytic process. The closed form of the enzyme made it possible to investigate the catalytic mechanism so far proposed (4Metzler D.E. Ikawa M. Snell E.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 648-652Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 5Flavin M. Slaughter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1112-1118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Laber B. Gerbling K.P. Harde C.

We now report the x-ray crystallographic study of the following two forms of tThrS: the unliganded form at 2.15-Å resolution and the complexed form with AP5 at 2.0-Å resolution. Expression and Purification—Using T. thermophilus HB8 genomic DNA and a set of primers (5′-CCATATGCGGCCGCCCCTCATA-3′ and 5′-CATCAGAGCGACGGGGATCCCCCCGGCCAGGTAG-3′), the tThrC gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the TA-vector pGEM (INVITROGEN). After confirmation of the nucleotide sequence, tThrC gene was ligated into the expression vector pET20b(+) at the NdeI/BamHI sites. The resulting expression plasmid was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The cells were grown in LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the OD600 had reached ∼0.6 (about 5 h after the beginning of a large scale culture), 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and culture was continued under the same conditions for 20 h. The enzyme was purified by a two-step procedure of column chromatography. The cell lysate was centrifuged (15,000 rpm) for 50 min at 277 K and applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column (TOSOH) equilibrated with 20 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH7.0. The flow-through fractions containing tThrS were pooled and centrifuged. Ammonium sulfate was added to the resultant supernatant to make a 20% saturated ammonium sulfate solution, which was applied to a Phenyl-Toyopearl column (TOSOH) equilibrated with 10 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm mercaptoethanol. tThrS was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 20 to 0% in the same buffer. The peak fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, concentrated to 7 mg ml-1 and stored at 277 K. Enzyme Assay—Enzymatic activity was measured by analyzing the phosphate released from HSerP using a previously reported procedure (15Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in a 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm PLP, and 30 μg of tThrS at 290 and 343 K. The reactions were initiated by adding purified enzyme and stopped by the color reagent. The protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). The enzyme has a specific activity of 0.25 ± 0.06 μmol min-1 mg-1 at 290 K and 4.25 ± 0.09 μmol min-1 mg-1 at 343 K. Crystallization and Data Collection—The unliganded tThrS was crystallized into trigonal or orthorhombic forms by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K using sparse matrix screens (17Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). Trigonal crystals were obtained by equilibration of a mixture containing 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m Mes, pH 6.5 buffer containing 1.45 m ammonium sulfate) against 400 μl of reservoir solution. Yellow octahedral crystals appeared within 3 days of incubation and grew to maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm. The space group is P3221 having cell dimensions of a = b = 113.2 and c = 150.3 Å with two subunits in the asymmetric unit. The 10% polyethyleneglycol 8000 as a reservoir solution gave orthorhombic crystals. Yellow plate-like crystals had grown to dimensions of about 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.02 mm within 5 days. The space group is P212121 having cell dimensions of a = 69.1, b = 83.3, and c = 123.5 Å with two subunits in the asymmetric unit. The complex with 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) was crystallized using the hanging drop composed of 2 μl of protein solution, 2 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% PEG 8000, and 0.2 m Ca(OAc)2), and 1 μl of additive solution (reservoir solution containing 25 mm AP5). Within 1 week of incubation, yellow crystals had grown to dimensions of about 0.4× 0.4× 0.2 mm. The space group is P21212 having cell dimensions of a = 116.6, b = 119. 5, and c = 123.4 Å with four subunits in the asymmetric unit. The data sets for the trigonal, orthorhombic, and tThrS·AP5 complex crystals were collected at 100 K on the BL40B2, BL44B2, and BL40B2 stations at Spring-8 (Hyogo, Japan), processed, and scaled by HKL2000 (18Otowinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar), MOSFLM (19Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESRF-EESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Warrington, UK: SERC Daresbury Laboratory1992Google Scholar), and HKL2000, respectively. The data sets for the trigonal crystals soaked in solutions containing heavy atom reagents were collected at 293 K with a Rigaku R-Axis IV++ and processed using CrystalClear (Molecular Structure Corporation, a Rigaku company) (Table I).Table IData collection, MIR, and refinement statisticsOrthorhombicTrigonalEMTSaEthylmercurithiosalicylic acid, sodium salt.KAu(CN)2AP5complexDiffraction dataWavelength (Å)1.01.01.54181.54181.0Resolution (Å)50-2.1520.0-2.2550.0-3.150.0-3.420.0-2.0Total no. of reflections26262848691483654697991141164Unique no. of Reflections38595531484265232541110109Completeness (%)97.9 (97.9)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.99.7 (99.4)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.99.0 (99.0)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.98.7 (98.7)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.95.0 (96.6)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.R merge (%)cRmerge-ΣhklΣi|Ihkl/-〈Ihkl〉|/ΣhklΣiIhkl where I = observed intensity and 〈I〉=averageintensityformultiplemeasurements.10.5 (30.5)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.8.0 (32.3)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.10.5 (30.6)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.14.9 (31.4)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.9.4 (32.1)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.MIRSoaking time, hour22R diff' %dRdiff=Σ||FPH|-|FP||/Σ|FP|, where|F PH| and|F P| are the derivative and native structure-factor amplitudes, respectively.22.419.6Phasing powerePhasing power is the ratio of the r.m.s. of the heavy atom scattering amplitude and the lack of closure error.0.901.10No. of site22Occupancy0.530.480.470.51RefinementResolution limits (Å)10.0-2.1510.0-2.2510-2.0R factor (%)21.0 (22.5)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.20.1 (21.1)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.19.6 (21.4)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.R free (%)25.1 (23.4)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.21.9 (22.6)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.23.0 (27.5)bThe values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.DeviationsBond length (Å)0.0030.0060.006Bond angles (deg)1.01.31.4Mean B factorMain chain atoms (Å2)20.524.815.7Side-chain atoms (Å2)21.625.716.9Water atoms (Å2)25.928.723.7Hetero atoms (Å2)PLP 13.9PLP 19.713.1SO4 37.7a Ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid, sodium salt.b The values in the parentheses are for the highest resolution shells.c Rmerge-ΣhklΣi|Ihkl/-〈Ihkl〉|/ΣhklΣiIhkl where I = observed intensity and 〈I〉=averageintensityformultiplemeasurements.d Rdiff=Σ||FPH|-|FP||/Σ|FP|, where|F PH| and|F P| are the derivative and native structure-factor amplitudes, respectively.e Phasing power is the ratio of the r.m.s. of the heavy atom scattering amplitude and the lack of closure error. Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of the unliganded tThrS was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement method, using two isomorphous data sets for the crystal in the trigonal form. The scaling of all the data and the map calculations were performed with the CCP4 program suite (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). The difference Patterson map calculations for the ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid and KAu(CN)2 data sets allowed the interpretation of two mercury sites and two gold sites, respectively. Refinement of heavy atom parameters was performed by the program SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The resulting MIR map has a mean figure-of-merit of 0.40 at a resolution of 20-3.1 Å. The map was significantly improved by the process of solvent flattening with the program RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) and the mean figure-of-merit reached 0.67 with the same resolution range. The map was of good quality, and the model of tThrS was gradually built into a 3.1 Å map through several cycles of model building using the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The resultant model was composed of 556 residues out of 702 as a dimer with an R factor of 40.1% and an R free of 44.3%. Using this model as the search model for the molecular replacement calculation, the initial structure of the unliganded tThrS in the orthorhombic form was determined with AMoRe (23Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The structure of tThrS in the orthorhombic form was refined by simulated annealing and energy minimization with the program CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.N. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar), using the x-ray data from 50.0-2.8 Å resolution to give an R factor of 28.2% and an R free of 34.5%. The resolution was progressively increased to 2.15 Å, and after several rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding, R factor and R free were reduced to 24.0 and 26.5%, respectively. A difference map displayed one large peak per subunit, which was assigned to the cofactor, PLP. Water molecules were picked up from the 2F o-F c map on the basis of the peak heights and distance criteria, except for those whose thermal factors after refinement were above 50 Å2 (corresponding to the maximum thermal factor of the main chain atoms). Further model building and refinement cycles resulted in an R factor of 21.0% and an R free of 25.1%, calculated for 38,595 reflections [F o > 2σ(F o)] observed in a 10.0-2.15 Å resolution range (Table I). The structure of tThrS in the complex with AP5 was determined with AMoRe (23Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), using the coordinates of the unliganded tThrS in the orthorhombic form except for those of PLP. The refinement procedure similar to that for the unliganded tThrS was applied to tThrS·AP5. When the R factor value became less than 30%, the difference Fourier map clearly exhibited a residual electron density corresponding to the AP5-cofactor conjugate system. The residual electron density of AP5 is connected to the N4 atom of the cofactor, indicating that AP5 is covalently bonded to the cofactor. The AP5-cofactor bond structure was assigned to an enamine as a major component, which showed a good fit to the residual electron density (Fig. 1, see “Active Site of tThrS Complex with AP5 in the Closed Form”) (25Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graphics. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Refinement cycles gave R factor and R free values of 19.6 and 23.0%, respectively, calculated for 110,109 reflections [F o > 2σ(F o)] observed in a 10.0-2.0 Å resolution range (Table I). Spectroscopic Measurements—The absorption spectra of the unliganded tThrS and tThrS in the complex with AP5 were recorded with a Hitachi spectrophotometer, Model 3300, using a 10-mm cell (Fig. 2). Quality of the Structure—The final model of the unliganded tThrS as a dimeric enzyme comprises 2 × 350 residues (one C-terminal residue of each subunit is not visible), two PLPs, and 283 water molecules with an R factor of 21.0% at 2.15-Å resolution (Table I). The six residues of one subunit and the five residues of the other subunit, the side chains of which were disordered and not located on the electron density map, were replaced by alanine residues. The main chain atoms of the two subunits in the asymmetric unit were superposed by least-squares fitting with an r.m.s deviation of 0.50 Å and a maximum deviation of 5.96 Å (Met1) (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar), indicating that the two independent subunits have the same structure. The average thermal factors of the main-chain atoms (N, Cα, C, and O) in the two subunits are 21.5 and 19.5 Å2. The model was of good quality with all the residues falling in the most favorable (88.9%) and additionally allowed region (11.1%) of the Ramachandran plot, when the stereochemistry was assessed by PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final model of the tThrS·AP5 complex contains 4 × 351 amino acid residues, four AP5-cofactor bond structures, and 885 water molecules with an R factor of 19.6% at 2.0 Å resolution (Table I). The main chain atoms of the four subunits in the asymmetric unit were superposed with an r.m.s deviation of 0.27 Å and a maximum deviation of 2.80 Å, indicating that the four independent subunits have the same structure. The average thermal factors of the main chain atoms in the four subunits are 13.8, 14.1, 17.4, and 17.7 Å2. All the main chain atoms fall within the most favorable (90.4%) and the additionally allowed region (9.6%). Structure diagrams were drawn using the programs Molscript (27Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Bobscript (25Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graphics. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar), PyMOL (28DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar), and Raster3D (29Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar) Overall and Subunit Structure—The overall structure of the unliganded tThrS is shown in Fig. 3A. The subunit structure of tThrS is shown with secondary structure assignments by the program DSSP in Fig. 3B (30Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers,. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12173) Google Scholar). The tThrS is folded into a dimeric form, and the Cα atoms of the two subunits are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. The surface area of the subunit interface was calculated to be 7223 Å2, which amounts to about one-fourth of the subunit surface area. The enzyme consists of a large domain, a small domain, and a swap domain. The large domain is formed by two parts of the polypeptide chains from the N terminus to Gly76 and from Val156 to Glu332, the small domain from Ala77 to Ser155, and the swap domain from Leu333 to the C terminus. The large domain is an α/β domain with an open twisted β-sheet structure. The six β-strands designated b1, b2, b10, b7, b8, and b9 (all parallel except for the b1-strand) form a twisted β-sheet structure as a central core surrounded by four α-helices (a2, a12, a13, and a14) from one side of the β-sheet and four α-helices (a8, a9, a11, and a10) from the other side of the β-sheet (Fig. 3B). Many of the active site residues, which interact with the cofactor are situated at or near one end of the six-stranded β-sheet (the C terminus of b2-, b7-, and b10-strands), forming the base of the active site cavity. The N-terminal 29 residues and α-helices (a3 and a7) of the large domain form a cluster, which is located between the small domain and the α/β core of the large domain. The small domain also assumes an α/β structure with a four-stranded parallel β-sheet (b6, b3, b4, and b5) surrounded by two α-helices (a4 and a5) from the protein side and one α-helix (a6) from the solvent side. The C-terminal swap domain extends its α-helix (a15) toward the small domain of the other subunit to interact with it and is involved in the formation of the tThrS molecule as a dimer. The a15 helix lies on the β-sheet of the small domain of the other subunit from the solvent side and behaves like a part of the α/β structure of the small domain (Fig. 3A). Open-Closed Conformational Change—One of the striking features of tThrS is the overall enzymatic conformational change from the open to the closed form, depending on the binding of the substrate analogue (AP5). It is well known that aspartate aminotransferase from higher animals and Escherichia coli show the open-closed conformational change (31Jansonius J.N. Vincent M.G. Jurnak F.A. Mcpherson A. Structural Basis for Catalysis by Aspartate Aminotransferase in Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1987: 187-285Google Scholar, 32Jäger J. Moser M. Sauder U. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The substrate binding to aspartate aminotransferase induces a large movement of a small domain as a rigid body to close the active site and shield the substrate from the solvent region. This domain movement plays important roles in the substrate recognition and catalytic actions of the enzyme. The Cα atoms of 270 residues out of 351 residues in the unliganded tThrS can be superimposed onto the corresponding ones in tThrS·AP5 within 1.0 Å with an r.m.s deviation of 0.23 Å. The r.m.s deviation for all residues is 2.21 Å with a maximum displacement of 9.2 Å (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). Out of 270 residues used for least-squares fitting by Cα atoms, 238, 32, and 0 residues are from the large, small, and swap domains, respectively, indicating that, upon binding of AP5, the small and swap domains change their orientations relative to the large domain and/or change their conformations (Fig. 4, A and B). Fig. 4C displays the deviations of Cα atoms, which have one significant and two large peaks in the small domain region and one large peak in the swap domain region. The corresponding Cα positions of the small domains in the unliganded tThrS and the tThrS·AP5 are superimposed within 0.74 Å with a maximum displacement of 4.46 Å (Thr85) except for the α-helix a4. This α-helix faces the large domain and does not change its position upon binding of AP5. Because the secondary structures (α-helices and β-strands) of the small domain except for a4 show an excellent overlap (r.m.s deviation of 0.41 Å) between the unliganded and the complex forms, the overall conformational change in tThrS upon binding of AP5 is caused essentially by the rigid-body movement of the small domain except for a4 (Fig. 4B). The small domain of tThrS·AP5 rotates by 25° around an axis which approximately goes through Val80 (β-strand b3), Ala103 (b4), and Ala125(b5) with respect to that of the unliganded tThrS to close the active site. The overall rotation of the small domain accompanies local conformation changes in the loop regions connecting the secondary structures, because the Cα atoms of the loop regions of the small domain exhibit an r.m.s. deviation of 0.74 Å, significantly larger than 0.41 Å for the secondary structures. The local conformational change is related to the substrate recognition of the enzyme (see “Active-Site Structure of tThrS·AP5 in the Closed Form”). The swap domain also shows a large r.m.s. deviation of 2.48 Å when the Cα atoms of the large domains are superimposed between the unliganded and the complex tThrS. The swap domain, which interacts with the small domain of the other subunit, especially with the b5-strand of the small domain, behaves like a part of the small domain and moves as a rigid body in consort with the conformational change in the small domain of the other subunit. Active Site of tThrS in the Open Form—The active site is located at the domain interface and is formed by the residues from one subunit of the dimeric molecule. A large crevice (20 Å in length, 6-8 Å in width and 7-11 Å in depth) filled with water molecules is formed between the large and the small domain of one subunit with PLP bound to the bottom of the central region of this crevice. The stereo structure and hydrogen-bonding scheme of the active site are shown in Figs. 5A and 6A, respectively. The PLP forms a Schiff base bond with Lys61 and interacts with the large domain residues with its si-face directed toward the protein side.Fig. 6Schematic diagram showing hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions of the active site residues.

The smaller protein, TrfA-33, is sufficient for plasmid replication in many bacterial hosts. Efficient replication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, specifically requires the larger TrfA-44 protein. With the aim of identifying sequences of TrfA-44 required for stable replication of RK2 in P. aeruginosa, specific deletions and a substitution mutant within the N terminus sequence unique to TrfA-44 were constructed, and the mutant proteins were tested for activity. Deletion mutants were targeted to three of the four predicted helical regions in the first 97 amino acids of TrfA-44. Deletion of TrfA-44 amino acids 21–32 yielded a mutant protein, TrfA-44Δ2, that had lost the ability to bind and load the DnaB helicase of P. aeruginosa or Pseudomonas putida onto the RK2 origin in vitro and did not support stable replication of an RK2 mini-replicon in P. aeruginosa in vivo. A substitution of amino acid 22 within this essential region resulted in a protein, TrfA-44E22A, with reduced activity in vitro, particularly with the P. putida helicase. Deletion of amino acids 37–55 (TrfA-44Δ3) slightly affected protein activity in vitro with the P. aeruginosa helicase and significantly with the P. putida helicase, whereas deletion of amino acids 71–88 (TrfA-44Δ4) had no effect on TrfA activity in vitro with either helicase. These results identify regions of the TrfA-44 protein that are required for recruitment of the Pseudomonas DnaB helicases in the initiation of RK2 replication.

These results identify regions of the TrfA-44 protein that are required for recruitment of the Pseudomonas DnaB helicases in the initiation of RK2 replication. A critical step in the initiation of DNA replication is the recruitment, loading, and activation of the replicative helicase. Helicase activity is not only necessary for progression of the replication fork but, as studies with the Escherichia coli chromosomal origin oriC have revealed, the DnaB helicase makes essential contacts with other proteins in the replication complex. Recruitment of the helicase in E. coli requires association of the DnaB hexamer with the E. coli DnaC accessory protein (1Funnell B. Baker T. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

The DnaB-DnaC complex interacts with the host initiation protein, DnaA, bound to specific sequences (DnaA boxes) at oriC. This association results in the loading of the helicase onto unwound single-stranded DNA in the origin and the release of DnaC (4Messer W. Blaesing F. Majka J. Nardmann J. Schaper S. Schmidt A.

Once loaded onto the single-stranded DNA, DnaB interacts directly with DnaG to facilitate primase loading onto the single-stranded DNA at the replication fork (8Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Lu Y.-B. Ratnakar P.V.A.L. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27244-27248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The subsequent association of DnaB with the Tau subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme results in rapid movement of the replication fork (12Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Studies on plasmids and phages that replicate in E. coli have revealed additional strategies for recruiting DnaB to a replication origin. The replication initiation proteins encoded by the narrow host range plasmids pSC101 and R6K, RepA and π, respectively, have been shown to interact with DnaB in vitro (14Datta H.J. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Lu Y.-B. Datta H.J. Bastia D.

A. 1996; 93: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For plasmid pSC101, the RepA-DnaB interaction is essential for loading the helicase onto the origin in a process that also requires the DnaC and DnaA proteins (14Datta H.J. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage λ utilizes the phage-encoded P protein instead of the host-encoded DnaC protein to recruit DnaB to the initiation complex (17Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10699-10708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With phage P2, the phage-encoded B protein appears to be required for DnaB recruitment for lytic replication, although not replication of P2 as a plasmid (19Odegrip R. Schoen S. Haggard-Ljungquist E. Park K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4057-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Broad host range plasmids are able to replicate in diverse bacteria. As such, they provide the means to examine replication of a specific replicon in different host backgrounds. RK2 is a promiscuous plasmid belonging to the IncP group. It is noted for its ability to transfer into and be stably maintained in a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria. Only two regions of an IncP plasmid are essential for broad host range replication, the cis acting origin for DNA replication (oriV) and the trfA gene that encodes two forms of a trans-acting replication initiation protein. The host bacterium provides all other proteins essential for replication. The simplicity of this system has allowed for a direct comparison of the mechanism for DNA replication initiation in different bacterial species (20Caspi R. Pacek M. Consiglieri G. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. Konieczny I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Caspi R. Helinski D.R. Pacek M. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18454-18461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).IncP plasmids can be divided into two subgroups based on sequence differences: IncPα, to which RK2 belongs, and IncPβ, which is represented by the plasmid R751. Both RK2 and R751 can replicate in E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Earlier studies had shown that the smaller form of the RK2 initiation protein, TrfA-33, was sufficient for stable replication of an RK2 mini-replicon in E. coli or Pseudomonas putida but that the larger form of the protein, TrfA-44, was required for plasmid replication in P. aeruginosa (22Shingler V. Thomas C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Fang F.C. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5861-5868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Durland R.H. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1987; 18: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that TrfA-44 is unique among plasmid initiation proteins in that it can load and activate the DnaB helicase of P. aeruginosa or P. putida on the RK2 origin in vitro in the absence of the DnaA protein (25Jiang Y. Pacek M. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Toukdarian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8692-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By contrast, the TrfA-33 protein requires DnaA protein to load and activate the helicase of P. putida and requires DnaA plus DnaC to load the helicase of E. coli. Consistent with the earlier in vivo studies, TrfA-33 did not function in vitro with the DnaB helicase of P. aeruginosa either in the presence or in the absence of P. aeruginosa DnaA (25Jiang Y. Pacek M. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Toukdarian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8692-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Since it has been shown that the open complex formed on a supercoiled oriV template is indistinguishable when either TrfA-33 or TrfA-44 proteins are used with the DnaA proteins of E. coli, P. putida, or P. aeruginosa (20Caspi R. Pacek M. Consiglieri G. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. Konieczny I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the observed differences in activity of the two forms of the TrfA initiation protein in P. aeruginosa are likely due to a difference in their ability to interact with the P. aeruginosa DnaB helicase. This suggested a role for the N-terminal 97 amino acids, which are unique to TrfA-44, in DnaB recruitment in Pseudomonas. We therefore undertook a mutational analysis of the first 97 amino acids of this protein in an attempt to identify those regions within the N terminus that are important in the loading of the Pseudomonas helicases at the RK2 replication origin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of trfA Mutations—Plasmid pGC1 (20Caspi R. Pacek M. Consiglieri G. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. Konieczny I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used to express His6TrfA-44(M98L/G254D/S267L), a variant of TrfA-44 that has six histidine residues inserted between the first amino acid (Met) and the second amino acid (Asn) of the native protein to allow for ease of purification, the M98L amino acid substitution that replaces the native methionine start of TrfA-33 with a leucine and thus eliminates TrfA-33 expression, and the G254D and S267L changes that result in a primarily monomeric form of the protein. A previous study had shown that although wild type TrfA protein is primarily a dimer in solution, it was the monomeric form that was essential for replication initiation activity (26Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Perri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7072-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGC1 served as the template for the construction of three specific N-terminal deletions and one point mutant as follows.Amino acids 21–32, 37–55, or 71–88 (numbering based on the native non-His-tagged protein) were deleted by using a PCR-based strategy. For each deletion, two pairs of primers were used to synthesize fragments that flanked either side of the desired deletion in the trfA gene. Both PCR fragments included restriction enzyme sites such that after digestion with the appropriate enzymes, ligation of the two fragments in the presence of a vector backbone resulted in the construction of a pGC1 derivative. These derivatives expressed the desired TrfA-44 deletion protein, which contained either one or two additional amino acids at the site of the deletion. The resulting plasmids were pZZ28, for expression of TrfA-44Δ2, pZZ25, for expression of TrfA-44Δ3, and pZZ23, for expression of TrfA-44Δ4.To change amino acid residue 22 in the trfA gene of pGC1 from Glu (GAG) to Ala (GCG), and coincidentally introduce a SacII site, primer 5′-GGGTTTTCCGCCGCGGATGCCGAAAC-3′ and its complement were used with pGC1 template and the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce the underlined base change. The EcoRI-SfiI fragment of one resulting mutant was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation, and this fragment was then used to replace the matching fragment in non-mutagenized pGC1 resulting in pZZ29.Source of Proteins—The N-terminal His6-tagged G254D/S267L form of TrfA-33 (27Blasina A.

Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reactions were run on 1.75-ml columns of Sepharose CL-4B. Fractions were collected and analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using a mouse antibody specific to the His tag (Tetra-His antibody, Qiagen). Bound primary antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG followed by SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce). TrfA protein was detected separately by applying aliquots of each fraction onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a slot-blot device followed by incubation with rabbit anti-TrfA antibody. Bound rabbit antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG followed by SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce).Plasmid Stability in Vivo—To test the ability of the TrfA-44 mutants to support replication in P. aeruginosa, the mutations were transferred into the RK2 mini-replicon pRR10 (32Roberts R.C. Burioni R. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6204-6216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EcoRI-SfiI fragment containing the 5′ end of trfA of plasmid pRR10 was replaced with the EcoRI-SfiI fragment containing the 5′ end of trfA from plasmids pZZ23 (TrfA-44Δ4), pZZ25 (TrfA-44Δ3), pZZ28 (TrfA-44Δ2), pZZ29 (TrfA-44E22A), and pGC1 (TrfA-44), resulting in plasmids pRR10-98HisΔ4, pRR10-98HisΔ3, pRR10-98HisΔ2, pRR10-98HisE22A, and pRR10-98His, respectively. E. coli strain MC1029 Ch3/86, which expresses wild type TrfA-33 and TrfA-44 proteins, was used as the host for the construction (33Thomas C.M. Stalker D.M. Helinski D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).The five pRR10 derivatives were then introduced separately into P. aeruginosa by electroporation (34Dennis J.J. Sokol P.A. Nickoloff J.A. Electroporation Protocols for Microorganisms. Vol. 47. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 125-133Google Scholar) using 100 μg/ml carbenicillin for selection. A single colony for each of these five strains was picked from a fresh overnight LB + 100 μg/ml carbenicillin plate, resuspended in 5 ml of LB, and then incubated for 24 h with shaking at 37 °C. At subsequent time points, 50 μl of the stationary phase culture was transferred to 5 ml of LB broth, and incubation at 37 °C with shaking was continued. In addition, serial dilutions of the initial suspension and the subsequent overnight cultures were prepared, and aliquots were plated onto LB agar without antibiotics. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, 100 colonies from these plates were patched to plates with LB + 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and then onto LB plates to determine the percentage of cells still maintaining the plasmid.RESULTSRationale for the Construction of Specific Mutants—Plasmids RK2 (IncPα replicon) and R751 (IncPβ replicon) can replicate in E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and both plasmids express two forms of the essential plasmid-encoded replication initiation protein. The larger form of the RK2 initiation protein, TrfA-44, is required for replication of the plasmid in P. aeruginosa, whereas the smaller form is sufficient for replication in E. coli (22Shingler V. Thomas C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Fang F.C. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5861-5868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Durland R.H. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1987; 18: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The smaller forms of the RK2 and the R751 initiation proteins, TrfA-33 and TrfA2, respectively, are each 285 amino acids in length, and when aligned using ClustalW (35Thompson J. Higgins D. Gibson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55151) Google Scholar), 91% of the residues are either identical or strongly similar (data not shown). The larger forms of the initiation protein of the two plasmids differ in size and are less related in the N-terminal regions. Alignment of the 382-amino-acid TrfA-44 protein of RK2 and the 407-amino-acid TrfA1 protein of R751 using ClustalW identified 78% residues that were identical or strongly similar. The alignment result for the N terminus of the larger proteins is shown in Fig. 1. Given the increased sequence variation of the two larger proteins as compared with the two smaller proteins, it seemed likely that those residues conserved in the N terminus of TrfA-44 and TrfA1 would be important for protein activity in P. aeruginosa.Analysis of TrfA-44 using the secondary structure prediction program PredictProtein (36Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified four possible helical regions in the first 97 amino acids of the protein (Fig. 1). The fourth helical region overlapped with a region of striking similarity between TrfA-44 and TrfA1, comprised of amino acid residues 70–90 of TrfA-44, that had been noted in an earlier study (37Thorsted P.B. Shah D.S. Macartney D. Kostelidou K. Thomas C.M. Plasmid. 1996; 36: 95-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to delete amino acids 71–88 of TrfA-44, which encompassed this helical region. The analysis of the in vitro activity of this deletion mutant, designated as TrfA-44Δ4, led to the construction of deletions TrfA-44Δ3 (amino acid residues 37–55 inclusive deleted) and TrfA-44Δ2 (amino acid residues 21–32 inclusive deleted), which removed, separately, two of the three remaining predicted helical regions.In Vitro Helicase Loading Activity of TrfA-44 Deletion Mutants—Loading and activation of DnaB helicase at a replication origin on a supercoiled plasmid template can be examined in vitro using the FI* assay (2Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The basis of this assay is that helicase unwinding of a supercoiled template in the presence of DNA gyrase and SSB produces a highly unwound form of the DNA, termed FI*, that can be distinguished electrophoretically from the template FI form.The FI* assay was used to test the functionality of the mutant TrfA proteins in the recruitment, loading, and activation of DnaB at the RK2 origin. To ensure that slight differences in the activity of the mutants would be seen, the amount of DnaB helicase added to the standard assay was titrated to determine the lowest level of DnaB protein needed to get full activity with wild type TrfA-44 protein. The level of E. coli DnaB necessary for full activity, 1600 ng, was similar to that reported previously (29Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the addition of both E. coli DnaA and DnaC proteins was essential (data not shown). The level of Pseudomonas DnaB required for full activity with wild type TrfA-44 protein, 50 ng for DnaB from P. aeruginosa and 100 ng for P. putida DnaB (Fig. 2), was less then reported previously (20Caspi R. Pacek M. Consiglieri G. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. Konieczny I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As expected from previous work (25Jiang Y. Pacek M. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Toukdarian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8692-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), activity with TrfA-44 was not dependent on the addition of Pseudomonas DnaA (compare Fig. 2, lane 5 or 6, with lane 4, and compare lane 11 or 12 with lane 10). We then confirmed that TrfA-33 was able to load this lower level of P. putida helicase, but only in the presence of P. putida DnaA (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9), and that even with DnaA present, P. aeruginosa DnaB, at this lower concentration, could not be loaded by TrfA-33 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3).Fig. 2Activity of P. aeruginosa and P. putida DnaB helicase at the RK2 origin as measured by the FI* assay. Assays were performed in the presence of 50 ng of P. aeruginosa DnaB (lanes 1–6)or 100 ng of P. putida DnaB (lanes 7–12), the homologous DnaA protein (0, 200, or 600 ng indicated as –, +, or ++), and 300 ng of TrfA-33 or TrfA-44 as indicated. The positions of the FI* (covalently closed highly underwound), FI (covalently closed supercoiled), FII (open circular), and FIII (linear) forms of the template DNA are noted by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of the three TrfA-44 deletion mutant proteins to load P. aeruginosa or P. putida helicase onto RK2 oriV was then tested. As shown in Fig. 3, TrfA-44Δ4 (lanes 5) was fully functional with DnaB from P. aeruginosa (A) or P. putida (B). TrfA-44Δ3 (lanes 4) had reduced activity, particularly with P. putida DnaB, whereas TrfA-44Δ2 (lanes 3) was not functional with either helicase. Activity with TrfA-44Δ2 was not restored by the addition of P. aeruginosa DnaA to reactions containing P. aeruginosa DnaB but was restored by the addition of P. putida DnaA to reactions containing P. putida DnaB protein (data not shown).Fig. 3Ability of TrfA-44 N-terminal deletion mutants to load and activate the Pseudomonas DnaB helicase in the absence of DnaA.

FI* assays were performed in the presence of E. coli DnaA (80 ng), DnaB (1600 ng), and DnaC (200 ng) with 300 ng of wild type (wt) or mutant TrfA-44 proteins as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Point Mutation in TrfA-44 with Altered Helicase Loading Activity—The TrfA-44Δ2 mutant protein was deleted for 12 amino acids. To determine whether a specific amino acid within the deleted region was required for helicase loading, we constructed a specific point mutant. Reasoning that a charged and/or polar amino acid residue might be involved in the stabilization of a DnaB/TrfA-44 interaction, we replaced the glutamate residue at position 22 with alanine, yielding TrfA-44E22A. This change alters the charge and polarity at this position but not the helical nature of this region as predicted using PredictProtein.The TrfA-44E22A mutant protein was tested for helicase loading activity. This mutant protein, when added at 300 ng/assay, had slightly reduced activity when compared with wild type TrfA-44 protein with P. aeruginosa or P. putida DnaB (data not shown). This reduction in activity was more pronounced, particularly with P. putida DnaB, when the amount of TrfA protein added to each reaction was decreased to 200 ng/assay (Fig. 5), suggesting that the point mutant was also altered in helicase recruitment or loading. The TrfA-44E22A mutant protein behaved as the wild type protein at all concentrations tested in assays with E. coli DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC (data not shown).Fig. 5The effect of a point mutant of TrfA-44 on the loading and activation of Pseudomonas DnaB helicase at the RK2 replication origin.

Previously, we showed that, although E-cadherin lacking its cytoplasmic tail is active in aggregation assays, partially truncated E-cadherin lacking the carboxyl-terminal catenin-binding site is not. Contrary to this observation, a similar N-cadherin construct is found to be functional. Chimeric constructs, in which the membrane-proximal region of the partially truncated E-cadherin was replaced by that of N-cadherin, are active in aggregation assays. N-cadherin constructs in the opposite manner are nonfunctional. Although deletion of the membrane-proximal region, which eliminates the binding site for p120, results in activation of the nonfunctional E-cadherin mutant polypeptides, amino acid substitutions in the membrane-proximal region, which uncouple p120 binding, do not. The p120 uncoupling could not activate a full-length E-cadherin construct, which was β-catenin-uncoupled by amino acid substitutions in the catenin-binding site. These results indicate that the membrane-proximal region determines the activity of these cadherin constructs but that p120 does not seem directly involved in the modulation of E-cadherin activity.

The classic cadherins (e.g. E-, N-, and P-cadherins) are transmembrane proteins that function as Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules (1Takeichi M.

Ca2+ protects the extracellular domains of cadherins from proteolytic degradation, and this ion is necessary for their function. The extracellular domain of cadherins is responsible for specific homophilic binding (5Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), whereas the conserved carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain interacts with intracellular proteins termed catenins (6Ozawa M.

Each cadherin molecule can bind to either β-catenin or plakoglobin (γ-catenin), which in turn binds to α-catenin (9Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J.

These interactions link cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton.Partial truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, which removes the catenin-binding site from the domain, results in a loss of function, despite its continued expression on the cell surface (7Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 17Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M.

Cells expressing E-cadherin with further deletions that eliminate the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain showed E-cadherin-dependent aggregation (19Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, deletion of the membrane-proximal region results in activation of nonfunctional E-cadherin polypeptides. Consequently, it appears that the binding of the cadherin-catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton is not an absolute requirement for the binding activity.The capacity of the membrane-proximal portion of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain to negatively regulate its aggregation activity may be due to its interaction with an intracellular partner. Since p120, which was originally identified as a Src substrate, binds to the membrane-proximal region of cadherins (19Ozawa M. Kemler R. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), p120 has been suggested to play a role in regulating the adhesive activity of cadherins. p120 likely affects the strength of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion by influencing the dimerization or clustering of cadherins or by changing the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (23Aono S.

Similarly, a C-cadherin deletion mutant retaining a juxtamembrane 94-amino-acid region of the cytoplasmic tail expressed on CHO cells displays adhesive activity (21Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Although the observed differences between E-cadherin and VE- and C-cadherin may arise from the different cadherin subtypes analyzed in the different studies, this remains to be determined. Since the cell adhesion activity of cadherins is under the under the control of cell physiology such as protein phosphorylation (23Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the activity of any cadherin expressed on L cells and CHO cells could vary significantly.It has been shown that two major cadherins in endothelial cells, VE-cadherin and N-cadherin, are differentially targeted to membranes; i.e. VE-cadherin is clustered at cell-cell junctions, whereas N-cadherin remains diffusely distributed on the cell membrane (20Navarro P. Ruco L. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 28Salomon D. Ayalon O. Patel-King R. Hynes R.O. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 7-17PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane-proximal region of VE-cadherin has been shown to have the ability to exclude N-cadherin from intercellular junctions (20Navarro P. Ruco L. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the membrane-proximal region of each cadherin exhibits specific functional features depending on the subtype, despite a certain degree of homology.In this study, I expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged full-length, partially truncated, and tail-less N-cadherin constructs on L cells and found that each construct is active in aggregation assays. Since the partially truncated N-cadherin construct was designed to retain the cytoplasmic amino acid residues similar to that of the partially truncated nonfunctional E-cadherin construct, I wanted to know the biological basis for these functional differences. A similar amount of p120 is coprecipitated with these constructs. Substitution of residues in the nonfunctional E-cadherin construct with homologous residues from functional N-cadherin demonstrated that the region containing the p120-binding site is responsible for the suppression of aggregation of truncated E-cadherin. Uncoupling of p120 binding by amino acid substitutions did not confer adhesive function, however, raising the possibility that p120 is not directly involved in the modulation of cadherin activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Construction—A cDNA encoding full-length mouse E-cadherin was described previously (6Ozawa M.

An EcoRV site was created by PCR at the carboxyl-terminal site of the N-cadherin construct, using the following primers for full-length N-cadherin: NCF (5′-GAAGGGCTTCATGCCGGTACCATGTTGACAACA and 5′-ATCGTCATCACCTCCACCATACA); the partially truncated construct, NC91 (5′-GAAGGGCTTCATGCCGGTACCATGTTGACAACA and 5′-ATCAATGAAGTCCCCAATGTCTC); and the tail-less construct, NC0 (5′-GAAGGGCTTCATGCCGGTACCATGTTGACAACA and 5′-ATCCATCCATACCACAAACATCAG). The EcoRV site was used for ligation of the cDNA for these constructs with the unique EcoRV site upstream of the HA epitope sequence in the pCAGGSneo vector.cDNAs encoding two EC81-derived constructs whose cytoplasmic domain alone or together with the transmembrane domain were replaced by that of N-cadherin (E/NC91 or E/NTMC91, respectively) (see Fig. 1) were constructed by PCR (31Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19600-19608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For this, the following combinations of primers were used: E/NC91 (5′-TAAGAAACAGTAGGAGCAGCAGGAT and 5′-AGCGCCGGGATAAAGAACGCCAG), E/NTMC91 (5′-CGGCACTTGCAATCCTGCTGCCA and 5′-GCCATCATTGCCATCCTGCTCTG). Likewise, cDNAs encoding two NC91 constructs whose cytoplasmic domain or the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains were replaced by that of E-cadherin (N/EC81 or N/ETMC81, respectively) were constructed using the following primer combinations: N/EC81 (5′-GCATCCATACCACAAACATCAGCAC and 5′-GCAGGAGAACGGTGGTCAAAGAG), N/ETMC81 (5′-GCCGGTGCCAAGCCCCGCAC and 5′-GCCATCCTCGGAATCCTTGGA). Two constructs having partial replacements in the membrane-proximal region, EC88E/N and EC84N/E, were constructed using the following primer pairs: 5′-CTGGCTCAAATCAAAGTCCTGGTC and 5′-CTGCAGCAGCCTGACACTGTGG and 5′-CTGGCTCAAGTCATAGTCCTGGTC and 5′-CTGCACAGGGGCCTGGATGCC, respectively.Site-directed mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin was performed as described above using the following primer pairs. To mutate a conserved triple glycine sequence to alanines (GA mutation) or a Glu-Glu-Asp sequence to alanines (EA mutation) (see Fig. 2), primer pairs 5′-GGCTTCTTCATCATAGTAATACACATT and 5′-GCGGCAGAAGAAGACCAGGACTT and 5′-GGCTCCACCTCCTTCTTCATCATA and 5′-GCGGCCCAGGACTTTGATTTGAG were used, respectively. To generate the S8A mutant, 3 serine residues were first changed to alanine residues using following primers (5′-ACCAGCGCCCTCGTAATCGAACA and 5′-CCGCTGAGGCGGATCAGGACCAGGACTA), and then the remaining 5 serine residues were changed to alanine residues using following primers: 5′-CGCTGCTGCTTCAGCACCAGCGCCCTCGTAAT and 5′-CTAGCAGCACTTAATGCCGCTGAGGCGGATCA. All PCR products were sequenced and cloned into expression vectors.Fig. 2Amino acid sequence of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain.

A mouse mAb (12CA5) directed against HA was kindly provided by Dr. A. Yoshimura (Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan) and used for screening of positive clones for the expression of HA-tagged constructs by immunoblotting. A rat mAb against HA (3F10) was purchased from Roche Applied Science and used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. A rabbit anti-N-cadherin antibody (H-63) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used for immunoblotting.Cells and Transfection—Mouse fibroblast L-tk- cells and their transfectants were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To obtain transfectants, appropriate expression vectors (5 μg) were introduced into L cells (5 × 105) by the calcium phosphate method (6Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). After selection in medium containing G418, single colonies were isolated and analyzed for expression of the constructs by immunoblot analysis using anti-HA (12CA5 or 3F10), anti-E-cadherin (DECMA-1), and anti-N-cadherin (H-63) antibodies.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were carried out as described previously (24Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (2 × 106) were cultured in 60-mm tissue culture dishes at 37 °C for 24 h and lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. The HA-tagged proteins were collected with either rat anti-HA mAb or rabbit anti-E-cadherin antibodies, which had been preabsorbed to protein G-agarose (Sigma). The immune complex was washed with the same buffer three times and then boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Cell Aggregation Assay—Cell aggregation assays were performed as described previously (7Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.01% trypsin (type XI, Sigma) and 2 mm CaCl2. After the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), the cells were washed, resuspended, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with constant rotation at 70 rpm.Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence staining of cells was performed as described previously (24Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm NH4Cl, the cells were soaked in a blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal calf serum) for 15 min and then incubated with DECMA-1 diluted with the blocking solution for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were analyzed on a conventional Olympus fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera CoolSNAP (Nippon Roper). Clustering was defined as one or several intense spots or regions of fluorescence on the cell surface. Cells that displayed a homogeneous distribution of fluorescence throughout the membrane were recorded as negative for clustering. In each experiment, the presence or absence of clustering in at least 100 randomly chosen cells was scored.RESULTSPartial Cytoplasmic Truncation of E-cadherin, but Not N-cadherin, Inhibits Cell Aggregation—E-cadherin and N-cadherin constructs encoding full-length proteins (ECF or NCF) (Fig. 1), partially truncated constructs lacking the catenin-binding region (EC81 or NC91), or constructs lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain (EC0 or NC0) were introduced into L cells, and stable transfectants were established. E-cadherin has a cytoplasmic domain of 151 amino acid residues, and N-cadherin of has a cytoplasmic domain of 160 residues. Alignment of amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of EC81 and NC91 shows that there are insertions of 10 amino acid residues in the NC91 sequence, but there is a certain degree of identity (Fig. 2). Since all the constructs are tagged with an HA epitope, the relative expression of the different constructs can be directly compared. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates of L cells expressing these constructs with anti-HA showed similar levels of expression (Fig. 3A). As was reported previously (31Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19600-19608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), L cells expressing EC81, with a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 70 amino acid residues eliminating the catenin-binding site but retaining the membrane-proximal region, showed almost no aggregation (Fig. 4). Cells expressing EC0, with the further deletion of 151 amino acid residues, showed Ca2+-dependent aggregation. These results confirm our previous observations that deletion of the membrane-proximal region results in the activation of nonfunctional E-cadherin polypeptides (19Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Contrary to the observations with E-cadherin, all three N-cadherin constructs, NCF, NC91, and NC0, are active in aggregation assays (Fig. 4). These results surprised me and prompted me to explore why NC91 is active but EC81 is not.Fig. 3A similar amount of p120 co-precipitates with nonfunctional EC81 and functional NC91 proteins.

L cells expressing different E-cadherin and N-cadherin constructs shown in Fig. 1 were dissociated by trypsinization (0.01%) in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and were allowed to aggregate for 30 min either in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 or in the presence of 5 mm EGTA.

ECFL, L cells expressing full-length E-cadherin; NCFL, L cells expressing full-length N-cadherin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)I postulated that the inability of EC81 to mediate cell adhesion could be ascribed to the association of p120 to the protein (24Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To identify whether NC91 is associated with p120 or not, L cells expressing EC81 or NC91 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-p120 (Fig. 3B). p120 was detected in both EC81 and NC91 immunoprecipitates. Coprecipitation of similar amounts of p120 in EC81 and NC91 indicates that there is not a substantial difference between the degree of association of p120 with these constructs. The amount of p120 associated with these constructs cannot explain the differences in aggregation activity of the E- and N-cadherin constructs.EC81 Constructs Substituted by the Cytoplasmic Domain of NC91 Are Active—To define the molecular domain responsible for the suppressed activity of EC81, I prepared a series of EC81 or NC91 cytoplasmic domain chimeric constructs (Fig. 1). These constructs were introduced into L cells, and stable clones were isolated. Aggregation assays of L cell clones expressing these constructs revealed that constructs having the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin (E/NC91 and E/NTMC91), like NC91, are active in the assays, whereas the constructs having the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (EC81, N/EC81, and N/ETMC81) are not (Fig. 4).Lack of activity does not seem to be due to failed cell surface transport because immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that all constructs are expressed on the cell surface (data not shown). Trypsin digestion (0.01%) in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, which would remove all Ca2+ from the system, revealed that significant portions of these constructs were degraded and thus were expressed on cell surfaces (Fig. 5A). In the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, these constructs were protected from trypsin and remained on the surface after digestion.Fig. 5Cell surface expression of the E-cadherin and N-cadherin constructs. In A, cells expressing EC81 and NC91 and their derivatives were incubated with 0.01% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ (TC) or 1 mm EGTA (TE). Proteins were detected by anti-HA mAb (3F10). The slowly migrating protein bands correspond to the intracellular, incompletely processed proteins having the precursor segment. In B, cells expressing EC81 and its derivatives were incubated with 0.01% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ (TC) or 1 mm EGTA (TE). Proteins were detected by anti-E-cadherin mAb (DECMA-1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To know the association status of these constructs with p120, these constructs were collected by immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies, and coprecipitated-p120 was detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6A). No difference in the amount of coprecipitated p120 was detected among the active and inactive constructs, indicating that the degree of p120 association with these constructs is similar, if not identical.Fig. 6Coprecipitation of p120 with partially truncated nonfunctional and functional cadherin constructs except for p120-uncoupled constructs. In A, materials collected by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA mAb from L cell transfectants expressing EC81, NC91, and their derivatives were detected by HA and p120 antibodies. In B, materials collected by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-E-cadherin antiserum from L cell transfectants expressing EC81 and its derivatives were detected by anti-E-cadherin and anti-p120 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To define the region involved in suppression of the adhesion activity of EC81, two additional constructs, EC88E/N and EC84N/E, were prepared. EC88E/N has a cytoplasmic domain composed of residues 1-41 of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and residues 45-91 of the N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain. EC84N/E has a cytoplasmic domain composed of residues 1-44 of the N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and residues 42-81 of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). These constructs were introduced into L cells, and stable transfectants were isolated. Aggregation assays with L cell clones expressing these constructs revealed that EC84N/E is active in the assays, whereas EC88E/N is inactive (Fig. 4). These constructs were expressed on the surface, as shown by the sensitivity of the protein to trypsin digestion in the absence of Ca2+ but not in its presence (Fig. 5B). Similar amounts of p120 coprecipitated with the constructs, as revealed by immunoblot analysis with anti-p120 antibodies of the material immunoprecipitated with anti-E-cadherin ("
https://openalex.org/W1968344845,"Members of the enolase mechanistically diverse superfamily catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions that are related by a common mechanistic feature, the abstraction of a proton adjacent to a carboxylate group. Recent investigations into the function and mechanism of the phosphosulfolactate synthase encoded by the ComA gene in Methanococcus jannaschii have suggested that ComA, which catalyzes the stereospecific Michael addition of sulfite to phosphoenolpyruvate to form phosphosulfolactate, may be a member of the enolase superfamily. The ComA-catalyzed reaction, the first step in the coenzyme M biosynthetic pathway, likely proceeds via a Mg2+ ion-stabilized enolate intermediate in a manner similar to that observed for members of the enolase superfamily. ComA, however, has no significant sequence similarity to any known enolase. Here we report the x-ray crystal structure of ComA to 1.7-Å resolution. The overall fold for ComA is an (α/β)8 barrel that assembles with two other ComA molecules to form a trimer in which three active sites are created at the subunit interfaces. From the positions of two ordered sulfate ions in the active site, a model for the binding of phosphoenolpyruvate and sulfite is proposed. Despite its mechanistic similarity to the enolase superfamily, the overall structure and active site architecture of ComA are unlike any member of the enolase superfamily, which suggests that ComA is not a member of the enolase superfamily but instead acquired an enolase-type mechanism through convergent evolution.

Mechanistically diverse superfamilies consist of groups of homologous enzymes that catalyze a wide variety of reactions related by a common mechanistic feature (1Gerlt J.A. Babbitt P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 209-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). When a new protein sequence can be ascribed to a superfamily, the function and mechanism of the enzyme can often be predicted, even for novel enzyme reactions (2Schmidt D.M. Hubbard B.K. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15707-15715Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There are several well studied mechanistically diverse enzyme superfamilies, some of which may possess hundreds of members, each related to one another by a common mechanistic thread (1Gerlt J.A. Babbitt P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 209-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 3Gerlt J.A. Raushel F.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Understanding the breadth of these superfamilies will be essential to interpret the vast number of sequences identified by high throughput genome sequencing projects.The enolase superfamily is a particularly well studied mechanistically diverse superfamily whose members catalyze diverse reactions that involve the abstraction of a weakly acidic proton (4Babbitt P.C. Hasson M.S. Wedekind J.E. Palmer D.R. Barrett W.C. Reed G.H. Rayment I. Ringe D. Kenyon G.L. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16489-16501Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Each enzyme in this superfamily catalyzes a reaction that proceeds via an enolate intermediate that is derived from the abstraction of an α-proton from a carboxylate substrate that is stabilized by one or more Mg2+ ions in the active site.The x-ray crystal structures of several enolase superfamily members have been solved. In all cases identified to date, these enzymes are constructed of a central (α/β)8 barrel domain and an α+β domain that is usually built from sequence at both the N and C termini (5Landro J.A. Gerlt J.A. Kozarich J.W. Koo C.W. Shah V.J. Kenyon G.L. Neidhart D.J. Fujita S. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Hasson M.S. Schlichting I. Moulai J. Taylor K. Barrett W. Kenyon G.L. Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10396-10401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Helin S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4349-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The (α/β)8 barrel domain contains the residues that act as ligands for the metal ion as well as those involved in acid/base catalysis. The α+β domain “caps” the active site at the C-terminal end of the barrel domain and has been proposed to confer substrate specificity on the individual members of the enolase superfamily (9Thompson T.B. Garrett J.B. Taylor E.A. Meganathan R. Gerlt J.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10662-10676Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A comparison of the active sites of enolase superfamily members has shown that a triad of conserved aspartate and glutamate residues usually coordinates an essential metal ion found in the active site (4Babbitt P.C. Hasson M.S. Wedekind J.E. Palmer D.R. Barrett W.C. Reed G.H. Rayment I. Ringe D. Kenyon G.L. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16489-16501Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).Members of the enolase superfamily have been assigned to one of three subgroups named after their enzyme prototypes: mandelate racemase, muconate lactonizing enzyme, and enolase (10Babbitt P.C. Mrachko G.T. Hasson M.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Kenyon G.L. Gerlt J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 1159-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A key feature that delineates members of each subgroup is the identity of the residues that serve as the general base(s) for proton abstraction. In the case of the mandelate racemase subgroup, either a conserved lysine residue or a conserved histidine residue carries out this function. In the muconate lactonizing enzyme subgroup, two conserved lysine residues function as the general base(s), and in the enolase subgroup, one conserved lysine performs this function. Membership in one of these subgroups can be used to help infer enzyme function and mechanism, in some cases before biochemical evidence exists. For example, on the basis of sequence similarity to known members of the muconate lactonizing enzyme subgroup, two novel Bacillus subtilis enzymes were identified as l-Ala-d/l-Glu epimerases that catalyzed 1,1-proton transfer reactions (2Schmidt D.M. Hubbard B.K. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15707-15715Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Since many members of the enolase superfamily share less than 15% sequence similarity, it is possible that more distantly related members may exist that have not yet been identified. One potentially unrecognized member of this superfamily is the Methanococcus jannaschii phosphosulfolactate synthase (ComA) or (2R)-O-phospho-3-sulfolactate sulfolyase (EC 4.4.1.19). Although this enzyme catalyzes an enolase-type reaction, the Mg2+ ion-dependent nucleophilic addition of sulfite to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 1The abbreviation used is: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.1The abbreviation used is: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. it has no PEP hydratase (enolase) activity and has no significant sequence similarity to members of the enolase superfamily (11Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13421-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since many members of the enolase superfamily share only 15% or less sequence identity, there is the possibility that ComA is a distantly related enolase superfamily member. Alternatively, ComA may not be an enolase homologue at all, but has instead evolved an enolase-type mechanism independently as the result of convergent evolution.Little is known about the mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by phosphosulfolactate synthase, which generates R-phosphosulfolactate by the stereospecific Michael addition of sulfite to phosphoenolpyruvate as the first step in coenzyme M biosynthesis (Scheme 1) (12Graham D.E. White R.H. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The lack of sequence similarity to any known enzyme makes inferences on the basis of sequence similarity difficult. Furthermore, with the exception of the SQD1/SqdB proteins in plants (13Sanda S. Leustek T. Theisen M.J. Garavito R.M. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which catalyze the addition of sulfite to UDP-glucose, no examples of sulfite chemistry in nature have been described.Deuterium exchange experiments show that ComA catalyzes the exchange of the C2 proton of the product, R-phosphosulfolactate, which suggests that the reaction proceeds through an enolate intermediate (11Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13421-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism would involve the nucleophilic addition of sulfite to an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid at the C3 position of phosphoenolpyruvate to generate an enolate anion intermediate. Like enolase, ComA requires the presence of Mg2+ for activity, which is presumably involved in the stabilization of the enolate intermediate. A general acid in the active site would protonate the re face of PEP to generate the product, R-phosphosulfolactate, in a stereospecific manner.ComA from the hyperthermophile M. jannaschii consists of 251 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 28,368. A sequence comparison shows that very few amino acid residues are strictly conserved among phosphosulfolactate synthase homologues except for a small number of aspartate and glutamate residues, some of which likely function as ligands for the metal ion (Asp40, Glu103, Glu133, Glu168, Glu171 and Glu205). In addition, two lysine residues, Lys43 and Lys137, are strictly conserved and may function as catalytic acids or be involved in sulfite binding. Some evidence exists that Lys137 may act as the catalytic acid that protonates the enolate intermediate. A K137N mutant was unable to catalyze the phosphosulfolactate synthase reaction or catalyze proton exchange at the C2 position, which would suggest that it plays a role in the protonation of the intermediate (11Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13421-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The lack of any structural information about phosphosulfolactate synthase has made it difficult to understand its reaction mechanism or to understand its relationship to other members of the enolase superfamily. While the evidence indicates that the phosphosulfolactate synthase reaction is mechanistically similar to that of enolase, it is unclear whether the two enzymes are homologous but highly divergent or are the result of convergent evolution in which an enolase-type mechanism evolved separately. To address these questions, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of phosphosulfolactate synthase from M. jannaschii to 1.7 Å resolution.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Expression and Purification—M. jannaschii ComA protein was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (11Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13421-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by anion exchange chromatography over DEAE-Sepharose resin. The protein was concentrated to 15 mg/ml, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80 °C.Crystallization—Crystals of ComA were grown by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method from a well solution containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm succinate at pH 4.4. Crystals grew to dimensions of ∼150 μm after a few days. They belong to the cubic space group P213 with cell dimensions a = b = c = 94 Å. Crystals were transferred to a cryo-protecting solution similar to the original growth conditions but containing 15% ethylene glycol for ∼30 s and were flash-frozen by placing them in a stream of nitrogen prior to diffraction experiments.A platinum derivative for phasing purposes was prepared by soaking ComA crystals in a solution identical to the cryo-protecting solution that contained 5 mm K2PtCl4 for ∼12 h. Crystals were flash-frozen by placing them in a stream of nitrogen prior to data collection.Data Collection and Structure Determination—A native data set to 1.7-Å resolution was collected at beamline 14-BM of the Consortium for Advanced Radiation Sources at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL) using a single 90° scan of 0.7° oscillations.

The overall fold of the protein is an (α/β)8 barrel (TIM barrel) composed of eight parallel β-strands flanked by eight α-helices (Fig. 2). An N-terminal tail, formed from the first 13 residues, extends away from the barrel. While this tail is well ordered and clearly visible in the electron density, it is largely devoid of any well defined secondary structure elements. A shorter C-terminal tail, which contains a small 3:10 helical region, also extends away from the body of the barrel itself. In addition, several ordered secondary structural elements are inserted into the classic TIM barrel fold, including a short stretch of 3:10 helix after helix two and a long α-helix between β-strand three and helix three.Fig. 2Ribbon representation of the ComA monomer found in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The figure was prepared with the program Ribbons (23Carson M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part B. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref Scopus (654) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structure of ComA Trimer—On the basis of a large buried surface area of ∼1800 Å2 between the ComA monomer and each of two other monomers related by a crystallographic 3-fold axis, the biological assembly of ComA was concluded to be a trimer. This observation corroborates the results of gel filtration experiments that suggested that the enzyme assembles as a trimer (11Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13421-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The three barrels in the trimer are oriented so that the C-terminal ends of each barrel faces roughly into the 3-fold axis (Fig. 3). Extensive interactions between the individual subunits in the trimer stabilize the oligomeric state. Side chains from residues located on the N- and C-terminal tails that extend away from the barrel form extensive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with residues located on the two extra helices inserted into the (α/β)8 fold, located after β-strands two and three of the adjacent barrel in the trimer. Additional contacts are also made between these extra helical regions and helices seven and eight of the adjacent barrel.Fig. 3Ribbon representation of the ComA trimer. The view is looking straight down the crystallographic 3-fold axis. The locations of the three active sites are indicated by the locations of the two ordered phosphate ions shown in ball-and-stick form. Each active site lies at a subunit interface so that two subunits contribute to each active site. The figure was prepared using the program Ribbons (23Carson M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part B. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref Scopus (654) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ComA Active Site—The location of the enzyme active site was deduced from the location of a cluster of residues that are highly conserved in all known ComA homologues. This cluster of residues, which includes several glutamate and lysine residues, is found in a pocket formed by the interface of two subunits in the trimer. Thus, three active sites are created per trimer. Each active site is constructed primarily of residues from a single subunit but the other subunit at each interface also contributes a few key residues to the active site. The third subunit in the trimer does not contribute any residues to a given active site.The side chains of several residues that are likely important for catalysis, including four conserved glutamate residues, are found clustered together in the active site. The first of these residues, Glu103, is found at the end of the fourth β-strand and is strictly conserved across all known ComA homologues. The remaining three, Glu133, Glu168, and Glu205, which are found at the ends of the fifth, sixth, and seventh β-strands, are highly conserved across almost all known ComA homologues. Given the location and arrangement of these conserved residues, it is likely that some or all of these are involved in the coordination of the metal ion required for catalysis. No metal ion was observed in the active site, however, so that the exact identity of the ligands for any Mg2+ ions in the active site could not be determined. Presumably the high concentrations of sulfate found in the crystal growth conditions chelated any free Mg2+ ions in solution and prevented them from binding in the enzyme active site.Two ordered sulfate ions are present in the active site. The first (SA) is located toward the back of the active site pocket so that it is essentially buried from the solvent. This sulfate ion forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Lys43, Lys137, and Thr76 (Fig. 4). Additional contacts are made with the backbone amide hydrogen atoms of Thr76 and Trp46. The second sulfate ion (SB), which is more solvent exposed, is coordinated by the side chain of Arg170, the main chain amide hydrogen atom of Glu171, and the side chain or Arg244′ from the second subunit in the active site. The side chain of Arg244′, which is located on the C-terminal tail region, participates in a stacking interaction with the indole side chain of Trp46. The nitrogen of the Trp46 side chain, in turn, forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the side chain of Thr238′ from the second subunit in the active site. As mentioned above, Trp46 was observed to be in a strained conformation, which suggests that the position of the indole ring and the interactions it makes with residues from the second monomer might be critical for active site assembly at the interface and the orientation of the Arg244′ side chain.Fig. 4Stereo view of the ComA active site and sample electron density. The subunit that makes up most of the active site is shown in lavender. Side chains from residues from this subunit are shown in green. The other subunit is shown in yellow. The two ordered sulfate ions each make several contacts with conserved active site residues. The more solvent exposed sulfate ion (SB) forms contacts with residues from both subunits at the interface, while the buried sulfate ion (SA) makes contacts with only the major subunit in the active site interface. The positions of several conserved glutamate residues, which are believed to serve as ligands for the Mg2+ ions, are shown. Electron density for selected active site residues is shown from a 2F o - F c map contoured at 1 σ. The figure was prepared using the program Ribbons (23Carson M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part B. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref Scopus (654) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Model for Binding of PEP—Numerous attempts were made to obtain crystals of ComA with a substrate, product, or substrate analogue in the active site either by soaking ComA crystals or co-crystallizing ComA with these various compounds. Unfortunately, diffraction quality crystals were not obtained. Given the extensive contacts made between the two sulfate ions and conserved residues in the active site, however, it is likely that these two sulfate ions are bound in positions analogous to those of the phosphate group of PEP and sulfite.While it is difficult to know for certain which sulfate ion is analogous to the phosphoryl group of PEP and which is analogous to sulfite, only the deeper buried sulfate ion has sufficient space around it to accommodate phosphoenolpyruvate. Accordingly, PEP can be modeled into the active site by overlaying the phosphate group on top of the sulfate ion that is more deeply buried in the active site (SA). The most plausible orientation for the molecule places the phosphate group of PEP near the side chains of Glu103 and Glu133. In this orientation, a Mg2+ ion, bound by the side chains of Glu103 and Glu133, could bind to an oxygen atom on the phosphate group of PEP and one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group of PEP (Fig. 5). This Mg2+ ion would function to assist in the binding of PEP by offsetting the negatively charged phosphate group. The carboxyl group of PEP would lie near the side chains of Glu168 and Glu205. These two side chains might function to bind a second Mg2+ ion that could serve to coordinate the two oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group of PEP. The use of two Mg2+ ions to bind PEP is consistent with biochemical evidence that suggests several molar equivalents of Mg2+ bind to PEP in the active site (11Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13421-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Such an arrangement would be similar to that seen in the active site of enolase (8Larsen T.M. Wedekind J.E. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4349-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Faller L.D. Baroudy B.M. Johnson A.M. Ewall R.X.

The negative charges of the phosphate group and the carboxylate group of PEP are offset by two Mg2+ ions. Several conserved aspartate residues in the active site are proposed to act as ligands for the two Mg2+ ions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download ("

Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of mt translation or about the expression of mt translation factors. Here, we studied the expression of mt translation factors during 12-O-tetradecanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells. For all mt translation factors investigated, mRNA expression was markedly down-regulated in a coordinate and specific manner, whereas mRNA levels for the cytoplasmic translation factors showed only a slight reduction. An actinomycin D chase study and nuclear run-on assay revealed that the TPA-induced decrease in mt elongation factor Tu (EF-Tumt) mRNA mainly results from decreased mRNA stability. Polysome analysis showed that there was no significant translational control of mt translation factor (EF-Tumt, ribosomal proteins L7/L12mt and S12mt) mRNA expression during differentiation. Thus, the decreased protein level of one of these mt translation factors (EF-Tumt) simply reflects its decreased mRNA level. It was also demonstrated by pulse labeling of mt translation products that the down-regulation of mt translational activity is actually associated with down-regulated mt translation factor expression during cellular differentiation. Our results illustrate that the regulatory mechanisms of mt translational activity upon terminal differentiation (in response to the growth arrest) is different to that of the cytoplasmic system, where the control of mRNA translational efficiency of major translation factors is the central mechanism for their down-regulation.

The coordination of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic systems in the cell is necessary for proper mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular functioning. However, little is known either about the control of mitochondrial translation activity or about the regulatory mechanisms governing the expression of mammalian mitochondrial translation factors. As a first step toward understanding the integrated processes that regulate mitochondrial translation we studied the expression of mt translation factors during TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, is one of the best studied models of cell differentiation (16Birnie G.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 58: 41-45Google Scholar, 17Tsiftsoglou A. Robinson S. Stem Cells. 1985; 3: 349-366Google Scholar). This line comprises 90–95% of cells with myeloblastic/promyelocytic morphology. A variety of agents can induce differentiation of these cells either to granulocyte-like (dimethyl sulfoxide) or to monocyte/macrophage-like (TPA or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) cells (16Birnie G.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 58: 41-45Google Scholar). The effects of TPA are thought to be due in part to the activation of protein kinase Cβ (18Tonetti D. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Macfarlane D. Manzel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4327-4331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of differentiation by TPA in HL-60 cells is associated with activation of the stress-activated protein kinase, mitochondrial swelling, permeability transition, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases, and ultimately the induction of apoptosis (20Ito Y. Mishra N.C. Yoshida K. Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Kufe D. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Laouar A. Glesne D. Huberman E. Mol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3941-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate down-regulation of the mt translation system during terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells by TPA. In contrast to cytoplasmic translation factors, which are down-regulated at the level of mRNA translation during terminal differentiation (in response to the growth arrest), the regulation of stability and transcription rather than translational efficiency of mRNA is crucial for gene expression of mt translation factors. The biological significance of down-regulating the mt translation system during terminal differentiation is also discussed. Cells and Culture Conditions—The HL-60-rapid growth (RG) derivative of the HL-60 cell line was used throughout the study (a gift from Dr. T. Yamaguchi, National Institute of Health Sciences). Because its DNA profiling and sensitivity to TPA-induced differentiation are almost the same as that of the parental HL-60 cell line, we chose HL-60RG to take advantage of its rapid growth rate (normal doubling time, 24 h). Cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen) in the presence of penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 unit/ml). Cells were routinely passaged twice weekly to a density of 0.2–1.0 × 106 cells/ml and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Induction of differentiation (20 ml of 4 × 105 cells/ml for 150-mm plate) into monocyte/macrophage-like cells was achieved by the addition of 50 nm TPA (Sigma). After a 48-h exposure to TPA, proliferation was arrested, and almost all the cells adhered to the plastic dishes in the form of aggregates; they subsequently spread out and acquired a spindle-shaped morphology and prominent pseudopodia. This series of events was confirmed microscopically in all experiments. RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using ISOGEN (Nippongene). RNA (10–20 μg/sample) was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and then UV-cross-linked to the membrane. The membrane was prehybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in ExpressHyb (Clontech) and then hybridized in fresh ExpressHyb with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe at 1–2 × 106 cpm/ml and salmon sperm DNA at 20 μg/ml overnight (or for 2 nights for rare RNA species) at 68 °C. The membrane was washed with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.05% SDS at 68 °C and then with 0.1× SSC - 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Membranes were analyzed by autoradiography and quantified using a BAS5000 analyzer (Fuji Film). The radiolabeled cDNA probes for Northern blots were prepared by random priming with a BcaBEST labeling kit (TAKARA). For analysis of mt transcripts (Fig. 1, 16 S, cytochrome c oxidase II (COII) and COIII), DNA templates were obtained by PCR of isolated HL-60RG total DNA. For analysis of nuclear transcripts (Fig. 1 remaining samples), template DNAs were amplified either by RT-PCR using HL-60RG total RNA and oligo-dT primers or by PCR of plasmids containing the objective sequences.

For differentiated cells, the ActD chase was initiated as follows. After 48 h of exposure to TPA, the culture medium was aspirated off to remove unattached cells and replaced with a new medium containing ActD (5 μg/ml). Total RNA was isolated from cells at the indicated time points and subjected to Northern analysis. Nuclear Run-on Transcription Assay—Isolation of nuclei, run-on transcription, and hybridization were performed essentially as described in Greenberg and Bender (23Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.10.1-4.10.11Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Approximately 1 × 108 growing (4 × 105 cells/ml) and differentiated (50 nm TPA, 48 h) HL-60RG cells were harvested and washed using ice-cold PBS. Before harvesting differentiated HL-60RG cells, unattached cells were carefully removed by washing twice with PBS. Cell pellets were lysed in 3.6 ml of ice-cold sucrose buffer I (0.32 m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and 3.6 ml of ice-cold sucrose buffer II (2 m sucrose, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added to the nuclei before they were collected in 4 ml of sucrose buffer II in a SW41Ti tube (Beckman Instruments). After centrifugation (45 min at 30,000 × g, 4 °C), the nuclear pellet was resuspended in glycerol storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 40% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) at a concentration of 5 × 107 nuclei/200 μl, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. For run-on transcription, 200-μl aliquots of frozen nuclei were added to 200 μl of a reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 100 μCi of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences)) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The mixture was treated with 100 units of RNase-free DNase I for 10 min at 30 °C, then further incubated with 400 μl of proteinase K solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml proteinase K) for 30 min at 42 °C. After phenol/CHCl3 extraction, transcripts were precipitated with isopropanol. The RNA was again treated with DNase I, proteinase K, phenol/CHCl3 extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Labeled RNA was dissolved in 50 μl TES (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS). Approximately 2 × 107 cpm of labeled RNA was reproducibly obtained from 1 × 108 growing cells and 1.5 × 107 cpm from the same amount of differentiated cells. Linearized plasmid constructs (10 μg) containing the relevant cDNA were alkali-denatured and immobilized onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was carried out in 2 ml of ULTRA Hyb (Ambion) with 2 × 107 cpm of radiolabeled RNA and salmon sperm DNA at 100 μg/ml over 2 nights at 50 °C with rotation. The membrane was washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and unhybridized RNA was finally removed with 10 μg/ml RNase A in 2× SSC (37 °C, 30 min). Membranes were analyzed using a BAS5000 analyzer (Fuji Film). We confirmed that the intensity of the actin signal was linearly obtained using 4 × 106–2 × 107 cpm of radiolabeled transcripts. The plasmids containing β-actin and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene were prepared as follows. Part of the β-actin and MPO cDNA sequences were amplified by RT-PCR of HL-60RG total RNA with the oligo-dT primer and the primers described in Table I. DNA fragments were cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen). pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ (Invitrogen) and hEF-Tumt/pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ were used for the detection of human EF-Tumt transcripts. Immunoblot Assay for Mitochondrial Protein—Growing (4 × 105 cells/ml) and differentiated HL-60RG cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After 30 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was recovered and stored at –80 °C. Total protein concentration of the lysate was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay; the proteins (10–50 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 22 °C for 1 h before incubation with a human EF-Tu/Ts mt polyclonal antibody (1: 1000; anti-rabbit) or human COII monoclonal antibody (1:1000; anti-mouse, Molecular Probes) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (or mouse) immunoglobulin G (1:4000; Amersham Biosciences); the protein was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by LAS-plus (Fuji Film). The blots were also probed with a human monoclonal β-actin antibody (1:5000; Sigma) as a control for loading. Pulse Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products—Labeling of mt translation products was performed as described in Hayashi et al. (24Hayashi J.I. Ohta S. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. Sakuta R. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled for 60 min at 37 °C in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and 100 μg/ml emetine. Cell pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (2% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7)) and sonicated, and total cellular protein (100 μg) was loaded and separated on Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% (w/v); acrylamide/bis-acrylamide = 32:1) gels. Radiolabeled mitochondrial proteins were analyzed by autoradiography and quantified using a BAS5000 analyzer (Fuji Film). Polysome Analysis—Fractionation of HL-60RG polysomes and isolation of RNA contained in the fractions was carried out using a modification of a published protocol (25Ruan H. Brown C.Y. Morris D.R. Richter J.D. mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 305-321Crossref Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 107 cells were used for each gradient (growing cells, 4 × 105 cells/ml; differentiated cells, 50 nm TPA, 48 h). Before harvesting, cells were incubated with the medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 5 min and washed twice with PBS (containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide). Cell pellets was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.04 m sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 units of RNase inhibitor and lysed by incubation on ice for 10 min with occasional shaking. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The lysate was layered on top of a 11-ml 15–50% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor for 2 h 15 min at 4 °C. Gradients were separated into 12 equal fractions using a density gradient fractionator (Towa Labo, Model 152–001) while monitoring absorbance at 260 nm. Each fraction was treated with proteinase K, and RNA was extracted by phenol/CHCl3, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed for each mRNA species. L19 and β-actin mRNAs were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using oligo-dT primers. The number of amplification cycles in PCR was optimized to maintain the PCR reaction within the linear range. Primers used for PCR are summarized in Table I. EF-Tumt, L7/L12mt, and S12mt mRNAs were detected by Northern blotting. Mitochondrial Translation Factor mRNAs Are Markedly Down-regulated in a Coordinate and Specific Manner during TPA-induced Differentiation of HL-60 Cells—Despite a myriad of recent studies on gene expression during TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells using both DNA microarray (26Zheng X. Ravatn R. Lin Y. Shih W.-C. Rabson A. Strair R. Huberman E. Conney A. Chin K.-V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4489-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Juan H.F. Lin J.Y. Chang W.H. Wu C.Y. Pan T.L. Tseng M.J. Khoo K.H. Chen S.T. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 2490-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and differential display methods (28Krichevsky A.M. Metzer E. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14295-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), little is known about the expression of mt translation factors. It is possible that the results obtained to date might be ambiguous due to the low levels of these mRNAs or because some objective genes were absent from the DNA arrays. We initially analyzed mRNA levels of several mt translation factors by Northern hybridization. This revealed that differentiation of HL-60RG cells by TPA promotes coordinate reduction of the mRNA level for all mt translation factors investigated (Fig. 1A). Nuclear-coded genes, i.e. initiation factor 2 (IF-2mt), elongation factor Tu (EF-Tumt), elongation factor Ts (EF-Tsmt), methionyl-tRNA transformylase (MTFmt), methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRSmt), and ribosomal proteins S12mt and L7/L12mt were reduced by ∼10–20-fold, whereas mtDNA-coded 16 S rRNA was down-regulated to a lesser extent (∼5-fold) (Fig. 1A, 16 S rRNA). Similar results were confirmed with the HL-60 cell line (data not shown). In contrast we observed only a slight reduction of mRNA expression for the cytoplasmic (cyt) translation factor, ribosomal protein L19 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, others also observed, using DNA microarray technology, that mRNA levels of some cyt translation factors (such as elongation factor 1α, ribosomal proteins S27 and L27a) are not down-regulated during this differentiation process (27Juan H.F. Lin J.Y. Chang W.H. Wu C.Y. Pan T.L. Tseng M.J. Khoo K.H. Chen S.T. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 2490-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, mt translation factor mRNAs appear to be specifically down-regulated in a stringent manner during TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and NRF-2) govern the transcription of many, but not all, nuclear-coded mt genes (29Scarpulla R.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 30Scarpulla R.C. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 2002; 1576: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). mtDNA-coded mRNAs are also downstream of NRFs, since their transcription is governed by Tfam (mt transcription factor a), whose transcription itself is governed by NRF-1 (31Virbasius J. Scarpulla R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of both NRF-1 and NRF-2α were significantly decreased by TPA-induced differentiation, and thus, the mt oxidative phosphorylation-related genes COII, cytochrome c oxidase III (COIII), and F1-ATP synthetase β subunit (F1-ATPase-β) also declined, as was expected (Fig. 1, C and D). Furthermore, previous studies reported that the DNA binding activity of NRF1 is growth-regulated (32Herzig R.P. Scacco S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13134-13141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and that expression of L7/L12mt mRNA is regulated in a growth-dependent manner (33Marty L. Fort P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11468-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results suggest that most mt genes are coordinately down-regulated, at least at a transcriptional level, through NRFs either in a direct or indirect manner in response to growth arrest that is associated with terminal differentiation. In agreement with this, another nuclear-coded mt mRNA, mt heat shock protein 70 (mt Hsp70), is also down-regulated after TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells (34Xu J. Xiao H.H. Sartorelli A.C. Oncol. Res. 1999; 11: 429-435PubMed Google Scholar). TPA-induced Decrease in EF-Tumt mRNA Results Mainly from the Decreased mRNA Stability—It is noteworthy that the extent of mRNA reduction is much more profound for mt translation factors than for other mt-related transcripts (Fig. 1, A and D). This indicates that decreased stability as well as the decreased transcription rate of mt translation factor mRNA contributes to their marked down-regulation during TPA-induced differentiation. To verify this possibility, nuclear run-on and ActD chase assays were employed to assess the effect of TPA on transcription rate and mRNA stability, respectively. The EF-Tumt transcript, which is one of the most abundant transcripts among mt translation factors, was analyzed. MPO mRNA level is also down-regulated after the TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, mainly due to its decreased transcription rate (35Lin K.M. Austin G.E. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Sagoh T. Yamada M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A nuclear run-on assay indicated that EF-Tumt transcription is apparently not down-regulated after exposure of HL-60RG cells to TPA (50 nm, 48h), whereas MPO gene transcription is reduced to less than 20% basal level (Fig. 2A). On the contrary, ActD chase studies demonstrated that EF-Tumt mRNA was significantly destabilized after the exposure to TPA (50 nm, 48 h) (Fig. 2B). It is difficult to precisely evaluate mRNA stability for each condition by simply comparing the mRNA half-life estimated by linear regression analysis. Because ActD induces the differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes and promotes apoptosis (37Collins S.J. Bodner A. Ting R. Gallo R.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 25: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 38Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar), it may modulate the expression of various cytoplasmic proteins, possibly including the trans-acting proteins that govern the stability of EF-Tumt mRNA. Indeed, the apparent increase of EF-Tumt mRNA level during the first 1.5 h of ActD chase study may reflect such an effect. However, taken together the results of the nuclear run-on and ActD chase assays indicate that the TPA-induced decrease in EF-Tumt mRNA mainly reflects decreased mRNA stability. In our preliminary observations we also found that TPA-induced decreases in mRNA levels of other mt translation factors, MTFmt, MetRSmt, and IF-2mt, result from a combination of decreased mRNA stability and transcription, the former appearing dominant. 2N. Takeuchi and T. Ueda, unpublished data. Thus, we suggest that down-regulation of mRNA stability is a general and crucial mechanism for the marked down-regulation of mt translation factor mRNA during the differentiation of HL-60 cells by TPA and probably in response to growth arrest in general. It is ambiguous how the transcriptional regulation for mt translation factors contributes to the change in their mRNA levels. Genomic sequence data base searching indicates that the promoter regions of EF-Tumt, MTFmt, MetRSmt, and IF-2mt carry putative NRF-binding sites; however, it remains to be elucidated whether these are functional. It is still possible that the transcription factors other than NRFs are important for the transcriptional regulation of mt translation factors, and that would explain why we did not observe the significant transcriptional reduction for EF-Tumt mRNA during differentiation (Fig. 2A). Functional analyses of their promoter regions are currently under investigation. It is interesting to note here that transcription of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator 2 (ANT2) gene is growth-regulated, but that NRF is not involved in its control (39Battini R. Ferrari S. Kaczmarek L. Calabretta B. Chen S."

Previous experiments have established the involvement of three conserved domain II residues in the proton pumping function of the enzyme: His91, Ser139, and Asn222, located on helices 9, 10, and 13, respectively. Eight highly conserved domain II glycines in helices 9, 10, 13, and 14 were mutated to alanine, and the mutant enzymes were assayed for hydride transfer between domains I and III and for proton translocation by domain II. One of the glycines on helix 14, Gly252, was further mutated to Cys, Ser, Thr, and Val, expression levels of the mutant enzymes were evaluated, and each was purified and assayed. The results show that Gly252 is essential for function and support a model for the proton channel composed of helices 9, 10, 13, and 14. Gly252 would allow spatial proximity of His91, Ser139, and Asn222 for proton conductance within the channel. Gly252 mutants are distinguished by high levels of cyclic transhydrogenation activity in the absence of added NADP(H) and by complete loss of proton pumping activity. The purified G252A mutant has <1% proton translocation and reverse transhydrogenation activity, retains 0.9 mol of NADP(H) per domain III, and has 96% intrinsic cyclic transhydrogenation activity, which does not exceed 100% upon the addition of NADP(H). These properties imply that Gly252 mutants exhibit a native-like domain II conformation while blocking proton translocation and coupled exchange of NADP(H) in domain III.

They catalyze the direct and stereospecific transfer of hydride between the 4A position of NAD(H) and the 4B position of NADP(H). The transhydrogenation reaction is coupled to transmembrane proton translocation with a H+/H– stoichiometry of unity (Reaction 1) (1Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M.

NADH+NADP+Hout+⇌NAD+NADPH+Hin+Reaction1(Eq. 1) In bovine mitochondria, the proton motive force accelerates the forward reaction 10–12-fold and shifts the equilibrium toward product formation. Due to this activity, a function of TH is to produce NADPH for reduction of toxic H2O2 by glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase. In the reverse direction, transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD results in outward proton translocation and creation of a proton motive force. Because there is essentially no difference in the reduction potential of the nicotinamide cofactors, the driving force for the reverse reaction is the difference in binding affinities for substrates (NADPH and NAD) versus products (NADH and NADP). Consequently, TH provides a system in which to study the transformation of substrate binding energy into proton translocation. The amino acid sequences of over 50 TH enzymes are available, but only the enzymes from bovine mitochondria (4Hatefi Y. Yamaguchi M. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 265-281Google Scholar), Escherichia coli (5Clarke D.M. Bragg P.D. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1991; 197: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have been purified. The bovine enzyme is a homodimer of monomer molecular mass of 109 kDa. The monomer is composed of three domains: an amino-terminal ∼430-residue-long extramembranous domain I that binds NAD(H), a ∼400-residue-long central domain II that is composed of 14 transmembrane α-helices, and a carboxyl-terminal ∼200-residue-long extramembranous domain III that binds NADP(H) (1Hatefi Y.

The extramembranous domains I and III come together in the mitochondrial matrix to form the active site for hydride transfer. Bovine TH lacks significant protein mass on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial inner membrane, except for the oligopeptide loops connecting transmembrane α-helices (8Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prokaryotic enzymes have the same overall domain structure, but the polypeptide is composed of two or three separate gene products: E. coli and R. capsulatus as α and β subunits and Rhodospirillum rubrum as α1, α2, and β subunits (1Hatefi Y.

Trypsin sensitivity, chemical modification, and NMR experiments indicate that the formation or binding of NADPH in domain III results in significant conformational change within domain III and longer range effects in the intact enzyme (4Hatefi Y.

Hence, conformational change involving the soluble domain I and domain III components of TH in response to the proton motive force favors hydride transfer to NADP in the forward direction (Reaction 1), or in the reverse direction, conformational change due to NADPH binding favors outward proton translocation. A secondary structure model for the integral membrane domain, domain II, is based on experiments defining the membrane exposure of loops connecting the predicted α-helices (3Bizouarn T.

Cysteine mutants were introduced in E. coli TH between all predicted transmembrane α-helices, and fluorescence labeling experiments defined their orientation with respect to the membrane (25Meuller J.

One transmembrane helix, H5, predicted for bovine TH does not occur in the E. coli enzyme, corresponding to the division between α and β subunits. The association of domain II helices has been studied by cross-linking and oxidation of introduced cysteines (28Bragg P.D. Hou C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These experiments indicate that E. coli TH is an α2β2 tetramer predominantly associated via β subunits; 2-fold symmetric quaternary structure is consistent with the dimeric relationship of domain I components in crystals (24Jackson J.B.

These acidic residues may be associated with a pKa shift coupled to NADPH induced movement in domain III. Experiments focused on residues Ser260–Ser266 show that the hinge region between helix 14 and domain III mediates communication between domains II and III, which involves an Asp213–Arg265 salt bridge (35Althage M. Bizouarn T. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9968-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutational study of 21 prototropic residues in H9, H10, H13, and H14 confirmed the requirement for His91 (H9) and Asn222 (H13) and identified the requirement for Ser139 (H10) but did not implicate any residues on H14 (32Yamaguchi M. Stout C.D. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33670-33675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on the mutagenesis data and the high degree of sequence conservation in helix 14, we proposed that the proton channel is composed of H9, H10, H13, and H14 (32Yamaguchi M. Stout C.D. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33670-33675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Subsequently, residues 240–260 of helix 14 have been mutated to Cys (36Karlsson J. Althage M. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6575-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Reduced activities for the Gly245, Gly249, and Gly252 mutants on one face of the expected α-helix were interpreted in terms of helix-helix interactions within domain II, and enhanced activities for the Ser250, Ser251, and Ser256 mutants support an allosteric effect of helix 14 on NADP(H) binding in domain III (36Karlsson J. Althage M. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6575-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The four α-helices predicted to comprise the proton channel contain eight highly conserved glycine residues, including three on H14 (Fig. 1). Amino acid replacements at Ser139 suggested that one role for glycine could be to allow water molecules within the proton channel (32Yamaguchi M. Stout C.D. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33670-33675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At the same time, substitutions for glycine uniquely test packing contacts within domain II. For these reasons, to test the four-helix bundle model and to evaluate the participation of H14, we have mutated each conserved glycine and assayed the mutant TH enzymes. Because Gly252 on helix 14 is uniquely implicated, additional replacements at this residue were prepared, and the mutant enzymes were purified and assayed. Materials—NAD, NADH, NADPH, and ATP were obtained from Calbiochem. AcPyAD, AcPyADP, and ACMA were obtained from Sigma. E. coli strain MC4100TH–, whose transhydrogenase gene was replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene, was reported previously (34Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16653-16659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The wild type transhydrogenase gene (pDC21) was digested with SalI/BamHI and the resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the SalI/BamHI site of pTZ18U. With this plasmid derivative, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the reagents and protocols outlined in the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene mutagenesis kit (37Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA was prepared from individual colonies, and mutants were identified by DNA sequencing. The mutant DNA fragment was excised by appropriate restriction enzymes and replaced with the counterpart of pDC21. Culture of E. coli Cells—The E. coli strain MC4100TH– was transformed with pDC21 or mutant plasmids. Each single colony was inoculated into the LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml). Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C until the late logarithmic phase, collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 5 min (Sorvall GSA rotor), and washed with 0.9% NaCl. Preparation of Membranes—The cells (wet weight, ∼5 g per 4 liters of LB medium) were suspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5 mm MgCl2, and sonicated in a Branson sonifier at output 8 and 25% pulse for 5 min. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman model L ultracentrifuge, and membranes were collected by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 45 min. Membranes were suspended in 5 ml of the same buffer and homogenized. Enzyme Purification—Transhydrogenase was extracted from E. coli membranes with 2% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (TEDP buffer) at ∼4 mg/ml protein concentration. The sample was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm (Beckman 42Ti rotor). The supernatant was applied to a DEAE Biogel A column (Bio-Rad) (1.0 × 12.5 cm) and washed with 8 column volumes of TEDP buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.125 m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient (0.125–0.4 m) of NaCl in TEDP buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (total volume 60 ml), and active fractions were combined and concentrated to 2 ml with a Centriprep YM-30 concentrator (Millipore Corp.). The enzyme was then applied to a Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) (1.5 × 70 cm) equilibrated with TEDP buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. Active fractions were combined and concentrated to 1 ml with a Centriprep YM-30 concentrator. The purified enzyme was stored at –80 °C until use. Enzyme Assays—Transhydrogenase activities were assayed as previously described (32Yamaguchi M. Stout C.D. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33670-33675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 34Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16653-16659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reverse transhydrogenase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 375 nm in a 37 °C reaction mixture (1 ml), containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.2 mm AcPyAD and 5–50 μg of protein from E. coli membranes or purified enzymes. Cyclic transhydrogenase activity was measured at 375 nm in a 37 °C reaction mixture (1 ml), containing 50 mm MES-KOH (pH 6.0), 0.2 mm NADH, 0.2 mm AcPyAD, with or without 10 μm NADPH, and 5–50 μg of protein from E. coli membranes or purified enzymes. A difference extinction coefficient of 6.1 mm–1 cm–1 for absorbance at 375 versus 340 nm was used to calculate specific activities. All assays are the average of three or four measurements. Proton Translocation—Proton translocation coupled to reverse transhydrogenation catalyzed by sonicated E. coli membranes was monitored by measuring the quenching of ACMA fluorescence (32Yamaguchi M. Stout C.D. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33670-33675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (2 ml) contained 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 2 μm ACMA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.4 mm AcPyAD, and E. coli membranes (10–100 μg of protein). ACMA fluorescence was measured at 37 °C by a Jobin Yvon FluroMax-3 fluorescence spectrophotometer, using an excitation wavelength of 415 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm. The reaction was initiated by the addition of AcPyAD. Assays are the average of two or three measurements. Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). Determination of NADP(H) Contents—NADP and NADPH were extracted separately from purified wild type and G252A mutant transhydrogenases, and their contents were determined as described by Klingenberg (38Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 2045-2072Crossref Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar) using 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained in 10% acetic acid. This paper addresses the role of conserved glycines in domain II of transhydrogenase. Previous mutagenesis studies have shown that three predicted transmembrane α-helices in the β subunit of domain II of E. coli TH provide residues essential for the proton translocation activity of the enzyme (Fig. 1). Based on these data and sequence conservation of residues in helix 14, we proposed that the proton conducting channel is comprised of helices H9, H10, H13, and H14 (32Yamaguchi M. Stout C.D. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33670-33675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The model presumes that the essential residues are associated in order to share a common function. It further assumes a four-helix bundle because of the occurrence of this motif in protein structures. With respect to the predicted secondary structure, His91, Ser139, and Asn222 are approximately the same distance from the cytosolic surface of the membrane. With respect to glycine, eight residues in helices H9, H10, H13 and H14 are highly conserved: Gly95, Gly138, Gly226, Gly233, Gly245, and Gly252 are strictly conserved in 51 available TH sequences; Gly132 is Ala or Ser in three species; and Gly249 is Ala in one species. TH mutants were constructed and expressed, and E. coli membranes were prepared and assayed, as previously described (32Yamaguchi M. Stout C.D. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33670-33675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a series of mutant enzymes for amino acid replacements at Gly252 were purified and assayed. Three assays were used to evaluate TH activity (Reaction 1). Reverse transhydrogenation from NADPH (0.2 mm) in domain III to the NAD analogue, AcPyAD, in domain I measures hydride transfer but is linked to proton translocation and is a measure of domain II function (34Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16653-16659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cyclic transhydrogenation measures hydride transfer between domains I and III. It entails hydride transfer from NADPH (10 μm) in domain III to AcPyAD in domain I; in the presence of excess NADH, the AcPyADH formed exchanges rapidly, and “forward” transhydrogenation from NADH back to NADP allows another cycle of hydride transfer to occur (9Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Fisher R.R. Earl S.R. Everse J. Anderson B. You K.-S. The Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes.

The third assay measures the conductance of protons through domain II in “inside-out” vesicles. In this case, reverse transhydrogenation from NADPH to AcPyAD causes [H+] to increase inside the vesicles, which is detected by fluorescence quenching (42Glavas N.A. Hou C. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All three assays were used to evaluate TH mutants in suspended membranes; detergent-purified TH native and mutant enzymes were assayed for reverse and cyclic transhydrogenation. The results of replacement of the eight conserved Gly → Ala mutants are given in Table I. In comparison with wild type TH, one of these mutants, G252A, exhibits virtually no activity in both the reverse transhydrogenation and proton translocation assays. The other mutants display at least 30% proton translocation activity or 50% reverse transhydrogenation activity, where the errors in the individual assays are <±10%. In addition, the Gly252 mutant is unique in that it retains essentially full cyclic transhydrogenation activity in the absence of added NADPH, whereas the other mutants regain this activity only upon the addition of NADPH (Table I). The requirement for Gly252 for proton pumping activity is consistent with its strict sequence conservation. Participation of Gly252 supports the proposed four-helix model by identifying an essential residue on helix H14 (Fig. 1). The reduced activities of the G95A mutant on H9, the G138A mutant on H10, and the G226A and G233A mutants on H13 are also consistent with the participation of these helices in the proton channel (Table I).Table ICatalytic properties of E. coli TH mutated to alanine at eight conserved glycine residues in the β subunit of domain IITHHelixReverse TH activityCyclic TH activityaCyclic transhydrogenation activity was measured with and without the addition of 10 μm NADPH.Proton translocation-NADPH+NADPHμmol·min-1 mg-1 bReverse transhydrogenation units are μmol of AcPyAD reduced by NADPH/min/mg of protein measured at 375 nm (see ‘Experimental Procedures‘).

https://openalex.org/W2028144107,"Prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs) have a cyclooxygenase that forms prostaglandin (PG) G2 from arachidonic acid (AA) plus oxygen and a peroxidase that reduces the PGG2 to PGH2. The peroxidase activates the cyclooxygenase. This involves an initial oxidation of the peroxidase heme group by hydroperoxide, followed by oxidation of Tyr385 to a tyrosyl radical within the cyclooxygenase site. His386 of PGHS-1 is not formally part of either active site, but lies in an extended helix between Tyr385, which protrudes into the cyclooxygenase site, and His388, the proximal ligand of the peroxidase heme. When His386 was substituted with alanine in PGHS-1, the mutant retained <2.5% of the native peroxidase activity, but >20% of the native cyclooxygenase activity. However, peroxidase activity could be restored (10-30%) by treating H386A PGHS-1 with cyclooxygenase inhibitors or AA, but not with linoleic acid; in contrast, mere occupancy of the cyclooxygenase site of native PGHS-1 had no effect on peroxidase activity. Heme titrations indicated that H386A PGHS-1 binds heme less tightly than does native PGHS-1. The low peroxidase activity and decreased affinity for heme of H386A PGHS-1 imply that His386 helps optimize heme binding. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that this is accomplished in part by a hydrogen bond between the heme D-ring propionate and the N-δ of Asn382 of the extended helix. The structure of the extended helix is, in turn, strongly supported by stable hydrogen bonding between the N-δ of His386 and the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Asn382 and Gln383. We speculate that the binding of cyclooxygenase inhibitors or AA to the cyclooxygenase site of ovine H386A PGHS-1 reopens the constriction in the cyclooxygenase site between the extended helix and a helix containing Gly526 and Ser530 and restores native-like structure to the extended helix. Being less bulky than AA, linoleic acid is apparently unable to reopen this constriction.

PGHS-1 is considered to be a constitutive enzyme (4Taniura S. Kamitani H. Watanabe T. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16823-16830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas PGHS-2 is induced in response to various cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 149-182Crossref Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 5Hwang D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 exhibit ∼60% amino acid sequence identity, and their crystal structures are essentially superimposable (6Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 7Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D.

Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Both enzymes function as homodimers with subunit molecular masses of ∼70 kDa. There are some subtle differences in kinetics and substrate specificities between isoforms, but PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 appear to operate similarly with respect to their reaction mechanisms (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 149-182Crossref Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 3van der Donk W.A. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15451-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). There is considerable therapeutic interest in PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 because both are major targets of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that compete with AA for binding to the enzymes (9DeWitt D.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 625-631PubMed Google Scholar, 10Marnett L.J. Kalgutkar A.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 465-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). PGHSs exhibit two different but complementary enzyme activities, including (a) a cyclooxygenase (bis-oxygenase) that catalyzes the conversion of AA and two molecules of O2 to PGG2 and (b) a peroxidase that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of the 15-hydroperoxyl group of PGG2 to PGH2. The cyclooxygenase activity of PGHS-2 (but not PGHS-1) can also use 2-arachidonylglycerol as a substrate and convert it to 2-PGG2-glycerol (11Kozak K.R. Prusakiewicz J.J. Rowlinson S.W. Schneider C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30072-30077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities occur at physically separate but functionally interactive locations within the protein (1Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W. Goodwin D.C. Kalgutkar A.S. Lanzo C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22903-22906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev.

The initial step in the cyclooxygenase reaction is abstraction of the 13-pro-S-hydrogen atom from AA to yield an allylic arachidonyl radical (13Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38311-38321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This hydrogen abstraction involves a protein tyrosyl radical centered on Tyr385 (17Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Goodwin D.C. Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Crews B.C. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8903-8909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This radical is thought to be formed as follows (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 149-182Crossref Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 3van der Donk W.A. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J.

The heme group at the peroxidase site of PGHS undergoes a two-electron oxidation by a hydroperoxide (e.g. PGG2), yielding the corresponding alcohol (e.g. PGH2) and an oxyferryl heme radical cation (Compound I). In the next step, a tyrosinate residue (Tyr385) contributes an election to Compound I, producing an oxyferryl heme plus a tyrosyl radical (Intermediate II). The newly formed tyrosyl radical abstracts a hydrogen from AA bound at the cyclooxygenase site to initiate the cyclooxygenase cycle of oxygen insertion and cyclization reactions (3van der Donk W.A. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15451-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M.

Commun. 2001; 289: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, once the cyclooxygenase catalytic cycle has been initiated, it can operate independently of the peroxidase cycle, a branched chain mechanism in which there is no tight one-to-one coupling between peroxide reduction (i.e. Compound I formation) and PGG2 formation (3van der Donk W.A. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15451-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A.- L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8499-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). According to this current model for PGHS function, activation of the cyclooxygenase activity requires peroxidase activity. It is clear, however, that the peroxidase activity need not be optimally functional because forms of PGHS that exhibit relatively low peroxidase activity (1-5% of that of the native enzyme) are capable of cyclooxygenase catalysis (22Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Strieder S. Schaible K. Scherer H.J. Dietz R. Ruf H.H. J. Biol.

In earlier studies in which we identified histidine residues critical for cyclooxygenase catalysis, we found two mutants of ovine PGHS (oPGHS)-1 (H386A and H386Q) that lack any detectable peroxidase activity, but retain appreciable cyclooxygenase activity (22Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We undertook the studies reported here because a complete lack of PGHS peroxidase function is inconsistent with the prevailing model for cyclooxygenase catalysis (3van der Donk W.A. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15451-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J.

During the course of these studies, we observed that addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor flurbiprofen restored significant peroxidase activity to H386A oPGHS-1. Here, we report this result and subsequent biochemical and computational studies to determine the role of His386 in peroxidase and cyclooxygenase catalysis. Materials—Hemoglobin, hematin, chloroquine, DEAE-dextran, guaiacol, Tween 20, GSH, glutathione peroxidase, N-ethylmaleimide, and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma. Ethyl hydrogen peroxide (EtOOH) was purchased from Polyscience. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Calf serum and fetal calf serum were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories. BA85 (0.45 μm)-nitrocellulose was from Schleicher & Schüll. ECL Western blotting reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. TiterMax adjuvant was from CytRx Corp. Oligonucleotides used as primers for mutagenesis were prepared by the Michigan State University Macromolecular Structure and Sequencing Facility. Fatty acids were from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc., and the detergents C10E6 and decyl maltoside were from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). All other reagents were from common commercial sources. PGHS Expression and Purification—pSVT7 expression plasmids containing the coding regions of native and H386A oPGHS-1 were as reported previously (22Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were used in transfections of COS-1 cells as described in an earlier report (26Spencer A.G. Thuresson E.A. Otto J.C. Song I. Smith T. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32936-32942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The H386A mutant of His6-tagged oPGHS-1 was prepared using protocols described previously (21Song I. Ball T.M. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Smith T. Leipprandt J. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Native and H386A His6-oPGHS-1 were produced in Sf21 insect cells following baculovirus infection and purified by nickel affinity chromatography and, in some cases, further purified by FPLC on a 1-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) (21Song I. Ball T.M. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Smith T. Leipprandt J. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For FPLC, His-tagged protein from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column in 200 mm imidazole (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% C10E6 was concentrated to ∼2 ml using centrifugal concentrators and subjected to buffer exchange (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% C10E6 or decyl maltoside) using pre-equilibrated Sephadex G-25 spin columns. The samples was applied to the FPLC column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% C10E6 or decyl maltoside. Fractions from the FPLC column were assayed for enzyme activity and protein. For samples intended for stopped-flow analysis, 100 μm flurbiprofen was typically included in the buffers. Flurbiprofen bound to the cyclooxygenase active site and stabilized oPGHS-1, but had no effect on the peroxidase activity of native oPGHS-1. Average yields of His6-oPGHS-1 purified by FPLC were 0.5 mg/liter of insect culture medium. Essentially the same approach outlined for oPGHS-1 was used to isolate His6-tagged human PGHS (hPGHS)-2 (27Smith T. Leipprandt J. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, the yields of His6-hPGHS-2 were three to five times those of His6-oPGHS-1. The cyclooxygenase-specific activities of the enzyme eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns averaged 10,000 and 2000 units/mg of protein for His6-oPGHS-1 and H386A His6-oPGHS-1, respectively. Purification by FPLC typically increased the specific activities by 2-3-fold. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford protein assay reagents from Bio-Rad. Enzyme Assays—Cyclooxygenase assays were performed at 37 °C by monitoring the maximal rate of O2 uptake using an oxygen electrode. Each assay mixture contained 3 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenol, 85 μg of hemoglobin, and 100 μm AA (28Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Dewitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of cyclooxygenase activity corresponds to the amount of enzyme that oxygenates 1 nmol of AA/min. Reactions were initiated by adding 10-100 μg of microsomal protein or 1-5 μg of partially purified His6-tagged enzyme. Inhibition assays performed with GSH and GSH peroxidase were performed with 0.1 mm GSH using 35 units and 1 unit of peroxidase for native and H386A oPGHS-1, respectively; N-ethylmaleimide was used at a final concentration of 1 mm. Peroxidase activities were measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of 3,3′-dimethoxydipheno-4,4′-quinone from guaiacol and EtOOH (100 μm) or H2O2 (500 μm) at room temperature (30Marnett L.J. Chen Y.N. Maddipati K.R. Ple P. Labeque R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16532-16535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5.6 mm guaiacol, 1 μm hematin, and typically 10-100 μg of microsomal protein or 20-80 μg (0.1-0.4 cyclooxygenase units) of partially purified His6-oPGHS-1 or H386A His6-oPGHS-1. Reactions were initiated by adding peroxide. Stopped-flow Analysis—The molar concentration of the PGHS was calculated using a value of 30,000 cyclooxygenase units/mg of pure enzyme (31Hemler M. Lands W.E.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5575-5581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C. Freire J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For samples used for stopped-flow or standard peroxidase assays, an equimolar amount of hemin chloride (1 mm in Me2SO) was added typically along with a 10-fold molar excess of flurbiprofen, and the sample was concentrated to 1 ml; the final concentration of Me2SO in this sample was typically ∼0.07%. For stopped-flow analyses of PGHS, concentrations of ∼15 μm (∼1 mg/ml) were routinely used. Peroxide solutions were prepared at the same concentration as PGHS in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% C10E6. The stopped-flow studies were performed at 4 °C using an Olis RSM instrument. Based on differences in molar extinction coefficients between the resting state heme and the reaction intermediates, the rate constants for Compound I (∼408 nm for native oPGHS-1) and Intermediate II (∼428 nm for native oPGHS-1) formation were determined. Western Transfer Blotting—Microsomal or purified protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and electroeluted onto BA85-nitrocellulose filters as described previously (26Spencer A.G. Thuresson E.A. Otto J.C. Song I. Smith T. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32936-32942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Otto J.C.

Filters were blocked for 12 h in 3% nonfat dry milk and Tris-buffered saline, followed by incubation with peptide-directed antibody against oPGHS-1 in 1% dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20, and Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at 25 °C. Filters were washed and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The filters were then incubated with ECL reagents and exposed to Kodak XAR film for chemiluminescence. Molecular Dynamics—The starting configuration for PGHS-1 was obtained from Protein Data Bank code 1EBV (35Loll P.J. Sharkey C.T. O'Connor S.J. Dooley C.M. O'Brien E. Devocelle M. Nolan K.B.

The simulations were performed using the SANDER module of the AMBER Version 7 simulation software package (36Case, D. A., Pearlman, D. A., Caldwell, J. W., Cheatham, T. E., III, Wang, J., Ross, W.

Preparation of the topology and parameter files was done using LEaP (37Schafmeister C.E.A.F. Ross W.S. Romanovski V. LEAP Software Package. University of California, San Francisco1995Google Scholar). We used atom types and parameters for the heme that were developed by Giammona (38Giammona, D. A. (1994) University of California, Davis, CAGoogle Scholar) as modified by C. Bayly. 2See also www.amber.ucsf.edu/amber/amber.html. The oxidation state of heme b is set to be ferric (Fe3+), and with the assumption that the propionates are ionized, the overall charge is -1. The ionization states of amino acid residues were set appropriate to pH 7. All histidines were assumed to be neutral with the N-δ protonated. The proximal histidine (His388) was covalently linked to the heme Fe3+ through N-ϵ. The SHAKE algorithm (39Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Computat. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16719) Google Scholar) was used to constrain bond lengths involving hydrogens, permitting a time step of 2 fs. The starting structure was immersed in a rectangular box consisting of ∼15,000 explicit water molecules. The temperature was kept at 300 K with the use of a Berendsen thermostat (40Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23150) Google Scholar) with a coupling constant of 0.2 ps. The particle mesh Ewald method (41Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen G.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8583Crossref Scopus (15369) Google Scholar) was used to treat the long-range coulombic interactions with the default values of the SANDER program. The dynamics were performed using periodic boundary conditions with the van der Waals non-bonded cutoff at 9.0 Å. Initially, a 2.25-ps constant number, pressure, and temperature simulation at 300 K was performed while restraining the atomic coordinates of the protein with a harmonic potential. This permitted the solvent molecules to relax while allowing the box dimensions to change and bring the whole system to an equilibrated density of ∼1.0 g/ml. The protein restraints were then removed, and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations was performed in the constant number, volume, and temperature ensemble for 1.3 ns. Kinetic Properties of Native oPGHS-1 and Mutants with Substitutions of His386—His386 is located in the extended helix (378MEFNQNLYHWHPL390) 3The numbering of residues in oPGHS-1 is based on numbering the N-terminal methionine of the signal peptide as residue 1, and the homologous numbering system is used for hPGHS-2 (7Kurumbail R.G.

The impetus for the studies reported here was our earlier findings that the H386A and H386Q mutants of oPGHS-1 lack detectable peroxidase activity, but retain oxygenase activity (22Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that this finding is inconsistent with the branched chain model for cyclooxygenase catalysis; this mechanism requires that a peroxide oxidize the heme group at the peroxidase site, which, in turn, oxidizes Tyr385 within the cyclooxygenase site (2Smith W.L.

Specifically, microsomal preparations of H386A oPGHS-1 expressed in COS-1 cells exhibit 30-35% of the maximal cyclooxygenase activity of native oPGHS-1, but lack detectable peroxidase activity when tested either with H2O2 (Table I) (22Shimokawa T.

Also shown in Table I are the kinetic values for native and H386A His6-oPGHS-1 purified from baculovirus expression systems. With purified enzymes, H386A His6-oPGHS-1 consistently had 15-20% of the native cyclooxygenase activity and 1.5-2.5% of the native peroxidase activity; this latter level of peroxidase activity is at the lower limit of detection of standard peroxidase assays.Table ICyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of oPGHS-1 and H386A oPGHS-1EnzymeCyclooxygenaseArachidonate KmPeroxidasenmol O 2/min/mgμMnmol H2O2/min/mgNative oPGHS-1 (COS-1 cells)1413.136H386A oPGHS-1 (COS-1 cells)474.20His6-oPGHS-112,000ND25,000H386A His6-oPGHS-12,500ND590His6-oPGHS-1 with 100 μM FBPNDND25,000H386A His6-oPGHS-1 with 100 μM FBPNDND10,000 Open table in a new tab O2 electrode tracings of O2 consumption observed with equal amounts of native or H386A His6-oPGHS-1 in standard assays with AA as the fatty acid substrate are compared in Fig. 2. A much more pronounced kinetic lag period was observed following addition of H386A oPGHS-1 to assay mixtures containing heme and the two cyclooxygenase substrates, O2 and AA. No appreciable lag was apparent with the same amount of native oPGHS-1 protein; lag phases such as the one for H386A oPGHS-1 are common with peroxidase-deficient forms of PGHSs (22Shimokawa T.

In the case of H386A oPGHS-1, the lag phase could be eliminated by adding 3 μm 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (but not 110 μm H2O2) to the assay chamber (data not shown), and the lag phase could be extended by adding GSH plus glutathione perox"
