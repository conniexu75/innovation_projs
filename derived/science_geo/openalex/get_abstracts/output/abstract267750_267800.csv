https://openalex.org/W2063768946,"The Mark III very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) system allows recording and later processing of up to 112 megabits per second from each radio telescope of an interferometer array. For astrometric and geodetic measurements, signals from two radio-frequency bands (2.2 to 2.3 and 8.2 to 8.6 gigahertz) are sampled and recorded simultaneously at all antenna sites. From these dual-band recordings the relative group delays of signals arriving at each pair of sites can be corrected for the contributions due to the ionosphere. For many radio sources for which the signals are sufficiently intense, these group delays can be determined with uncertainties under 50 picoseconds. Relative positions of widely separated antennas and celestial coordinates of radio sources have been determined from such measurements with 1 standard deviation uncertainties of about 5 centimeters and 3 milliseconds of arc, respectively. Sample results are given for the lengths of baselines between three antennas in the United States and three in Europe as well as for the arc lengths between the positions of six extragalactic radio sources. There is no significant evidence of change in any of these quantities. For mapping the brightness distribution of such compact radio sources, signals of a given polarization, or of pairs of orthogonal polarizations, can be recorded in up to 28 contiguous bands each nearly 2 megahertz wide. The ability to record large bandwidths and to link together many large radio telescopes allows detection and study of compact sources with flux densities under 1 millijansky."

https://openalex.org/W1995880824,"Several well-characterized transition metal catalysts contain a metal-carbon double bond or a metal-carbon triple bond. In other homogeneous (or heterogeneous) catalyst systems in which the metal is likely to be in a relatively high oxidation state, such as molybdenum(VI) or tungsten(VI), metal-carbon multiple bonds may play an important role. Some recent results suggest that even supposedly well understood reactions such as ethylene polymerization may actually involve catalysts that behave as if they contained a metal-carbon double bond instead of a metal-carbon single bond. The chemistry of metal-carbon double and triple bonds should eventually complement and perhaps. overlap the known chemistry of complexes containing metal-oxygen double bonds or metal-nitrogen triple bonds, respectively; unique catalytic reactions involving carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen ligands multiply bonded to transition metals are therefore possible."
https://openalex.org/W2067784289,The photochemistry of butterfly rhabdoms has properties that had been associated exclusively with the photoreceptor organelles of vertebrates. Noninvasive measurements of the absorbance spectra of rhabdoms in intact butterflies show that their rhodopsins are converted by light to metarhodopsins that decay from the rhabdom in the dark. A total bleach is possible because the first-order decay of metarhodopsin is considerably faster than the kinetically more complicated recovery of rhodopsin.
https://openalex.org/W2063900366,"By use of a new, very sensitive interferometric system, a faint, compact radio source has been detected near the center of the galaxy that acts as the main part of a gravitational lens. This lens forms two previously discovered images of the quasar Q09S7+561, which lies in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major. The newly detected source has a core smaller than 0.002 arc second in diameter with a flux density of 0.6 +/- 0.1 millijansky at the 13-centimeter wavelength of the radio observations. This source could be the predicted third image of the transparent gravitational lens, the central core of the galaxy, or some combination of the two. It is not yet possible to choose reliably between these alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W4246045688,"Acoustical monitoring of real landslides has revealed the existence of subaudible noise activity prior to failure and has enabled prediction of the depth of the seat of sliding when conducted in boreholes beneath the surface. Recordings of noise generated in small slopes of moist sand, tilted to failure in laboratory tests, have been analyzed to determine the foci of discrete subaudible noise events. The noises emitted shortly before failure were plotted close to the true sliding surface observed after failure. The foci of earlier events lay either within the central portion of the sliding mass or in a region behind the failure surface. The head and toe zones were devoid of strong seismic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1994346455,"In late 1972, the Soviet Union embarked on a program to identify and document plant species that are threatened with extinction. Perhaps 2000 species in the Soviet Union are in need of monitoring or protective measures, while nearly 200 may be in immediate danger of extinction. Currently, the Soviet Union has an official, national list of endangered species, and each of the 15 republics has prepared a regional list. Once a revised national list is prepared, Soviet scientists hope that the Supreme Soviet will pass a law protecting those species. A corresponding law for endangered animals was passed in 1980."

https://openalex.org/W1991518043,"The university pays for its benefits from a federally financed project with its own investments in the faculty scientist and not, as is often assumed, by its absorption of project costs that are not reimbursed by the government. An analysis of the exchange of resources between the university, the scientist, the discipline, and the government shows, however, that by absorbing costs the institution gains acceptance as a host for federal research. Funds for this ticket of admission are drawn away from several groups on the campus. In exploring whether there should be such an entry fee, the pragmatic response of the National Commission on Research is considered."

https://openalex.org/W2020446163,"The probability that a galaxy gathers light from another remote galaxy, and deflects and focuses it toward an observer on Earth, is calculated according to various cosmologic models. I pose the question of whether an object called a quasar is a single, intrinsically luminous entity or the result of accidental alignment, along the line of sight, of two normal galaxies, the more distant of which has its light amplified by the gravitational-lens effect of the nearer galaxy. If galaxies are distributed at random in the universe, the former alternative is true. But, if we assume that most galaxies exist in pairs, we can find about 30 galaxies occurring exactly one behind the other in such a way as to enable amplification of the order of 50. This model explains also the variations in intensity in quasars, but fails to explain others of their observed properties."
