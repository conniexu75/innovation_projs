https://openalex.org/W2088661249,"An assay for the presence of given DNA sequences has been developed, based on the ability of two oligonucleotides to anneal immediately adjacent to each other on a complementary target DNA molecule. The two oligonucleotides are then joined covalently by the action of a DNA ligase, provided that the nucleotides at the junction are correctly base-paired. Thus single nucleotide substitutions can be distinguished. This strategy permits the rapid and standardized identification of single-copy gene sequences in genomic DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2066416662,"Cadherins are cell-surface glycoproteins responsible for Ca2+-dependent cell-to-cell adhesion. E- or P-cadherin was transfected into L cells, which normally have little cadherin activity, and cellular aggregation of the resulting transfectants was observed to be a function of the cadherin molecule expressed. Transfected cells preferentially adhered to cells expressing the same cadherin subclass. Furthermore, in reconstituted embryonic lung tissue, E-cadherin-expressing L cells were associated with epithelial tubules expressing E-cadherin, while untransfected L cells associated with mesenchymal cells. These results provide the first direct evidence that the differential expression of cadherins can play a role in cell sorting in heterogeneous cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2121075147,"A mutation has been found that dramatically shortens the period of the circadian locomotor rhythm of golden hamsters. The pattern of inheritance of this mutation suggests that it occurred at a single, autosomal locus (tau). Wild-type animals have rhythms with free-running periods averaging about 24 hours; animals heterozygous for the mutation have periods of about 22 hours, whereas homozygous animals have rhythms with periods close to 20 hours. Animals that carry the mutant alleles exhibit abnormal entrainment to 24-hour light:dark cycles or are unable to entrain."
https://openalex.org/W1541668845,"The nucleotide sequences of partial cDNA clones coding for the core protein of a human polymorphic epithelial mucin were determined, and a large domain was found to consist of a 60-base pair tandem repeat sequence. The cDNA clones were originally selected (Gendler, S. J., Burchell, J. M., Duhig, T., Lamport, D., White, R., Parker, M., and Taylor-Papadimitriou, J. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 6060-6064) using three monoclonal antibodies which show differential reactivity with the mucin produced by normal and malignant breast. Two of the epitopes are exposed in the normally processed and cancer-associated mucin, while one epitope is unmasked only in the cancer-associated mucin (Burchell, J. M., Durbin, H., and Taylor-Papadimitriou, J. (1983) J. Immunol. 131, 508-513; Burchell, J., Gendler, S., Taylor-Papadimitriou, J., Girling, A., Lewis, A., Millis, R., and Lamport, D. (1987) Cancer Res. 47, 5476-5482). We show here that all three antibodies react with a synthetic peptide with an amino acid sequence corresponding to that predicted by the tandem repeat. Identification of the epitopes preferentially expressed on the cancer-associated mucin should allow a directed approach to the development of tumor-specific antibodies using synthetic peptides as immunogens."
https://openalex.org/W1996251138,"The mammalian activator protein ATF stimulates transcription from the adenovirus E4 promoter by binding to multiple upstream promoter and enhancer elements. DNAase footprint analyses have revealed that there are cooperative interactions between ATF and TFIID (the mammalian TATA factor) when both are bound simultaneously to the promoter and that these interactions in turn facilitate promoter recognition by RNA polymerase II and the general initiation factors TFIIB and TFIIE. However, the complex of TFIID and the other general factors is stable following oligonucleotide-mediated dissociation of ATF from the complete preinitiation complex. These results indicate that TFIID is a direct target for ATF, that these interactions facilitate assembly of a complete preinitiation complex, and that the role of ATF might be transient."
https://openalex.org/W1606308790,"The organizational relationship between the recently identified alpha 3 chain of basement membrane collagen (Butkowski, R.J., Langeveld, J.P.M., Wieslander, J., Hamilton, J., and Hudson, B.G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7874-7877) and collagen IV was determined. This was accomplished by the identification of subunits in hexamers of the NC1 domain of collagen IV that were immunoprecipitated with antibodies prepared against subunits M1, corresponding to alpha 1(IV)NC1 and alpha 2(IV)NC1, and M2, corresponding to alpha 3NC1, and by amino acid sequence analysis. The presence of at least two distinct types of hexamers was revealed, one enriched in M1 and the other enriched in M2, but in both types, M1 and M2 coexist. Evidence was also obtained for the existence of heterodimers comprised of M1 and M2. These results indicate that M2 is an integral component of the NC1 hexamer of collagen IV. The amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal region of M2 was found to be highly related to the collagenous-NC1 junctional region of the alpha 1 chain of collagen IV. Therefore, M2 is designated alpha 3(IV)NC1 and its parent chain alpha 3(IV). These findings lead to a new concept about the structure of collagen IV: namely, 1) collagen IV is comprised of a third chain (alpha 3) together with the two classical ones (alpha 1 and alpha 2); the alpha 3(IV) chain exists within the same triple-helical molecule together with the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains and/or within a separate triple-helical molecule, exclusive of alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains, but connected through the NC1 domains to the classical triple-helical molecule comprised of alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains. Additionally, a portion of those triple-helical molecules exclusive of alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains may be connected to each other through their NC1 domains; and 3) the epitope to which the major reactivity of autoantibodies are targeted in glomerular basement membrane in patients with Goodpasture syndrome is localized to the NC1 domain of the alpha 3(IV) chain."
https://openalex.org/W2023361302,"The human ferritin H chain messenger RNA contains a specific iron-responsive element (IRE) in its 5â€² untranslated region, which mediates regulation by iron of ferritin translation. An RNA gel retardation assay was used to demonstrate the affinity of a specific cytosolic binding protein for the IRE. A single-base deletion in the IRE eliminated both the interaction of the cytoplasmic protein with the IRE and translational regulation. Thus, the regulatory potential of the IRE correlates with its capacity to specifically interact with proteins. Titration curves of binding activity after treatment of cells with an iron chelator suggest that the factor acts as a repressor of ferritin translation."
https://openalex.org/W1968574403,"The human ribosomal RNA promoter contains two distinct control elements (UCE and core) both of which are recognized by the sequence-specific DNA binding protein UBF1, which has now been purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified factor activates RNA polymerase I (RNA pol I) transcription through direct interactions with either control element. A second RNA pol I transcription factor, designated SL1, participates in the promoter recognition process and is required to reconstitute transcription in vitro. Although SL1 alone has no sequence-specific DNA binding activity, deoxyribonuclease I footprinting experiments reveal that a cooperative interaction between UBF1 and SL1 leads to the formation of a new protein-DNA complex at the UCE and core elements. In vitro transcription experiments indicate that formation of the UBF1-SL1 complex is vital for transcriptional activation by UBF1. Thus, protein-protein interactions between UBF1 and SL1 are required for targeting of SL1 to cis-control sequences of the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2010049199,"Transcription of protein-encoding genes by human RNA polymerase II requires multiple ancillary proteins (transcription factors). Interactions between these proteins and the promoter DNA of a viral class II gene (the major late transcription unit of adenovirus) were investigated by enzymatic and chemical footprinting. The experiments indicated that the assembly of functionally active RNA polymerase II-containing transcription preinitiation complexes requires a complete set of transcription factors, and that both specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions are involved. This allows individual steps along the transcription reaction pathway to be tested directly, thus providing a basis for understanding basic transcription initiation mechanisms as well as the regulatory processes that act on them."
https://openalex.org/W1492698022,"The ligand binding domain of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor contains seven imperfect repeats of a 40-amino acid cysteine-rich sequence. Each repeat contains clustered negative charges that have been postulated as ligand-binding sites. The adjacent region of the protein, the growth factor homology region, contains three cysteine-rich repeats (A-C) whose sequence differs from those in the ligand binding domain. To dissect the contribution of these different cysteine-rich repeats to ligand binding, we used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to alter expressible cDNAs for the human LDL receptor which were then introduced into monkey COS cells by transfection. We measured the ability of the mutant receptors to bind LDL, which contains a single protein ligand for the receptor (apoB-100), and beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL), which contains apoB-100 plus multiple copies of another ligand (apoE). The results show that repeat 1 is not required for binding of either ligand. Repeats 2 plus 3 and repeats 6 plus 7 are required for maximal binding of LDL, but not beta-VLDL. Repeat 5 is required for binding of both ligands. Repeat A in the growth factor homology region is required for binding of LDL, but not beta-VLDL. Repeat B is not required for ligand binding. These results support a model for the LDL receptor in which various repeats play additive roles in ligand binding, each repeat making a separate contribution to the binding event."

An antibody was induced to an analog of a high-energy intermediate anticipated along the reaction coordinate of amide hydrolysis. This antibody is an amidase with high specificity and a large rate enhancement (250,000) relative to the uncatalyzed reaction. This reaction represents the kinetically most difficult hydrolysis reaction yet catalyzed by an antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1533807820,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) autophosphorylated under limiting conditions (7 microM [gamma-32P]ATP, 500 microM magnesium acetate, 4 degrees C) was analyzed by CNBr cleavage and peptide mapping to determine the site of autophosphorylation that brings about transition of the kinase to the Ca2+-independent form. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (C3) revealed one major CN-Br 32P-peptide (CB1) that eluted at about 6% propanol. This peptide contained [32P]threonine, but almost no [32P]serine, and migrated as a single band (Mr = 3000-3500) in polyacrylamide gels run in the presence of urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The properties of CB1 were compared to the properties of a 26-residue synthetic peptide containing the CaM-binding and inhibitory domains as well as a consensus phosphorylation sequence (-Arg-Gln-Glu-Thr-) of rat brain CaM-kinase II (residues 282-307 and 283-308 of the alpha and beta subunits, respectively). CB1 and the synthetic peptide comigrated in urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, co-eluted from reverse phase HPLC (C3 and C18) and from Sephadex G-50, and exhibited Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding properties. When the two peptides were subjected to automated Edman sequence analysis, both exhibited a burst of 32P release at cycle 5, which is consistent with the expected amino-terminal sequence of the two peptides, i.e. His-Arg-Gln-Glu-Thr(PO4)-. These findings indicate that autophosphorylation of Thr286 (alpha subunit) and Thr287 (beta subunit) is responsible for transition of CaM-kinase II to the Ca2+-independent form."
https://openalex.org/W1498935560,"A novel polypeptide, designated p18, was detected in a variety of hematopoietic cells by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantitative analysis of p18 indicated its occurrence in a substantially greater amount in acute leukemia relative to nonleukemic cells. The increased amount of p18 in leukemia could not be explained on the basis of specific lineage, differentiation stage, or cell proliferation and thus appears to be a part of the malignant phenotype of the leukemic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1549341998,"Addition of cadmium salts to the growth medium of Schizosaccharomyces pombe leads to synthesis of a Cd.gamma-Glu peptide complex and an enhanced generation of sulfide ions. The gamma-Glu peptide complex functions in the detoxification of heavy metal ions. Native Cd.gamma-Glu peptide complexes contain acid-labile sulfide in the metal-thiolate cluster. Two forms of the complex exist differing primarily in their sulfide content. Sulfide concentrations up to 0.2 and 1.2 mol/mol of peptide were observed in native isolates of forms I and II, respectively. Addition of sulfide to the low sulfide form I converted it to a complex similar to form II. Properties of the Cd.gamma-Glu peptide complex were altered by the incorporation of sulfide ions. Sulfide-dependent electronic transitions in the ultraviolet were evident, and the absorbance maximum of the transition was related to the sulfide content and the bound metal ion. High sulfide forms of the Cd and Zn complexes exhibited absorbance peaks at 318 nm and 255 nm, respectively. Incorporation of sulfide into the Cd.gamma-Glu peptide complex imparted greater thermodynamic stability to the complex, an increased Stokes radius, and an enhanced Cd(II) binding capacity. Sulfide generation may be a cellular response in part to enhance the effectiveness of the gamma-Glu peptide system for Cd(II) detoxification."
https://openalex.org/W1556193518,"The platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (GPIIb-IIIa) recognizes peptides containing the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, a sequence present at two locations in the alpha chain of fibrinogen. GPIIb-IIIa also interacts with peptides containing the carboxyl-terminal 10-15 residues of the fibrinogen gamma chain. We found that the alpha chain tetrapeptide, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), and the gamma chain peptide, Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val (LGGAKQAG-DV), each inhibited fibrinogen binding to ADP-stimulated platelets with Ki values of 15.6 +/- 2.7 and 46.2 +/- 8.2 microM, respectively. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of the peptides was additive, indicating that they interact with GPIIb-IIIa in a mutually exclusive manner. Mutually exclusive binding suggests that either the alpha and gamma chain peptides bind to identical or overlapping sites on the GPIIb-IIIa complex or that one peptide induces a change in the complex that excludes the other. To differentiate between these possibilities, we compared the ability of RGDS and LGGAKQAGDV to inhibit the binding of fibrinogen and two GPIIb-IIIa complex-specific monoclonal antibodies, A2A9 and PAC-1, to ADP-stimulated platelets. A2A9 and PAC-1 appear to bind to different sites on GPIIb-IIIa because A2A9 binds to both stimulated and unstimulated platelets while PAC-1 only binds to stimulated platelets. RGDS specifically inhibited fibrinogen and PAC-1 binding with nearly identical Ki values of 15.6 +/- 2.7 and 20.2 +/- 3.5 microM, respectively. In contrast, LGGAKQAGDV had a differential effect on fibrinogen and PAC-1 binding, inhibiting PAC-1 binding with a Ki of 116.1 +/- 12.9 microM and fibrinogen binding with a Ki of 46.2 +/- 8.2 microM (p less than 0.005). Furthermore, while RGDS had no effect on the binding of the monoclonal antibody A2A9, LGGAKQAGDV was a partial inhibitor of A2A9 binding to activated platelets. These results suggest that the bindings sites for RGDS and LGGAKQAGDV are spatially distinct. They also suggest that ligand-induced changes in GPIIb-IIIa conformation are likely to be responsible for the mutually exclusive nature of alpha and gamma chain peptide binding."

The positions of host and donor cells relative to graft boundaries observed throughout embryonic development and after hatching implicated both radial and tangential cell movements in brain morphogenesis. In addition, transplants containing the entire quail mesencephalon and diencephalon resulted in the transfer of certain aspects of species-typical crowing behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1498526978,"The covalent ligation of the 8.6-kDa polypeptide ubiquitin to various cellular target proteins is believed to represent a fundamental regulatory process. In this mechanism, the ATP-coupled activation and subsequent ligation of ubiquitin are catalyzed by separate enzymes (E1 and E3, respectively) functionally linked by ubiquitin carrier protein (E2). Carrier protein has been proposed to constitute a family of isozymes having molecular masses of 14, 17, 20, 24, and 32 kDa whose role is to shuttle activated polypeptide in the form of a high-energy thiol ester intermediate to the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin. Using a combination of covalent affinity and high performance liquid chromatographic methods, the pututive E2 isozymes have been purified to apparent homogeneity. The E2(14kDa) isozyme resolved into two forms differing in net charge at pH 7.5. All of the E2 isozymes contained only one thiol ester site except for E2(17kDa) and E2(20kDa) which were capable of forming two such adducts per subunit. Thiol ester formation was rapid for the E2 isozymes and required the presence of activating enzyme. In contrast, the reverse reaction of thiol ester transfer from E2 to E1 was kinetically significant for only E2(14kDa), E2(20kDa), and E2(24kDa). The stability of E2(17kDa) and E2(32kDa) to such trapping may reflect a marked shift in binding affinity to E1 upon thiol ester formation. In addition, differential rates for thiol ester formation to each subunit of dimeric E2(14kDa) was also noted. The E2(14kDa) isoforms were approximately 10-fold more active in E3-dependent ubiquitin-protein ligation than either E2(20kDa) or E2(32kDa). Neither E2(17kDa) nor E2(24kDa) supported this reaction. In addition, the thiol ester formed to E2(14kDa) was inherently more reactive since its second order rate constant for the E3-independent transfer of ubiquitin to the small molecular weight nucleophile dithiothreitol was an order of magnitude greater than found for the other isozymes. If these proteins constitute a family of isozymes, they exhibit considerable catalytic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2086404403,"The ability of RNA polymerase I to read through a promoter-bound transcription initiation factor (TIF) was assessed using a dimeric ribosomal RNA gene promoter. Transcription from the upstream promoter is unaffected by TIF bound to the downstream promoter; RNA polymerase I is freely able to read through DNA-bound TIF. In contrast, transcription from the downstream promoter is inhibited by the passage of RNA polymerase I. Readthrough by RNA polymerase I disrupts the downstream TIF-DNA complex, and alters the TIF footprint. A general function for sequences leading to transcription termination upstream of rRNA or other promoters may be the prevention of promoter occlusion in tandem arrays of genes."
https://openalex.org/W1529834112,"The influence of chlorate, an inhibitor of sulfate adenylyltransferase, on biosynthesis and secretion of proteoglycans was investigated in cultured human skin fibroblasts. At up to 10 mM concentrations, chlorate caused a reduction of [35S]sulfate incorporation into small chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan by up to 96%. Incorporation of [3H]leucine and [3H] glucosamine was only slightly affected. No influence was seen on the polymerization degree of the polysaccharide chain as judged by gel filtration, and on the kinetics of secretion of the proteoglycan. Concomitant with reduced sulfation, however, was an increased sensitivity toward chondroitin AC lyase which suggests a diminished epimerization of D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid residues. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that all polysaccharide chains of control chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan exhibited a similar sulfation degree. Chlorate treatment led to the formation of polysaccharide chains of widely varying degree of sulfation, but fully sulfated chains were synthesized even in the presence of 3 mM chlorate, and sulfate-free chondroitin was not detected. Studying the effects of chlorate treatment on the synthesis of other proteoglycan types it was found that, in cell-associated galactosaminoglycans, 6-sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues was less affected than was 4-sulfation. In case of heparan sulfate the synthesis of sulfamate groups was less impaired than sulfate ester formation. Nitrous acid degradation at pH 4.1 indicated the presence of unsubstituted amino groups. Chlorate treatment may be considered as a means for the production of proteoglycans with defined structural alterations."
https://openalex.org/W1511648056,"Purified flagellar filaments of Halobacterium halobium contain three different protein species based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These proteins were designated as flagellins Fla I, Fla II, and Fla III and were characterized as sulfated glycoproteins with N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides of the type GlcA-(1----4)-GlcA-(1----4)-GlcA-(1----4)-Glc. All halobacterial flagellin polypeptides are immunologically cross-reactive. A gene fragment of one flagellin was isolated in an expression vector using antibody probes. Using this gene fragment as probe, we identified, subcloned, and determined the nucleotide sequences of five different but highly homologous flagellin genes. Two flagellin (flg) genes are arranged tandemly at one locus (flg A1 and -2), and the other three in a tandem arrangement at a different locus (flg B1, -2, and -3), Two flg mRNAs were detected, one from the A genes and the other from the B genes. Based on immunological analysis, the products of the flg A1 and A2 are Fla II and Fla I, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1551353917,"Cellular retinol-binding protein, type II (CRBP (II], an abundant protein of the rat small intestine, has recently been shown to be able to bind retinaldehyde in addition to retinol (MacDonald, P.N., and Ong, D. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10550-10556). Retinaldehyde is produced in the intestine by oxidative cleavage of beta-carotene. The next step in the intestinal metabolism of vitamin A is the reduction of retinaldehyde to retinol which is then esterified for incorporation into chylomicrons. In the present study retinaldehyde bound to CRBP(II) was found to be available for reduction by microsomal preparations from rat small intestinal mucosa. The microsomal activity was about 8 times greater than the activity observed for an equal amount of cytosolic protein. Retinaldehyde reduction utilized either NADH or NADPH as cofactor, with NADH being slightly more effective. The apparent Km for retinaldehyde-CRBP(II) was 0.5 microM, and the Vmax was approximately 300 pmol/min/mg protein, a rate more than sufficient for the needs of the animal. The product retinol remained complexed to CRBP(II). The microsomal enzyme activity reduced free and bound retinaldehyde to approximately the same extent, although the aldehyde function of retinaldehyde bound to CRBP(II) was less accessible to chemical reducing agents than that of free retinaldehyde. Retinol bound to CRBP(II) could not be oxidized by the microsomal activity in the presence of NAD+, while free retinol or retinol bound to bovine serum albumin was oxidized to retinaldehyde. The more favorable reduction versus oxidation of retinoid bound to CRBP(II) consequently favored the reaction known to be required for the ultimate conversion of beta-carotene to retinyl esters for export from the gut."
https://openalex.org/W1566897609,"We report the results of experiments which show that cholesterol transfer between membranes cannot proceed by aqueous diffusion, as widely held, but must involve a more complex mechanism. (a) The rate of transfer of [3H]cholesterol from red blood cells was found to vary inversely with the size of the acceptor particle (ghosts, vesicles of ghosts, liposomes, and plasma lipoproteins). (b) The transfer of [3H]cholesterol from red blood cells to ghosts was accelerated by the presence of plasma, even though the plasma competed with the ghosts as an acceptor. (c) The rate of transfer of [3H]cholesterol from red blood cells to ghosts decreased to zero with increasing dilution but was not simply second-order. (d) The cholesterol in retinal rod disc membranes is not at equilibrium with plasma lipoproteins in that disc cholesterol increased when the homogenates were incubated in vitro with plasma. (e) The kinetics of cholesterol transfer cannot be limited by unstirred layer effects since the transfer of lysolecithin in the same system was faster than that of cholesterol by 3 orders of magnitude. The simplest model compatible with all the data suggests a two-step pathway involving a first-order followed by a second-order process. The first step could be a unimolecular activation event, perhaps the movement of the sterol in the donor particle to a more exposed (hydrated) position. In the second step, the activated sterol would be transferred during transient collisions between donor and acceptor particles. When collision is not rate-limiting, the overall process would appear to be simply first-order, hence kinetically indistinguishable from the aqueous diffusion mechanism. The activation-collision model thus not only rationalizes our data but is also consistent with the simpler kinetics previously reported for the transfer of both membrane phospholipids and sterols."
https://openalex.org/W2141117854,"Purified glutathione S-transferase from rat liver cytosol are irreversibly inhibited by the glutathione conjugate of tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone, 2-S-glutathionyl-3,5,6-trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone. The inhibition is due to covalent binding in or near the active site, resulting in modification of a single amino acid residue/subunit, presumably a cysteine residue. The amount of inhibition is related to the molar ratio of the inhibitor and the enzyme and is independent of the enzyme concentration. A 70-80% inhibition is obtained on incubating the enzyme with a 5-fold molar excess of the conjugate. Complete 100% inhibition is never reached. The derivative bound to the enzyme still possesses a quinone structure and is able to react with thiol-containing compounds. Reduction of the enzyme-bound quinone abolishes its reactivity but does not decrease the inhibition. At 0 degrees C, the glutathione conjugate of tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone inhibits the glutathione S-transferases at a much higher rate than the corresponding beta-mercaptoethanol conjugate, indicating a distinct targetting effect of the glutathione moiety. However, the parent compound, tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone, also has a considerable affinity for the enzymes. Although it does not react as fast as the glutathione conjugate, it reacts with the same amino acid residue. Protection from inhibition by the substrate analog S-hexylglutathione also indicates an active site-directed modification. Small but significant differences exist between the different rat liver transferase isoenzymes; using a 20-fold molar excess the inhibition ranges from 78 to 98% for the conjugate, and from 72 to 93% for the quinone, with isoenzyme 1-1 being the most and isoenzyme 2-2 the least inhibited forms."
https://openalex.org/W1542817219,"Three murine liver glutathione transferase (GT, EC 2.5.1.18) have been cloned and sequenced. Two of the cDNA clones, pGT875 and pGT55, encode the murine class-mu GT isoenzymes, GT8.7 and GT9.3, respectively. These two cDNA clones share 85% DNA sequence identity with one another, and the GT8.7 sub-unit encoded by pGT875 shares 92% protein sequence identity with the class-mu rat-3 (Yb1) GT subunit. The third cDNA clone, pGT41, encodes a class-alpha GT subunit that shares 96% protein sequence identity with a mouse Ya gene, 95% identity with a rat-1 (Ya) GT subunit, and 70% identity with the rat-2 (Yc) subunit. These cDNA clones and an oligonucleotide derived from the sequence of a rat class-pi cDNA clone were used to measure the induction of the mu, alpha, and pi classes of GT mRNA in different tissues of mice that were fed the dietary antioxidant 2(3)-tert-butyl hydroxyanisole (BHA). These tissues included liver, intestinal mucosa, kidney, lung, spleen, and brain. Class-mu GT mRNAs that hybridize with pGT875 are most abundant in liver and intestinal mucosa but are also found in kidney and lung, and at low levels in brain and spleen. Class-alpha GT mRNAs are most abundant in BHA-induced and uninduced intestinal mucosa, kidney, and induced liver, and were not found in spleen and brain. Class-mu and -alpha GT mRNA levels increased 15- and 50-fold, respectively, in the liver and 15- and 100-fold in intestinal mucosa in response to BHA induction. BHA increases class-mu mRNAs less than 5-fold in the kidney and lung. Class-pi mRNAs were found in all the tissues examined but were much less responsive to BHA induction. The expression of two cytochrome P-450 mRNAs increased 3-5-fold in liver and intestine after BHA induction. Oligonucleotides from divergent portions of the pGT875 and pGT55 cDNA clones have been used to examine the expression of specific mRNAs from individual class-mu GT genes; these experiments suggest that the GT mRNAs expressed in BHA-induced tissues are also expressed in the uninduced tissue. Measurements of transcription rates in isolated nuclei showed that increased GT mRNA levels are due to increased rates of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1531016194,"Horseradish peroxidase will convert from a five-coordinate high-spin heme at neutral pH to a six-coordinate low-spin heme at alkaline pH. Though alkaline forms of other heme proteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin are known to contain a heme-ligated hydroxide, alkaline horseradish peroxidase has been considered not to contain a ligated hydroxide. Several alternatives have been proposed which would be stronger field ligands than a hydroxide ion. In this report we provide resonance Raman evidence, using Soret excitation, that alkaline horseradish peroxidase does in fact contain a heme iron-ligated hydroxyl group. The band was located for isoenzymes C and A-1 by its sensitivity to 18O substitution and confirmed with 54Fe, 57Fe, and 2H. An isoenzyme of turnip peroxidase was investigated and found to also contain a ligated hydroxide at alkaline pH. The observed peroxidase Fe(III)-OH frequencies are 15-25 cm-1 higher than the corresponding frequencies of alkaline methemoglobin and metmyoglobin and correlate with changes in spin-state distribution. This is explained in the context of hydrogen bonding to a distal histidine which results in increased ligand field strength facilitating the formation of low-spin hemes. It has been demonstrated that the ferryl/ferric redox potential of horseradish peroxidase is markedly lowered at alkaline pH (Hayashi, Y., and Yamazaki, I. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9101-9106). These observations are rationalized in terms of oxidation of a ligated ferric hydroxyl group facilitated through base catalysis by a distal histidine."
https://openalex.org/W1553601962,"This paper demonstrates that heparin-oligosaccharides with low anticoagulant activity have a high capacity to inhibit activation of the amplification pathway of complement in vitro. We prepared heparin-oligosaccharides by partial depolymerization of heparin using purified flavobacterial heparinase. The resulting oligosaccharide mixture was then fractionated using strong anion exchange-high pressure liquid chromatography to produce individual oligosaccharide components of this mixture, with degree of polymerization ranging from 2 to 16. These heparin-oligosaccharides were examined for both their anticoagulant activity and capacity to inhibit activation of the amplification pathway of complement. Although there was little difference among commercial heparins, a correlation between molecular weight and activity to inhibit convertase generation was clearly established for heparin-oligosaccharides between degree of polymerization 2 through 16. Heparin-oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization 10-16 (Mr 3888-5320) demonstrated up to 54% of heparin's activity on a molar basis (and up to 163% of heparin's activity on a weight basis) in inhibiting the amplification pathway of complement in vitro while showing almost no anticoagulant activity.

A nonagglutinating monoclonal antibody to human red blood cells conjugated to a synthetic peptide antigen (in this case residues 579 to 601 of the HIV-1 envelope precursor, Arg-Ile-Leu-Ala-Val-Glu-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Lys-Asp-Gln-Gln-Leu-Leu-Gly-Ile-Trp- Gly-Cys - Ser-Gly-Lys) permitted the detection of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in 10 microliters of whole blood within 2 minutes. Agglutination was specifically inhibited by addition of synthetic peptide antigen but not by unrelated peptides. The frequency of false positive results was 0.1% with HIV-1 seronegative blood donors (n = 874). The false negative results were approximately 1% (n = 81). The autologous red cell agglutination test is potentially suitable for simple, rapid, qualitative screening for antibodies to a variety of antigens of medical and veterinary diagnostic significance."
https://openalex.org/W1565976965,"Transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB), which by itself does not bind stably or specifically to DNA, was purified from cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa cells using five different chromatographic steps. This procedure yields one predominant polypeptide which represents 90% of the most highly purified preparation and shows a relative molecular mass of 60,000, when analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. A similar value was obtained for the native protein by rate zonal centrifugation on glycerol gradients. From these data we conclude that TFIIIB from HeLa cells has a Mr of 60,000 +/- 5,000 and that it functions as a single polypeptide. Highly purified TFIIIB was required and sufficient for the specific transcription of the Xenopus laevis and human tRNA and 5 S RNA genes as well as those for VA RNA when reconstituted with RNA polymerase III and the other appropriate transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1491475074,"Two types of mechanisms for the enzymatic reduction of NO2- to N2O have been proposed. In one, two NO2- ions are reduced in parallel, with the nitrogen-nitrogen bond formed from reduced intermediates. In the second, the two NO2- ions enter the reaction sequentially, with the nitrogen of at least one of the two having a valence of 3+ when the nitrogen-nitrogen bond is formed. Our objective was to distinguish between these two types of mechanism. Toward that end, the exchange of 18O from H2O to NO2- and the overall nitrogen isotopic fractionation factor (beta obs) were measured. The rate of exchange of oxygen from H2O to NO2-, resulting from a protonation-dehydration step preceding reductive events in both mechanisms, was less than 10% of the rate of denitrification at both low and high [NO2-]. The value of beta obs was 1.010 +/- 0.001 and 1.020 +/- 0.001 at low and high [NO2-], respectively. Expressions for beta obs, as a function of the measured rate of entry of oxygen from H2O into NO2-, were derived for both types of mechanism. The measured dependence of beta obs on substrate concentration, as constrained by the 18O exchange data, is inconsistent with the first type of mechanism, but consistent with the second type. Thus, by combining nitrogen isotopic fractionation and 18O exchange data, we rule out any mechanism in Pseudomonas stutzeri in which NO2- ions are reduced in parallel, with the nitrogen-nitrogen bond being formed from reduced intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1575703146,"Protein B23 (Mr/pI = 38,000/5.1) is a major RNA-associated nucleolar phosphoprotein which contains highly acidic segments and has a high affinity for silver ions. Using synthetic oligonucleotides as probes cloned cDNAs encoding protein B23 were isolated and characterized. One of the cDNAs, obtained from a rat brain library, contained an insert of 1232 base pairs of DNA encoding a polypeptide of 292 amino acid residues. Segments of the protein sequence were confirmed by partial sequencing of CNBr fragments from rat hepatoma protein B23. The protein contains a methionine-rich amino-terminal sequence and two highly acidic segments in the center of the sequence. The first acidic segment, in which 11 of the 13 residues are acidic, begins at residue 120 and contains a major phosphorylation site. In the second segment (residues 159-187) there are four copies of the sequence Asp-Asp-Glu, and all but two of the 29 residues have acidic side chains. When the sequence of the rat protein was compared with available sequences from other species a high degree of conservation was found; the 77-residue carboxyl-terminal sequence is identical with that of human protein B23 (Chan, P. K., Chan, W.-Y., Yung, B. Y. M., Cook, R. G., Aldrich, M. B., Ku, D., Goldknopf, I. L., and Busch, H. (1986) J. Biol.

S., Hugle-Dorr, B., and Franke, W. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 1881-1890). Except for the presence of highly acidic regions no significant similarities were found with protein C23 (nucleolin), the other major nucleolar protein."
https://openalex.org/W1495618553,"We have used subunit-specific antibodies to identify and to characterize partially the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits of rat skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on immunoblots. The alpha subunit of rat muscle is a single band of 42 kDa, whereas the beta subunit has an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa. Both alpha and beta subunits are glycosylated and contain one or more N-linked oligosaccharide chains that are sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion. The gamma and delta subunits, on the other hand, each appear as doublets on immunoblots, with apparent molecular masses of 52 kDa (gamma), 48 kDa (gamma') and 58 kDa (delta), 53 kDa (delta'), respectively. In each case, the two bands are structurally related and the lower band is probably the partial degradation product of the corresponding upper band. Each of the four gamma and delta polypeptides is N-glycosylated and contains both endoglycosidase H-sensitive and endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharides. When the AChRs purified from embryonic, neonatal, adult, and denervated adult rat muscles were compared, no differences in the mobilities of alpha, beta, or delta subunits on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels were detected among them, either with or without endoglycosidase treatment. The gamma subunits, which were present in AChRs purified from neonatal, embryonic, or denervated rat muscles, were also identical; no gamma subunit was detected, however, in AChRs of normal adult rat muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1539760887,"Abstract The structural genes (luxA-E) of the Vibrio harveyi luminescent system coding for the luciferase (alpha, beta) and fatty acid reductase (r, s, t) polypeptides can be expressed exclusively in Escherichia coli under the T7 phage promoter providing a convenient method for identifying and locating these genes. luxD which codes for the acyltransferase enzyme producing fatty acids for the luminescent reaction was located immediately above the luciferase genes (luxA, B) with the two other fatty acid reductase genes (luxC, E) flanking these genes, in the same order as found for the Vibrio fischeri luminescent system. By hybridization with luxC DNA probes, a set of mRNAs coding for this gene was detected; part of this set of mRNAs extended downstream and complemented the set of mRNAs previously detected for the other lux structural genes. The luxD gene from a mutant (M17) which requires tetradecanoic acid for light emission was cloned into the T7 system, and upon expression it could be demonstrated that the lack of activity was due to synthesis of a full-length nonfunctional protein and not to introduction of a stop codon. The nucleotide sequence of the luxD gene of the native and mutant strains was determined and shown to consist of an open reading frame of 915 bases preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence with very high homology to the ribosome binding site found for luxA and B. The 3'-sequence was identical to a 669-base open reading frame upstream of the luxA gene reported earlier by Cohn et al. (Cohn, D.H., Mileham, A.J., Simon, M.I., Nealson, K.H., Rausch, S.K., Bonam, D., and Baldwin, T.O. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6139-6146).

Rhombohedral crystals grow in 1.8 to 2.0 M ammonium sulfite, pH 7.8 at 21 degrees C, and tetragonal crystals grow in 2.6 M magnesium sulfate, pH 5.5 at 25 degrees C. Analysis of TNF by isoelectric focusing under native and denaturing conditions indicates that TNF molecules exist as trimers in solution. The rhombohedral cachectin crystals belong to space group R3 and have unit cell constants a = b = c = 47.65 A and alpha = beta = gamma = 88.1 degrees. Density determinations and the space group indicate that the unit cell contains one 51,000-dalton trimer.

https://openalex.org/W1592798792,"The role of specific receptors in the translocation of diphtheria toxin A fragment to the cytosol and for the insertion of the B fragment into the cell membrane was studied. To induce nonspecific binding to cells, toxin was either added at low pH, or biotinylated toxin was added at neutral pH to cells that had been treated with avidin. In both cases large amounts of diphtheria toxin became associated with the cells, but there was no increase in the toxic effect. There was also no increase in the amount of A fragment that was translocated to the cytosol, as estimated from protection against externally added Pronase E. In cells where specific binding was abolished by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate, trypsin, or 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid, unspecific binding did not induce intoxication or protection against protease. This was also the case in untreated L cells, which showed no specific binding of the toxin. When Vero cells with diphtheria toxin bound to specific receptors were exposed to low pH, the cells were permeabilized to K+, whereas this was not the case when the toxin was bound nonspecifically at low pH or via avidin-biotin. The data indicate that the cell-surface receptor for diphtheria toxin facilitates both insertion of the B fragment into the cell membrane and translocation of the A fragment to the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1594174694,"We have studied the regulation, by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), of vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (28-kDa CaBP) mRNA in chick tissues in vivo. Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA was carried out using, as hybridization probes, synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to chick 28-kDa CaBP mRNA. In vitamin D-deficient chicks, 28-kDa CaBP mRNA was virtually undetectable in intestine, was clearly detectable in kidney, and present at the highest levels in cerebellum. After a single intravenous dose of 500 ng of 1,25-(OH)2D3, intestinal 28-kDa CaBP mRNA levels were increased 50-fold, kidney levels were increased 4-fold, and cerebellum levels were unchanged. Increased levels of 28-kDa CaBP mRNA were appreciated 2 h after induction and were maximal at 12 h. Pretreatment of vitamin D-deficient chicks with actinomycin D had little effect on the acute phase of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of 28-kDa CaBP mRNA in intestine but blunted the induction in kidney. Pretreatment with cycloheximide caused a delayed response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the intestine, although control (noninhibition) levels of 28-kDa CaBP mRNA were present 12 h after hormone administration. By contrast, in the kidney, cycloheximide pretreatment resulted in an increased steady-state (vitamin D-deficient) level of 28-kDa CaBP mRNA, but completely abolished the induction of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Our studies indicate that, whereas 1,25-(OH)2D3 does not regulate 28-kDa CaBP mRNA levels in the brain, the hormone modulates 28-kDa CaBP gene expression in intestine and kidney in a tissue-specific manner, by acting through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W288896935,"The influence of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection on nucleotide binding and phosphorylation of an Mr 68,000 host-encoded protein (p68) was examined. The phosphorylation of p68 in homogenates from TMV-infected tissues was 4-fold greater than in homogenates from mock inoculated tissues. Phosphorylation of p68 in extracts from mock inoculated tissues was enhanced by the addition of double-stranded (ds) RNA. Nucleotide photoaffinity labeling experiments indicate that p68 contains an ATP binding site with characteristics consistent with protein kinase activity. Antiserum raised against a dsRNA-dependent protein kinase activity. Antiserum raised against a dsRNA-dependent protein kinase from interferon-treated human cells immunoprecipitated p68 from extracts of TMV-infected tissue, and p68-containing immunocomplexes catalyzed the phosphorylation of endogenous p68. These data suggest that p68 may be an autophosphorylating, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase involved in viral pathogenesis. Based upon analogous functions demonstrated for dsRNA-dependent protein kinases in mammalian systems, p68 may have a role in the regulation of protein synthesis and viral replication in infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1833753548,"We have investigated the influence of amino acid residues on hepatic clearance of oligopeptides by determining the rate of disappearance (nmol.(min.g liver)-1) of selective oligopeptides from the medium during isolated rat liver perfusion. (a) N terminus: the rate of disappearance of Ala-Leu was greater (p less than 0.01) than those of Gly-Leu, Phe-Leu, and Arg-Leu (208 +/- 13, 135 +/- 13, 116 +/- 12, and 127 +/- 12, respectively). (b) C terminus: the rate of disappearance of Leu-Ala (244 +/- 18) was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than that of Leu-Gly (145 +/- 16). (c) Number of residues: with each increase in the number of alanine residues (2-4) there was a significant increase in the rate of peptide disappearance, and conversely, with each increase in the number of glycine residues (2-6) there was a significant decrease in the rate of peptide disappearance. Further studies showed no peptide transport by isolated liver plasma membrane vesicles and no significant correlation between the rates of peptide disappearance and hydrolase activities of the perfusion medium but highly significant correlation with hydrolase activity of plasma membrane. We conclude that certain amino acid residues, such as alanine, enhance hepatic clearance of oligopeptides by increasing their affinity as substrates for plasma membrane peptide hydrolases."
https://openalex.org/W1522842081,"Phospholipase A2s hydrolyze aggregated phospholipid substrates much more rapidly than dispersed monomeric ones. Whether this is a consequence of interface-associated conformational changes of the enzyme or of the substrate, or of both, remains a key question in lipid enzymology. This problem is addressed herein using a rationally designed probe of substrate conformation. (1,3/2)-1-O-(phosphorylcholine)-2,3-O-dihexanoylcyclopentane-1,2,3 -triol is a novel short chain phosphatidylcholine analogue in which the glycerol-like backbone is part of a five-membered ring and therefore covalently constrained within a small defined range of conformations. To the extent that the constrained analogue resists aggregation-associated conformational changes, it provides a means for assessing the contribution of such changes to phospholipase A2 action on aggregated phospholipids. The monomeric (-)-cyclopentanoid analogue is a substrate for phospholipase A2s from Naja naja naja venom. However, when this constrained phospholipid is aggregated, its hydrolysis rate is not enhanced, in contrast to its unconstrained counterpart, 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphorylcholine. This lack of activation was not caused by a failure of the enzyme to bind the micellar, constrained analogue. While the constrained analogue does not show interfacial activation, it does show the activation of phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis typical of phosphorylcholine-containing lipids. Hence, these results strongly support the contention that specific packing-induced conformations of aggregated substrate play a substantial role in the large interfacial activations observed with phospholipase A2."
https://openalex.org/W1536295751,"Abstract Previous spectroscopic studies on the phycocyanobilin-containing peptide beta-2T from Synechococcus sp. 6301 C-phycocyanin and the phycoerythrobilin-containing peptide beta-2TP from Porphyridium cruentum B-phycoerythrin indicated a different single thioether mode of attachment, postulated to be through the D-ring of the tetrapyrrole, in contrast to the A-ring linkage established for the other singly linked bilins in these proteins (Bishop, J.E., Lagarias, J.C., Nagy, J. O., Schoenleber, R.W., Rapoport, H., Klotz, A.V., and Glazer, A.N. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6790-6796; Klotz, A.V., Glazer, A.N., Bishop, J.E., Nagy, J.O., and Rapoport, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6797-6805). The crystal structure of Agmenellum quadruplicatum C-phycocyanin at 2.5-A resolution (Schirmer, T., Bode, W., and Huber, R. (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 196, 677-695) supports an A-ring linkage for all three phycocyanobilins. Consequently we have re-evaluated our proposed structural assignments by further 1H NMR studies. Two-dimensional homonuclear correlated and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopic data presented here show that all three bilins in Synechococcus 6301 C-phycocyanin are attached solely through the A-ring, complementary to the crystallographic data. The evidence from the NMR data for all bilin peptides examined includes the dipoledipole interactions of the 5-H with the 3-H, 3'-H, and a pyrrole methyl group (7-CH3); the corresponding interactions would not be possible in a D-ring-linked bilin. The 5-H also consistently exhibits allylic J-coupling to the 3-H, supporting A-ring linkage assignment. These data are inconsistent with the alternative D-ring linkage assignment since this would involve J-coupling through five bonds. Examination of the phycoerythrobilin beta-2 position in B-phycoerythrin also reveals an A-ring type of attachment by similar criteria. We conclude that all singly linked bilins are attached through the A-ring."
https://openalex.org/W1500009177,"A great mystery in the mechanism of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and many other lipolytic enzymes is the induced by micellar but not monomeric substrates. Equally mysterious is the lack of interfacial activation in bee venom PLA2, as opposed to PLA2s from pancreas and other sources. We have probed these problems using the conformationally restricted short-chain cyclopentano-analogues of diacylphosphatidylcholine (Cp-DCnPC, all-trans isomer). In the reaction catalyzed by bovine pancreatic PLA2, Cp-DC8PC behaved differently from DC8PC in that its monomers and micelles showed comparable activities (but lower than the activity of DC8PC). This result suggests that the activity of PLA2 can be regulated by conformation and supports the substrate conformation model (Wells, M. A. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 2248-2257), but raises a question as to whether Cp-DC8PC mimics monomers or micelles of DC8PC. Conformational analysis by 1H NMR revealed that monomeric Cp-DC8PC was conformationally restricted near the carbonyl region, a property characteristic of micelles. Thus, monomeric CP-DC8PC can be considered as a conformational analogue of micelles, but the important structural feature lies in the CH2COO region instead of the glycerol backbone. CP-DC8PC was then used to test a previous proposal that the bee venom PLA2 hydrolyzes monomers but not micelles (which would predict little or no activity for Cp-DC8PC since its conformation is micelle-like whether below or above its critical micelle concentration). The results showed that Cp-DC8PC is a relatively good for the bee venom PLA2 in comparison with the pancreatic PLA2. This and other evidence together suggest that the bee venom PLA2 is not sensitive to the conformation of monomeric and micellar substrates and hydrolyzes both monomers and micelles. The results in both PLA2s demonstrate the usefulness of cyclopentano-phospholipids in probing the mechanism of phospholipases and the roles of conformation in the catalysis of PLA2."
https://openalex.org/W1622184364,"Actobindin, a 25,000-dalton dimeric protein purified from Acanthamoeba castellanii was previously shown to form a 1:1 molar complex with both Acanthamoeba and rabbit muscle G-actin with KD values of about 5 and 7 microM, respectively, and not to interact with F-actin (Lambooy, P. K., and Korn, E. D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 17150-17155). We now find that actobindin is a much more potent inhibitor of the early phases of polymerization of both Acanthamoeba and muscle G-actin than can be accounted for by its binding to G-actin. Actobindin inhibits the polymerization of both G-ATP-actin and G-ADP-actin, and has little, if any, effect on the rate of ATP hydrolysis that accompanies polymerization of G-ATP-actin. The kinetics of actin polymerization in the presence of actobindin are qualitatively consistent with the postulation that actobindin binds reversibly to and inhibits the elongation of an intermediate between G-actin and F-actin, perhaps a small oligomer(s) or a species in equilibrium with such an intermediate. This hypothesis implies the, at least transient, existence of an actin species with properties different from those of monomers and filaments. Actobindin may, then, provide a useful experimental tool for investigating the still relatively obscure early steps in actin polymerization. Irrespective of its mechanism of action, actobindin might serve in situ to reduce the rate of actin polymerization de novo while having relatively little effect on the rates of elongation of existing filaments or from actobindin-resistant nucleating sites."
https://openalex.org/W1547624238,"Rat liver glycine methyltransferase, a homotetramer, exhibits sigmoidal rate behavior with respect to S-adenosylmethionine (Ogawa, H., and Fujioka, M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3447-3452). The binding experiment shows that the sigmoidicity observed in initial velocity kinetics is explained by the cooperative binding of S-adenosylmethionine to the catalytic sites residing on each subunit. Limited proteolysis of glycine methyltransferase with trypsin in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine yields an enzyme lacking the NH2-terminal 8 residues. The proteolytically modified enzyme retains a tetrameric structure. The truncated enzyme shows no cooperativity with respect to S-adenosylmethionine binding and kinetics. It has values of Vmax and Km for glycine identical to those of the native enzyme, but a 3-fold lower [S]0.5 value for S-adenosylmethionine. The proteolytic modification is without effect on the circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra. Furthermore, the protein fluorescence of the modified enzyme is quenched upon addition of S-adenosylmethionine to the same extent as observed with the native enzyme. These results suggest that a short NH2-terminal segment, which lies outside the active site, is important for communication between subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1587702697,"The hydrolysis of thioester containing phospholipids by rat liver plasmalemma phospholipase A1 was measured in a continuous spectrophotometric assay. In this assay thioester substrates were employed which, upon hydrolysis, liberated a free thiol which was reacted with 4,4â€²-dithiopyridine to yield the product 4-thiopyridone that absorbs at 324 nm. Thioester substrates, prepared by chemical synthesis, were used in phospholipid and Triton X-100 micelles for kinetic analysis carried out according to the method of Hendrickson and Dennis (Hendrickson, H.S., and Dennis, E.A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5734-5739). Vmax, Ks, and Km values obtained for various isomers and racemic mixtures of the synthetic thioester analogs are compared with corresponding oxyester substrates. Unnatural sn-1 isomers competitively inhibited the hydrolysis of natural sn-3 isomers of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid. Furthermore, the sn-1 isomer of phosphatidic acid was hydrolyzed by phospholipase A1, but with lower catalytic efficiency than the sn-3 isomer. The presence of a thioester at the sn-1 position did not change the Vmax significantly, as compared to the oxyester phospholipids. When two thioesters were present on the phospholipid molecule, the Vmax was decreased significantly. A convenient synthesis of 1-monothioester analogs of phospholipids is reported. The results presented show the usefulness of the spectrophotometric assay for measuring phospholipase A1 activity as well as the influence of racemic mixtures and thioesters on the hydrolytic rate."

Complicating the matter further, new research findings suggest that the health effects of ozone have additional dimensions not contemplated in the setting of the original standard for ambient air quality. Moreover, other research calls into question the strategy for controlling ozone on which previous actions have been based."
https://openalex.org/W1498146861,"To evaluate the synthesis and initial processing of the insulin receptor precursor, we compared cell-free translation of rat liver poly(A)+ RNA in a reticulocyte lysate system with metabolically labeled rat hepatoma (Fao) cells. In in vitro translation assays, the primary L-[35S]cysteine-labeled products of rat liver mRNA specifically immunoprecipitable with insulin receptor antiserum were two closely migrating polypeptides with a Mr range of 160,000-164,000 (n = 7). This is similar to the size predicted by the insulin receptor cDNA sequence. When heterologous microsomal membranes were included in the cell-free system to process newly synthesized proteins co-translationally, the receptor precursors migrated as larger species of 180 +/- 2 kDa (n = 3). For comparison, when Fao cells were treated with tunicamycin to block core N-glycosylation and pulse-labeled with L-[35S]methionine, two closely migrating precursors were labeled that co-migrated with the unprocessed in vitro translation products (approximately 160 kDa). Pulse labeling of Fao cells in the absence of tunicamycin revealed receptor precursor species of 188 and 198 kDa that rapidly disappeared (t1/2 = 54 min) as the receptor subunits were observed. Thus, the initial products of insulin receptor mRNA translation are two approximately 162-kDa polypeptides that are rapidly processed in intact cells and can only be observed by in vitro studies or by using inhibitors of core glycosylation. Insulin proreceptor species can also be partially glycosylated during cell-free translation by added microsomal membranes. This is the first description of cell-free translation of the insulin proreceptor in a system that will allow detailed characterization of the earliest steps in insulin receptor biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1537058042,"Proteoglycans were extracted under nondissociative conditions from superficial and deeper layers of dog normal articular cartilage. The purified a-A1 preparations were characterized by velocity gradient centrifugation. Superficial specimens exhibited an abundant population of slow sedimenting aggregates whereas the aggregates of deeper preparations sedimented as two well-defined families of molecules. These dissimilarities in the size distribution of the aggregates observed between superficial and deeper a-A1 preparations derived most of all from differences in their content of hyaluronate and link proteins: (a) superficial preparations contained twice as much hyaluronate as deeper specimens; (b) superficial aggregates were link-free and unstable at pH 5.0 whereas deeper preparations contained link-proteins and their faster sedimenting aggregates were stabilized against dissociation at pH 5.0. In these proteoglycan preparations from different cartilage layers, the monomers exhibited an identical capacity for aggregation and the hyaluronate molecules displayed quite similar molecular weight (Mr = 5 x 10(5] and aggregating capacity. These observations as well as aggregating studies conducted with highly purified link protein and purified hyaluronate specimens of different molecular weights support the following conclusions: (a) link protein not only stabilizes proteoglycan aggregates but also enhances the aggregating capacity of hyaluronate; (b) for all practical purposes, the slow sedimenting aggregates represent a secondary complex of hyaluronate and proteoglycan monomers whereas the fast sedimenting aggregates may be considered as a ternary complex wherein link protein stabilizes the hyaluronate-proteoglycans interaction; (c) the distinctive heterogeneity of articular cartilage can be related to structurally different proteoglycan aggregates. The structural dissimilarities observed between superficial and deeper aggregates could reflect the different macromolecular organization of the proteoglycan molecules in the territorial and interterritorial matrices, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2136955088,"Serum-free culture medium conditioned by an established human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, CAPAN-1, contains copious amounts of immunoreactivity due to pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) as demonstrated by radioimmunoassay. The immunoreactive substance was purified from the conditioned medium to apparent homogeneity by trypsin affinity and gel filtration chromatography with an overall recovery of 40%, and its primary structure was determined by Edman degradation. The immunoreactive substance is a peptide of 56 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 6,241. Its amino acid composition, primary structure, and inhibitory effect against trypsin are indistinguishable from those of human pancreatic juice PSTI, indicating that this substance is PSTI itself. This is the first direct demonstration that tumor cells secrete PSTI in vitro. When CAPAN-1 was inoculated into a nude mouse, it produced a tumor and the tumor synthesized human PSTI in vivo, as demonstrated by the fact that the tumor extract contained 99.0 +/- 26.2 ng of human PSTI/mg of protein, while PSTI was not detected in extracts from other tissues examined. Furthermore, high levels of human PSTI (14.3 +/- 2.6 ng/ml) were detected in the serum of tumor-bearing mice but not in that of nontumor-bearing mice, suggesting that PSTI secreted from the tumor appears in the blood circulation. Taken together, these results strongly support the view that the serum levels of PSTI are elevated in cancer-bearing patients due to secretion of this peptide from tumor cells per se."
https://openalex.org/W1583235731,"Abstract 125I-Calmodulin (125I-CaM) binding to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes isolated from skeletal muscle cells was investigated, and the CaM receptors associated with the membrane were identified by using the photoaffinity cross-linker methyl-4-azidobenzimidate or the chemical cross-linker dithiobis-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl propionate. Exogenous CaM binds to CaM-depleted membranes in a Ca2+- or Mg2+-dependent way. When both cations are added together to the reaction medium, the stimulatory effects appear to be additive, suggesting that Ca2+ and Mg2+ act by two distinct mechanisms. The Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent binding of CaM is specific since it is inhibited by unlabeled CaM or by trifluoperazine. Furthermore, it is saturable and shows one class of high affinity binding sites with a KD of about 52 nM and a beta max of about 5 pmol/mg of protein. The sensitivity of Ca2+ is expressed in two steps reaching half-saturation at free Ca2+ concentrations of about 1.6 x 10(-7) and 3 x 10(-5) M, respectively. On the other hand, the sensitivity to Mg2+ is expressed in one step with a half-saturation Mg2+ concentration of about 2 x 10(-3) M. Electrophoretic analysis in a polyacrylamide gradient and subsequent autoradiography demonstrated a major CaM-binding protein of about 60 kDa and five minor CaM receptors of about 148, 125, 41, 33, and 23 kDa, respectively. The major labeled protein (60 kDa) probably represents the CaM-dependent component involved in Ca2+ release from SR, whereas the others represent a previously unrecognized class of CaM receptors in skeletal SR."
https://openalex.org/W157153443,"After exposure to compactin, the competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 22% of CHO-K1 cells contained abnormally high numbers of chromosomes. In two populations of cells selected for compactin resistance 31 and 33% of the cells contain more than 22 chromosomes. Some cell lines isolated from these populations have the wild type chromosome number of 20-21, while others have a broad distribution of chromosome number, often with a mean around 36-40. Finally, Chinese hamster ovary cells that are mutant for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and therefore auxotrophic for mevalonate were starved for that compound. This treatment also increased the number of cells containing extra chromosomes. These results indicate that interruption of the cellular supply of mevalonate results in abnormal chromosome number."
