https://openalex.org/W2018853587,"Oat seeds with a higher protein content as a result of chemical applications in 1967 yielded 21 to 42 percent more grain in 1968. Wheat seed, whether from Michigan, Illinois, or Mexico, that contained more protein as a result of field applications of chemicals or nitrogen developed into larger seedlings. The content of protein in the seed correlated with subsequent growth and yield, indicating that the amount of endogenous protein or of a proteinaceous moiety, which can be controlled, may be an important factor in subsequent yield of major agronomic crops."

https://openalex.org/W2002338790,"Pecoraite is a new phase in the natural system H(2)O-NiO-MgOSiO(2), the nickel analog of clinochrysotile. It occurs in cracks in the Wolf Creek meteorite in Australia where it was formed under hydrothermal conditions. Particles of pecoraite are very small curved plates which have begun to coil; some have achieved spiral form."

https://openalex.org/W2079032493,"Uranium concentrations and distributions in separated clinopyroxenes of eclogites from four different sites have been studied by the fission track method. Types of uranium occurrences included (i) inhomogeneously distributed clusters, (ii) line concentrations at cracks, and (iii) uniform distributions in the body of the mineral. Different grains from the same sample generally vary by factors of 2 to 4 in uniformly distributed uranium concentration. Samples from different locations vary in their average uniformly distributed uranium concentration by a factor of approximately 1000 (that is, from 0.01 to 20 parts per billion of uranium). The degree of homogeneity also varies markedly from one site to the next. The clinopyroxenes from the only oceanic locality studied (Salt Lake Crater) contained both the largest concentration of uranium (15 to 20 parts per billion) and the most uniform uranium distribution. This study suggests that, if total uranium concentrations in eclogitic clinopyroxenes are less than a few parts per billion, much if not most of the uranium may occur as contaminants along cracks or in microinclusions of unknown origin."

https://openalex.org/W1980045544,"I was surprised to discover from Alexander Helleman's article (News & Comment, [16 Feb., p. 902][1]) that we had reached “consensus” on future x-ray generation at the International Committee on Future Accelerators Workshop on 4th Generation Light Sources, hosted by the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. In fact, the group of more than 100 international scientists found it difficult even to agree on the definition of “4th Generation,” let alone have a precise view of the future. While linear accelerator (linac)-based free electron lasers (FELs) did have their strong advocates, as Helleman describes, there was more to the meeting than that.

FELs have already demonstrated success as powerful infrared facilities in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere, mostly on the basis of relatively low-energy electron linacs. However, electron storage rings are likely to remain better value for the money in the higher energy range from 100 megaelectron volts to at least several gigaelectron volts; such energies are needed for the next step of user facilities using very ultraviolet, extreme ultraviolet, and even soft x-ray output. Of course, if an accelerator has already been funded for other purposes [such as the TESLA linac at DESY (Germany's particle physics laboratory near Hamburg)], then it makes sense to exploit it for FEL development. In contrast to such unusual (and technologically demanding) linacs, there are already large numbers of storage rings in use or planned around the world, and it seems logical to explore the use of FELs on these as a favored option. Successful demonstrations have been conducted for more than 10 years, and one UV user facility now exists at the LURE center near Paris. It seems likely that the present Russian world record for FEL output wavelength [240 nanometers (nm)] will be broken later this year as the Duke University storage ring in the United States comes on stream. The workshop concluded that storage ring FEL technology should reach 50 nm within 2 years and 20 nm soon afterwards (the possibility of 4 nm was also discussed).

It is far too early to write an obituary for both the 3rd Generation Light Sources and the FELs they are likely to contain in the future. As usual, a number of complementary sources are going to emerge, and each will have its application.
