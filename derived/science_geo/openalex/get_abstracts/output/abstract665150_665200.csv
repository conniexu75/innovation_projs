https://openalex.org/W3110926944,"It is unclear whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019, can enter the brain. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 binds to cells via the S1 subunit of its spike protein. We show that intravenously injected radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the blood–brain barrier in male mice, was taken up by brain regions and entered the parenchymal brain space. I-S1 was also taken up by the lung, spleen, kidney and liver. Intranasally administered I-S1 also entered the brain, although at levels roughly ten times lower than after intravenous administration. APOE genotype and sex did not affect whole-brain I-S1 uptake but had variable effects on uptake by the olfactory bulb, liver, spleen and kidney. I-S1 uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb was reduced by lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. Mechanistic studies indicated that I-S1 crosses the blood–brain barrier by adsorptive transcytosis and that murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not in kidney, liver or spleen uptake. Rhea at al. show that intravenously injected, radiolabeled SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 protein crosses the mouse blood–brain barrier, likely through the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis and is also taken up by peripheral tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3111182037,"FAT1, which encodes a protocadherin, is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers1–5. However, the role and the molecular mechanisms by which FAT1 mutations control tumour initiation and progression are poorly understood. Here, using mouse models of skin squamous cell carcinoma and lung tumours, we found that deletion of Fat1 accelerates tumour initiation and malignant progression and promotes a hybrid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. We also found this hybrid EMT state in FAT1-mutated human squamous cell carcinomas. Skin squamous cell carcinomas in which Fat1 was deleted presented increased tumour stemness and spontaneous metastasis. We performed transcriptional and chromatin profiling combined with proteomic analyses and mechanistic studies, which revealed that loss of function of FAT1 activates a CAMK2–CD44–SRC axis that promotes YAP1 nuclear translocation and ZEB1 expression that stimulates the mesenchymal state. This loss of function also inactivates EZH2, promoting SOX2 expression, which sustains the epithelial state. Our comprehensive analysis identified drug resistance and vulnerabilities in FAT1-deficient tumours, which have important implications for cancer therapy. Our studies reveal that, in mouse and human squamous cell carcinoma, loss of function of FAT1 promotes tumour initiation, progression, invasiveness, stemness and metastasis through the induction of a hybrid EMT state. In mouse and human squamous cell carcinoma, loss of function of FAT1 promotes tumour initiation, malignant progression and metastasis through the activation of a hybrid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3134314273,"The designer approach has become a new paradigm in accessing novel quantum phases of matter. Moreover, the realization of exotic states such as topological insulators, superconductors and quantum spin liquids often poses challenging or even contradictory demands for any single material. For example, it is presently unclear if topological superconductivity, which has been suggested as a key ingredient for topological quantum computing, exists at all in any naturally occurring material . This problem can be circumvented by using designer heterostructures combining different materials, where the desired physics emerges from the engineered interactions between the different components. Here, we employ the designer approach to demonstrate two major breakthroughs - the fabrication of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures combining 2D ferromagnetism with superconductivity and the observation of 2D topological superconductivity. We use molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow two-dimensional islands of ferromagnetic chromium tribromide (CrBr$_3$) on superconducting niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) and show the signatures of one-dimensional Majorana edge modes using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). The fabricated two-dimensional vdW heterostructure provides a high-quality controllable platform that can be integrated in device structures harnessing topological superconductivity. Finally, layered heterostructures can be readily accessed by a large variety of external stimuli potentially allowing external control of 2D topological superconductivity through electrical, mechanical, chemical, or optical means."

In this study, we examined the physical state of condensed chromatin in vitro and in vivo. Our in vitro studies demonstrate that self-association of nucleosomal arrays under a wide range of solution conditions produces supramolecular condensates in which the chromatin is physically constrained and solid-like. By measuring DNA mobility in living cells, we show that condensed chromatin also exhibits solid-like behavior in vivo. Representative heterochromatin proteins, however, display liquid-like behavior and coalesce around the solid chromatin scaffold. Importantly, euchromatin and heterochromatin show solid-like behavior even under conditions that produce limited interactions between chromatin fibers.

Long-standing hierarchical models of chromatin folding have largely been disproven, and new models based on clustering of nucleosomes (Otterstrom et al., 2019Otterstrom J. Castells-Garcia A.

Trans. 2018; 46: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have taken their place. In these new models, interphase and mitotic chromosomes are assembled from 10-nm chromatin without subsequent helical coiling. Concomitantly, although the classical 30-nm fiber may be present locally throughout the genome, folded helical fibers are now thought to be absent in bulk from most animal cells and tissues. Although the evidence in favor of models lacking the 30-nm fiber is substantial, the mechanisms by which extended 10-nm fibers are packaged into higher-order heterochromatin and euchromatin domains have not been established. It is widely held that the biophysical properties associated with condensed chromatin are regulatory in nature. Consequently, determining the physical state of condensed chromatin is critical for understanding mechanisms that modulate genome function. Concomitant with the new models of chromatin organization in the nucleus, in vitro studies of chromatin dynamics have also shifted focus. After decades of emphasis on 30-nm fibers (Hansen, 2002Hansen J.C. Conformational dynamics of the chromatin fiber in solution: determinants, mechanisms, and functions.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Folded 30-nm structures are first observed when cations are titrated into a purified chromatin sample (Finch and Klug, 1976Finch J.T. Klug A. Solenoidal model for superstructure in chromatin.Proc.

At higher cation concentrations that better approximate those found in vivo (Strick et al., 2001Strick R. Strissel P.L. Gavrilov K. Levi-Setti R. Cation-chromatin binding as shown by ion microscopy is essential for the structural integrity of chromosomes.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), chromatin assembles into condensates. Chromatin condensates have been studied for many years. Historically, chromatin condensates were first referred to as precipitants or insoluble aggregates based on their size and the ease with which they pelleted upon centrifugation. Nevertheless, condensate assembly is freely reversible and requires the core histone tail domains (Gordon et al., 2005Gordon F. Luger K. Hansen J.C.

The structural features of chromatin condensates formed by defined 12-mer nucleosomal arrays in 4–10 mM MgCl2 have been determined recently (Maeshima et al., 2016bMaeshima K. Rogge R. Tamura S. Joti Y. Hikima T. Szerlong H. Krause C. Herman J. Seidel E. DeLuca J. et al.Nucleosomal arrays self-assemble into supramolecular globular structures lacking 30-nm fibers.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 1115-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The condensates had a globular morphology and reached 0.5–1.0 μm in diameter, as judged by fluorescence and electron microscopy. Sedimentation velocity experiments indicated that the condensates sedimented in the 300,000 S range, documenting that these globular structures are stable in solution (Maeshima et al., 2016bMaeshima K.

The nucleosomal arrays that made up the condensates were packaged as irregular 10-nm fibers, as is the case with bulk chromatin in vivo (Eltsov et al., 2008Eltsov M. Maclellan K.M. Maeshima K. Frangakis A.S. Dubochet J. Analysis of cryo-electron microscopy images does not support the existence of 30-nm chromatin fibers in mitotic chromosomes in situ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Indirect evidence of the existence of liquid chromatin in vitro and in vivo comes from studies of chromatin binding proteins (CBX2, CBX5, MeCP2, SUV39H1, and TRIM28) that can undergo LLPS at micromolar concentrations in near-physiological buffers. The related chromobox proteins HP1apha (CBX5) (Larson et al., 2017Larson A.G. Elnatan D. Keenen M.M. Trnka M.J. Johnston J.B. Burlingame A.L. Agard D.A. Redding S. Narlikar G.J.

MeCP2 is a chromatin and methyl DNA binding protein associated with pericentric heterochromatin in vertebrates.

Phase separation drives heterochromatin domain formation.Nature. 2017; 547: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the constitutive and facultative heterochromatin structures found in cells are formed and maintained by liquid-liquid unmixing and phase separation of the associated chromatin binding proteins. In this model, chromatin is a passive player, and LLPS is driven by the intrinsic properties of the proteins bound to chromatin. Despite the attractiveness of liquid condensate formation as a mechanism to explain chromatin packaging and condensation, the contribution of condensed chromatin to the mechanical integrity of the nucleus and its ability to respond to extranuclear forces applied to the nuclear surface are difficult to reconcile with a liquid state. Two groups have recently studied the contribution of chromatin organization to mechanical stability of the nucleus. One found that the ability of the nucleus to resist an applied force was reduced approximately 10-fold by mildly digesting linker DNA and approximately 3-fold by treating cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors (Maeshima et al., 2018Maeshima K. Tamura S. Shimamoto Y. Chromatin as a nuclear spring.Biophys. Physicobiol. 2018; 15: 189-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Shimamoto et al., 2017Shimamoto Y. Tamura S. Masumoto H. Maeshima K.

Cell. 2019; 30: 2320-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar further demonstrated that cells adapt to mechanical strain by activating mechanically sensitive ion channels, which stimulates the histone methylation machinery to drive assembly of more heterochromatin. The increased heterochromatinization of the nucleus resulted in increased resistance to externally applied stress (Stephens et al., 2019Stephens A.D. Liu P.Z. Kandula V. Chen H. Almassalha L.M. Herman C. Backman V. O’Halloran T. Adam S.A. Goldman R.D. et al.Physicochemical mechanotransduction alters nuclear shape and mechanics via heterochromatin formation.Mol. Biol.

This mechanical property is more consistent with a solid or gel state of bulk chromatin during interphase. In this study, we critically assessed the mobility of defined nucleosomal arrays and native chromatin fragments in chromatin condensates that form in vitro under the conditions used by Maeshima et al., 2016bMaeshima K.

When the properties of the condensates formed in MgCl2-containing buffers were examined, we found that the packaged nucleosomal arrays were immobile, as in a solid- or gel-like state. Formation of liquid condensates could be induced by divalent cations, but only in the presence of DTT, BSA, and acetate anions. Under all other solution conditions examined, packaged nucleosomal arrays in condensates were constrained and solid-like. For our studies of chromatin in vivo, we incorporated fluorescent nucleotides into the genomic DNA of living cells, which enabled tracking of the mobility of the chromosomal DNA molecule rather than associated chromatin proteins. We found that DNA motion in heterochromatin and euchromatin domains was constrained so that it did not mix with surrounding chromatin even after hyperacetylation-induced decondensation. Finally, by evaluating constitutive heterochromatin at the pericentromere, we show that solid-like chromatin supports formation of liquid protein condensates in vivo. Our study provides concordant in vitro and in vivo results indicating that condensed chromatin is packaged into a solid- or gel-like state, supporting the concept of a globally constrained genome. Our results further demonstrate that solid chromatin formation is inherent to the nucleosomal array with no requirement for nonhistone chromatin proteins. In vitro, chromatin forms condensates under a wide range of salt conditions (Gibson et al., 2019Gibson B.A. Doolittle L.K. Schneider M.W.G. Jensen L.E. Gamarra N. Henry L. Gerlich D.W. Redding S.

In this study, we wanted to find out whether chromatin in condensates is mobile as in a liquid or constrained as in a solid. We first examined condensates formed by native chromatin fragments derived from micrococcal nuclease digestion, consisting of a heterogeneous population of nucleosomal arrays bound to H1 and a host of other chromatin-associated proteins. Consistent with a large body of published results (Hansen, 2002Hansen J.C. Conformational dynamics of the chromatin fiber in solution: determinants, mechanisms, and functions.Annu. Rev. Biophys.

Fluorescence microscopy in 100 mM NaCl/2 mM MgCl2 revealed the presence of individual chromatin condensates that were globular and ∼0.5 μm in diameter and, upon contact, formed complex 3D structures rather than fusing into larger spheres (Figures 1B and 1C; Video S1). This size is smaller than that formed by nucleosomal arrays alone (Figure 1D) but consistent with the smaller condensate sizes observed when histone H1 is bound to nucleosomal arrays (Maeshima et al., 2016bMaeshima K. Rogge R. Tamura S. Joti Y. Hikima T. Szerlong H. Krause C. Herman J. Seidel E. DeLuca J. et al.Nucleosomal arrays self-assemble into supramolecular globular structures lacking 30-nm fibers.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 1115-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When the condensates were subjected to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we observed a lack of mixing of bleached and unbleached chromatin even after overnight incubation (Figure 1C). The findings that the chromatin condensates formed discrete pellets upon centrifugation (Figure 1A), did not fuse upon contact (Figure 1B), and did not mix after photobleaching (Figure 1C) indicate that native chromatin in condensates was packaged in a constrained solid-like state. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/b79108d2-0c09-42c9-9b2b-669bb5927147/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

In Vitro Experiments of Condensate Formation and Photobleaching Characteristics, Related to Figure 1 The solid-like properties of native chromatin condensates were unexpected considering recent descriptions of liquid chromatin condensates formed in vitro by arrays of positioned nucleosomes (Gibson et al., 2019Gibson B.A. Doolittle L.K. Schneider M.W.G. Jensen L.E. Gamarra N. Henry L. Gerlich D.W. Redding S. Rosen M.K. Organization of Chromatin by Intrinsic and Regulated Phase Separation.Cell. 2019; 179: 470-484.e21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is possible that the presence of H1 or other proteins in our native chromatin was responsible for this discrepancy. We therefore carefully reexamined salt-dependent condensate formation by model nucleosomal arrays. We utilized fluorescently labeled 12-mer 601 nucleosomal arrays with a 207-bp nucleosome repeat length (60-bp linkers) for these experiments. We first examined condensates formed in 4 mM MgCl2, standard conditions used previously for structural analyses (Maeshima et al., 2016bMaeshima K. Rogge R. Tamura S. Joti Y. Hikima T. Szerlong H. Krause C. Herman J. Seidel E. DeLuca J. et al.Nucleosomal arrays self-assemble into supramolecular globular structures lacking 30-nm fibers.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 1115-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). More than 95% of the nucleosomal arrays assemble into condensates that pellet in the microcentrifuge under these salt conditions (Maeshima et al., 2016bMaeshima K. Rogge R. Tamura S. Joti Y. Hikima T. Szerlong H. Krause C. Herman J. Seidel E. DeLuca J. et al.Nucleosomal arrays self-assemble into supramolecular globular structures lacking 30-nm fibers.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 1115-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The largest condensates formed under these conditions were globular and ranged from 0.5–1.0 μm (Figure 1D). Previous work has shown that ∼1.0 μm is the maximum size reached by the condensates in MgCl2, corresponding to structures that sediment at ∼300,000 S (Maeshima et al., 2016bMaeshima K. Rogge R. Tamura S. Joti Y. Hikima T. Szerlong H. Krause C. Herman J. Seidel E. DeLuca J. et al.Nucleosomal arrays self-assemble into supramolecular globular structures lacking 30-nm fibers.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 1115-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The size distribution of the condensates in 5 mM MgCl2, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, ranges from 35,000–300,000 S (∼0.2–1.0 μm). Figure 1D shows that condensates formed in 4 mM MgCl2 did not increase in maximum size with increasing chromatin concentration. At high concentrations, individual condensates formed networks of contacting 3D structures rather than fusing into larger globules, behavior inconsistent with a liquid state. We next determined the mobility of packaged nucleosomal arrays in condensates using FRAP. When a single condensate formed in 4 mM MgCl2 was partially bleached, there was no mixing of unbleached and bleached arrays over a 15-min period (Figure 1E). No fluorescence recovery was observed when an entire condensate was bleached, regardless of whether the free array concentration in solu"

https://openalex.org/W3112161336,"The preparation of large, low-entropy, highly coherent ensembles of identical quantum systems is foundational for many studies in quantum metrology, simulation, and information. Here, we realize these features by leveraging the favorable properties of tweezer-trapped alkaline-earth atoms while introducing a new, hybrid approach to tailoring optical potentials that balances scalability, high-fidelity state preparation, site-resolved readout, and preservation of atomic coherence. With this approach, we achieve trapping and optical clock excited-state lifetimes exceeding $ 40 $ seconds in ensembles of approximately $ 150 $ atoms. This leads to half-minute-scale atomic coherence on an optical clock transition, corresponding to quality factors well in excess of $10^{16}$. These coherence times and atom numbers reduce the effect of quantum projection noise to a level that is on par with leading atomic systems, yielding a relative fractional frequency stability of $5.2(3)\times10^{-17}~(\tau/s)^{-1/2}$ for synchronous clock comparisons between sub-ensembles within the tweezer array. When further combined with the microscopic control and readout available in this system, these results pave the way towards long-lived engineered entanglement on an optical clock transition in tailored atom arrays."
https://openalex.org/W3113032954,"The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state is a two-dimensional topological insulating state that has quantized Hall resistance of h/Ce2 and vanishing longitudinal resistance under zero magnetic field, where C is called the Chern number. The QAH effect has been realized in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Despite considerable experimental efforts, the zero magnetic field QAH effect has so far been realized only for C = 1. Here we used molecular beam epitaxy to fabricate magnetic TI multilayers and realized the QAH effect with tunable Chern number C up to 5. The Chern number of these QAH insulators is tuned by varying the magnetic doping concentration or the thickness of the interior magnetic TI layers in the multilayer samples. A theoretical model is developed to understand our experimental observations and establish phase diagrams for QAH insulators with tunable Chern numbers. The realization of QAH insulators with high tunable Chern numbers facilitates the potential applications of dissipationless chiral edge currents in energy-efficient electronic devices and opens opportunities for developing multi-channel quantum computing and higher-capacity chiral circuit interconnects."
https://openalex.org/W3111038068,"During female germline development, oocytes become a highly specialized cell type and form a maternal cytoplasmic store of crucial factors. Oocyte growth is triggered at the transition from primordial to primary follicle and is accompanied by dynamic changes in gene expression1, but the gene regulatory network that controls oocyte growth remains unknown. Here we identify a set of transcription factors that are sufficient to trigger oocyte growth. By investigation of the changes in gene expression and functional screening using an in vitro mouse oocyte development system, we identified eight transcription factors, each of which was essential for the transition from primordial to primary follicle. Notably, enforced expression of these transcription factors swiftly converted pluripotent stem cells into oocyte-like cells that were competent for fertilization and subsequent cleavage. These transcription-factor-induced oocyte-like cells were formed without specification of primordial germ cells, epigenetic reprogramming or meiosis, and demonstrate that oocyte growth and lineage-specific de novo DNA methylation are separable from the preceding epigenetic reprogramming in primordial germ cells. This study identifies a core set of transcription factors for orchestrating oocyte growth, and provides an alternative source of ooplasm, which is a unique material for reproductive biology and medicine."

Previous nanoscale weaves2–16 include isotropic crystalline covalent organic frameworks12–14 that feature rigid helical strands interlaced in all three dimensions, rather than the two-dimensional17,18 layers of flexible woven strands that give conventional textiles their characteristic flexibility, thinness, anisotropic strength and porosity. A supramolecular two-dimensional kagome weave15 and a single-layer, surface-supported, interwoven two-dimensional polymer16 have also been reported. The direct, bottom-up assembly of molecular building blocks into linear organic polymer chains woven in two dimensions has been proposed on a number of occasions19–23, but has not previously been achieved. Here we demonstrate that by using an anion and metal ion template, woven molecular ‘tiles’ can be tessellated into a material consisting of alternating aliphatic and aromatic segmented polymer strands, interwoven within discrete layers. Connections between slowly precipitating pre-woven grids, followed by the removal of the ion template, result in a wholly organic molecular material that forms as stacks and clusters of thin sheets—each sheet up to hundreds of micrometres long and wide but only about four nanometres thick—in which warp and weft single-chain polymer strands remain associated through periodic mechanical entanglements within each sheet. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy show clusters and, occasionally, isolated individual sheets that, following demetallation, have slid apart from others with which they were stacked during the tessellation and polymerization process. The layered two-dimensional molecularly woven material has long-range order, is birefringent, is twice as stiff as the constituent linear polymer, and delaminates and tears along well-defined lines in the manner of a macroscopic textile. When incorporated into a polymer-supported membrane, it acts as a net, slowing the passage of large ions while letting smaller ions through. An anion and metal ion template is used to form woven polymer patches that are joined together by polymerization into a fully woven, two-dimensional, molecular patchwork."
https://openalex.org/W3211193817,"The safe, highly effective measles vaccine has been recommended globally since 1974, yet in 2017 there were more than 17 million cases of measles and 83,400 deaths in children under 5 years old, and more than 99% of both occurred in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)1-4. Globally comparable, annual, local estimates of routine first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) coverage are critical for understanding geographically precise immunity patterns, progress towards the targets of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), and high-risk areas amid disruptions to vaccination programmes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)5-8. Here we generated annual estimates of routine childhood MCV1 coverage at 5 × 5-km2 pixel and second administrative levels from 2000 to 2019 in 101 LMICs, quantified geographical inequality and assessed vaccination status by geographical remoteness. After widespread MCV1 gains from 2000 to 2010, coverage regressed in more than half of the districts between 2010 and 2019, leaving many LMICs far from the GVAP goal of 80% coverage in all districts by 2019. MCV1 coverage was lower in rural than in urban locations, although a larger proportion of unvaccinated children overall lived in urban locations; strategies to provide essential vaccination services should address both geographical contexts. These results provide a tool for decision-makers to strengthen routine MCV1 immunization programmes and provide equitable disease protection for all children."
https://openalex.org/W3113121586,"Mechanical deformations of DNA such as bending are ubiquitous and have been implicated in diverse cellular functions1. However, the lack of high-throughput tools to measure the mechanical properties of DNA has limited our understanding of how DNA mechanics influence chromatin transactions across the genome. Here we develop ‘loop-seq’—a high-throughput assay to measure the propensity for DNA looping—and determine the intrinsic cyclizabilities of 270,806 50-base-pair DNA fragments that span Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V, other genomic regions, and random sequences. We found sequence-encoded regions of unusually low bendability within nucleosome-depleted regions upstream of transcription start sites (TSSs). Low bendability of linker DNA inhibits nucleosome sliding into the linker by the chromatin remodeller INO80, which explains how INO80 can define nucleosome-depleted regions in the absence of other factors2. Chromosome-wide, nucleosomes were characterized by high DNA bendability near dyads and low bendability near linkers. This contrast increases for deeper gene-body nucleosomes but disappears after random substitution of synonymous codons, which suggests that the evolution of codon choice has been influenced by DNA mechanics around gene-body nucleosomes. Furthermore, we show that local DNA mechanics affect transcription through TSS-proximal nucleosomes. Overall, this genome-scale map of DNA mechanics indicates a ‘mechanical code’ with broad functional implications. A high-throughput, chromosome-wide analysis of DNA looping reveals its contribution to the organization of chromatin, and provides insight into how nucleosomes are deposited and organised de novo."

These results provide a resource of 600 human proteins containing effectors and demonstrate a scalable strategy for assigning functions to protein domains. To understand the molecular underpinnings of human biology and disease, we require systematic knowledge of how proteins function in human cells. Functional studies are challenging to approach systematically because the sequence space of proteins and their mutant variants is vast. For example, the human proteome includes >1,600 transcription factors (TFs) (Lambert et al., 2018Lambert S.A. Jolma A. Campitelli L.F. Das P.K. Yin Y. Albu M. Chen X. Taipale J. Hughes T.R. Weirauch M.T. The Human Transcription Factors.Cell. 2018; 175: 598-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Extensive efforts have generated maps of genome occupancy for a subset of these TFs (Moore et al., 2020Moore J.E. Purcaro M.J. Pratt H.E. Epstein C.B. Shoresh N. Adrian J. Kawli T. Davis C.A.

Meadows S.K. et al.Occupancy maps of 208 chromatin-associated proteins in one human cell type.Nature. 2020; 583: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, we still lack a complete understanding of their transcriptional effector functions. With systematic knowledge of which proteins can activate or repress transcription, which protein domains mediate these functions, and which residues in these domains are critical, we could build better models of gene regulation and devise better approaches to correct dysregulated gene expression in disease contexts. Thus, a scalable approach to determine and measure transcriptional effector function is needed. Traditionally, effector function is measured with a recruitment assay, in which a candidate effector protein is fused onto a synthetic DNA binding domain and recruited to a reporter gene promoter, resulting in change in reporter expression (Sadowski et al., 1988Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. GAL4-VP16 is an unusually potent transcriptional activator.Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The recruitment assay has been applied extensively to characterize individual proteins (reviewed in Tycko et al., 2017Tycko J. Van M.V. Elowitz M.B. Bintu L. Advancing towards a global mammalian gene regulation model through single-cell analysis and synthetic biology.Curr. Opin. Biomed. Eng. 2017; 4: 174-193Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but the throughput of this assay is limited because each effector protein is individually cloned, delivered into cells, and measured. Recently, systematic recruitment of hundreds of chromatin regulators was achieved in yeast in an arrayed screen (Keung et al., 2014Keung A.J. Bashor C.J. Kiriakov S. Collins J.J. Khalil A.S. Using targeted chromatin regulators to engineer combinatorial and spatial transcriptional regulation.Cell. 2014; 158: 110-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and pooled strategies for recruitment assays of activator domains were implemented in yeast (Erijman et al., 2020Erijman A.

A high-throughput method to identify trans-activation domains within transcription factor sequences.EMBO J. 2018; 37: 98896Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we report the development of HT-recruit, a high-throughput recruitment assay in human cells that allows us to measure the function of tens of thousands of candidate effector domains in parallel. The method combines pooled synthesis of oligonucleotide libraries encoding protein domains and variants, a synthetic surface marker reporter allowing facile magnetic cell separation, and next-generation sequencing of the protein domains as a readout. This approach enabled us to quantify the effector activity of thousands of Pfam-annotated domains in nuclear-localized human proteins, providing a comprehensive functional assessment of large domain families such as the KRAB and the Homeodomain. We also assign effector function to a number of domains of unknown function (DUFs). Furthermore, we performed a deep mutational scan of the KRAB repressor domain used in CRISPRi (Gilbert et al., 2014Gilbert L.A. Horlbeck M.A. Adamson B. Villalta J.E. Chen Y. Whitehead E.H. Guimaraes C. Panning B. Ploegh H.L. Bassik M.C. et al.Genome-Scale CRISPR-Mediated Control of Gene Repression and Activation.Cell. 2014; 159: 647-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), identifying mutations that ablate and enhance its gene silencing effects. Lastly, we identify compact repressor domains in unannotated regions of nuclear proteins using a library tiling 238 nuclear proteins. Together, we demonstrate a method for systematic functional analysis of effector domains, establish a resource for interpreting the roles of proteins in the human nucleus based on the capacity of their domains to activate or repress transcription, and generate a toolbox of compact and efficient effector domains to enable synthetic biology approaches to perturb and manipulate the epigenome and transcription. To turn the classical recruitment assay into a high-throughput assay of transcriptional domains, we had to solve two problems: (1) modify the reporter to make it compatible with rapid screening of libraries of tens of thousands of domains, and (2) devise a strategy to generate a library of candidate effector domains. To improve on our previously published fluorescent reporter (Bintu et al., 2016Bintu L. Yong J. Antebi Y.E. McCue K. Kazuki Y. Uno N. Oshimura M. Elowitz M.B. Dynamics of epigenetic regulation at the single-cell level.Science. 2016; 351: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we engineered a synthetic surface marker to enable facile magnetic separation of large numbers of cells and integrated the reporter at the AAVS1 safe harbor locus in K562 cells that are amenable to large-scale culture (Figure 1A). We used flow cytometry to confirm that recruitment of a known repressor, the KRAB domain from zinc finger TF ZNF10, silences this reporter in a doxycycline (dox)-dependent manner (Figures S1A and S1B). We also confirmed that the synthetic surface marker allows magnetic separation of reporter ON from OFF cells (Figure S1C).Figure S1Validation of Lentiviral Recruitment Assay and Dual Reporter for Gene Silencing, and High-Throughput Measurements of Domain Expression by FLAG Staining, Sorting, and Sequencing, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Schematic of lentiviral recruitment vector with Golden Gate cloning site for creating fusions of effector domains to the dox-inducible DNA-binding domain rTetR.

Random controls are poorly expressed compared to tiles across the DMD protein or Pfam domains (p < 1e−5, Mann-Whitney test). The Pfam domains and the DMD tiling controls were similarly well expressed. Dashed line shows the threshold for expression level, as in (F). We next curated a list of candidate transcriptional effector domains. We pulled sequences from the UniProt database for Pfam domains in nuclear proteins, totaling 14,657 domains. Of these, 72% were ≤80 amino acids (AA) long (Figure 1B), compatible with pooled synthesis as 300 base oligonucleotides. For domains shorter than 80 AA, we extended the domain sequence on both ends with adjacent residues from the native protein sequence to reach 80 AA and avoid PCR amplification biases. We excluded the C2H2 zinc finger DNA-binding domains, which are highly abundant, repetitive, and not expected to function as transcriptional effectors, resulting in 5,093 Pfam domains in the library. We added 861 negative controls that were either random 80 AA sequences or 80 AA tiled along the DMD protein with a 10-AA tiling window (Method Details). The DMD protein is not localized in the nucleus (Chevron et al., 1994Chevron M.P. Girard F. Claustres M. Demaille J. Expression and subcellular localization of dystrophin in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles during the human development.Neuromuscul. Disord. 1994; 4: 419-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and thus unlikely to feature domains with transcriptional activity. The library (Table S1) was cloned for lentiviral expression as a fusion protein with either the rTetR dox-inducible DNA-binding domain alone or a 3X-FLAG-tagged rTetR (Figure S1D; Table S2) and delivered to K562 reporter cells (Figure 1A). Before assaying for transcriptional activity, we determined which protein domains were well expressed in K562 cells using immunostaining against the FLAG-tagged library, sequencing the domains in the FACS-sorted FLAGhigh and FLAGlow populations, and setting a FLAGhigh:FLAGlow threshold ratio 1 SD above the median of the random controls to define well-expressed domains (Figures S1F–S1I). By this definition, 66% of the Pfam domains (that passed the sequencing depth threshold; Method Details) were well expressed; these 3,014 domains were the focus of further analysis. Next, we screened the Pfam domain library for transcriptional repressors. We treated the pooled library of cells with dox for 5 days, sufficient for the reporter mRNA silencing and protein degradation and dilution from cell division, resulting in a clear bimodal mixture of ON and OFF cells (Figure S2A). Then, we performed magnetic cell separation (Figure S2A) and domain sequencing, computing the log2(OFF:ON) ratio for each library member using the read counts in the unbound (OFF) and bead-bound (ON) populations (Figure 1A). The measurements were highly reproducible (r2 = 0.96; Figure 1C) and contained data for 2,978 domains that were well expressed and passed the sequencing depth threshold. We found 446 repressor hits at day 5, representing 63 domain families (Figure 1D). Known repressor domains (e.g., KRAB from human ZNF10, Chromoshadow from CBX5) from 10 domain families described as repressors or co-repressor-binding domains by Pfam were among the hits (Table S4), as expected. Overall, the high reproducibility and identification of expected positive control repressors suggested that our screening method, which we called HT-recruit, yielded reliable results. To measure epigenetic memory, we took additional time points at days 9 and 13. The set of proteins containing hits was significantly enriched for TFs and chromatin regulators when compared to all of the nuclear proteins used in our library, but different categories of proteins were differentially enriched when classified by their memory levels (Figure S2B). Specifically, the repressors with high memory (cells remaining OFF) at day 13 were most enriched for C2H2 zinc finger TFs, including KRAB ZNF proteins, and the repressors with low memory were most enriched for homeodomain TFs, including the Hox proteins. One of the strongest hits was the YAF2_RYBP, a domain present in the RING1- and YY1-binding protein (RYBP) and its paralog YY1-associated Factor 2 (YAF2), both components of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (Chittock et al., 2017Chittock E.C.

We individually tested the domain from the RYBP protein as annotated by Pfam (which is just 32 AAs, thus shorter than the version in our 80-AA domain library) and confirmed rapid silencing of the reporter (Figure 1E). RYBP-mediated silencing was also demonstrated by full-length RYBP protein recruitment in mouse embryonic stem cells (Moussa et al., 2019Moussa H.F. Bsteh D. Yelagandula R. Pribitzer C. Stecher K. Bartalska K. Michetti L. Wang J. Zepeda-Martinez J.A. Elling U. et al.Canonical PRC1 controls sequence-independent propagation of Polycomb-mediated gene silencing.Nat.

Cell Biol. 2020; 22: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our result establishes that the 32-AA RYBP domain, the minimal required domain to bind the polycomb histone modifier enzyme RING1B (PDB: 3IXS), is sufficient to mediate silencing. We used the percentage of cells OFF over time to quantify the rates of silencing (Method Details) for RYBP (Figure 1F), other domains with previous support for repressor function (Figures 1F and S2C–S2F), and other new repressors (Figures S2G–S2K). We performed these individual validations using a new variant of the DNA binding domain rTetR (SE-G72P), engineered to mitigate leakiness in the absence of dox in yeast (Roney et al., 2016Roney I.J. Rudner A.D. Couture J.-F. Kærn M. Improvement of the reverse tetracycline transactivator by single amino acid substitutions that reduce leaky target gene expression to undetectable levels.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 27697Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which we found is not leaky in human cells and has the same silencing strength at maximum dox (Figures S3A–S3C). Encouragingly, silencing rates from all individual measurements correlated well with the high-throughput measurements of silencing (R2 = 0.86; Figure 1G). Over 22% of the Pfam domain families are labeled as DUFs, while others are not labeled DUFs but also lack experimental characterization (El-Gebali et al., 2019El-Gebali S. Mistry J. Bateman A. Eddy S.R. Luciani A. Potter S.C. Qureshi M. Richardson L.J. Salazar G.A. Smart A. et al.The Pfam protein families database in 2019.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D427-D432Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar). Our high-throughput domain screen offered the opportunity to associate initial functions with DUFs. We identified DUF3669 domains, found in KRAB zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), as repressor hits (Figures 1D–1F). Two DUF3669 domains were recently shown to be repressive (Al Chiblak et al., 2019Al Chiblak M. Steinbeck F. Thiesen H.-J. Lorenz P.

Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and our high-throughput results expand this finding to include the four remaining DUF3669 sequences (Table S4). The HNF_C DUF domains from both FOXA1 and FOXA2 were repressor hits (Table S4); both include an EH1 (engrailed homology 1) motif, FxIxxIL, that has been nominated as a candidate repressor motif (Copley, 2005Copley R.R. The EH1 motif in metazoan transcription factors.BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All three of the IRF-2BP1_2 N-terminal zinc finger domains (Childs and Goodbourn, 2003Childs K.S. Goodbourn S. Identification of novel co-repressor molecules for Interferon Regulatory Factor-2.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3016-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), an uncharacterized domain found in the interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) co-repressors IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and IRF2BPL, were repressor hits (Table S4). The Cyt-b5 domain in the DNA repair factor HERC2 E3 ligase (Mifsud and Bateman, 2002Mifsud W. Bateman A. Membrane-bound progesterone receptors contain a cytochrome b5-like ligand-binding domain.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0068.1–research0068.5)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is another functionally uncharacterized domain that we validated as a strong repressor hit (Figure S2G). The SH3_9 domain in BIN1 is a largely uncharacterized variant of the SH3 protein-binding domain, which we also validated as a repressor (Figure S2H). BIN1 is a Myc-interacting protein and tumor suppressor (Elliott et al., 1999Elliott K. Sakamuro D. Basu A. Du W. Wunner W. Staller P. Gaubatz S. Zhang H. Prochownik E. Eilers M. Prendergast G.C. Bin1 functionally interacts with Myc and inhibits cell proliferation via multiple mechanisms.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3564-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that is also associated with Alzheimer disease risk (Nott et al., 2019Nott A. Holtman I.R. Coufal N.G. Schlachetzki J.C.M. Yu M. Hu R. Han C.Z. Pena M. Xiao J. Wu Y. et al.Brain cell type-specific enhancer-promoter interactome maps and disease-risk association.Science. 2019; 366: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Both full-length BIN1 and a Myc-binding domain deletion mutant were previously shown to repress transcription in a Gal4 recruitment assay in HeLa cells (Elliott et al., 1999Elliott K. Sakamuro D.

Next, we validated the repressor activity of the HMG_box domain from the TF TOX and of the zf-C3HC4_2 RING finger domain from the polycomb component PCGF2 (Figures S2I and S2J). DUF1087 is found in CHD chromatin remodelers and, although its high-throughput measurement was just below the significance threshold (Figure 1D), we validated it as a weak repressor (Figures 1E and 1F). Surprisingly, one of the random sequences (which were designed as negative controls) was a strong repressor in the screen, and individual flow cytometry confirmed that rTetR fused to this random 80-amino-acid sequence does fully silence the reporter with moderate epigenetic memory 2 weeks after dox removal (Figure S2K). These results demonstrate that high-throughput protein domain screens can assign initial functions to DUFs and expand our understanding of the functions of incompletely characterized domains. We analyzed all of the effector domains in the largest family of TFs, the KRAB domains, which incl"
https://openalex.org/W3111481291,"Effective pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder remains a major challenge, as more than 30% of patients are resistant to the first line of treatment (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)1. Sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist2,3, provide rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects in these patients4–6, but the molecular mechanism of these effects remains unclear7,8. Ketamine has been proposed to exert its antidepressant effects through its metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine ((2R,6R)-HNK)9. The antidepressant effects of ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK in rodents require activation of the mTORC1 kinase10,11. mTORC1 controls various neuronal functions12, particularly through cap-dependent initiation of mRNA translation via the phosphorylation and inactivation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs)13. Here we show that 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 are key effectors of the antidepressant activity of ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK, and that ketamine-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity depends on 4E-BP2 and, to a lesser extent, 4E-BP1. It has been hypothesized that ketamine activates mTORC1–4E-BP signalling in pyramidal excitatory cells of the cortex8,14. To test this hypothesis, we studied the behavioural response to ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK in mice lacking 4E-BPs in either excitatory or inhibitory neurons. The antidepressant activity of the drugs is mediated by 4E-BP2 in excitatory neurons, and 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 in inhibitory neurons. Notably, genetic deletion of 4E-BP2 in inhibitory neurons induced a reduction in baseline immobility in the forced swim test, mimicking an antidepressant effect. Deletion of 4E-BP2 specifically in inhibitory neurons also prevented the ketamine-induced increase in hippocampal excitatory neurotransmission, and this effect concurred with the inability of ketamine to induce a long-lasting decrease in inhibitory neurotransmission. Overall, our data show that 4E-BPs are central to the antidepressant activity of ketamine. The antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in mice depend on the expression of specific eIF4E-binding proteins in excitatory and inhibitory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3113103322,"Single neocortical neurons are driven by populations of excitatory inputs, which form the basis of neuronal selectivity to features of sensory input. Excitatory connections are thought to mature during development through activity-dependent Hebbian plasticity1, whereby similarity between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity selectively strengthens some synapses and weakens others2. Evidence in support of this process includes measurements of synaptic ultrastructure and in vitro and in vivo physiology and imaging studies3-8. These corroborating lines of evidence lead to the prediction that a small number of strong synaptic inputs drive neuronal selectivity, whereas weak synaptic inputs are less correlated with the somatic output and modulate activity overall6,7. Supporting evidence from cortical circuits, however, has been limited to measurements of neighbouring, connected cell pairs, raising the question of whether this prediction holds for a broad range of synapses converging onto cortical neurons. Here we measure the strengths of functionally characterized excitatory inputs contacting single pyramidal neurons in ferret primary visual cortex (V1) by combining in vivo two-photon synaptic imaging and post hoc electron microscopy. Using electron microscopy reconstruction of individual synapses as a metric of strength, we find no evidence that strong synapses have a predominant role in the selectivity of cortical neuron responses to visual stimuli. Instead, selectivity appears to arise from the total number of synapses activated by different stimuli. Moreover, spatial clustering of co-active inputs appears to be reserved for weaker synapses, enhancing the contribution of weak synapses to somatic responses. Our results challenge the role of Hebbian mechanisms in shaping neuronal selectivity in cortical circuits, and suggest that selectivity reflects the co-activation of large populations of presynaptic neurons with similar properties and a mixture of strengths."
https://openalex.org/W3111328403,"Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, flaviviruses and alphaviruses, carry out transcription and replication inside virus-induced membranous organelles within host cells1-7. The remodelling of the host-cell membranes for the formation of these organelles is coupled to the membrane association of viral replication complexes and to RNA synthesis. These viral niches allow for the concentration of metabolites and proteins for the synthesis of viral RNA, and prevent the detection of this RNA by the cellular innate immune system8. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of non-structural protein 1 (nsP1) of the alphavirus chikungunya virus, which is responsible for RNA capping and membrane binding of the viral replication machinery. The structure shows the enzyme in its active form, assembled in a monotopic membrane-associated dodecameric ring. The structure reveals the structural basis of the coupling between membrane binding, oligomerization and allosteric activation of the capping enzyme. The stoichiometry-with 12 active sites in a single complex-redefines viral replication complexes as RNA synthesis reactors. The ring shape of the complex implies it has a role in controlling access to the viral organelle and ensuring the exit of properly capped viral RNA. Our results provide high-resolution information about the membrane association of the replication machinery of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, and open up avenues for the further characterization of viral replication on cell membranes and the generation of antiviral agents."
https://openalex.org/W3111155661,"Autophagy, a process of degradation that occurs via the lysosomal pathway, has an essential role in multiple aspects of immunity, including immune system development, regulation of innate and adaptive immune and inflammatory responses, selective degradation of intracellular microorganisms, and host protection against infectious diseases1,2. Autophagy is known to be induced by stimuli such as nutrient deprivation and suppression of mTOR, but little is known about how autophagosomal biogenesis is initiated in mammalian cells in response to viral infection. Here, using genome-wide short interfering RNA screens, we find that the endosomal protein sorting nexin 5 (SNX5)3,4 is essential for virus-induced, but not for basal, stress- or endosome-induced, autophagy. We show that SNX5 deletion increases cellular susceptibility to viral infection in vitro, and that Snx5 knockout in mice enhances lethality after infection with several human viruses. Mechanistically, SNX5 interacts with beclin 1 and ATG14-containing class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3KC3) complex 1 (PI3KC3-C1), increases the lipid kinase activity of purified PI3KC3-C1, and is required for endosomal generation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) and recruitment of the PtdIns(3)P-binding protein WIPI2 to virion-containing endosomes. These findings identify a context- and organelle-specific mechanism-SNX5-dependent PI3KC3-C1 activation at endosomes-for initiation of autophagy during viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W3110837484,"The response to the COVID-19 epidemic is generating severe shortages of personal protective equipment around the world. In particular, the supply of N95 respirator masks has become severely depleted, with supplies having to be rationed and health care workers having to use masks for prolonged periods in many countries. We sought to test the ability of 7 different decontamination methods: autoclave treatment, ethylene oxide gassing (ETO), low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (LT-HPGP) treatment, vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP) exposure, peracetic acid dry fogging (PAF), ultraviolet C irradiation (UVCI) and moist heat (MH) treatment to decontaminate a variety of different N95 masks following experimental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or vesicular stomatitis virus as a surrogate. In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. All methods except for UVCI were effective in total elimination of viable virus from treated masks. We found that all respirator masks tolerated at least one cycle of all treatment modalities without structural or functional deterioration as assessed by fit testing; filtration efficiency testing results were mostly similar except that a single cycle of LT-HPGP was associated with failures in 3 of 6 masks assessed. VHP, PAF, UVCI, and MH were associated with preserved mask integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles by both fit and filtration testing. A similar result was shown with ethylene oxide gassing to the maximum 3 cycles tested. Pleated, layered non-woven fabric N95 masks retained integrity in fit testing for at least 10 cycles of autoclaving but the molded N95 masks failed after 1 cycle; filtration testing however was intact to 5 cycles for all masks. The successful application of autoclaving for layered, pleated masks may be of particular use to institutions globally due to the virtually universal accessibility of autoclaves in health care settings. Given the ability to modify widely available heating cabinets on hospital wards in well-resourced settings, the application of moist heat may allow local processing of N95 masks."

The purpose of this brief report is to evaluate the AAMC data from 1969 to 2018 to compare the level of female academic faculty representation for surgical specialties over the past four decades. Design The number of women as a percentage of the total surgeons per year were recorded for each year from 1969–2018, the most recent year available. Descriptive statistics were performed. Poisson regression examined the percentage of women in each field as the outcome of interest with the year and specialty (using general surgery as a reference) as two predictor variables. Setting Data from the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). Participants All full-time academic faculty physicians in the specialties of obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), general surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology (ENT), plastic surgery, plastic surgery, urology, neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery and cardiothoracic surgery as per AAMC records. Results The percentage of women in surgery for all specialties evaluated increased from 1969 to 2018 (OR 1.04, p&lt;0.001). Compared with general surgery, the rate of yearly percentage change increased more slowly in neurosurgery (OR 0.84; P = .004), orthopaedic surgery (OR 0.82; P = .002), urology (OR 0.59; P &lt; .001), and cardiothoracic surgery (OR 0.38; P &lt; .001). There was no significant difference in the rate of yearly percentage change for plastic surgery (OR 1.01; P = .840).

Conclusions Representation of women in academic surgery is increasing overall but is increasing more slowly in orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery and urology compared with that in general surgery. These data may be used to inform and further the discussion of how mentorship and sponsorship of female students and trainees interested in surgical careers may improve gender equity in the future."

The results of these samples were compared to an OPMT performed by a HCW in the same patient at the same session. Results In subjects confirmed to have COVID-19, the sensitivities of the HCW-swab, self-swab, saliva, and combined self-swab plus saliva samples were 82.8%, 75.1%, 74.3% and 86.5% respectively. All samples obtained from healthy volunteers were tested negative. Compared to HCW-swab, the sensitivities of a self-swab sample and saliva sample were inferior by 8.7% (95%CI: 2.4% to 15.0%, p = 0.006) and 9.5% (95%CI: 3.1% to 15.8%, p = 0.003) respectively. The combined detection rate of self-swab and saliva had a sensitivity of 2.7% (95%CI: -2.6% to 8.0%, p = 0.321). The sensitivity of both the self-collection methods are higher when the Ct value of the HCW swab is less than 30. The specificity of both the self-swab and saliva testing was 100% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%). Conclusion Our study provides evidence that sensitivities of self-collected OPMT swab and saliva samples were inferior to a HCW swab, but they could still be useful testing tools in the appropriate clinical settings."

However, it is unknown how the brain compactly represents the current state of the environment to guide this process.

We deployed DQN as a model of brain activity and behavior in participants playing three Atari video games during fMRI. Hidden layers of DQN exhibited a striking resemblance to voxel activity in a distributed sensorimotor network, extending throughout the dorsal visual pathway into posterior parietal cortex. Neural state-space representations emerged from nonlinear transformations of the pixel space bridging perception to action and reward. These transformations reshape axes to reflect relevant high-level features and strip away information about task-irrelevant sensory features.

Here, we sought to validate the MSL-COVID-19 score, originally developed to predict COVID-19 mortality in Mexicans. Also, an adaptation of the formula is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 severity in a triage setting (Nutri-CoV). Methods We included patients evaluated from March 16 th to August 17 th , 2020 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición, defining severe COVID-19 as a composite of death, ICU admission or requirement for intubation (n = 3,007). We validated MSL-COVID-19 for prediction of mortality and severe disease. Using Elastic Net Cox regression, we trained (n = 1,831) and validated (n = 1,176) a model for prediction of severe COVID-19 using MSL-COVID-19 along with clinical assessments obtained at a triage setting. Results The variables included in MSL-COVID-19 are: pneumonia, early onset type 2 diabetes, age &gt; 65 years, chronic kidney disease, any form of immunosuppression, COPD, obesity, diabetes, and age &lt;40 years. MSL-COVID-19 had good performance to predict COVID-19 mortality (c-statistic = 0.722, 95%CI 0.690–0.753) and severity (c-statistic = 0.777, 95%CI 0.753–0.801). The Nutri-CoV score includes the MSL-COVID-19 plus respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. This tool had better performance in both training (c-statistic = 0.797, 95%CI 0.765–0.826) and validation cohorts (c-statistic = 0.772, 95%CI 0.0.745–0.800) compared to other severity scores. Conclusions MSL-COVID-19 predicts inpatient COVID-19 lethality. The Nutri-CoV score is an adaptation of MSL-COVID-19 to be used in a triage environment. Both scores have been deployed as web-based tools for clinical use in a triage setting."

This paper uses a unique survey data collected early on in the pandemic to measure economic deprivation among individuals. The Federal Reserve Board fielded a Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making (SHED) in April 2020. This survey is used to compile data on four indicators of economic deprivation, namely: i) Overall financial condition, ii) Loss of employment, iii) Reduction in income and iv) Inability to pay bills in full. Data on these indicators is compiled for each individual and is used in a novel way to construct a set of multidimensional deprivation indices. These indices measure the overlap of deprivations experienced by an individual. Results show that almost 25 percent of the respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators. More than 13 percent of adults reported their inability to pay monthly bills and struggled to make ends meet financially. One in four respondents had lower income compared to income from previous month. The economic shock affected Hispanics in a more profound way. More than 37 percent Hispanics reported hardship in two or more indicators and 8 percent reported hardship in all four indicators. Higher proportion of young adults and those without a college degree suffered multiple hardships.

Methods Prospective cohort study in a first-level hospital in Madrid. Patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit with tachypnea, use of accessory musculature or Sp O2 &lt;92% despite Fi O2 &gt; 0.5 were included. Intubation rate, medical complications, and 28-day mortality were recorded. Statistical analysis through association studies, logistic and Cox regression models and survival analysis was performed. Results Seventy patients were included. 37.1% required endotracheal intubation, 58.6% suffered medical complications and 24.3% died. Prone positioning was independently associated with lower need for endotracheal intubation (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.005 to 0.54, p = 0.001). The adjusted HR for death at 28 days in the group of patients requiring endotracheal intubation was 5.4 (95% CI 1.51 to 19.5; p = 0.009). Conclusions The rate of endotracheal intubation in patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19 was 37.1%. Complications and mortality were lower in patients in whom endotracheal intubation could be avoided. Prone positioning could reduce the need for endotracheal intubation."

A hallmark of categorical decisions is that sensory stimuli can be arbitrarily assigned into discrete groups according to their behavioral relevance. Visual categories are encoded in multiple brain regions in the primate, including the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) (Freedman and Assad, 2006Freedman D.J. Assad J.A. Experience-dependent representation of visual categories in parietal cortex.Nature. 2006; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Freedman et al., 2001Freedman D.J.

Yet the format of neural category representations differs between these brain areas. Whereas PPC and PFC encode categories in an abstract or binary-like format with nearly identical firing rates to all stimuli within a category (Freedman and Assad, 2006Freedman D.J. Assad J.A. Experience-dependent representation of visual categories in parietal cortex.Nature. 2006; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar; Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012Swaminathan S.K. Freedman D.J. Preferential encoding of visual categories in parietal cortex compared with prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), ITC neurons encode categories with more graded firing rates to stimuli within a category, thus “mixing” abstract category signals with sensory feature encoding (Freedman et al., 2003Freedman D.J.

These two formats of category encoding—binary or graded—reflect a tradeoff between sensory feature encoding and abstract category encoding, yet the mechanistic origins of this tradeoff remain unknown. Category signals have been studied through behavioral tasks that divide a continuous range of sensory stimuli into two or more discrete categories by an arbitrary category boundary (Freedman et al., 2001Freedman D.J. Riesenhuber M. Poggio T. Miller E.K. Categorical representation of visual stimuli in the primate prefrontal cortex.Science. 2001; 291: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar; Freedman and Assad, 2006Freedman D.J. Assad J.A. Experience-dependent representation of visual categories in parietal cortex.Nature. 2006; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Further, these tasks decouple categorical decisions from animals’ motor responses by using delayed matching paradigms, which require comparing sequentially presented stimuli separated by a delay (Freedman et al., 2001Freedman D.J. Riesenhuber M. Poggio T. Miller E.K. Categorical representation of visual stimuli in the primate prefrontal cortex.Science. 2001; 291: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar; Freedman and Assad, 2006Freedman D.J. Assad J.A. Experience-dependent representation of visual categories in parietal cortex.Nature. 2006; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For example, in the delayed match-to-category (DMC) task, monkeys must release a manual touch-bar if a test stimulus matches the category of a previously presented sample. During DMC tasks, neurons in PFC and lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of PPC (Freedman and Assad, 2006Freedman D.J. Assad J.A. Experience-dependent representation of visual categories in parietal cortex.Nature. 2006; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar; Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012Swaminathan S.K. Freedman D.J. Preferential encoding of visual categories in parietal cortex compared with prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) show binary-like categorical encoding of motion-dot stimuli, and LIP activity in particular correlates with animals’ categorical choices on a trial-by-trial basis (Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012Swaminathan S.K. Freedman D.J. Preferential encoding of visual categories in parietal cortex compared with prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recent work using reversible cortical inactivation demonstrated a causal role for LIP in visual categorical decisions (Zhou and Freedman, 2019Zhou Y. Freedman D.J. Posterior parietal cortex plays a causal role in perceptual and categorical decisions.Science. 2019; 365: 180-185PubMed Google Scholar). These binary-like category signals have mostly been observed in tasks with a short-term, memory-delay period, which helps dissociate sensory signals from decision and motor signals. However, the delay also imposes additional mnemonic demands that are not directly related to categorization. Thus, it remains unknown whether these binary-like category signals evident in LIP emerge because of the cognitive demands of delayed matching paradigms (e.g., short-term memory or matching) predominantly used in previous categorization studies. This raises two related questions—(1) does LIP’s role in categorical decisions generalize across tasks with different task demands and (2) does the format of category encoding depend on changing task demands? Here, we examine whether LIP plays a generalized role in categorical decisions across different categorization task paradigms and whether categorical encoding is modulated by task demands. We devised a cued task switching paradigm in which monkeys alternate between two motion categorization tasks that vary in their task demands. In both tasks, monkeys grouped a 360° range of motion directions into two categories according to the same arbitrary, learned category boundary. The first task was a one-interval categorization (OIC) task, in which monkeys rapidly reported their categorical decisions with a saccade to a red (category one) or green (category two) target. The second task was a DMC task that required monkeys to compare sequentially presented sample and test stimuli that were separated by a delay and report whether they matched in category with a manual response. The tasks vary in (1) the report of direct (OIC) versus sequential category judgments (DMC), (2) associative mappings between the stimulus category and saccade target colors (OIC) versus working memory and sequential comparison (DMC), and (3) the effector for the motor response of eye (OIC) versus hand (DMC) movements. Single neurons and populations in LIP showed strong and similar category encoding in both tasks, indicating that LIP plays a generalized role in categorical decision making. However, the format of categorical encoding was more abstract with binary-like neural activity in the DMC task but more mixed with graded neural activity in the OIC task. Furthermore, categorical encoding was more temporally stable and sustained in the DMC task. We hypothesize that this binary-like format of category encoding in the DMC task could be generated by population attractor dynamics required to maintain or manipulate stimulus information over memory-delay periods. Because only the DMC task requires maintaining and manipulating category information in working memory, attractor dynamics appears to compress category-related information to a simpler, binary format by collapsing all directions within a category toward a single population state. We validated this hypothesis using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to perform both tasks and found through analysis of the fixed-point structure of these RNNs that following stimulus onset, sample categories produce stable attractors in the DMC, but not in the rapid OIC, task. Thus, the binary-like categorical responses observed in DMC tasks may not be necessary for categorization per se but may instead arise from the network dynamics underlying the storage of stimulus information or comparison of sequential stimuli in working memory. More broadly, our approach of incorporating flexibility in behavioral tasks facilitates the understanding of how neural activity patterns support diverse cognitive computations and distinguishes between task-specific encoding underlying categorization and working memory. Two monkeys alternated between the OIC and DMC tasks, in which they categorized the same random-dot motion stimuli (Figure 1A). In both tasks, motion directions were divided into two categories based on an arbitrary learned category boundary, with 5 motion directions in each category (Figure 1B). On every trial, after a 500-ms fixation period, one sample stimulus was presented for 500 ms in the OIC task and for 650 ms in the DMC task in the neuron’s receptive field (RF). Both tasks were visually identical until 500 ms from sample onset, after which they diverged. In the OIC task, saccade targets (red and green squares) appeared at 500 ms after sample onset and monkeys reported their categorical decisions with a saccade to either the red or green target to indicate category one or two, respectively. Importantly, the target position varied randomly on every trial between two possible locations—one inside the RF and the other diametrically opposed to the RF. This ensured a dissociation between the categorical decision (red versus green) and the motor responses (saccade toward versus away from the RF). In the DMC task, the sample stimulus was followed by a 1-s delay and a test stimulus, and monkeys reported whether the test stimulus was a categorical match to the previously presented sample stimulus by releasing a touch bar. Each test stimulus was randomly sampled from the ten possible motion directions (five in each category). Based on a colored cue presented at the start of each trial, monkeys switched between the OIC and DMC tasks in blocks. Monkeys successfully switched between the two tasks with a mean behavioral performance of 87.6% correct in OIC (monkey B: 86.4%; monkey M: 88.9%) and 84.3% correct in DMC (monkey B: 83.1%; monkey M: 85.7%; Figures 1C and S1). Performance of both monkeys was significantly higher in the OIC task for the near-boundary directions that were 10° away from the category boundary (p value of paired t test: 10−08). We recorded from 100 LIP neurons (monkey B, N = 44 single units; monkey M, N = 56 single units) as monkeys alternated between the OIC and DMC tasks. We compared LIP responses in both tasks to determine whether LIP neurons were preferentially engaged in one over the other. We hypothesized that LIP’s well-known role in spatial attention and saccadic eye movements would be reflected in the firing rates in the OIC task, which requires a saccadic report (Gnadt and Andersen, 1988Gnadt J.W. Andersen R.A. Memory related motor planning activity in posterior parietal cortex of macaque.Exp. Brain Res. 1988; 70: 216-220PubMed Google Scholar; Colby et al., 1996Colby C.L. Duhamel J.R.

Neurosci. 2010; 33: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). On the other hand, LIP’s well-known role in spatial functions might be distinct from its role in visual motion categorization, as suggested by a previous study in which spatial signals and category signals independently influenced LIP activity when the saccadic report and the categorical report were behaviorally not linked (Rishel et al., 2013Rishel C.A. Huang G. Freedman D.J. Independent category and spatial encoding in parietal cortex.Neuron. 2013; 77: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To compare firing rates between the OIC and DMC tasks, we focused on neural responses during the first 500 ms of the sample period, during which monkeys were fixating and stimulus presentation was identical, henceforth referred to as the shared sample period. Out of 100 recorded neurons, 82 neurons showed significant differences in firing rates between the OIC and DMC tasks in the shared sample period. Among the 82 neurons that showed significant firing rate differences between the two tasks, 73.2% (60/82) of individual LIP neurons responded with higher mean firing rates in the OIC task (unpaired, two-sample t test; p < 0.01; Figure 2C). Further, firing rates of individual neurons in the OIC task were positively correlated with firing rates in the DMC task (Figure 2D; r2 = 0.95; p < 10−4), and these values were well fit by a linear model (R2 = 0.90) with positive slope 1.13 (95% confidence intervals: (1.05,1.22)) and intercept 2.7 (95% confidence intervals: (−0.56,6.06)), indicating that OIC firing rates were significantly higher than DMC firing rates in the LIP population. Higher average firing rates in the OIC than DMC task could result from multiple factors that vary between the two tasks, such as differences in motor response modality, task difficulty, task demands, or expected value of reward. Although we cannot isolate the factor(s) that contributes toward higher firing rates in OIC, we test one candidate: because of LIP’s known involvement in saccadic eye movements, we hypothesized that LIP responses could be modulated by prior information about the motor modality used to report decision. Even before sample onset on each trial, the color of the fixation point indicated which task (and subsequently effector) is relevant during that block. If LIP neurons were modulated by prior knowledge about the task or motor modality, we would expect fixation period firing rates to be higher in the OIC than DMC task. Out of 100 recorded neurons, 57 neurons showed significant differences in firing rates between the OIC and DMC tasks in the fixation period, of which 68.4% (39/57) showed greater activity in the OIC task (unpaired, two-sample t test; p < 0.01). Moreover, neural trajectories computed through principal-component analysis (PCA) on LIP population responses showed different starting points in OIC and DMC during the fixation period, suggesting that the neural dynamics for each task started at a slightly different point in neural population space (Figure S6). These observations suggest that LIP neurons could be preferentially engaged (i.e., have higher firing rates) when the task requires a saccadic (OIC) versus manual (DMC) report. It is possible that task difficulty influences firing rates such that differences in behavioral performance between the OIC and DMC tasks could explain firing rate differences. We controlled for task difficulty by considering a subset of task conditions: motion directions that were 30° away from the boundary that were matched in accuracy, and thus were equally difficult in both tasks. For these accuracy-matched conditions, we found that mean firing rates were significantly higher in the OIC task, indicating that task difficulty cannot explain differences in the magnitude of firing rates between tasks (unpaired, two-sample t test; p < 0.01). However, as the OIC and DMC tasks differ in other aspects besides motor response modality, we cannot be certain which factors account for this activity difference. For instance, because OIC trials are shorter than DMC trials, monkeys received more reward per unit time during the OIC blocks than DMC blocks. This difference in reward frequency could have led to increased motivation in the OIC task, which in turn could have led to increased firing rates. We next asked how encoding of task-relevant variables differed between tasks. We compared the fractions of cells that encoded the variables shared across tasks—sample motion direction and sample category. Because motion direction is nested within motion category, with any given motion direction associated either with category one or two, but not both, we used a two-level nested ANOVA to quantify direction and category selectivity independently of each other. In the OIC task, 65% of recorded neurons were selective for motion direction (two-level nested ANOVA with direction nested within category; p < 0.01) during the sample period although 50% were selective during the saccade epoch. Similarly, during the DMC task, 51% of recorded neurons were motion direction selective during the sample period and 25% were selective during the delay period. In addition to encoding motion direction, LIP neurons also encoded motion category throughout the trial. While 56% of cells were category selective during the OIC sample period, 63% of cells were category selective during the DMC sample period. In both tasks, many single neurons were category selective—responding similarly to directions within a category but distinctly to directions in different categories (example neurons in Figures 2A, 2B, and S2). Further, 52.6% of single neurons were direction selective in both tasks and 65.3% of neurons were category selective in both tasks, relative to total populations of direction and category-selective neurons, respectively. We note that several LIP neurons also showed anticipatory responses during the fixation period in both tasks (Figure 2B; neuron 2 during fixation in both OIC and DMC tasks). We compared firing rates during early versus late fixation periods and found that 62.7% of neurons in OIC and 51.1% of neurons in DMC showed significantly higher firing rates during late fixation than early fixation, indicating anticipatory responses before sample appearance (paired-sample t test; p < 0.05; Figures S3A and S3B). Finally, LIP neurons also encoded choice—i.e., saccade toward versus away from the RF in OIC and match versus non-match in DMC; 64% of neurons encoded saccade direction in OIC and 61% of neurons encoded match versus non-match in DMC. Thus, LIP activity multiplexes a variety of behaviorally relevant sensory (motion direction), decision (motion category), and motor (saccade direction and touch bar release) variables. Although single neurons encoded combinations of task-relevant variables in both tasks, we wondered whether population-level category representations were also encoded similarly between tasks, because both tasks relied on the same category rules (i.e., category boundary). Specifically, we asked whether the strength and timing of category signals differed between the OIC and DMC tasks by quantifying category selectivity in two ways—(1) a category tuning index (CTI) applied to single neurons (Freedman and Assad, 2006Freedman D.J. Assad J.A. Experience-dependent representation of visual categories in parietal cortex.Nature. 2006; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and (2) linear decoders to classify motion category at the population level (Swaminathan et al., 2013Swaminathan S.K. Masse N.Y. Freedman D.J. A comparison of lateral and medial intraparietal areas during a visual categorization task.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 13157-13170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; Sarma et al., 2016Sarma A. Masse N.Y. Wang X.J. Freedman D.J. Task-specific versus generalized mnemonic representations in parietal and prefrontal cortices.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The CTI quantifies category selectivity for each neuron by comparing firing rates between pairs of motion directions within the same category (within category difference [WCD]) versus different categories (between category difference [BCD]). To measure the strength of category selectivity, we constructed the CTI by taking the difference between BCD and WCD and dividing by their sum. CTI values range from −1 to +1, with 1 indicating “binary-like” responses to categories (large differences in firing rate for directions in different categories) and −1 indicating zero differences between categories (large differences in firing rate for directions within each category). In both tasks, mean CTI values during the shared sample period were shifted toward positive values (indicating categorical tuning) and were significantly greater than values during the fixation epoch (Figure 3A; OIC: sample CTI = 0.13 versus fixation CTI = 0.01; DMC: sample CTI = 0.19 versus fixation CTI = −3 × 10−3; paired t test p < 0.005 in both OIC and DMC). Further, we examined the relationship between the strength of category selectivity in the OIC and DMC tasks. If individual neurons encoded category signals in one task, but not the other, we might find a negative correlation between CTI measures across the population. Instead, we found a positive correlation between CTI values of neurons in both tasks (Figure 3D; r2 = 0.68; p < 10−4), indicating that the strength of category selectivity covaries between tasks. Next, we compared the time course of category signals for all direction-selective neurons in both tasks by calculating CTI in 200-ms windows stepped every 10 ms during fixation and shared sample periods. We found that mean CTI values were significantly greater in the DMC than OIC task during the late sample period, indicating stronger category representations in the DMC task (Figure 3B). Further, category selectivity was maintained through the delay period in the DMC task (Figure 3B, right panel). We also compared the time course of category signals when firing rates were aligned to response onset instead of sample onset by aligning neural responses to saccade onset in the OIC task and touch bar release in the DMC task (Figure 3C). We found that mean CTI values were greater in the DMC than OIC task, even in the motor response-aligned condition. Interestingly, the time course of the response-aligned CTI monotonically increased to reach its maximum value just before movement onset in both OIC and DMC tasks, indicating that categorical tuning peaks immediately prior to the motor response, independent of the motor modality used to report the decision (eye versus hand). We also used a population-level decoding approach to confirm our findings from the single-neuron CTI measure. We quantified the amount of category information in the LIP population using linear support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995Cortes C. Vapnik V. Support-vector networks.Mach. Learn. 1995; 20: 273-297Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) classifiers trained to decode whether population responses were elicited by stimuli from category one or category two. This analysis revealed strong and similar category decoding in both tasks (Figure S4; category decoder: DMC 99.4%, OIC 97.8%; bootstrap; p < 0.001 compared to chance). However, this category decoder measured category selectivity without controlling for motion direction selectivity, an inherent property of LIP neurons, thus potentially overestimating the amount of explicit category information in the population. To reduce the influence of direction tuning on our measure of category selectivity, a different linear classifier was trained and tested on different subsets of motion direction pairs with equivalent angular distances in each category. This direction-independent category decoder revealed higher category information in the DMC task, as both the mean and time course of decoding accuracy were significantly greater in the DMC task (Figures 3E and 3F; category decoder: DMC 95.9%, OIC 85.5%; bootstrap; p < 0.001 compared to chance). In sum, both the single-neuron CTI measure and the population-level decoders reveal that category selectivity is higher in the DMC task. Greater category selectivity in the DMC task was unexpected because firing rates in the DMC task were lower than in the OIC task. To understand which aspects of tuning accounted for greater category selectivity in the DMC than OIC task, we separately examined the BCD and WCD measures that were used to construct the category tuning index. This revealed that, although BCD values were comparable in both tasks, WCD values were significantly greater in the OIC than DMC task, indicating greater tuning for directions within a category in the OIC task (Figure 4A). Hence, the increase in CTI during the late sample of the DMC task is a direct consequence of more uniform firing rates among the within-category directions, i.e., within-category compression, resulting in a tendency for more binary-like category selectivity in the DMC task. Greater WCD in the OIC task predicts that neural populations would encode more within-category direction information in the OIC than DMC task. Using category-independent direction decoders trained to classify motion directions within a category, we confirmed greater within-category direction information in the OIC task (Figure 4B; direction decoder: DMC 65.1%, OIC 73.9%; bootstrap; p < 0.01 compared to chance). The time course of direction decoding also showed higher accuracy for within-category direction information in the OIC than DMC task, particularly in the late sample period (400–500 ms from sample onset; Figure 4C). In contrast to the sustained category information present through the delay period in the DMC task, within-category direction information decreased during the same delay epoch, suggesting that behaviorally relevant categorical information is stored in a low-dimensional, categorical representation instead of a high-dimensional, directional representation during the delay period (Figures 4A, 4C, and S7). Our results suggest that stronger category tuning in the DMC task is due to tighter clustering of responses to directions within each category that leads to larger differences between categories. Our results so far reveal stronger category representations in the DMC than OIC task. However, it remains unclear whether shared or distinct neural subpopulations encode category in the two tasks. In other words, are the same neurons contributing toward categorical judgments in a similar manner in both tasks? We employed a “cross-task” population decoding approach to directly compare the extent of overlap in population-level representations in both tasks. We trained category decoders on population firing rates from one task (e.g., OIC) and tested the decoder on trials from the other task (e.g., DMC). The cross-task decoder reliably decoded category well above chance during the shared sample period in both tasks (Figures 5A and 5B ;"

The current analytical methods for the quantification of sunscreen are mostly specific to individual chemical ingredients and based on complex analytical and instrumental techniques. A simple, selective, rapid, reproducible and low-cost spectrophotometric procedure for the quantification of commercial sunscreen in seawater is described here. The method is based on the inherent properties of these cosmetics to absorb in the wavelength of 300–400 nm. The absorption at 303 nm wavelength correlates with the concentration of most commercial sunscreens. This method allows the determination of sunscreens in the range of 2.5–1500 mg L -1 , it requires no sample pretreatment and offers a precision of up to 0.2%. The spectrophotometric method was applied to quantify sunscreen concentrations at an Atlantic Beach with values ranging from 10 to 96.7 mg L -1 in the unfiltered fraction and from the undetectable value to 75.7 mg L -1 in the dissolved fraction. This method is suggested as a tool for sunscreen quantifications in environmental investigations and monitoring programs."
https://openalex.org/W3111932734,"In recent years, the global greenhouse effect caused by excessive energy-related carbon emissions has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we studied the dynamic evolution of factors driving China's energy-related CO 2 emissions growth from 2007 to 2015 by using energy consumption method and input-output analysis and used the IO-SDA model to decompose the energy carbon emissions. Within the research interval, the results showed that (1) on the energy supply-side, the high carbon energy represented by raw coal was still the main factor to promote the growth of energy-related CO 2 emissions. However, the optimization of energy consumption structure is conducive to reducing emissions. Specifically, the high carbon energy represented by raw coal exhibited a downward trend in promoting the increment of energy-related CO 2 emissions, while the clean energy represented by natural gas showed an upward trend in promoting the increment of CO 2 emissions. It is worth noting that there is still a lot of room for optimization of China’s energy consumption structure to reduce emissions. (2) On the energy demand-side, the final demand effect is the main driving force of the growth of carbon emissions from fossil energy. Among them, the secondary industry plays a major role in the final demand effect. The ""high carbonization"" of the final product reflects the characteristics of China's high energy input in the process of industrialization. At the same time, since the carbon emission efficiency of the tertiary industry and the primary industry is better than that of the secondary industry, actively optimizing the industrial structure is conducive to slowing down the growth of carbon emission brought by the demand effect. (3) The input structure effect is the main restraining factor for the growth of energy carbon emissions, while the energy intensity effect has a slight driving effect on the growth of energy carbon emissions. The results show that China's ""extensive"" economic growth model has been effectively reversed, but the optimization of fossil energy utilization efficiency is still not obvious, and there is still a large space to curb carbon emissions by improving fossil energy utilization efficiency in the future."

Therefore, it is of interest to examine and compare the effects of age-associated changes on the general health and brain function impairment of Cd157 and Cd38 knockout (CD157 KO and CD38 KO) mice. The body weight and behaviors were measured in 8-week-old (young adult) or 12-month-old (middle-aged) male mice of both KO strains. The locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and social behavior of the mice were measured in the open field and three-chamber tests. The middle-aged CD157 KO male mice gained more body weight than young adult KO mice, while little or no body weight gain was observed in the middle-aged CD38 KO mice. Middle-aged CD157 KO mice displayed increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased sociability and interaction compared with young adult KO mice. Middle-aged CD38 KO mice showed less anxiety and hyperactivity than CD157 KO mice, similar to young adult CD38 KO mice. The results reveal marked age-dependent changes in male CD157 KO mice but not in male CD38 KO mice. We discuss the distinct differences in aging effects from the perspective of inhibition of NAD metabolism in CD157 and CD38 KO mice, which may contribute to differential behavioral changes during aging."
https://openalex.org/W3111532952,"Previous studies have proved that observational learning can induce placebo analgesia, but the factors that influence observationally induced placebo analgesia have not yet been extensively examined. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the effect of information about the role that the observed person (model) plays in the experiment on the magnitude of the observationally induced placebo effect. This study also examined the contribution of the observer’s empathy, conformity and fear of pain to the placebo analgesia induced by observational learning. The effects induced in two experimental groups and one control group were compared. Participants in the experimental groups observed a model introduced as either another participant taking part in the study or a coworker of the experimenter. The model rated the intensity of pain induced by electrocutaneous stimuli preceded by color stimuli. One-half of all participants watched a model rating pain stimuli preceded by the color orange as higher than stimuli preceded by the color blue; for the other half, the ratings were the opposite. There was no observation in the control group. Subsequently, all participants received pain stimuli of the same intensity preceded by orange and blue stimuli and rated the intensity of the experienced pain. Placebo analgesia was found in both experimental groups. However, the way the observed model was introduced to participants did not affect the magnitude of placebo analgesia. Thus, the study showed that the role played by the model is not crucial for observationally induced placebo analgesia. The examined observer’s individual characteristics did not predict the magnitude of placebo effect."
https://openalex.org/W3112252859,"Background To introduce new ways to calculate OB volumes, checking their validity and comparing them to already established technique i.e. OB volumetric based on manual segmentation of OB boundaries. Methods Two approaches were used to calculate OB volumes (1) Manual Segmentation using planimetric manual contouring; (2) Box-frame method, calculating the parameters based on a box placed around the OB. Results We calculated OB volumes using both techniques and found comparable outcomes. High inter-observer reliability was found for volumes calculated by both observers. For manual segmentation, Cronbach’s alpha (α) was 0.91 and 0.93 for right and left OB volume, respectively, whereas for the box-frame method α was 0.94 and 0.90 for right and left OB, respectively. Conclusions The simple box-frame method of OB volume calculation appears reliable. Its results are comparable to an established technique."
https://openalex.org/W3110665465,"In a previous study, we demonstrated that CHL1, the neuronal cell adhesion molecule close homolog of L1, acts as a tumor suppressor in human neuroblastoma (NB), a still highly lethal childhood malignancy, influencing its differentiation and proliferation degree. Here we found that ezrin, one of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, strongly interacts with CHL1. The low expression of EZRIN , as well as the low expression of CHL1 and of the neuronal differentiation marker MAP2 , correlates with poor outcome in NB patients. Knock-down of ezrin in HTLA-230 cell line induces neurite retraction, enhances cell proliferation and migration, and triggers anchorage-independent growth, with effects very similar to those already obtained by CHL1 silencing. Furthermore, lack of ezrin inhibits the expression of MAP2 and of the oncosuppressor molecule p53, whereas it enhances MAPK activation, all typical features of tumor aggressiveness. As already described, CHL1 overexpression in IMR-32 cell line provokes an opposite trend, but the co-silencing of ezrin reduces these effects, confirming the hypothesis that CHL1 acts in close connection with ezrin. Overall, our data show that ezrin reinforces the differentiating and oncosuppressive functions of CHL1, identifying this ERM protein as a new targetable molecule for NB therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3111033611,"Zinc oxide (ZnO) NP is considered as a nanoscale chemotherapeutic. Thus, the drug delivery of this inorganic NP is of considerable importance. Ras mutations are common in cancer and the activation of this signaling pathway is a hallmark in carcinoma, melanoma and many other aggressive malignancies. Thus, here we examined the binding and delivery of Ras binding domain (RBD), a model cancer-relevant protein and effector of Ras by ZnO NP. Shifts in zeta potential in water, PBS, DMEM and DMEM supplemented with FBS supported NP interaction to RBD. Fluorescence quenching of the NP was concentration-dependent for RBD, Stern–Volmer analysis of this data was used to estimate binding strength which was significant for ZnO-RBD (K d &lt; 10 −5 ). ZnO NP interaction to RBD was further confirmed by pull-down assay demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis. The ability of ZnO NP to inhibit 3-D tumor spheroid was demonstrated in HeLa cell spheroids—the ZnO NP breaking apart these structures revealing a significant (&gt;50%) zone of killing as shown by light and fluorescence microscopy after intra-vital staining. ZnO 100 nm was superior to ZnO 14 nm in terms of anticancer activity. When bound to ZnO NP, the anticancer activity of RBD was enhanced. These data indicate the potential diagnostic application or therapeutic activity of RBD-NP complexes in vivo which demands further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3112066979,"Background Prescription drug diversion, and misuse has increased over the past decade and is notably in high-income-countries and significantly contributes to the opioid epidemic. People living with HIV (PLWH) are particularly vulnerable to prescription drug diversion, and misuse as most experience chronic pain, mental health problems and HIV-related illnesses. The researchers investigated the prevalence and correlates of prescription drug diversion, and misuse among PLWH in the eThekwini district, KwaZulu-Natal. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 392 PLWH, conveniently recruited from the public healthcare facilities located in rural, semi-urban and urban areas of the eThekwini district. Participants answered questions about their background, prescription medications, substance use, and prescription drug diversion, and misuse. Descriptive analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of prescription drug diversion, and misuse. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of prescription drug diversion, and misuse. Findings Overall, 13% of the participants reported lifetime prescription drug diversion. The most common type of diversion was using prescription medication not prescribed by a healthcare provider (11%), followed by sharing of prescription medication (9%) and buying prescription medication without a medical script (5%). Twenty-three per cent of the participants reported prescription drug misuse in the past 90 days, with using prescription medication without a healthcare providers’ guidance (9%) and not following the scheduled time periods (8%) being the most common reported types of misuse. Self-medicating was identified as a risk factor for prescription drug misuse. There was no association between ART adherence and prescription drug diversion, and misuse. Conclusion The study findings contribute to improving the limited data available on prescription drug diversion, and misuse among PLWH in South Africa. The prevalence underscores a need for urgent interventions when prescribing medications with potential risks. Addressing the risk of self-medicating is imperative for HIV care outcomes and to avert death."
https://openalex.org/W3112695191,"Gallbladder mucocele (GBM) is a common biliary disorder in dogs. Gallbladder hypokinesia has been proposed to contribute to its formation and progression. The specific cause of gallbladder stasis in dogs with GBM as well as viable treatment options to resolve dysmotility remains unknown. Vitamin D deficiency is one of the many potential causes of gallbladder hypokinesia in humans and repletion results in complete resolution of stasis. Improving our understanding of the relationship between serum vitamin D and GBM could help identify dogs as a model for humans with gallbladder hypokinesia. Furthermore, this relationship could provide insight into the pathogenesis of GBM and support the need for future studies to investigate vitamin D as a novel treatment target. Therefore, goals of this study were i) to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin(OH)D concentrations were decreased in dogs with GBM, ii) if serum 25(OH)D concentrations were different in clinical versus dogs subclinical for GBM, and iii) to determine if serum 25(OH)D concentrations could predict the ultrasonographic type of GBM. Sixty-two dogs (clinical, n = 26; subclinical, n = 36) with GBM and 20 healthy control dogs were included in this prospective observational study. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured with a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay. Overall, dogs with GBM had lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations than control dogs (P = 0.004). Subsequent subgroup analysis indicated that this difference was only significant in the subclinical group compared to the control dogs (P = 0.008), and serum 25(OH)D concentrations did not significantly differ between dogs clinical for GBM versus subclinical or control dogs, indicating that inflammatory state in clinical dogs was not the major constituent of the observed findings. Decreasing serum 25(OH)D concentrations, but not clinical status, was associated with a more advanced developmental stage of GBM type determined by ultrasonography. Our results indicate that vitamin D has a role in dogs with GBM. Additional studies are needed to assess if reduced vitamin D in dogs with GBM is a cause or effect of their biliary disease and to investigate if vitamin D supplementation could be beneficial for dogs with GBM."
https://openalex.org/W3112097623,"Extracellular adenosine, a danger signal, can cause hypothermia. We generated mice lacking neuronal adenosine A 1 receptors (A 1 AR, encoded by the Adora1 gene) to examine the contribution of these receptors to hypothermia. Intracerebroventricular injection of the selective A 1 AR agonist (Cl-ENBA, 5'-chloro-5'-deoxy- N 6 -endo-norbornyladenosine) produced hypothermia, which was reduced in mice with deletion of A 1 AR in neurons. A non-brain penetrant A 1 AR agonist [SPA, N 6 -(p-sulfophenyl) adenosine] also caused hypothermia, in wild type but not mice lacking neuronal A 1 AR, suggesting that peripheral neuronal A 1 AR can also cause hypothermia. Mice expressing Cre recombinase from the Adora1 locus were generated to investigate the role of specific cell populations in body temperature regulation. Chemogenetic activation of Adora1-Cre-expressing cells in the preoptic area did not change body temperature. In contrast, activation of Adora1-Cre-expressing dorsomedial hypothalamus cells increased core body temperature, concordant with agonism at the endogenous inhibitory A 1 AR causing hypothermia. These results suggest that A 1 AR agonism causes hypothermia via two distinct mechanisms: brain neuronal A 1 AR and A 1 AR on neurons outside the blood-brain barrier. The variety of mechanisms that adenosine can use to induce hypothermia underscores the importance of hypothermia in the mouse response to major metabolic stress or injury."
https://openalex.org/W3112681741,"Background In percutaneous coronary intervention, drug-eluting stent (DES) showed better clinical outcome compared to bare-metal stent (BMS) but mostly with different DAPT durations. Hypothesis The clinical superiority of DES over BMS may depend on the medication adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Methods We retrospectively enrolled all Koreans PCI patients in year 2011 (n = 47,291). Medication adherence to DAPT was assessed by proportion of days covered (PDC) per 6 months. Analysis adjusted with the clinical propensity for receiving DES or BMS and DAPT PDC of the first 6 month was performed. Primary outcome was the 5-year major adverse clinical event (MACE) risk consisting all-cause death, revascularization, shock, or stroke. Results Patients with DES (n = 46,356) showed higher PDC (78% versus 60%, p&lt;0.001) and lower MACE risk (39% versus 56%, p&lt;0.001) compared to patients with BMS (n = 935). In the propensity-matched 1,868 patients, MACE risk was lower with DES than BMS (46% versus 54%, HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.70–0.91, p&lt;0.001). In both DES and BMS, patients with good medication adherence (PDC ≥80%) showed much lower MACE risk compared to patients with PDC &lt;80% (HR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.30–0.44; HR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.33–0.48, p&lt;0.001, all). Patients with DES and PDC &lt;80% showed higher MACE risk compared to BMS with and PDC ≥80% (HR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.03–1.64, p = 0.027). Conclusions Good medication adherence to DAPT in the first 6 month was prerequisite for better clinical outcome in both DES and BMS. DES with poor adherence to DAPT showed worse outcome compared with BMS with good adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3110768712,"Birches are generally known for their high genetic and morphological variability, which has resulted in the description of many species. Ojców birch was described in 1809 by Willibald Suibert Joseph Gottlieb Besser in Poland. Since then, several studies assessing its taxonomy were conducted. Today, various authors present Ojców birch at different taxonomic ranks. In Czechia, the Ojców birch is classified a critically endangered taxon and confirmed at one locality consisting of several tens of individuals. However, before a strategy for its conservation can be applied, we consider it necessary to assess the taxonomic position of the endangered Czech population and to evaluate its relationship to the original Polish population. This study aimed to evaluate the morphometric and genetic variability between populations of B . × oycoviensis in Poland and the Czechia and their relationship to regional populations of B . pendula , one of the putative parental species of the Ojców birch. Altogether, 106 individuals were sampled, including the holotype of B . szaferi , the second putative parental species of B . × oycoviensis , received from the herbarium of W. Szafer, which is deposited at the Institute of Botany in Kraków. Morphological analyses identified differences in leaves between B . × oycoviensis and B . pendula . However, no significant differences were found in genome size between selected taxa/working units except for B . pendula sampled in Czechia. The identified difference of the Czech population of B . pendula is probably caused by population variability. Genetic variability between all the taxa under comparison, regardless of their origin, was also very low; only the benchmark taxa ( B . nana and B . humilis ) clearly differed from all samples analyzed. The results indicate minute morphological and negligible genetic variability between the Czech and Polish populations of B . × oycoviensis . In light of our results, the classification of B . ×oycoviensis as B . pendula var. oycoviensis seems more accurate than all hitherto presented alternatives (e.g. B . ×oycoviensis as a separate species)."

https://openalex.org/W3111511574,"In humans, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been used as a clinical tool in diagnosis and/or prognosis of a variety of cancers and medical conditions, as well as in measuring physiological stress over time. Given the close phylogenetic relationship and physical similarities between humans and apes, NLR may similarly be a useful diagnostic tool in assessing chimpanzee health. Only one study has examined NLR in apes, reporting that NLR increased with age and was affected by body-mass index and sex. In the current study, we examined changes in NLR data from longitudinal health records for 443 chimpanzees in two captive chimpanzee populations. Using these data, we analyzed intra-individual changes and inter-individual differences in NLR as a function of age, rearing history, and sex. Contrary to previous studies in humans and the one previous study in chimpanzees, NLR values did not change over a 10-year timespan within individual chimpanzees. However, cross-sectional comparisons revealed a significant quadratic relationship between age and NLR, with the highest values during mid-life (20–30 years of age) and the lowest values in younger and older individuals. Additionally, males and mother-reared individuals had higher NLR than females and nursery-reared chimpanzees, respectively. Lastly, males and those with higher NLR values died at younger ages. These findings suggest that NLR may be useful as a predictor of longevity in chimpanzees. However, given the complexities of these relationships, more research is needed to determine the utility of NLR as a diagnostic health tool for chimpanzees."
https://openalex.org/W3110814374,"The treatment of children with posterior fossa brain tumours (PFBT) impacts their long term functional and imaging outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate academic achievement correlated with long-term sequelae after different PFBT treatment modalities. The study cohort consisted of 110 survivors (median age at diagnosis 10.1 years and median time of follow up 13.2 years) who completed hearing questionnaires, neurological assessment and MRI of the brain ≥5 years after the end of treatment. There were three treatment groups. A cisplatin group which underwent cisplatin chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery (medulloblastoma N = 40), a radiotherapy group which underwent radiotherapy and surgery (astrocytoma/ependymoma N = 30), and a surgery group (astrocytoma N = 40). Academic achievement was correlated to the age at diagnosis, ototoxicity, Karnofsky score (KS), and MRI findings (Fazekas Score (FS)- treatment related parenchymal changes). For a modelled age at diagnosis of five years, the cisplatin group had lower academic achievements compared to the radiotherapy (p = 0.028) and surgery (p = 0.014) groups. Academic achievements evaluated at a modelled age of 10 years at diagnosis did not significantly differ among the treatment groups. The cisplatin group exhibited a higher occurrence of ototoxicity than the radiotherapy (p&lt;0.019) and surgery groups (p&lt;0.001); however, there was no correlation between ototoxicity and academic achievements (p = 0.722) in older age at diagnosis. The radiotherapy group exhibited lower KS than the surgery group (p&lt;0.001). KS significantly influenced academic achievements in all groups (p&lt;0.000). The cisplatin group exhibited higher FS than the surgery group (p&lt;0.001) while FS did not correlate with academic achievement (p = 0.399). Older age is a protective factor for academic achievements irrespective of a treatment modality."
https://openalex.org/W3112437661,"Objective Based on a national survey of program directors we developed a letter of recommendation (LOR) scoring rubric (SR) to assess LORs submitted to a pediatric residency program. The objective was to use the SR to analyze: the consistency of LOR ratings across raters and LOR components that contributed to impression of the LOR and candidate. Methods We graded 30 LORs submitted to a pediatric residency program that were evenly distributed based on final rank by our program. The SR contained 3 sections (letter features, phrases, and applicant abilities) and 2 questions about the quality of the LOR (LORQ) and impression of the candidate (IC) after reading the LOR on a 5-point Likert scale. Inter-rater reliability was calculated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(2,1)). Pearson (r) correlations and stepwise multivariate linear regression modeling predicted LORQ and IC. Mean scores of phrases, features, and applicant abilities were analyzed with ANOVA and Bonferroni correction. Results Phrases (ICC(2,1) = 0.82, p&lt;0.001)) and features (ICC(2,1) = 0.60, p&lt;0.001)) were rated consistently, while applicant abilities were not (ICC(2,1) = 0.28, p&lt;0.001)). For features, LORQ (R 2 = 0.75, p&lt;0.001) and IC (R 2 = 0.58, p&lt;0.001) were best predicated by: writing about candidates’ abilities, strength of recommendation, and depth of interaction with the applicant. For abilities, LORQ (R 2 = 0.47, p&lt;0.001) and IC (R 2 = 0.51, p&lt;0.001) were best predicted by: clinical reasoning, leadership, and communication skills (0.2). There were significant differences for phrases and features (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions The SR was consistent across raters and correlates with impression of LORQ and IC. This rubric has potential as a faculty development tool for writing LORS."
https://openalex.org/W3112845350,"Following a successful renal transplantation circulating markers of inflammation may remain elevated, and systemic inflammation is associated with worse clinical outcome in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Vitamin D-receptor (VDR) activation is postulated to modulate inflammation and endothelial function. We aimed to explore if a synthetic vitamin D, paricalcitol, could influence systemic inflammation and immune activation in RTRs. Newly transplanted RTRs were included in an open-label randomized controlled trial on the effect of paricalcitol on top of standard care over the first post-transplant year. Fourteen pre-defined circulating biomarkers reflecting leukocyte activation, endothelial activation, fibrosis and general inflammatory burden were analyzed in 74 RTRs at 8 weeks (baseline) and 1 year post-engraftment. Mean changes in plasma biomarker concentrations were compared by t -test. The expression of genes coding for the same biomarkers were investigated in 1-year surveillance graft biopsies (n = 60). In patients treated with paricalcitol circulating osteoprotegerin levels increased by 0.19 ng/ml, compared with a 0.05 ng/ml increase in controls (p = 0.030). In graft tissue, a 21% higher median gene expression level of TNFRSF11B coding for osteoprotegerin was found in paricalcitol-treated patients compared with controls (p = 0.026). Paricalcitol treatment did not significantly affect the blood- or tissue levels of any other investigated inflammatory marker. In RTRs, paricalcitol treatment might increase both circulating and tissue levels of osteoprotegerin, a modulator of calcification, but potential anti-inflammatory treatment effects in RTRs are likely very modest.

https://openalex.org/W3113295175,"Purpose Seeking to improve the access to regenerative medicine, this study investigated the structural and transcriptional effects of storage temperature on human oral mucosal epithelial cells (OMECs). Methods Cells were stored at four different temperatures (4°C, 12°C, 24°C and 37°C) for two weeks. Then, the morphology, cell viability and differential gene expression were examined using light and scanning electron microscopy, trypan blue exclusion test and TaqMan gene expression array cards, respectively. Results Cells stored at 4°C had the most similar morphology to non-stored controls with the highest viability rate (58%), whereas the 37°C group was most dissimilar with no living cells. The genes involved in stress-induced growth arrest ( GADD45B ) and cell proliferation inhibition ( TGFB2 ) were upregulated at 12°C and 24°C. Upregulation was also observed in multifunctional genes responsible for morphology, growth, adhesion and motility such as EFEMP1 (12°C) and EPHA4 (4°C–24°C). Among genes used as differentiation markers, PPARA and TP53 (along with its associated gene CDKN1A ) were downregulated in all temperature conditions, whereas KRT1 and KRT10 were either unchanged (4°C) or downregulated (24°C and 12°C; and 24°C, respectively), except for upregulation at 12°C for KRT1 . Conclusions Cells stored at 12°C and 24°C were stressed, although the expression levels of some adhesion-, growth- and apoptosis-related genes were favourable. Collectively, this study suggests that 4°C is the optimal storage temperature for maintenance of structure, viability and function of OMECs after two weeks."
https://openalex.org/W3110677592,"Pollen viability is crucial for wheat breeding programs. The unique potential of the protoplasm of live cells to turn brown due to the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through rapid photoreduction of Ag + , was exploited for testing wheat pollen viability. Ag + -viability test medium (consisting of 0.5 mM AgNO 3 and 300 mM KNO 3 ) incubated with wheat pollen turned brown within 2 min under intense light (~600 μmol photon flux density m -2 s -1 ), but not in dark. The brown medium displayed AgNPs-specific surface plasmon resonance band in its absorption spectrum. Light microscopic studies showed the presence of uniformly stained brown protoplasm in viable pollen incubated with Ag + -viability medium in the presence of light. Investigations with transmission electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray established the presence of distinct 5–35 nm NPs composed of Ag. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that AgNPs were crystalline and biphasic composed of Ag 0 and Ag 2 O. Conversely, non-viable pollen and heat-killed pollen did not turn brown on incubation with Ag +- medium in light. We believe that the viable wheat pollen turn brown rapidly by bio-transforming Ag + to AgNPs through photoreduction. Our findings furnish a novel simplest and rapid method for testing wheat pollen viability."
https://openalex.org/W3112366987,"The rice stem borer (RSB), Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is an important agricultural pest that has caused serious economic losses in the major rice-producing areas of China. To effectively control this pest, we investigated the genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and genetic structure of 16 overwintering populations in the typical bivoltine areas of northern China based on 12 nuclear microsatellite loci. Moderate levels of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation among the studied populations were detected. Neighbour-joining dendrograms, Bayesian clustering and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) consistently divided these populations into three genetic clades: western, eastern and northern/central. Isolation by distance (IBD) and spatial autocorrelation analyses demonstrated no correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance. Bottleneck analysis illustrated that RSB populations had not undergone severe bottleneck effects in these regions. Accordingly, our results provide new insights into the genetic relationships of overwintering RSB populations and thus contribute to developing effective management strategies for this pest."
