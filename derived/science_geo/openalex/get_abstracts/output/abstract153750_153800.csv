We report proteomic characterization with mass spectrometry and immunoblotting of NMDAR multiprotein complexes (NRC) isolated from mouse brain. The NRC comprised 77 proteins organized into receptor, adaptor, signaling, cytoskeletal and novel proteins, of which 30 are implicated from binding studies and another 19 participate in NMDAR signaling. NMDAR and metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes were linked to cadherins and L1 cell-adhesion molecules in complexes lacking AMPA receptors. These neurotransmitter-adhesion receptor complexes were bound to kinases, phosphatases, GTPase-activating proteins and Ras with effectors including MAPK pathway components. Several proteins were encoded by activity-dependent genes. Genetic or pharmacological interference with 15 NRC proteins impairs learning and with 22 proteins alters synaptic plasticity in rodents. Mutations in three human genes (NF1, Rsk-2, L1) are associated with learning impairments, indicating the NRC also participates in human cognition."

We hypothesize that additional activities of latrunculin A may be important for its biological activity. Our data are consistent with the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.2 to 0.4 μm and provide no evidence that the actin-latrunculin A complex participates in the elongation of actin filaments. Profilin and latrunculin A bind independently to actin, whereas binding of thymosin β4 to actin is inhibited by latrunculin A. Potential implications of this differential effect on actin-binding proteins are discussed. From a structural perspective, if latrunculin A binds to actin at a site that sterically influences binding by thymosin β4, then the observation that latrunculin A inhibits nucleotide exchange on actin implies an allosteric effect on the nucleotide binding cleft. Alternatively, if, as previously postulated, latrunculin A binds in the nucleotide cleft of actin, then its ability to inhibit binding by thymosin β4 is a surprising result that suggests that significant allosteric changes affect the thymosin β4 binding site. We show that latrunculin A and actin form a crystalline structure with orthorhombic space group P212121and diffraction to 3.10 Å. A high resolution structure with optimized crystallization conditions should provide insight regarding these remarkable allosteric properties.

A high resolution structure with optimized crystallization conditions should provide insight regarding these remarkable allosteric properties. Latrunculin A, isolated from the Red Sea sponge Negombata magnifica, was initially identified as an inhibitor of actin polymerization by its morphological effects and by the effects it had on actin filament distribution in cultured nonmuscle cells (1Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 214: 493-495Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Based on the effects of latrunculin A on the steady state level of F-actinin vitro, the effects of the drug were thought to be consistent with sequestration of monomeric actin in a 1:1 molar complex with equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.2 μm (2Coué M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The binding site of latrunculin has not been conclusively identified, but based on the study of the effects of specific mutations of yeast actin on latrunculin A binding, it has been inferred that latrunculin A may bind to actin near or in its nucleotide binding cleft (3Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 4Belmont L.D. Patterson G.M.L. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1325-1336PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that latrunculin affects nucleotide exchange has been offered as support of this conclusion (3Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). These data, however, are inconclusive in light of the fact that many actin-binding proteins with binding sites that are spatially distant from the nucleotide cleft are also able to affect nucleotide exchange (5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and that actin demonstrates several additional allosteric properties that serve as a precedent for the transmission of structural alterations to distant sites (6Kuznetsova I.

J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).When latrunculin A is employed in studies of cell biology, the observed effects are consistent with depolymerization of actin filaments consequent to sequestration of monomeric actin by latrunculin (9Spector I. Shocet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). A previous preliminary report (2Coué M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) did not rule out the possibility that latrunculin A has effects related to the polymerization of actin in addition to monomer sequestration, and these possibilities are explored in our current studies. Other effects of latrunculin A on the cytoskeleton are possible, however, and evidence has been reported that latrunculin can affect the expression of actin and possibly of other actin-binding proteins by a feedback mechanism that may sense the cellular concentration of actin monomers, resulting in more complicated outcomes than that predicted by monomer sequestration alone (10Bershadsky A.D. Gluck U. Denisenko O.N. Sklyarova T.V. Spector I. Ben-Zéev A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the surface interactions of latrunculin A and actin, we examined whether latrunculin A affected the interaction of actin with other actin-monomer-binding proteins. To our surprise, latrunculin A inhibited binding by thymosin β4 but not binding by profilin or DNase I. Because thymosin β4 has been postulated to perform functions related to wound healing (11Frohm M. Gunne H. Bergman A.C. Agerberth B. Bergman T. Boman A. Liden S. Jornvall H. Boman H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), apoptosis (12Niu M. Nachmias V.T. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the inflammatory response (13Young J.D. Lawrence A.J. MacLean A.G. Leung B.P. McInnes I.B. Canas B. Pappin D.J.C. Stevenson R.D. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), augmentation of the concentration of free thymosin β4 by latrunculin A could potentiate these responses. Our results imply that actin-binding marine natural products may have effects other than those predicted solely by their effects on actin polymerization and, by inference, that marine natural products may exist that affect actin-binding protein function without directly affecting actin polymerization. Finally, our results illustrate a novel mechanism by which pharmacological agents that bind actin could be used to modulate the function of actin-binding proteins.DISCUSSIONOur current data show that in the presence of latrunculin A, profilin binds to actin independently, or perhaps with some positive cooperativity. Similarly, latrunculin A had no apparent effect on actin-DNase I interactions. In contrast, binding of thymosin β4 to actin is inhibited by latrunculin A. Previous reported information suggested that latrunculin A bound to actin in the cleft between subdomains 2 and 4 of actin, at a site adjacent to the adenine nucleotide binding site (3Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). We confirm that latrunculin A inhibits adenine nucleotide exchange on actin. Just as DNase I, which bridges the cleft between subdomains 2 and 4, reduces the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange on actin (31Polzar B. Nowak E. Goody R.S. Mannherz H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), latrunculin A may limit the flexibility of the cleft and trap nucleotide, thereby resulting in relative inhibition of nucleotide exchange.Inhibition of the binding of thymosin β4 to actin by latrunculin A does not necessarily conflict with the postulated localization of latrunculin A to the nucleotide-binding cleft of actin. Neither the analytical ultracentrifuge data nor the fluorescence anisotropy data are consistent with simple competitive inhibition (in which case, (K d LT)−1= 0), but rather, they suggest that latrunculin A inhibits thymosin β4 noncompetitively. Noncompetitive inhibition of thymosin β4 binding to actin by latrunculin A has several possible structural interpretations. Latrunculin A could bind near or at the binding site of thymosin β4, but not be large enough to create a steric effect that completely eliminates simultaneous binding by thymosin β4. Because evidence has been reported that thymosin β4 may bind to actin in an extended conformation, with interactions on actin at multiple sites (5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), a second possibility is that latrunculin A sterically competes at one site of interaction, and the weak affinity of thymosin β4 in the presence of latrunculin A is due to residual interactions between actin and thymosin β4 at other sites. The third possibility is that latrunculin A inhibits binding by an allosteric effect, perhaps with a binding site in the nucleotide binding cleft of actin, as previously suggested.The most recent models of thymosin β4 bound to actin show that thymosin β4 is more than 20 Å from the nucleotide binding cleft (5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In these analyses, earlier evidence that thymosin β4 could be covalently cross-linked to ATPγS (32Reichert A. Heintz D. Echner H. Voelter W. Faulstich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1301-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was considered to be an artifact produced by cross-linking free, rather than actin-bound, nucleotide to thymosin β4. Although considerable evidence supports the identification of an interaction between subdomain 1 of actin and thymosin β4 (5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Reichert A. Heintz D. Echner H. Voelter W. Faulstich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1301-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Ballweber E. Hannappel E. Huff T. Mannherz H.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), disagreement continues regarding whether thymosin β4binds directly to subdomain 2 of actin (5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or whether the effects on subdomain 2 can be explained by an allosteric mechanism (33Ballweber E. Hannappel E. Huff T. Mannherz H.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To summarize, if latrunculin A does bind in the nucleotide-binding cleft of actin, then effects on thymosin β4 are the result of substantial allosteric effects on actin. Conversely, latrunculin A may bind at or near one of the thymosin β4 binding sites on actin and, like thymosin β4, allosterically affect the rate of nucleotide exchange.Proteins that bind to actin may regulate actin filament dynamics and may have functions independent of their actin-regulatory functions. Moreover, these functions may be regulated by their interaction with actin filaments or monomers. Profilin and thymosin β4have proven to be typical examples for which identification of actin-regulatory functions has been followed by the identification of complex functions that may, in turn, be dependent on actin binding activity. The regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism by profilin and the roles of thymosin β4 in wound healing, apoptosis, and immunosuppression illustrate the diversity of functions served by such proteins (12Niu M. Nachmias V.T. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Young J.D. Lawrence A.J. MacLean A.G. Leung B.P. McInnes I.B. Canas B. Pappin D.J.C. Stevenson R.D. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Frohm M. Gunne H. Bergman A.C. Agerberth B. Bergman T. Boman A. Liden S. Jornvall H. Boman H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 34Huff T. Ballweber E. Humeny A. Bonk T. Becker C. Müller C.S.G. Mannherz H.G. Hannappel E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). With latrunculin A, we have demonstrated that a drug that binds to actin may have differential effects on various actin-binding proteins. Given the independent functions of these actin-binding proteins, the effects of actin-binding drugs may have far-reaching consequences. First, these effects may be significant when the drugs are employed to dissect cell biological problems. Thus, the consequences of addition of latrunculin A to cells in vivo or in situ may be the result of factors other than simple monomer sequestration. Secondly, our preliminary work with more than 20 derivatives of latrunculin A suggests that derivatization may independently alter properties of monomer sequestration and inhibition of thymosin β4 binding. Finally, it may be possible to exploit these effects in a therapeutic context.With regard to the effects of thymosin β4 on immune suppression, thymosin β4 sulfoxide appears to be an effector molecule for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids (13Young J.D. Lawrence A.J. MacLean A.G. Leung B.P. McInnes I.B. Canas B. Pappin D.J.C. Stevenson R.D. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is not known how thymosin β4 gets sulfonated or gets to the extracellular space, but it is certainly possible that only free thymosin β4actively participates in either one or both of these steps. If so, latrunculin A may activate the anti-inflammatory function of thymosin β4 by increasing free thymosin β4concentrations. Thus, actin-binding drugs may induce specific, desired effects by a novel mechanism. Because several cell regulatory proteins, such as protein kinases and their substrates, are spatially regulated by anchorage to F-actin (35Freeman J.L. De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20653-20657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36Prekeris R. Hernandez R.M. Mayhew M.W. White M.K. Terrian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26790-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 37Bubb M.R. Lenox R.H. Edison A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36472-36478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the potential displacement and activation of these proteins by actin-binding drugs suggests that this general mechanism may, in other instances, have broad implications with complicated consequences.Latrunculin A lowers the affinity of actin for thymosin β4 by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Although this is not a large thermodynamic effect, it is likely to be significant in living cells. In a cell such as a polymorphonuclear leukocyte with approximately 150 μm thymosin β4 (38Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the addition of saturating concentrations of latrunculin A would result in a rapid change in the effective equilibrium dissociation constant for thymosin β4 from approximately 0.3 (K d T) to 8 μm (K d LT). Assuming that the critical concentration of actin in a cell is maintained at approximately 1.0 μm by capping of barbed ends, this would be expected to cause an immediate increase in the amount of free thymosin β4 by approximately 15 μm. If excluded volume conditions in the cytoplasm increase the relative affinity of these interactions by a factor of 10, which is a conservative estimate (39Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), then the concentration of free thymosin β4 would increase 3-fold immediately after adding latrunculin A. Later, as actin depolymerizes and the complex of actin-latrunculin A begins to accumulate, this complex becomes a sink for monomer sequestering proteins, particularly those that bind to the complex as well as they bind to free actin. Thus, at steady state, both free profilin and free thymosin β4concentrations would be diminished after addition of latrunculin A, but because of the differential effect of latrunculin A, the decrease in profilin concentration would be much greater than that for thymosin β4.The actin crystal described here is unique because it is the first actin crystal to diffract to this resolution in the absence of other actin-binding proteins. It is also unique in its symmetry and packing volume. The successful use of a marine natural product inhibitor of actin polymerization to stabilize actin for purposes of crystallization may have other applications. In cases in which production of an actin crystal in complex with other proteins or peptides of interest has been unsuccessful to date, the addition of latrunculin A or another actin-stabilizing marine natural product may facilitate crystal growth. Latrunculin A, isolated from the Red Sea sponge Negombata magnifica, was initially identified as an inhibitor of actin polymerization by its morphological effects and by the effects it had on actin filament distribution in cultured nonmuscle cells (1Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 214: 493-495Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Based on the effects of latrunculin A on the steady state level of F-actinin vitro, the effects of the drug were thought to be consistent with sequestration of monomeric actin in a 1:1 molar complex with equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.2 μm (2Coué M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The binding site of latrunculin has not been conclusively identified, but based on the study of the effects of specific mutations of yeast actin on latrunculin A binding, it has been inferred that latrunculin A may bind to actin near or in its nucleotide binding cleft (3Ayscough K.R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or whether the effects on subdomain 2 can be explained by an allosteric mechanism (33Ballweber E. Hannappel E. Huff T. Mannherz H.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To summarize, if latrunculin A does bind in the nucleotide-binding cleft of actin, then effects on thymosin β4 are the result of substantial allosteric effects on actin. Conversely, latrunculin A may bind at or near one of the thymosin β4 binding sites on actin and, like thymosin β4, allosterically affect the rate of nucleotide exchange.Proteins that bind to actin may regulate actin filament dynamics and may have functions independent of their actin-regulatory functions. Moreover, these functions may be regulated by their interaction with actin filaments or monomers. Profilin and thymosin β4have proven to be typical examples for which identification of actin-regulatory functions has been followed by the identification of complex functions that may, in turn, be dependent on actin binding activity. The regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism by profilin and the roles of thymosin β4 in wound healing, apoptosis, and immunosuppression illustrate the diversity of functions served by such proteins (12Niu M.

With latrunculin A, we have demonstrated that a drug that binds to actin may have differential effects on various actin-binding proteins. Given the independent functions of these actin-binding proteins, the effects of actin-binding drugs may have far-reaching consequences. First, these effects may be significant when the drugs are employed to dissect cell biological problems. Thus, the consequences of addition of latrunculin A to cells in vivo or in situ may be the result of factors other than simple monomer sequestration. Secondly, our preliminary work with more than 20 derivatives of latrunculin A suggests that derivatization may independently alter properties of monomer sequestration and inhibition of thymosin β4 binding. Finally, it may be possible to exploit these effects in a therapeutic context.With regard to the effects of thymosin β4 on immune suppression, thymosin β4 sulfoxide appears to be an effector molecule for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids (13Young J.D.

It is not known how thymosin β4 gets sulfonated or gets to the extracellular space, but it is certainly possible that only free thymosin β4actively participates in either one or both of these steps. If so, latrunculin A may activate the anti-inflammatory function of thymosin β4 by increasing free thymosin β4concentrations. Thus, actin-binding drugs may induce specific, desired effects by a novel mechanism. Because several cell regulatory proteins, such as protein kinases and their substrates, are spatially regulated by anchorage to F-actin (35Freeman J.L. De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Lefkowitz R.J.

Although this is not a large thermodynamic effect, it is likely to be significant in living cells. In a cell such as a polymorphonuclear leukocyte with approximately 150 μm thymosin β4 (38Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the addition of saturating concentrations of latrunculin A would result in a rapid change in the effective equilibrium dissociation constant for thymosin β4 from approximately 0.3 (K d T) to 8 μm (K d LT). Assuming that the critical concentration of actin in a cell is maintained at approximately 1.0 μm by capping of barbed ends, this would be expected to cause an immediate increase in the amount of free thymosin β4 by approximately 15 μm. If excluded volume conditions in the cytoplasm increase the relative affinity of these interactions by a factor of 10, which is a conservative estimate (39Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), then the concentration of free thymosin β4 would increase 3-fold immediately after adding latrunculin A. Later, as actin depolymerizes and the complex of actin-latrunculin A begins to accumulate, this complex becomes a sink for monomer sequestering proteins, particularly those that bind to the complex as well as they bind to free actin. Thus, at steady state, both free profilin and free thymosin β4concentrations would be diminished after addition of latrunculin A, but because of the differential effect of latrunculin A, the decrease in profilin concentration would be much greater than that for thymosin β4.The actin crystal described here is unique because it is the first actin crystal to diffract to this resolution in the absence of other actin-binding proteins. It is also unique in its symmetry and packing volume. The successful use of a marine natural product inhibitor of actin polymerization to stabilize actin for purposes of crystallization may have other applications. In cases in which production of an actin crystal in complex with other proteins or peptides of interest has been unsuccessful to date, the addition of latrunculin A or another actin-stabilizing marine natural product may facilitate crystal growth. Our current data show that in the presence of latrunculin A, profilin binds to actin independently, or perhaps with some positive cooperativity. Similarly, latrunculin A had no apparent effect on actin-DNase I interactions. In contrast, binding of thymosin β4 to actin is inhibited by latrunculin A. Previous reported information suggested that latrunculin A bound to actin in the cleft between subdomains 2 and 4 of actin, at a site adjacent to the adenine nucleotide binding site (3Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). We confirm that latrunculin A inhibits adenine nucleotide exchange on actin. Just as DNase I, which bridges the cleft between subdomains 2 and 4, reduces the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange on actin (31Polzar B. Nowak E. Goody R.S. Mannherz H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), latrunculin A may limit the flexibility of the cleft and trap nucleotide, thereby resulting in relative inhibition of nucleotide exchange. Inhibition of the binding of thymosin β4 to actin by latrunculin A does not necessarily conflict with the postulated localization of latrunculin A to the nucleotide-binding cleft of actin. Neither the analytical ultracentrifuge data nor the fluorescence anisotropy data are consistent with simple competitive inhibition (in which case, (K d LT)−1= 0), but rather, they suggest that latrunculin A inhibits thymosin β4 noncompetitively. Noncompetitive inhibition of thymosin β4 binding to actin by latrunculin A has several possible structural interpretations. Latrunculin A could bind near or at the binding site of thymosin β4, but not be large enough to create a steric effect that completely eliminates simultaneous binding by thymosin β4. Because evidence has been reported that thymosin β4 may bind to actin in an extended conformation, with interactions on actin at multiple sites (5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), a second possibility is that latrunculin A sterically competes at one site of interaction, and the weak affinity of thymosin β4 in the presence of latrunculin A is due to residual interactions between actin and thymosin β4 at other sites. The third possibility is that latrunculin A inhibits binding by an allosteric effect, perhaps with a binding site in the nucleotide binding cleft of actin, as previously suggested. The most recent models of thymosin β4 bound to actin show that thymosin β4 is more than 20 Å from the nucleotide binding cleft (5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In these analyses, earlier evidence that thymosin β4 could be covalently cross-linked to ATPγS (32Reichert A. Heintz D. Echner H. Voelter W. Faulstich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1301-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was considered to be an artifact produced by cross-linking free, rather than actin-bound, nucleotide to thymosin β4. Although considerable evidence supports the identification of an interaction between subdomain 1 of actin and thymosin β4 (5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Reichert A. Heintz D. Echner H. Voelter W. Faulstich H. J. Biol.

Fas, TNF-R1, and DR3, the first three identified death domain-containing receptors, initiate apoptosis through recruitment of a common adapter protein FADD. FADD in turn recruits caspase 8 to form the death-inducing signaling complex, which leads to activation of a caspase cascade and eventual cell-death.FADD−/− MEFs are resistant to FasL or TNF-induced apoptosis and apoptosis mediated by DR3 overexpression.

The authors concluded that FADD was not required for DR4- and possibly DR5-mediated apoptosis.

Primers from the EST sequence were used to perform 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR using a mouse spleen cDNA library to obtain a longer clone. This longer clone was used to screen a thymus cDNA phage library to obtain a full-length cDNA clone, which was cloned into pCI-HA. This HA-mDR4/5 was then cloned into the PmeI site of MSCV-puro-PLAP. BOSC cells were transfected by calcium phosphate with empty vector or MSCV-mDR4/5-puro-PLAP to generate viral supernatants.FADD+/− and FADD−/−MEFs were infected with respective viral supernatants. The cells were maintained in puromycin selection (10 mg/ml) and analyzed for PLAP by flow cytometry. pCMV1-flag-DR5 and pCDNA3-flag-DR4 were co-transfected with pTK-Hygro by LipofectAMINETM Plus. Cells were placed into hygromycin selection at 50 mg/ml. The mouse cDNA of FADD was cloned into the XhoI site of MSCV-zeo. Viral supernatants were obtained and used to infect FADD−/− MEF cells stably transfected with hDR4 or hDR5. Batch cultures were selected in the presence of 100 mg/ml zeocin. The extracellular domain ofmDR4/5 was obtained by PCR with gene-specific primer pairs for cloning into pGEX-2T to create a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified with glutathione-agarose beads and used as antigen to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. For Western blot, cell extracts were generated using 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (18Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Blots were secondarily probed with horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit antibodies and were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells were trypsinized and washed with flow buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline with 2% FCS). The cells were then blocked in 10% goat serum for 15 min on ice and stained using mouse anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase (DAKO, clone 8B6) followed by goat anti-mouse phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody. Cells were treated with increasing amounts of human recombinant TRAIL (Biomol) in the presence of 500 ng/ml cycloheximide for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were analyzed for viability by either the crystal violet or the MTT assay. MTT was added to each sample to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated for 3–4 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and isopropyl alcohol was added. Following color elution, absorbance at 595 nm was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Cells were stained for 15 min in 100 ml of annexin V buffer with 1–2 ml of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate. An additional 400 ml of annexin V buffer was added to each sample, and the cells were analyzed on a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer. We established that FADD+/− andFADD−/− MEFs were not sensitive to TRAIL. Addition of soluble human TRAIL to the mouse fibroblast line, L929, led to apoptosis but did not cause substantial death of eitherFADD+/− or FADD−/−MEFs even in the presence of cycloheximide. 2A. A. Kuang, G. Diehl, J. Zhang, and A. Winoto, unpublished data. This could be due to either a lack or low level expression of TRAIL receptors. We therefore stably transfected both FADD+/− andFADD−/− MEFs with the mouse TRAILreceptor expression plasmid. We identified a full-length mouseTRAIL receptor cDNA by screening a thymus cDNA library with a mouse EST probe homologous to human DR4 andDR5. Sequencing of this clone showed that it is identical to the reported mouse DR5 TRAIL receptor (16Wu G.S. Burns T.F. Zhan Y. Alnemri E.S. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2770-2775PubMed Google Scholar). However, because its predicted polypeptide is 39% identical and 56% homologous to both human DR4 and DR5 alike, it is not clear if this gene is the mouse ortholog of human DR4 or DR5. We will call this gene henceforth as mDR4/5. In transient transfection of 293T cells, expression of this gene leads to extensive apoptosis and PARP cleavage (data not shown). We then stably transfected mDR4/5into MEF cells and established several individual clones. Two empty vector-transfected controls and three mDR4/5-transfected clones were chosen for further analysis. To detect the TRAIL receptor protein expression, polyclonal antibodies were generated using a GST fusion protein. The mDR4/5-specific antiserum detects a protein with the predicted molecular mass of 46 kDa (Fig.1). This species is present only in extracts of mDR4/5 transiently transfected cells but not in nontransfected cells or MEF cells. A similar band was detected in threemDR4/5 stably transfected FADD heterozygous MEF cells (mDR2-2, mDR2-17, mDR2-30) and in threeFADD−/− stably transfected cells (mDR2-4, mDR2-10, mDR2-11, Fig. 1). To assess the sensitivity of these transfected cells to TRAIL-mediated cell death, we subjected them to increasing amounts of human TRAIL protein in the presence of the protein inhibitor cycloheximide. Human TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptosis in both human and mouse cells alike (19Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Ruppert S. Donahue C.J. Moore A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig.2 A, apoptosis can clearly be seen in mDR4/5 stably transfectedFADD+/− cells, whereas control vector alone-transfected cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death. In FADD−/− MEF cells, however, transfection of mDR4/5 did not confer TRAIL sensitivity. All three stably transfected cells are equally resistant to the same extent to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as the vector alone-transfected cells (Fig.2 A, right panel). Similar results were also obtained by measuring annexin V, which detects translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cellular membrane in early apoptotic cells (Fig. 2 B). To see if the requirement for FADD in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis also applies to the human receptors, we expressed human DR4 or human DR5 into FADD-deficient MEF cells by stable transfection. Expression of the human receptors was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR with gene-specific primers (Fig.3 and data not shown). For further analysis, we selected four DR4- and three DR5-transfected clones. As shown in Fig. 4, none of these cells is sensitive to the addition of human TRAIL protein (Fig. 4 A,dashed lines, and Fig. 4 B, left panel). To restore FADD function, a retroviral construct expressing mouse FADD was transduced into all theDR4- and DR5-transfectedFADD−/− clones. Western blot analysis with FADD-specific antisera showed that FADD is expressed at high levels in these cells (Fig. 3). Addition of TRAIL to these cells led to apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis can be seen in all DR4- or DR5-expressing cells (Fig. 4 A), and the extent of cell death is similar to a known TRAIL-sensitive mouse cell line, L929 (19Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Ruppert S.

This is further confirmed by annexin V assay (Fig.4 B).Figure 4FADD is required for human DR4- and DR5-mediated apoptosis. A, individual clones ofFADD−/− cells stably transfected withhDR4 or hDR5 were infected with empty or FADD-containing virus. Each clone with or without FADD reconstitution was incubated with increasing amounts of TRAIL and 500 ng/ml cycloheximide. Cell survival (using MTT colorimetry assay) was assessed after 24 h and plotted as percent of control cultures (cycloheximide alone). The mouse fibroblast cell line, L929, which is TRAIL-sensitive, served as a positive control. B, representative stably transfected hDR4 or hDR5 FADD−/− MEF clones were infected with empty or FADD-containing virus. Cells were incubated with 500 ng/ml cycloheximide either in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml TRAIL.

A subset of this family includes Fas, TNF-RI, DR3, DR4, and DR5, which all contain a death domain in their respective cytoplasmic tails. The signal transduction pathway of Fas-mediated apoptosis has been studied extensively (21Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar, 22Nagata S.

FADD in turn interacts with a death effector domain-containing caspase (caspase 8), which activates a caspase cascade, leading to apoptosis (29Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), its role in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis has remained controversial. Whether FADD can interact with DR4 or DR5 is not clear, as different groups have reported conflicting data regarding the ability of FADD to associate with DR4 and DR5. Interaction by co-immunoprecipitation, however, can be difficult to detect because of the low abundance of the molecules or unfavorable lysis conditions. A case in point is the inability to detect the presence of FADD in the endogenous TNF-RI complex (33Shu H.-B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 34Shu H.-B. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Despite this,FADD−/− MEFs are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis (7Yeh W.-C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF receptor utilizes FADD indirectly in initiating apoptosis. Thus, genetic studies are more definitive in establishing the importance of a protein in a signal transduction pathway. Dominant negative FADD has been reported to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis (1Chaudhary P.M. Edby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter J.M. Hood L.

Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, overexpression ofDR4 in FADD−/− MEFs can still lead to cell death (7Yeh W.-C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we usedFADD−/− MEFs in a stable transfection assay to establish the role of FADD in TRAIL-induced cell death.FADD+/− MEFs transfected with mouseDR4/5 are sensitive to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast,FADD−/− MEFs expressing the mouseTRAIL receptor remain resistant to FADD. To correlate with the human system, we also transfected human DR4 orDR5 into FADD−/− cells. Despite expression of the TRAIL receptors, these cells remain resistant to TRAIL-mediated cell death. However, when these cells were reconstituted with the FADD molecule, they regained their TRAIL sensitivity. Thus, FADD is essential for the ability of TRAIL to initiate apoptosis. The discrepancy with the previous studies (7Yeh W.-C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) is most likely due to the non-physiologically high level expression of the transiently transfected molecule, leading to either nonspecific toxicity or induction of an alternate pathway of apoptosis. Indeed, all receptors containing a death domain can induce apoptosis when transiently transfected into mammalian cells. However, in stably transfected cells or in physiological settings, expression of these receptors alone does not lead to cell death. Expression of the respective ligands in the same cells or contacting cells is necessary to initiate apoptosis. While this work was in preparation, Bodmer et al. (35Bodmer J.-L. Holler N. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) reported that FADD and caspase 8 are recruited to the DR5 death-inducing signaling complex in Jurkat T cells that express DR5 but not DR4. Using these DR5-expressing Jurkat T cells deficient for FADD or caspase 8, they showed that these cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Their results confirm our findings with regard to DR5-mediated apoptosis. We extend these findings along with our FADD reconstitution studies to show that FADD is also required for DR4-mediated apoptosis. In summary, we demonstrate that DR4- and DR5-mediated apoptosis depends critically upon FADD, and similar signaling pathways are used in both mouse and human cells. The essential role of FADD in apoptosis initiated by all the known death domain-containing TNF receptor family members may underscore the dramatic phenotype of FADD-deficient mice. These mice die by day 9.5 of gestation due to abnormal cardiac development (7Yeh W.-C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S.

Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In addition, T-cell receptor-mediated cell proliferation is defective in FADD-deficient T lymphocytes (18Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to Fas- and TNF-RI-deficient mice, which are viable and exhibit no abnormalities until much later. Apoptosis and cell proliferation mediated by one or more of these TNF receptor members may therefore be crucial for mouse embryonic development and establishment of the immune system. Further gene targeting studies are necessary to establish the physiological role of the TRAIL receptors and other death domain-containing TNF receptor family members. We thank G. Pan and V.

The increasing availability of high-resolution crystal structures from both thermophiles and mesophiles has provided an important database for determining the structural basis of thermal stability. For example, Gromiha et al. (1Gromiha M.M. Oobatake M. Sarai A. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) analyzed the thermal stability of 16 different families of proteins. The collective results suggest that the stability of thermally stable proteins may result from a better balance between packing and solubility. Other researchers have attributed various factors such as changes in loop flexibility (2Russell R.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 1157-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), salt bridge interactions (3Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), and amino acid substitutions (i.e. Ile for Ala) (1Gromiha M.M. Oobatake M. Sarai A. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) as the origin of increased thermal stability. It is important to note that despite all efforts to define specific traits, no single trait has been universally linked to the increase in thermal stability for all proteins. It is therefore important to use comparative analyses to determine the factors that lead to an increase in the thermal stability of structurally related proteins. In addition to the fundamental question of how structure relates to stability, there is considerable practical significance in the industrial and medical application of thermally stable enzymes. (4Zeikus J.G. Vieille C. Savchenko A. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this regard, reactions catalyzed by cytochromes P450 are of particular interest. P450s are heme enzymes that catalyze the following reaction, where R represents a variety of substrates, normally non-polar aromatic or aliphatic molecules.NAD(P)H+H++R­H+O2→NAD(P) ++H2O+R­OHREACTION 1One of the primary functions of P450s is to aid in the clearance of toxic hydrocarbons by rendering such molecules more soluble through hydroxylation. In addition to this catabolic function, P450s also participate in the biosynthesis of essential molecules such as steroids (5Nelson D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and various natural products including antibiotics (6Andersen J.F. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 725-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A long sought practical goal in P450 research is to capitalize on the exquisite specificity of P450s in regio- and stereo-selective hydroxylation reactions (7Guengerich F.P. MacDonald T.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2453-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). One possible example is in the preparation of important hydroxylated molecules that are difficult to prepare using traditional organic synthesis methods. In addition, P450s could prove useful in the oxidative or reductive elimination of environmental pollutants (8Kellner D.G. Maves S.A. Sligar S.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A current limitation is the requirement for relatively expensive reducing equivalents in the form of NADH or NADPH. It might be possible to circumvent this restriction by the use of H2O2 as the oxidant rather than O2, because H2O2-supported P450 reactions do not require the transfer of electrons from a redox partner (9Joo H. Lin Z. Arnold F.H. Nature. 1999; 399: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). A second limitation is the instability of the P450 catalysts. There are basically two approaches to the resolution of this problem. One is to seek out enzymes from thermophiles that catalyze the reaction of interest, and the second is to use protein engineering to convert a mesophilic enzyme into a thermally stable enzyme. Utilization of the latter approach requires knowledge of those structural features that are critical for imparting thermal stability. Until now this has not been possible with P450s because the available structures are all from mesophiles. However, quite recently, Wright et al. (10Wright R.L. Harris K. Solow B. White R.H. Kennelly P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) accidentally discovered a P450 while attempting to clone the thymidylate synthase gene from the acidothermophilic archaeonSulfolobus solfataricus. Based on the accepted P450 nomenclature (5Nelson D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), this P450 has been termed CYP119.1 S. solfactaricus has optimal growth conditions at 85 °C and pH 3.5 (11Schafer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 163-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which operationally defines it as a thermophile. As expected, CYP119 exhibits unusual thermal stability with a melting temperature of ∼90 °C compared with ∼55 °C for bacterial P450cam (12Koo L.S. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Straub W.E. Moenne-Loccoz P.

The function of CYP119 remains unknown, but considering that S. solfataricus can utilize elemental sulfur as an energy source (11Schafer G. Biochim. Biophys.

Currently, the genome of S. solfataricus is being sequenced (15Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Chow C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B. Doolittle W.F. Duguet M. Erauso G. Gaasterland T. Garrett R.A.

At an A 600 nm of 0.8, 500 μg/liter of isopropyl β-d-thiopyranogalactoside (USB) was used to induce expression of CYP119. The conditions for cell growth were 2× YT (tryptone, 16 g, yeast extract, 10 g, NaCl, 5 g, per liter), 0.1 g/liter ampicillin (Sigma) at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for the starter cultures and slow stirring (80–100 rpm) at 30° C for the fermenter. Thirty-six hours after induction the cells were harvested, and cell paste was stored at −70 °C. Cells were lysed in a French pressure cell in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the cell-free extract was heated to 65 °C for 1 h. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was brought to 80% ammonium sulfate, and the resulting precipitant was resuspended in minimal volume and dialyzed against 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.2 overnight (three times buffer exchanges). The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a QAE-Sepharose column (2.5 cm × 25 cm), washed with 2–3 column volumes of buffer, then eluted with a linear gradient, 0–250 mm NaCl in 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.2. Fractions with an absorbance ratio (A 415 nm/A 280 nm) of > 1.40 were pooled, desalted, and exchanged into 50 mmbis-Tris, pH 7.0. A chromatofocusing column (PBE94, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated with 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.0. The protein was loaded, washed, and then eluted with Polybuffer 74 pH 5.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions with an absorbance ratio (A 415 nm/A 280 nm) above 1.60 were pooled, desalted, and then exchanged to 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.0 and used for crystallization. P450 concentrations were determined with the extinction coefficient ε415 nm = 104 mm−1 as reported by McLeanet al. (13McLean M.A. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Krepich S. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Crystals belonging to the monoclinic space group P21 (unit cell dimensions a = 76.97 Å, b = 70.26 Å, c = 107.54 Å, β = 102.34°) were grown by free interface diffusion in 200-μl capillaries with a protein to precipitant ratio of 2:3. The initial protein concentration for capillary growth was 40 mg/ml. The precipitant solution consisted of 35% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 100 mm imidazole pH 8.0, and 0.2 m Li2SO4. Crystals belonging to the orthorhombic space group C2221 (unit cell dimensions a = 76.96 Å, b = 114.60 Å, c = 185.20 Å) were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion over a well of 20% PEG 3350, 100 mm epps, pH 8.5, 0.2 mMgSO4. 1 mm 4-phenylimidazole was mixed with 20 mg/ml CYP119 (final concentrations) and used to set up 5 μl + 5 μl drops on siliconized glass coverslips. All crystals were grown at room temperature. The single crystals used for data collections were carefully separated from larger crystal clusters. Cryogenic data collection conditions for the C2221 space group consisted of a four-step transfer to artificial precipitant solution with increased ethylene glycol concentration up to 20%. Cryogenic conditions for the P21 space group were unsuccessful, leading to severe anisotropy in crystal diffraction. There were two molecules per asymmetric unit for both space groups. Room temperature data were collected from the P21 crystal form using an in-house R-Axis IV imaging plate equipped with a Rigaku rotating copper anode x-ray generator. High-resolution data collection (50–1.93 Å) at 100 K on the C2221 crystal form was performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, beamline 7–1 with a Mar345 imaging plate. Low-resolution data (50–3.1 Å) on the C2221 form were also collected in-house at 100 K. Optimization of data collection was guided by the STRATEGY function of MOSFLM (16Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP 4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26.Google Scholar). All data were reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar), and rejections were performed with ENDHKL (Louis Sanchez, California Institute of Technology) in conjunction with SCALEPACK. Molecular replacement in the P21 space group was carried out with a version of BRUTE modified to use log-likelihood scoring 2Read, R. J., International Union of Crystallography Congress, Glasgow, Scotland, 1999. using data to 4.5 Å with a polyalanine model of P450eryF (PDB accession number 1OXA) (18Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) as the search model. The top rotation solution was correct and was further optimized using data to 3 Å, which was followed by a translational search. The second rotation solution was generated through application of the self-rotation peak and followed with another translational search. The final solution had an R-factor of 0.53 after rigid body refinement. Density modification in MAGICSQUASH (19Schuller D.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was used to improve phases. Electron density map fitting beginning from the polyalanine P450eryF model was carried out with TOM (20Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 151-171Google Scholar). Several sections of the electron density map, especially the core of the structure near the heme, clearly showed the identity of CYP119 side chains. Regions of the molecule that lacked clear backbone electron density were deleted prior to further refinement with CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). With successive rounds of refinement and model building the entire CYP119 sequence was fit to the electron density map except for the last two residues. In the first 12 rounds of refinement, the entire chain of one molecule was traced and non-crystallographic symmetry operators were used to generate the second molecule in the asymmetric unit. In the last two rounds of refinement, each chain was fit separately. The final R-factor was 0.219 (R-free = 0.253). Backbone geometry was analyzed in PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and only two residues (alanine 152 in both molecules) were in the disallowed region. There were 29 water and 2 sulfate molecules found per asymmetric unit. To determine phases for the C2221 space group the imidazole-bound (P21) structure was used as a search model in AMoRe (23Navanza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The first molecule produced a solution that stood out above the background and was fixed to find the second molecule giving aR-factor of 0.436. After one round of both positional and temperature factor refinement in CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The F and G helical regions of the protein had to be extensively remodeled. The final R-factor was 0.225 (R-free = 0.274). Backbone geometry was checked in PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and none of the residues were in the disallowed region. All of the residues except the last residue, 368, were present in the electron density maps. The final model contains 622 water molecules, 2 sulfates, and one zinc per asymmetric unit.

CYP119 exhibits the typical P450-fold (Fig.1). However, at 368 residues, CYP119 is considerably shorter than P450cam (24Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16122-16130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or P450eryF (18Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), at 414 and 403 residues, respectively. The majority of this difference in length is located at the N-terminal region. P450cam and P450eryF begin with relatively ill-defined N-terminal tails whereas CYP119 begins immediately with helix A. As a result, residue 1 in CYP119 corresponds to residue 42 or 16 in P450cam or P450eryF, respectively. Therefore, the shorter N terminus alone in CYP119 accounts for 41 of the 56 fewer amino acids in CYP119 compared with P450cam. The remainder of the differences in length occurs primarily in surface turns (Fig. 1). For example, the β1–1/β1–2 hairpin (residues 13–24) in CYP119 is four residues shorter than that in P450cam (residues 52–66). Another difference includes the 225–234 β5-turn in P450cam compared with the 191–195 loop in CYP119, a difference of five residues. This tight loop between the H and I helices in CYP119 resembles what was found in P450nor (25Park S.Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Obayashi E. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which does not require a redox protein partner for electron transfer. In contrast, all other known P450 structures show an extended but ill-defined β-hairpin similar to that in P450cam. Interestingly, this hairpin region makes direct contact with the FMN-binding domain in the crystal structure of the complex formed between the heme and FMN domains in P450 BM-3 (26Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The most striking differences involve the B' helix region, which is known to be important in substrate binding (27Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 63–66 in CYP119 corresponding to the location of B' helix in P450eryF are no longer a complete helix. Instead this region defines only one turn of the 310 helix. However, CYP119 does have a helix that we have termed the B' helix consisting of residues 49–53 (Fig.2). In CYP119, the B' helix is preceded by a long loop that enables the B' helix to adopt a position away from the active site toward the molecular surface (Fig. 2). Such a change should leave the active site relatively exposed. However, a solvent accessibility calculation, without substrate or inhibitors included, shows that ∼24 Å2 of the heme is exposed in CYP119 compared with ∼18 Å2 in P450cam. The reason that CYP119 and P450cam are so similar in active site access by a solvent probe is because of the repositioning of the loop connecting the F and G helices (Fig. 2). In P450cam and other P450s, this F/G loop extends out on the surface. Conversely, in CYP119, this loop points completely in the opposite direction and dips into the active site, thereby occupying the space normally taken by the B' helix region. As we shall see in the next section, this loop can adopt alternate conformations depending on the identity of the ligand coordinated to the heme iron. The most highly conserved regions are near the heme, which includes the I and L helices. The polypeptide conformation and local environment surrounding the Cys thiolate heme axial ligand, Cys-317 in CYP119, is strictly conserved. The I helix spans the entire molecule and is situated directly above the heme. The I helix in CYP119 is unusual, having two additional Thr residues following the conserved Thr at position 213 (Fig. 3), which is present in most P450s. The positioning of Thr-213 close to the heme surface relative to Thr-214 and Thr-215 was correctly predicted based on chemical modification data (12Koo L.S. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Straub W.E. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14112-14123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This region has been postulated to be involved in a proton shuttle network considered important for delivering solvent protons required for the activation of O2 during the catalytic cycle (28Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). The H-bonding network involving helix I Thr residues, however, is somewhat different in CYP119. The side chain hydroxyl group of the conserved Thr-213 does not donate an H-bond to a peptide carbonyl as it does in P450cam. Instead, Thr-214 donates an H-bond to the peptide oxygen atom of Gly-210 (Fig.3). This is very similar to the H-bonding pattern found in P450BM-3 that also has a Thr corresponding to Thr-214 in CYP119 (29Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the T214A (but not T213A) mutant results in a large increase in the rate at which CYP119 catalyzes H2O2-supported styrene epoxidation (12Koo L.S. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Straub W.E. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14112-14123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because Thr-214 but not Thr-213 H-bonds with the backbone, it might be expected that mutation of Thr-214 would cause a greater perturbation in the I helix thereby leading to a greater change in reactivity toward styrene. An interesting feature of the 4-phenylimidazole structure is a cation, most likely Zn2+, situated at the interface between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figs.4 and 5). The identification of the ion as Zn2+ is based on anomalous difference Fouriers calculated in PHASES (30Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) at different x-ray wavelengths. Zinc has an absorption edge at 1.28 Å whereas that for iron is at 1.74 Å. Using data from the copper rotating anode at a wavelength of 1.54 Å, an anomalous difference Fourier shows strong 10–11ς peaks for the two iron atoms but nothing for the presumed zinc. However, using synchrotron data at a wavelength of 1.08 Å, the zinc site has a peak of 17ς, whereas the iron peaks are 13–14ς. The type of ligands and the tetrahedral coordination environment of the ion also support its identification as zinc. As shown in Fig. 5, the Zn2+ is coordinated by Glu-139 and His-178 in one subunit, and their symmetry mates in the other subunit. The zinc binding motif is very likely to be native to the enzyme rather than an artifact of crystal lattice formation because Zn2+ was not included in the crystallization buffers. The fact that Zn2+ was not seen in the imidazole complex may be due to the presence of 0.1m imidazole in the buffer, which may have scavenged the low amounts of Zn2+ present as a contaminant. It remains unclear if the dimer and Zn2+ site are functionally important. Only 727 Å2 per monomer of accessible surface area is buried at the interface, which is below the range for most true dimers. However, the tight coordination of Zn2+ might provide sufficient stabilization to favor the dimeric form under physiological conditions.Figure 5The dimeric interface in CYP119 and a close-up view of the tetrahedral ligation of the putative zinc ion in the 4-phenylmidazole-bound structure. The zinc ion is ligated by Glu-139 and His-178 and their symmetry mates forming a tetrahedral geometry common in known crystal structures with bound zinc (40Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J.

The active site adjusts in size and shape depending on the ligand bound, with the active site expanding to accommodate the larger 4-phenylimidazole ligand. The F/G region undergoes the largest movements with backbone atoms shifting as much as 6 Å. The most significant change occurs in the F helix. In the 4-phenylimidazole complex, the F helix includes residues 141–155, but in the imidazole complex the helix stops at residue 151, a loss of one full turn of helix (Fig. 6). This unraveling of the helix lengthens the F/G loop, which then is able to dip down into the active site to make contacts with the smaller imidazole ligand. For example, the Leu-155 side chain moves approximately 6 Å, which enables the side chain to interact with the imidazole ligand. The loop “in” conformation is stabilized by direct contacts between the F/G loop with helix I, which are not present in the 4-phenylimidazole complex (Fig.7).Figure 7Stereo views of the electron density surrounding a portion of the F-G region. The model appears inlight gray and black with the 2Fo-Fc electron-density map in thin dark gray lines. Residues Arg-154, Leu-155, and Glu-212 are shown for both models. a, the imidazole-bound structure (loop in). Arg-154 forms a hydrogen bond with Glu-212 causing Leu-155 to protrude into the active site. b, the 4-phenylimidazole-bound structure (loop out). Arg-154 no longer forms a hydrogen bond with Glu-212 and Leu-155 moves out of the way to accommodate the larger ligand. The omit electron density maps were generated with the atoms shown removed from a round of simulated-annealing refinement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the 4-phenylimidazole complex, the F/G loop must move to make room for the larger ligand. One of the most dramatic changes is in the location of Arg-154. In the 4-phenylimidazole complex, Arg-154 is part of the F helix where it H-bonds with the peptide oxygen atom of Glu-198 (Fig. 7). In the imidazole complex, this section of the F helix unfolds enabling the Arg-154 side chain to reorient by 180o where it can then interact with Glu-212. This new ion pair in the imidazole complex and other F/G loop-I helix contacts helps to stabilize the loop “in” conformation. It appears that favorable interactions lost upon unfolding of the F helix are partially offset by favorable interactions between the F/G loop and helix I. Another region that experiences a large change is the β4 hairpin turn centered on Val-353, which moves about 3 Å. In this case, the hairpin squeezes in closer to the ligand in the 4-phenylimidazole complex which is in the F/G loop “out” conformation. This location of the turn is incompatible with the F/G loop “in” conformation in the imidazole complex. The F/G loop and the β4 hairpin as a whole undergoes an “induced fit” conformational change depending upon the size and shape of the ligand bound at the heme active site. The only other P450 in which similar changes have been observed is P450BM-3. In that case, there is"

Also, there was a basal transcription of the NOS II gene, which did not result in measurable NOS II expression. The 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the NOS II mRNA contains four AUUUA motifs and one AUUUUA motif, known to destabilize the mRNAs of proto-oncogenes, nuclear transcription factors, and cytokines. Luciferase reporter gene constructs containing the NOS II 3′-UTR showed a significantly reduced luciferase activity. The embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-like protein HuR was found to bind with high affinity to the adenylate/uridylate-rich elements of the NOS II 3′-UTR. Inhibition of HuR with antisense constructs reduced the cytokine-induced NOS II mRNA, whereas overexpression of HuR potentiated the cytokine-induced NOS II expression. This provides evidence that NOS II expression is regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Binding of HuR to the 3′-UTR of the NOS II mRNA seems to play an essential role in the stabilization of this mRNA.

The low output Ca2+-regulated enzymes NOS I and NOS III are expressed constitutively, but their expression level can be adjusted to meet local demand (2Förstermann U. Boissel J.P. Kleinert H. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, the high output NOS II enzyme is not normally present in resting cells. Instead, the cell must be activated to express the enzyme, whose activity is then independent of elevated Ca2+ concentrations. NOS II expression can be induced in different types of cells and tissues following exposure to immunologic and inflammatory stimuli such as cytokines or lipopolysaccharide. Once synthesized, the enzyme is active for hours to days and generates large amounts of nitric oxide that can have beneficial effects, such as antimicrobial, antiatherogenic, or antiapoptotic actions. However, inappropriate NOS II induction can have detrimental consequences, such as cellular injury in arthritis or colitis, and in septic shock (3Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev.

Traditionally, it has been believed that the expression of the NOS II is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. The human NOS II promoter contains potential binding sites for a number of transcription factors, such as signal transfer and activator of transcription-1, activator protein-1, (jun/fostranscription factor), and nuclear factor-κB, which is known to participate in the induction of NOS II expression by cytokines. Interaction of these transcription factors with their cis-elements activates (or represses) the transcriptional machinery leading to mRNA synthesis (7Spitsin S.V. Koprowski H. Michaels F.H. Mol.

However, the steady-state levels of a particular mRNA depend not only on its synthesis but also on its rate of degradation. Several lines of evidence suggest that regulation of mRNA stability may contribute to NOS II expression. Using RNase protection assays or Northern blot experiments, different laboratories including our own were unable to detect NOS II mRNA in noninduced cells. However, the gene is not totally silent, and significant basal transcription has been detected. After cytokine induction, the transcription rate is only increased 2–5-fold compared with the estimated 20–100-fold increase in the level of NOS II mRNA. These findings point to an instability of NOS II transcripts in resting cells (8de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nüssler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl.

Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (AU-rich elements) are found in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of many mRNAs encoding proto-oncogenes, nuclear transcription factors, and cytokines (13Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, 14Ross J.

Using RNA binding assays, several groups have identified proteins that interact with AU-rich elements (ELAV-like family, AUF1, heat shock proteins, among others) (16Good P.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Henics T. Nagy E. Oh H.J. Csermely P. von Gabain A. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins have been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability. The 3′-UTR of the human NOS II mRNA contains five AUUUA and one AUUUUA repeat, classical motifs found in AU-rich elements of different mRNAs, which have a short and fine regulated half-life. So far, little is known about the role of these motifs in the regulation of NOS II expression. Recently, Nunokawa et al. (19Nunokawa Y. Oikawa S. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) designed a reporter gene construct containing not only the 5′-flanking region (−1 kb) of the human NOS II gene but also the 3′-UTR and ∼1 kb of the 3′-flanking sequence. This construct showed a reduced basal reporter gene activity and a higher apparent rate of induction in response to cytokines. Although these authors proposed the existence of a cooperative interaction between the 5′-promoter and the 3′-region for the induction of the gene, the mechanism by which the 3′-UTR may regulate the expression has not yet been investigated (19Nunokawa Y. Oikawa S. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we describe that post-transcriptional mechanisms account for an important part of the cytokine-induced expression of the human NOS II in intestinal epithelial DLD-1 cells, and the 3′-UTR of the gene seems to be essential for this regulation. In search for potential intracellular proteins able to interact with the NOS II 3′-UTR, we found that the ELAV-like RNA-binding protein HuR binds with high affinity and specificity to AU-rich elements present in the NOS II 3′-UTR. We also present evidence that the HuR protein is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of human NOS II. Trypsin, glutamine, and pyruvate solutions, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, agarose, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, polyvinylpyrrolidone, tRNA, bovine serum albumin, phosphatase alkaline-coupled goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate were purchased from Sigma. Isotopes were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Restriction enzymes, Taqpolymerase, Klenow DNA polymerase, T3 and T7 RNA polymerase, dNTPs, oligo(dT) primer, Ficoll 400, pGEX-2T, and glutathione-agarose affinity beads were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RNase A, RNase T1, DNase I and DOTAP were obtained from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany. A rabbit polyclonal anti-NOS II antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human interferon-γ, interleukin 1-β, TNF-α, fetal calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and RPMI were purchased from PAN-Systems, Nürnberg, Germany. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system, pGL2-Basic, and pRL-SV40 were purchased from Promega, Heidelberg, Germany. G 418 was purchased from Calbiochem. Zeocin, pRc-CMV, and pZeoSV2(−) were purchased from Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands. pCR-Script was from Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany. Human DLD-1 cells (ATCC, no. CCL-221; stable colon adenocarcinoma cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Eighteen hours before cytokine induction, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mml-glutamine in the absence of serum and phenol red. DLD-1 cells were induced with the cytokines interferon-γ (100 units/ml), interleukin 1-β (50 units/ml), and TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for the corresponding time periods depending on the experiment. Afterward, a supernatant of the cells (300 μl) was used to measure N O⨪2 by the Griess reaction and cells were processed for RNA isolation by guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction as described (12Kleinert H. Wallerath T. Fritz G. Ihrig-Biedert I. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Geller D.A. Förstermann U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) or for protein extraction as described below. To generate a luciferase cDNA plasmid for in vitro transcription, a 230-bpHinfI fragment of pGL2-Basic (positions 306–535) and pGL3-Basic (positions 318–547) were cloned after blunting into theEcoRV site of pCR-Script, generating pCR-Luc-pGL2 and pCR-Luc-pGL3, respectively. A plasmid containing a human HuR cDNA fragment was generated from pGEX-HuR (21Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) by cloning a 207-bpBamHI-EcoRI fragment (positions 892–1096 of the HuR mRNA) into pCR-Script, generating pCR-HuR. DNA sequences of the clones were determined using the dideoxy chain termination method with a sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To generate radiolabeled human NOS II, β-actin, pGL2 and pGL3 luciferase, and HuR antisense probes for RNase protection assays, 0.5 μg of the linearized plasmids pCR NOS II human, pCR β-actin human (22Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. Ihrig-Biedert I. Förstermann U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar), pCR-Luc-pGL2, pCR-Luc-pGL3, and pCR-HuR were in vitro transcribed using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP. To quantify human NOS II, HuR, and luciferase mRNA levels, RNase protection experiments were performed as described (12Kleinert H. Wallerath T. Fritz G. Ihrig-Biedert I. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Geller D.A. Förstermann U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In all experiments, β-actin mRNA was also determined for normalization purposes. Densitometric analyses were performed using a PhosphoImager (Bio-Rad). The protected fragments of NOS II, HuR, luciferase, and β-actin were 386, 207, 230, and 108 nucleotides, respectively. To study the expression of NOS II and HuR proteins, total cell protein was fractionated in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts as described (23Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). For NOS II or HuR Western blots, 10–50 μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear protein were separated on 7.5 and 12% polyacrylamide gels, respectively, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semidry electroblotting. All further steps were performed as described (24Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. Ihrig-Biedert I. Förstermann U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6039-6045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For the detection of human NOS II an anti-NOS II antibody (N-20) at 1:200, dilution was used. HuR protein was detected using a monoclonal anti-HuR-antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. For detection of the immunocomplexes a 1:10,000 dilution of phosphatase alkaline-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG was used and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described (23Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled RNA was hybridized at 65 °C for 48 h to the linearized pCR-Script (as negative control) or plasmids containing either the whole human NOS II cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. David Geller (25Geller D.A. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Di S.M. Wang S.C. Nakayama D.K. Simmons R.L. Snyder S.H. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3491-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) or the whole human β-actin cDNA, immobilized on nitrocellulose filters as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in 6× SSC (0.9 M NaCl; 0.09 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's reagent (0.1 g of Ficoll 400; 0.1 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone; 0.1 g of bovine serum albumin, Fraction V, in 100 ml of H2O), and 0.1% SDS. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, followed by two washes with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. Filters were air-dried and exposed to x-ray films. Densitometric analyses were performed using a PhosphoImager (Bio-Rad). The plasmid pGL3–3.6-NOS-II-luc-neo was generated by cloning a 3.6-kb KpnI fragment from pNOS2(16)Luc (8de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nüssler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R.

Jessen T. Herget T. Fàrstermann U. Kleinert H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) digested with KpnI. A NOS II cDNA fragment containing only the 3′-UTR sequence of the human NOS II gene was generated by PCR from reverse transcriptase products using the primers CCAAGCTTGAGGGCCTACAGGAGGGG (5P1, sense) and CCAAGCTTGATTAAAGTAAAATGCAATTCATG (3P1, antisense), corresponding to the positions 3667–3684 and 4122–4145 of the human NOS II mRNA (25Geller D.A. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Di S.M. Wang S.C. Nakayama D.K. Simmons R.L. Snyder S.H. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3491-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) (positions 1–16 and 454–477 of the NOS II 3′-UTR, see Fig. 3) flanked by HindIII restriction sites. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site of pCR-Script to give pCR-NOS II-3′-UTR. The insert of this plasmid was further cut with HindIII, Klenow-filled, and then recloned in both orientations into the XbaI site of the plasmid pGL3–3.6-NOS-II-luc-neo to give pGL3–3.6-NOS-II-luc-neo-3′-UTR A and B. Also, DNA fragments corresponding to the NOS II coding sequence (345 bp, positions 3127–3471) and the pCR-Script sequence (459-bpHinfI fragment, positions 177–636) were cloned into theXbaI site of pGL3–3.6-NOS-II-luc-neo. DLD-1 cells were transfected by lipofection with DOTAP according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For transient experiments, 4.5 μg of the plasmid were combined with 0.5 μg of the renilla reporter gene plasmid pRL-SV40 for normalization of the transfection efficiency. After overnight transfection incubation, cells processed for luciferase activity were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer provided by the dual luciferase reporter assay system, and firefly and renilla luciferase activities were determined in 40- and 20-μl extracts, respectively. The light units of the firefly luciferase were normalized by those of the renilla luciferase after subtraction of extract background. Cells used for quantification of luciferase mRNA levels by RNase protection assays were lysed with guanidium thiocyanate buffer as described (12Kleinert H. Wallerath T. Fritz G. Ihrig-Biedert I. Rodriguez-Pascual F. Geller D.A. Förstermann U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To generate DLD-1 cells stably transfected with a construct containing a 16-kb fragment of the human NOS II promoter cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene (pGL2 system), cells were transfected as described above with 4.5 μg of pNOS2(16)Luc (8de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nüssler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and 0.5 μg of pRc-CMV (containing a neomycin resistance gene). The transfected cells were selected by G 418 treatment (1 mg/ml). Different cell clones were analyzed for luciferase activity and checked for integration of the transfected DNA by PCR. Purified GST-HuR fusion protein was prepared using the plasmid pGEX-HuR as described (21Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The yield of the purification procedure was determined by comparison to a bovine serum albumin standard on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresis revealed a 62-kDa band corresponding to the fusion protein. The same procedure was used to purify GST protein from Escherichia coli cultures transformed with the plasmid pGEX-2T. cDNAs encoding for subfragments of human NOS II 3′-UTR were obtained by PCR using pCR-NOS II-3′-UTR as template. The primers employed were for subfragment non-AU, 5P1 (sense) and AGATTTTGTCTCCAAGGGACC (antisense); for subfragment AU, GAGACAAAATCTTAAATGCCAGG (5P2, sense) and 3P1 (antisense); for subfragment A, 5P2 (sense) and TGCGATAGCACCTCCTGGTG (antisense); for subfragment B, GCACCACTGTGTATTTAACTGCC (sense) and TACAGGGAAGACCCAAGTGG (antisense); for subfragment C, TAACACCCAGTCTGTTCCCC (sense) and 3P1 (antisense). Reverse transcriptase-generated cDNA encoding for the AUFL element of the c-fos 3′-UTR was amplified using the primers CATGCATTGTTGAGGTGGTC (sense) and CTTGGAACAATAAGCAAACAATG (antisense), giving a 201-bp product corresponding to the positions 3301–3501 in the c-fos mRNA sequence. The amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into the XcmI site of pXcmI (28Schutte B.C. Ranade K. Pruessner J. Dracopoli N. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 40-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to give the clones pCR-non-AU, pCR-AU, pCR-A, pCR-B, pCR-C, and pCR-AUFL-c-fos. DNA sequences of all of the clones were determined by sequencing. To generate mutants of the AU-rich sequence within pCR-C, antisense primers containing a T7 promoter flanked by the sequence to be transcribed (GATTAAAG TAAAAT GCAATTCATG TAAAT ATCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA, wild type; GATTAAAG TAAAAT GCAATTCATG GGCCC ATCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA, mutant 1; GATTAAAG CGGCCG GCAATTCATG TAAAT ATCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA, mutant 2; GATTAAAG CGGCCG GCAATTCATG GGCCC ATCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA, mutant 1/2) (boldface and underlines mark the putative binding sequences of HuR and the mutations introduced) were hybridized with a sense T7 primer (TAATACGACTCACTATAG) and filled by PCR (95 °C 1 min, 50 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1 min, 35 cycles). To generate radiolabeled NOS II and c-fos 3′-UTR sense probes for RNA binding experiments, 0.5–1 μg of DNA (linearized plasmids or PCR fragments) were in vitro transcribed as described above. Radiolabeled transcripts were analyzed by urea-denaturing electrophoresis to estimate the yield and the specific activity. Incorporated radioactivity in transcripts was usually higher than 80%, and the specific activity ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 μCi/pmol. The AUFL c-fos transcript for competition experiments was synthesized following the same procedure but using cold UTP with trace amounts of radioactivity to accurately determine molarity. RNA binding experiments were carried out as described (21Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) using 5–8 fmol of labeled RNA (about 60,000 cpm) and protein as indicated. RNA-protein complexes were analyzed on 1% agarose gels in buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. In competition experiments, GST-HuR was preincubated with the RNA competitor for 15 min at room temperature. Northwestern experiments were carried out as described (29Erondu N.E. Nwankwo J. Zhong Y. Boes M. Dake B. Bar R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 495-504PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of recombinant HuR or GST were fractionated by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semidry blotting. The membranes were then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with renaturation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.25 mg/ml tRNA). Subsequently, the blotted proteins were probed overnight at 4 °C with 3′-UTR, non-AU, AU, subfragment A, B, or C (150,000–200,000 cpm/ml) in the same buffer with occasional shaking. Unbound RNA was removed by three cycles of washing in TBS buffer (5 min/wash), and the membrane was then exposed to x-ray film and quantified by densitometry using a PhosphoImager. In Northwestern experiments with cell extracts, 75–100 μg of protein (nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts) diluted in 200 μl final volume with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7, 4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 150 mm NaCl) were precleared by adding 12 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG bound to agarose (1:18, 1-h incubation, 4 °C with shaking), and then centrifuged at 200 × g for 2 min. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h with anti-HuR antibody (1:200) at 4 °C and then with 12 μl of anti-mouse IgG-agarose (1:18, 1-h incubation, 4 °C with shaking). Agarose beads were washed five times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and then resuspended in 10 μl of loading buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for RNA binding as described above. A 1.6-kb ApaI fragment of HuR9 (21Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol.

Stable transfectants were selected with zeocin (200 μg/ml). As a control, DLD-1 cells stably transformed with the pZeoSV2(−) vector were also generated (Zeo). Pooled population of cells and single clones were characterized by HuR protein expression and DNA analyses. As a human model for studying the regulation of the NOS II gene, we chose the intestinal epithelial cell line DLD-1 (9Linn S.C. Morelli P.J. Edry I. Cottongim S.E. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. Am. J.

As shown in Fig.1, no NOS II mRNA or protein was detected in unstimulated DLD-1 cells, and virtually no nitrite production was seen with the Griess reaction (B). A triple cytokine mixture (CM) consisting of interferon-γ (100 units/ml), interleukin 1-β (50 units/ml), and TNF-α (10 ng/ml) produced a marked NOS II expression. Using quantitative RNase protection assays with a NOS II 3′-UTR probe (see “Experimental Procedures”), significant levels of NOS II mRNA were already detected after 2 h of incubation with CM. Maximal induction was reached between 6 and 12 h (Fig. 1, A and B, open circles). Western blot studies (Fig. 1 C) showed NOS II protein after 4 h of incubation with CM peaking at 12 h. This time course was also reflected in the accumulation of nitrite as detected by the Griess reaction (Fig. 1 B, closed circles). To investigate whether the induction of the NOS II gene is mainly because of transcriptional activation or, on the other hand, also mechanisms at the post-transcriptional level take place, we examined the transcription rate of the gene in a nuclear run-on assay. A significant basal NOS II mRNA synthesis was observed in nuclei of unstimulated cells. Incubation with CM for 6 h resulted only in a modest 1.5-fold up-regulation of NOS II promoter activity (CM, 147.2 ± 14.6; basal, 100.8 ± 4.7, percentage of basal as mean ± S.D.,n = 6, p < 0.01), which is in agreement with previously published data (9Linn S.C. Morelli P.J. Edry I. Cottongim S.E. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1499-G1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also established transfectants of DLD-1 cells expressing a luciferase reporter under the control of a 16-kb fragment of the human NOS II promoter (8de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nüssler A.K.

As shown in Fig. 2, these cells produced significant levels of luciferase mRNA (open circles) under nonstimulated conditions, whereas no NOS II mRNA (closed circles) was detected. After incubation with cytokines, both luciferase mRNA and endogenous NOS II mRNA were up-regulated. Interestingly, different time courses were observed for the two mRNAs. Luciferase mRNA levels increased quickly after exposure of the cells to CM, peaking at 4 h. In contrast, NOS II mRNA levels increased more slowly reaching their maximum level at 8 h. The delay in the induction of the NOS II mRNA relative to the luciferase mRNA (both driven by the same promoter) cannot be explained by a longer processing time of the NOS II transcript (luciferase cDNA versus NOS II genomic sequence). We found the same time course with a NOS II 5′-UTR probe (data not shown). Taken toget"

C., Kwon, O., Xu, G. W., Burant, C. F., Simpson, I., and Levine, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 18982–18989). We therefore studied DHA and 2-DG transport in rat adipocytes, which express GLUT4. Without insulin, rat adipocytes transported 2-DG 2–3-fold faster than DHA. Preincubation with insulin (0.67 μm) increased transport of each substrate similarly: 7–10-fold for 2-DG and 6–8-fold for DHA. Because intracellular reduction of DHA in adipocytes was complete before and after insulin stimulation, increased transport of DHA was not explained by increased internal reduction of DHA to ascorbate. To determine apparent transport kinetics of GLUT4 for DHA, GLUT4 expression inXenopus oocytes was reexamined. Preincubation of oocytes for >4 h with insulin (1 μm) augmented GLUT4 transport of 2-DG and DHA by up to 5-fold. Transport of both substrates was inhibited by cytochalasin B and displayed saturable kinetics. GLUT4 had a higher apparent transport affinity (K m of 0.98versus 5.2 mm) and lower maximal transport rate (V max of 66 versus 880 pmol/oocyte/10 min) for DHA compared with 2-DG. The lower transport rate for DHA could not be explained by binding differences at the outer membrane face, as shown by inhibition with ethylidene glucose, or by transporter trans-activation and therefore was probably due to substrate-specific differences in transporter/substrate translocation or release. These novel data indicate that the insulin-sensitive transporter GLUT4 transports DHA in both rat adipocytes andXenopus oocytes. Alterations of this mechanism in diabetes could have clinical implications for ascorbate utilization. Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the first stable oxidation product of vitamin C, was transported by GLUT1 and GLUT3 inXenopus laevis oocytes with transport rates similar to that of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), but due to inherent difficulties with GLUT4 expression in oocytes it was uncertain whether GLUT4 transported DHA (Rumsey, S. C., Kwon, O., Xu, G. W., Burant, C. F., Simpson, I., and Levine, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 18982–18989). We therefore studied DHA and 2-DG transport in rat adipocytes, which express GLUT4. Without insulin, rat adipocytes transported 2-DG 2–3-fold faster than DHA. Preincubation with insulin (0.67 μm) increased transport of each substrate similarly: 7–10-fold for 2-DG and 6–8-fold for DHA. Because intracellular reduction of DHA in adipocytes was complete before and after insulin stimulation, increased transport of DHA was not explained by increased internal reduction of DHA to ascorbate. To determine apparent transport kinetics of GLUT4 for DHA, GLUT4 expression inXenopus oocytes was reexamined. Preincubation of oocytes for >4 h with insulin (1 μm) augmented GLUT4 transport of 2-DG and DHA by up to 5-fold. Transport of both substrates was inhibited by cytochalasin B and displayed saturable kinetics. GLUT4 had a higher apparent transport affinity (K m of 0.98versus 5.2 mm) and lower maximal transport rate (V max of 66 versus 880 pmol/oocyte/10 min) for DHA compared with 2-DG. The lower transport rate for DHA could not be explained by binding differences at the outer membrane face, as shown by inhibition with ethylidene glucose, or by transporter trans-activation and therefore was probably due to substrate-specific differences in transporter/substrate translocation or release. These novel data indicate that the insulin-sensitive transporter GLUT4 transports DHA in both rat adipocytes andXenopus oocytes. Alterations of this mechanism in diabetes could have clinical implications for ascorbate utilization. dehydroascorbic acid 2-deoxyglucose 3-O-methylglucose glucose transporter isoform high pressure liquid chromatography sodium-dependent glucose transporter Cellular accumulation of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) is due to transport of both ascorbate and its oxidized metabolite, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA)1(1Welch R.W.

Although ascorbate is the predominant if not the only form in blood, it is possible that DHA is produced in the extracellular milieuin vivo during oxidative stress (3Dhariwal K.R. Hartzell W.O.

Experiments in neutrophils demonstrated that the rate of cellular DHA uptake is as much as 30-fold greater than the rate of ascorbate uptake (1Welch R.W. Wang Y. Crossman Jr., A. Park J.B. Kirk K.L.

DHA uptake followed by intracellular reduction can increase intracellular ascorbate accumulation 5–20-fold within minutes. This process, termed ascorbate recycling, was first demonstrated experimentally in human neutrophils (1Welch R.W. Wang Y. Crossman Jr., A. Park J.B. Kirk K.L. Levine M. J. Biol.

We demonstrated previously that DHA is efficiently transported by glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, with rates of transport and affinity equal to or greater than that for glucose (7Rumsey S.C.

Isoforms GLUT2, GLUT5, and SGLT1 did not transport DHA, and no glucose transporter isoform transported ascorbic acid (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol.

GLUT4 demonstrated minimal DHA transport activity, and it was not possible to adequately examine DHA transport by this isoform. GLUT4 is the insulin-sensitive protein responsible for the majority of glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissues. Upon insulin stimulation, intracellular vesicles containing GLUT4 fuse with plasma membranes, greatly increasing glucose transport (9Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Flower C.J. Saltis J.

Ineffective recruitment of GLUT4 to the cell surface results in excessive glucose accumulation in the blood and type II diabetes clinically. In addition to aberrant glucose metabolism, some evidence suggests that diabetics may also have decreased cellular concentrations of ascorbate or increased requirements for it (14Lindsay R.M.

Considering the importance of GLUT4 in glucose uptake and its possible implications in ascorbate metabolism, it was worthwhile to pursue investigation of DHA transport by GLUT4. We examined DHA transport in isolated rat adipocytes, a well characterized model of GLUT4-mediated transport, and found that adipocytes transported DHA in an insulin-responsive manner. Because rat adipocytes co-express GLUT1, which also transports DHA, this system could not be used to determine kinetics of GLUT4-mediated DHA transport. On the other hand, Xenopus laevis expression of GLUT4 provides a pure transport system, but levels of surface expression can be low (18Janicot M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We therefore examined ways to enhance transporter activity in oocytes and showed that preincubation with insulin increased transport substantially above oocytes not exposed to insulin. This enabled examination for the first time of DHA transport by GLUT4 and characterization of DHA apparent transport kinetics. [14C]DHA was prepared from crystalline [14C]ascorbic acid (8.0 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (4Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of bromine solution (Fluka) was added to 600 μl of [14C]ascorbic acid solubilized in ultrapure water at a concentration of 20 mm, vortexed briefly, and immediately purged with nitrogen on ice and in the dark for 10 min. HPLC with radiomatic detection confirmed 100% conversion of ascorbate to DHA, which could be completely recovered upon reduction with 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol. Isolation of rat adipose cells was performed as described previously (21Weber T.M. Joost H.G. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Kahn C.R. Harrison L.C. The Insulin Receptor. Allen R.

Briefly, epididymal fat pads were removed from anesthetized Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) and minced in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer, 1% bovine serum albumin without glucose, containing 200 nmadenosine. Type I collagenase (Worthington) was added for 50–60 min, and digested tissue was filtered through a 250-μm nylon screen mesh into a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube. Cells were resuspended and washed five times with the Krebs-Ringer buffer described. Cell number was quantified using lipid weight determinations. Rat adipocytes were diluted in the Krebs-Ringer buffer described above to 3–4 × 106cells/tube. When indicated, insulin (Humulin R; Lilly) was added at a final concentration of 0.67 μm for 30 min at 37 °C. Radiolabeled compounds were added at the concentrations specified. Transport was stopped after 5 min by centrifugation of cells through dinonylphthalate (ICN), 3.5 ml of scintillant was added, and cell-associated radioactivity was quantified. Radiolabeled compounds (NEN Life Science Products) used were [14C]DHA and 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (specific activity 26.2 mCi/mmol). Experiments were also performed at room temperature with comparable results. Rat adipocyte ascorbate mass and internalized ascorbate and DHA radioactivity were measured using HPLC with in-line electrochemical and radiomatic detection (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F.

To extract intracellular ascorbate and DHA, adipocytes were washed twice with 20 mm Tris buffer containing 255 mm sucrose and 1 mm EDTA, homogenized with five strokes of a Dounce homogenizer at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. The infranatant was removed and centrifuged again for 2 min at 4 °C. The resulting infranatant was removed, added to an equal volume of 90% methanol 1 mmEDTA, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min (4 °C). The supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Oocyte intracellular ascorbate was measured as described (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol.

Oocytes were isolated fromX. laevis (Xenopus I, Dexter, MI) and injected with mRNA using established methods (29Soreq H. Seidman S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 225-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as described (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Injection volume and mRNA concentration was 30–50 nl at a concentration of 1 mg/ml unless specified. After injection, oocytes were maintained at 20 °C in OR-2 medium containing 1 mm pyruvate (Sigma) for up to 5 days, and OR-2 was changed daily. Experiments were performed 3–5 days after mRNA injection. In some experiments, oocytes were incubated in the presence of insulin 1 μm for up to 24 h prior to transport studies. Transport of [14C]DHA, 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (26.2 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), and 3-O- [methyl-3H]d-glucose (75.2 mCi/mmol) was examined by incubating groups of 10–20 oocytes at 23 °C in OR-2 containing different concentrations of freshly prepared [14C]DHA (0.6–5.5 μCi/ml) or sugar (0.5–1.0 μCi/ml labeled sugar with added nonlabeled sugar) for up to 10 min. After incubation, oocytes were washed immediately four times with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmphloretin. Inhibitors or competitors were added to the incubation as indicated. Individual oocytes were either dissolved in 500 μl of 10% SDS, and internalized radioactivity was measured using scintillation spectrometry, or oocytes were frozen to −70 °C in 50 μl of 60% methanol 1 mm EDTA for later HPLC analysis. Oocytes plasma membranes were prepared using established protocols (30Wall D.A. Patel S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes manually dissected without collagenase treatment were injected with 30 ng of GLUT4 mRNA or sterile water and maintained for 3 days at 20 °C in OR-2 medium containing 1 mm pyruvate. Prior to plasma membrane isolation, oocytes were incubated for 4 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm insulin. Plasma membrane complexes were purified from groups of 30 oocytes by repeated Dounce homogenization and gravity sedimentation (30Wall D.A. Patel S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Prepared plasma membrane complexes were solubilized overnight at 4 °C in 0.4% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1 volume 20% Triton X-100 (20Nishimura H. Pallardo F.V. Seidner G.A. Vannucci S. Simpson I.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8514-8520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of solubilized plasma membrane complexes were analyzed on SDS-4–20% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with polyclonal GLUT4 antiserum (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX). Detection was by colorimetric measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity. Densitometric analyses of colorimetric signals were performed using a flatbed scanner (Hewlett Packard ScanJet 5100C) and Scion Image analysis software (Scion Corp., Fredrick, MD). Data are expressed as the arithmetic mean ± S.D. of 10–20 oocytes at each data point, unless otherwise indicated. S.D. is not displayed when smaller than the symbol size. Transport kinetics were analyzed by best fit analysis of data points utilizing curve fitting (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) and Eadie-Hofstee transformation, which gave comparable results. DHA transport by GLUT4 was first studied in isolated rat adipocytes, cells that express GLUT4. In adipocytes without insulin, the ratio of GLUT4 to GLUT1 in plasma membrane is approximately 2:1. Upon insulin stimulation this ratio changes to approximately 10:1 (9Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Flower C.J. Saltis J. Habberfield A.D. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18172-18179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because GLUT4 is disproportionately up-regulated by insulin, adipocytes are a preferred cell system to study GLUT4-mediated transport. If DHA were transported by GLUT4, DHA transport would be insulin-stimulated. Adipocytes, preincubated with or without insulin, were incubated with either [14C]DHA or [3H]2-DG (30, 100, and 300 μm), and uptake was measured (Fig. 1, A andB). A linear concentration-dependent increase in uptake for each substrate occurred, and insulin preincubation increased both 2-DG and DHA uptake by 6–8-fold. Ratios of 2-DG to DHA uptake in the basal state and stimulated state were approximately 3:1 (Fig.1 C), indicating that transport of each substrate increased proportionately with insulin. Intracellular DHA was completely reduced to ascorbate, as determined by HPLC (data not shown). We next examined whether DHA transport in adipocytes was inhibited by cytochalasin B, a potent inhibitor of hexose transport. Insulin-stimulated and nonstimulated adipocytes were incubated with 100 μm [14C]DHA or [3H]2-DG with or without cytochalasin B, and uptake was measured (Fig.2). Insulin preincubation increased total uptake of both substrates by 5- and 7-fold. Cytochalasin B inhibited basal and insulin-stimulated uptake of both DHA and 2-DG. With insulin, cytochalasin B-inhibitable transport increased by 7.7- and 8.7-fold for DHA and 2-DG, respectively. Taken together, the data in Figs. 1 and 2suggest that DHA is transported by GLUT4 in adipocytes. Xenopus oocytes present an ideal means to specifically examine DHA transport by GLUT4. In oocytes, adequate membrane expression of GLUT4 can be problematic due to its poor insertion in the plasma membrane (19Birnbaum M.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 20Nishimura H. Pallardo F.V. Seidner G.A. Vannucci S. Simpson I.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8514-8520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason and because previously reported DHA transport was very low in GLUT4-expressing oocytes (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), it was necessary to increase transport rates to study DHA transport kinetics. Oocytes and mammalian cells might have similar insulin-responsive intracellular pathways for translocation of transmembrane proteins (31Mora S. Kaliman P. Chillaron J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether insulin enhanced DHA and 2-DG transport in GLUT4-expressing oocytes. These oocytes were incubated from 1 to 24 h with 1 μminsulin, washed, and incubated with either radiolabeled DHA or 2-DG (Fig. 3, A andB). Both DHA and 2-DG transport increased up to 5-fold after 4 h of insulin preincubation. Transport of both substrates was completely inhibited by 10 μm cytochalasin B (data not shown). Control water-injected oocytes showed very little transport and were unresponsive to insulin preincubation. Preincubation with 1 μm insulin produced the maximum effect on both DHA and 2-DG transport (Fig. 3, C and D). The effect of insulin was specific for GLUT4, because oocytes expressing either GLUT1 or SGLT1 showed no increased transport in response to insulin (Fig.3 E). We tested whether the effect of insulin on increasing DHA and 2-DG transport was due to increased GLUT4 translocation to the oocyte plasma membrane. Oocytes previously injected with or without GLUT4 were incubated for 4 h with insulin, and GLUT4 in isolated oocyte plasma membranes was quantitated by Western blot (Fig.4). Insulin increased GLUT4 in the membrane approximately 5-fold, based on densitometric analyses, in agreement with the transport findings. Based on these results, DHA transport experiments in GLUT4-expressing oocytes were performed after a 4-h preincubation with insulin 1 μm except as indicated. mRNA injection amount and postinjection incubation time influenced DHA and 2-DG transport. Transport of both substrates increased linearly with injected amounts of mRNA from 0.3 to 40 ng (data not shown), and 30 ng of mRNA was used for injections. Transport increased linearly with substrate incubation time from day 2 to 5 after mRNA injection (data not shown). Experiments were performed using oocytes 3–5 days postinjection, because oocyte fragility increased after day 5. To determine kinetics, injected oocytes were preincubated with insulin, washed, and incubated with different concentrations of [14C]DHA or [3H]2-DG. Intracellular substrate uptake was quantified, and apparent transport kinetics constants were determined by Eadie-Hofstee transformation of the data (Fig. 5, A andB, insets). For DHA, the apparentK m was 0.98 mm and the apparentV max was 66 pmol/oocyte/10 min, and for 2-DG the apparent K m was 5.2 mm and the apparentV max was 880 pmol/oocyte/10 min. Nonlinear curve fitting gave similar results. Because of the difference in maximal transport rates between DHA and 2-DG in GLUT4-expressing oocytes, uptake rates of DHA and 2-DG were compared with those in oocytes expressing GLUT1 or GLUT3. At comparable extracellular concentrations, 2-DG uptake was 6–12-fold greater than that of DHA in GLUT4-expressing oocytes (Fig.6, A and B). In contrast, oocytes expressing GLUT1 or GLUT3 transported both substrates equally (Fig. 6 B). Maximal transport rates of DHA for GLUT1- and GLUT3-expressing oocytes were approximately 100 pmol/oocyte/min compared with a maximal rate of 6.6 pmol/oocyte/min for GLUT4-expressing oocytes. The apparent transport affinity of GLUT4 for DHA was similar to that of GLUT1 and GLUT3 (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and higher than that for 2-DG (lower K m ), but the rate of GLUT4-mediated transport was at least 6-fold lower for DHA compared with 2-DG. The maximal transport rate differences between DHA and 2-DG could not be attributed to differences in expressed transporter on the cell surface, because oocytes used in experiments with either substrate were injected and incubated in the same way at the same time. We therefore examined whether differences in transport rate between DHA and 2-DG could be attributed to other factors. Decreased transport of DHA could not be attributed to intracellular reduction of dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate. Measurement of intracellular ascorbic acid using HPLC demonstrated 100% reduction of DHA acid to ascorbate at all extracellular concentrations of DHA examined. Furthermore, using GLUT1 and GLUT3-expressing oocytes, intracellular reduction of DHA to ascorbate began to diminish at approximately 70–100 pmol/min/oocyte, which is at least 10-fold higher than the maximal rate of transport seen in GLUT4-expressing oocytes (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Some glucose transport isoforms exhibit increased transport activity due to substrate trans-activation (32Cohen N.R. Knecht D.A. Lodish H.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Because DHA is completely reduced and phosphorylation is not rate-limiting within the time course of these experiments (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 25Burant C.F. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10414-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (data not shown), we tested whether increased transport of 2-DG by GLUT4 could be due to intracellular activation of the transport process. Control and GLUT4-expressing oocytes were loaded overnight with 20 mm 3-OMG, a nonmetabolized glucose analog, and transport of [14C]DHA or [3H]2-DG was examined. Uptake rates of both substrates were similar regardless of 3-OMG loading (Fig.7). Loading of oocytes with 3-OMG was confirmed using 3-O-[methyl-3H]d-glucose and measuring intracellular accumulation of radiolabel in a parallel set of GLUT4-expressing oocytes (data not shown). It was also tested whether binding affinity to the external face of the transport protein was different for DHA or 2-DG. Incubation of GLUT4-expressing oocytes with 500 μm of either [14C]DHA or [3H]2-DG in the presence of increasing amounts of the exofacial glucose inhibitor 4,6-O-ethylidene-α-glucose resulted in a similar concentration-dependent inhibition of uptake for both substrates (Fig. 8). These results suggest that DHA and 2-DG binding to the external face of GLUT4 are comparable. In summary, GLUT4-expressing oocytes transported DHA with an apparent affinity higher than that of 2-DG, but with a 6–12-fold lower maximal transport rate. This could not be attributed to intracellular reduction of DHA, substrate trans-activation, or decreased DHA binding at the extracellular surface. Therefore, the lower transport rate is probably due to differences between DHA and 2-DG in either transmembrane translocation or intracellular release. The relevance of DHA transport by GLUT4 in vivo depends upon both DHA availability and the presence of other substrates such as glucose that could inhibit transport. We tested whether DHA uptake would occur in GLUT4-expressing oocytes in the presence of glucose at physiologic concentrations and at higher concentrations that occur in diabetes mellitus. GLUT4-expressing oocytes were incubated with DHA (100 μm) for 10 min in the presence ofd-glucose (0–30 mm) (Fig.9). Uptake was inhibited approximately 50% by glucose within the physiologic concentration range of 3–5 mm, while higher concentrations inhibited DHA uptake by up to 92%. These data show that concentrations of glucose within the physiologic range and 30–50-fold in excess of DHA only partially inhibited DHA uptake in oocytes. This study presents new information showing that GLUT4 transports dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of ascorbate. Transport was initially examined using isolated rat adipocytes because of their abundance of GLUT4. Rat adipocytes express GLUT1 as well as GLUT4, and in response to insulin both are translocated to the cell surface. Upon insulin stimulation, GLUT4 concentration in plasma membrane is approximately 10-fold greater than GLUT1, and increased glucose transport after insulin stimulation can be attributed predominantly to GLUT4(9). We report here that DHA and 2-DG were transported by rat adipocytes without insulin, that insulin preincubation increased uptake of both DHA and 2-DG 6–8-fold, and that the rate of DHA transport was approximately 3-fold less than that of 2-DG independent of insulin. These novel data support the conclusion that DHA transport in adipocytes was mediated by GLUT4. To validate that GLUT4 could transport DHA, GLUT4 was expressed inXenopus oocytes. Advantages of oocytes are that specific GLUT transporters can be tested individually, endogenous glucose and DHA transport is nearly undetectable in control oocytes, and the human GLUT4 construct could be tested. These experiments showed conclusively for the first time that GLUT4 transports DHA, that the affinity of GLUT4 for DHA is similar to that of GLUT1 and GLUT3, and that the affinity of GLUT4 for DHA is higher than for 2-DG. Oocyte expression of GLUT4 has been reported (18Janicot M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2642-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Birnbaum M.J.

Pharmacol. 1999; 377: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but measurement of hexose transport has been problematic because GLUT4 expression on the oocyte surface is generally less than that of other glucose transport proteins (7Rumsey S.C.

Experiments with DHA as a substrate are further complicated by low specific activity of synthesized [14C]DHA and its lability, making long incubations impossible. These problems were solved by increasing GLUT4 transport activity inXenopus oocytes. Insulin preincubation of ≥4 h increased transport activity of both DHA and 2-DG by up to 5-fold, and the maximum effect was achieved with 1 μm insulin. Insulin increased GLUT4 translocation to the oocyte plasma membrane by approximately 5-fold, as expected. Although oocytes do not have insulin receptors, our results are consistent with those showing that insulin can act through IGF-1 pathways (18Janicot M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2642-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown insulin to increase GLUT-4-mediated transport of 2-DG in oocytes 2-fold by increasing V max, although the longest insulin preincubation time was 1.5 h (31Mora S. Kaliman P. Chillaron J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Detaille D. Wiernsperger N. Devos P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 377: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Other investigators examined GLUT4-mediated transport (25Burant C.F. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10414-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Gould G.W. Thomas H.M. Jess T.J. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5139-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) in oocytes, but insulin effects were not reported (37Keller R.J. Coulombe R.A. Sharma R.P. Grover T.A. Piette L.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is possible that other investigators did not detect insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation because the insulin incubation time was too short. Although the mechanisms by which insulin increased the amount of GLUT4 in oocyte membranes are not fully understood (31Mora S. Kaliman P. Chillaron J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Detaille D. Wiernsperger N. Devos P. Eur. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26193-26199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enhanced GLUT4 transport activity induced by insulin was essential for measurement of DHA apparent transport kinetics. Utilizing oocytes expressing GLUT4, we compared zero-trans uptake kinetics of DHA and 2-DG. The apparent transport affinity of GLUT4 for DHA was 0.98 mm, similar to that of GLUT1 (1.1 mm) and GLUT3 (1.7 mm) (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The apparent transport affinity of GLUT4 for 2-DG was considerably lower, 5.2 mm, but this is comparable with other values for GLUT4 (25Burant C.F. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10414-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,35Detaille D. Wiernsperger N. Devos P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 377: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 39Keller K. Mueckler M. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1990; 49: 1201-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its higher apparent transport affinity for DHA, however, GLUT4 transported DHA at a substantially slower rate than 2-DG both in oocytes and in rat adipocytes. For example, in oocytes expressing GLUT4, uptake of 2-DG was 6–12-fold greater than uptake of DHA, while in oocytes expressing either GLUT1 or GLUT3, uptake of 2-DG and of DHA were essentially equal. We examined several possible explanations to account for the lower transport rate of DHA compared with 2-DG by GLUT4 in oocytes. Substrate transport by glucose transport proteins may involve either a single binding site that translocates from outside to inside the cell, termed simple carrier transport, or two sites that are independently present on each side of the membrane, termed fixed site carrier transport (40Carruthers A. Helgerson A.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3907-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,41Cloherty E.K. Heard K.S. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10411-10421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following these mechanisms, apparent transport affinity, measured as zero-trans uptake, is a function of substrate binding to the transport protein at the extracellular face, membrane translocation of the substrate, and substrate release leading to the return of the transport protein for further extracellular substrate binding. We showed that extracellular binding of DHA and 2-DG were the same by performing inhibition experiments with ethylidene glucose, a glucose analog not translocated by glucose transporters. Because the intracellular side of the transport protein may also be available to bind substrate, we examined whether the differences in transport might be attributed to a trans-activation effect. Once inside oocytes, DHA is rapidly reduced to ascorbate, which does not interact with glucose transport proteins (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Therefore, only 2-DG could possibly interact with intracellular binding sites. Using oocytes preloaded with 20 mm 3-OMG, we demonstrated that intracellular sugar had no effect on GLUT4 transport of either 2-DG or DHA. These data are consistent with previous reports that GLUT4, unlike GLUT1, does not demonstrate mechanisms of transactivation (32Cohen N.R. Knecht D.A. Lodish H.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Taken together, the findings suggest that the different rate of uptake of DHA compared with 2-DG is probably due to differences in membrane translocation and/or intracellular substrate release. To clarify this issue, additional biochemical tools are needed that are not currently available, such as a nonreducible DHA analog or a high affinity ligand that inhibits DHA but not 2-DG transport. DHA transport by GLUT4 may be a novel aspect of ascorbate recycling, in which DHA formed by oxidation of extracellular ascorbate is rapidly transported into cells and immediately reduced to ascorbate intracellularly. Ascorbate recycling allows cells to accumulate ascorbate rapidly (4Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it may be a new mechanism for ascorbate accumulation in GLUT4-expressing cells such as adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, or cardiac myocytes. Because GLUT4 transports DHA as shown in this paper, GLUT1 and GLUT3 transport DHA (7Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and nearly all cells possess at least one of these transporters, we predict that most cells will transport DHA if available. The contribution of GLUT4-mediated transport of DHA to ascorbate accumulation in vivo is unknown. Plasma concentrations of DHA in healthy people cannot be distinguished from zero (3Dhariwal K.R. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). DHA was detected in plasma of diabetic patients, but this may be due to assay artifact (2Rumsey S.C. Levine M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1998; 9: 116-130Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 42Sinclair A.J. Taylor P.B. Lunec J. Girling A.J. Barnett A.H. Diabet. Med. 1994; 11: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 43Washko P.W. Welch R.W. Dhariwal K.R. Wang Y. Levine M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). DHA plasma concentrations, however, may not indicate substrate availability to tissues. Cellular transport may be a consequence of local formation of DHA extracellularly, which would not be reflected by plasma measurements (2Rumsey S.C. Levine M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1998; 9: 116-130Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Local oxidation of ascorbate to DHA is followed by its rapid uptake into neutrophils (4Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unknown whether similar local oxidation occurs in the extracellular milieu of tissues that express GLUT4. Transport of ascorbate itself may be responsible for ascorbate accumulation under conditions without oxidation. With oxidative stress, DHA uptake and subsequent intracellular reduction may contribute to ascorbate accumulation (1Welch R.W. Wang Y. Crossman Jr., A. Park J.B. Kirk K.L. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12584-12592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,2Rumsey S.C. Levine M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1998; 9: 116-130Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Type II diabetes is characterized by insulin insensitivity, decreased GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane, decreased glucose transport, and accumulation of glucose in plasma. Although unresolved, a number of investigators have suggested that ascorbate requirements of diabetics may be increased (14Lindsay R.M. Jamieson N.S. Walker S.A. McGuigan C.C. Smith W. Baird J.D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Nagano S. Kurokawa M. Ebara T. Naito H. Sakamaki R. Furukawa S. Hirano T. Maeda M. Tsuji A. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol.

Nutr. 1998; 17: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The data here provide several potential mechanisms by which this may occur. DHA uptake followed by internal reduction could be one mechanism accounting for ascorbate accumulation in GLUT4-expressing tissues. If in diabetics DHA uptake is diminished due to decreased GLUT4 at the cell membrane, ascorbate intracellular concentrations might decline. It is also possible that DHA clearance by GLUT1, GLUT3, or GLUT4 may decline due to high extracellular glucose concentrations, and DHA residence time outside cells may increase. Because DHA is labile, irreversible extracellular degradation of DHA may occur, and ascorbate reducing equivalents would be lost. Another possibility is that insulin-induced increases in GLUT1 at the plasma membrane may partially mediate DHA uptake. In oocytes, the rate of GLUT1-mediated DHA transport is approximately 20-fold faster than that mediated by GLUT4, although such comparisons are not ideal because transport rate differences in oocytes may be due to differences in transporter expression (20Nishimura H. Pallardo F.V. Seidner G.A. Vannucci S. Simpson I.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8514-8520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the rate of DHA transport by GLUT1 greatly exceeds that by GLUT4, a modest increase in GLUT1 at the plasma membrane could mediate DHA accumulation. In diabetes, if insulin-induced GLUT1 recruitment to the plasma membrane is diminished (44Miele C. Formisano P. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Oriente F. Andreozzi F. Tocchetti C.G. Riccardi G. Beguinot F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), DHA uptake would be diminished. All of these possibilities are dependent on formation of DHA in vivo, which remains to be proven (2Rumsey S.C. Levine M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1998; 9: 116-130Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 43Washko P.W. Welch R.W. Dhariwal K.R. Wang Y. Levine M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and on DHA reduction pathways in normal and diabetic tissues. Considering the possible implications of ascorbate recycling for the determination of ascorbate requirements for all individuals, and especially those with aberrant glucose metabolism or increased oxidant loads, these concepts deserve further investigation."

Immunological characterization of these conjugates suggests that both topoisomerase IIα and IIβ isozymes are conjugated to SUMO-1. The involvement of SUMO-1/UBC9 in the modification of topoisomerase II isozymes is also supported by the demonstration of physical interaction between topoisomerase II and SUMO-1/UBC9. Surprisingly, ICRF-193, which does not induce topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage but traps topoisomerase II into a circular clamp conformation, is also shown to induce similar SUMO-1 conjugation to topoisomerase II isozymes. In addition, we show that both oxidative and heat shock stresses, which can cause protein damage, rapidly increase nuclear SUMO-1 conjugates.

However, the mechanism for repair of topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage is still largely unclear. Topoisomerase I (TOP1)1-mediated DNA damage has been shown to activate the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway resulting in degradation of TOP1 (TOP1 down-regulation) (3Desai S.D. Liu L.F.

Recently, some proteases, which specifically activate SUMO-1/Smt3p precursors and cleave SUMO-1/Smt3p from their protein conjugates and are distinct from isopeptidases for ubiquitin conjugates, have also been identified in yeast and mammalian cells (23Li S.J.

Many proteins such as RanGAP1, PML, IκBα, RAD51, RAD52, centromere proteins, and p53, which have diverse functions have been shown to interact with UBC9/SUMO-1 or be modified by SUMO-1 (see review in Ref. 12Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this communication, we show that TOP2-mediated DNA damage induced by teniposide (VM-26), a TOP2-specific poison (27Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar), also results in rapid accumulation of SUMO-1-TOP2 conjugates. In addition, ICRF-193, which is known not to induce TOP2-mediated DNA damage but to trap topoisomerase II into circular clamp conformation, is also shown to induce rapid accumulation of SUMO-1-TOP2 conjugates. Furthermore, heat shock stress, which is known to cause protein unfolding, also significantly increases SUMO-1 conjugation to nuclear proteins. These results suggest that the signal that triggers SUMO-1 conjugation to topoisomerase II may result from the conformational change (the circular clamp conformation) of topoisomerase II.

Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar. The full-length hTOP2β cDNA was also cloned into plasmid pAS2–1 (Matchmaker II) as a bait for screening the human placenta cDNA library (Matchmaker II). The active site tyrosine at amino acid 821 was mutated to Phe by polymerase chain reaction based site-directed mutagensis. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The cDNA containing the Y821F mutation was similarly cloned into pAS2–1 for yeast two-hybrid assay. The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using full-length hTOP2β cDNA and Matchmaker II human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH). The large scale screening assay was done as described in the Matchmaker II protocol. The filter and quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assay were done according to the protocol described by the Matchmaker II system (CLONTECH). The full-length hUBC9 cDNA, which was excised from the plasmid recovered from the positive yeast clone obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen, was constructed to fuse in-frame with GST in the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST and GST-hUBC9 fusion protein were overexpressed in E. coli and purified by batch elution from affinity glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech). The GST pull-down assay was performed exactly the same as described previously except that hTOP2 rather than hTOP1 antibodies were used for immunoblotting (4Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (4051): 4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This assay was performed exactly the same as described previously except that anti-hTOP2 rather than anti-hTOP1 antibodies were used in co-immunoprecipitation (4Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (4051): 4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). HeLa cells in subconfluency were treated with 100 μm VM-26 or 100 μm ICRF-193 for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were lysed by an alkali solution as described previously (3Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Following neutralization, lysates were digested with Staphylococcal S7 nuclease at room temperature for 15 min and then analyzed by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting with anti-hTOP2α, anti-hTOP2β, and anti-SUMO-1 antibodies was performed as described (3Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded in 60 × 15-mm dishes. Cells in subconfluency were subject to heat shock treatment. Following heat shock, cells were trypsinized and pelleted. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of buffer N (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) and centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and the nuclear pellet fractions were collected separately after centrifugation. Proteins in the supernatant fraction were subject to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Both supernatant and nuclear pellets were then resuspended in an alkaline solution as described previously (3Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Following neutralization, the samples were digested withStaphylococcal S7 nuclease and then subject to immunoblotting analysis. HeLa cells treated with 100 μm ICRF-193 for 50 min were trypsinizied, and cell pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitors) with brief sonication. 150 μl of lysates were precleared by incubating with 2 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were then mixed with another 2 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads and anti-hTOP2α or anti-hTOP2β antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, beads were washed twice with 600 μl of radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer and once with rinse buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were resuspended in 45 μl of 2× SDS buffer and boiled for 10 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-hTOP2 antibodies. Using hTOP2β as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen (see “Experimental Procedures”), we have identified 12 positive clones. Sequencing analysis of these clones have revealed that 9 of 12 of these clones encodes full-length hUBC9. The interaction between hUBC9 and hTOP2β was also confirmed by quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assay. The interaction between hTOP2β (both wild type and active site mutant Y821F) and hUBC9 gave rise to β-galactosidase activity, which was about 100-fold higher compared with hUBC9 alone without the bait (TableI). However, no positive interaction between the C-terminal domain of hTOP2β (amino acids 991–1621) and hUBC9 was demonstrated in the filter assay. UBC9 is the E2 enzyme for SUMO-1 conjugation (16Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It has been reported that some proteins, which are covalently modified by SUMO-1 also interact with SUMO-1 noncovalently (9Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol.

Consequently, we have also tested the interaction between hTOP2β and SUMO-1 using the yeast two hybrid assay. As shown in Table I, hTOP2β also interacts strongly with SUMO-1 in the β-galactosidase filter assay.Table IhTOP2β interacts with hUBC9 in yeast two-hybrid assayPreyBaitβ-galactosidase assayLiquidFilterβ-galactosidase unitshUBC9 +hTOP2β (Y821F)19.4++1-a++, visible blue color developed within 30 min.hUBC9 +hTOP2β (wt)17.7++hUBC9 +hTOP2β (C-terminal)n/d1-bn/d, not determined.−1-c−, no visible blue color after 18 h.hUBC90.2−SUMO-1 +hTOP2β (wt)n/d++1-a ++, visible blue color developed within 30 min.1-b n/d, not determined.1-c −, no visible blue color after 18 h. Open table in a new tab To confirm the interaction between hUBC9 and hTOP2β, we constructed and purified a GST-hUBC9 fusion protein and performed a GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Using the GST pull-down assay, we showed that both hTOP2β and hTOP2α interacted with hUBC9 (Fig.1 A). GST-hUBC9 pulled down both hTOP2α and hTOP2β from nuclear extracts and purified protein preparations (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4). As a control using GST alone, neither hTOP2 isozyme was pulled down (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). This result suggested that the interaction between hTOP2 and GST-hUBC9 was specific. This specific interaction between hTOP2 and hUBC9 was further confirmed by the co-immunoprecipitation assay. In this assay, GST-hUBC9 was mixed with the nuclear extract prepared from human 2RA cells (WI38 cells transformed with SV40 T antigen). As shown in Fig. 1 B(lane 3), antibodies that recognize both hTOP2α and hTOP2β isoforms co-immunoprecipitated GST-hUBC9 from nuclear extract (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). In contrast, HA antibodies (used as a control) did not immunoprecipitate GST-hUBC9, which remained in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 2 and 4). To demonstrate a functional interaction between hTOP2 and SUMO-1/UBC9, we have tested the possibility that hTOP2 can be covalently modified by SUMO-1. As shown in Fig.2 A (lane 1), no SUMO-1-hTOP2 conjugates in HeLa cells were detectable by immunoblotting with anti-hTOP2αβ antibodies (antibodies that recognize both isoforms of hTOP2). However, upon VM-26 treatment, some higher molecular weight species (see bands marked by *) were detectable in the immunoblot (Fig. 2 A). The same blot was stripped and reblotted with anti-SUMO-1 antibodies. The same higher molecular weight species were detected (see bands marked by * in lanes 3 and4 of Fig. 2 A). These experiments suggest that these high molecular weight species could be SUMO-1-hTOP2 conjugates. To test whether both hTOP2 isoforms were covalently modified by SUMO-1, antibodies specific for each hTOP2 isoforms were used to perform immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, high molecular species were detectable in HeLa cells treated with VM-26 using isozyme-specific antibodies against either isoform. ICRF-193 belongs to a different class of hTOP2 inhibitors (30Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Unlike VM-26, which induces topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, ICRF-193 inhibits the catalytic activity of hTOP2 by trapping TOP2 into circular protein clamps in the presence of ATP (31Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Interestingly, covalent modification of hTOP2 by SUMO-1 was also observed in HeLa cells treated with ICRF-193 (Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.3 A (compare lanes 1 and 2), a similar group of high molecular weight species (see the bracket labeled hTOP2-SUMO-1 conjugates) were detected by anti-hTOP2αβ antibodies using lysates prepared from HeLa cells treated with ICRF-193. The same membrane filter was stripped and reblotted with anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). Again, similar high molecular weight species were observed (see bands in the bracketed region in Fig. 3 A), suggesting that these high molecular weight species could be covalent SUMO-1-hTOP2 conjugates. To verify that those conjugates induced in HeLa cells treated with ICRF-193 were covalent SUMO-1-hTOP2 complexes, we immunoprecipitated hTOP2 isozymes from HeLa cell lysates using isozyme-specific antibodies (Fig. 3 B). The immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with either anti-hTOP2αβ antibodies (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3–6) or anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (Fig. 3 B,lanes 9–12). The same high molecular weight species (see bracketed regions) in immunoprecipitates were detectable using either hTOP2αβ antibodies or anti-SUMO-1 antibodies, suggesting that these high molecular weight species contained both SUMO-1 and hTOP2. In the aggregate, these results suggest that the high molecular weight species induced by either ICRF-193 or VM-26 are SUMO-1-hTOP2 conjugates. In our current study, we have shown that both ICRF-193 and VM-26, which represent two distinct types of TOP2 inhibitors, induce SUMO-1 conjugation to hTOP2. Previous studies have demonstrated that the majority of SUMO-1-TOP1 conjugates in cells treated with camptothecin are covalently linked to DNA (3Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 4Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (4051): 4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To test whether SUMO-1-hTOP2 conjugates in cells treated with either ICRF-193 or VM-26 were covalently linked to DNA, the effect of nuclease (Staphylococcal S7 nuclease) treatment of cell lysates was tested (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig.4 A (lanes 1 and 2), in the absence of nuclease treatment, no SUMO-1 conjugates were detectable in HeLa cells treated with VM-26. The decrease in the band intensities of hTOP2α and hTOP2β (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) was because of the formation of significant fractions of hTOP2 into covalent complexes with DNA, which were too large to enter gel (32Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9713-9715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon nuclease treatment, these covalent complexes (either retained in the well or migrated as smears) were released from DNA, and consequently more hTOP2 species including those high molecular weight SUMO-1-hTOP2 conjugates were detected as distinct bands (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). However, when a similar experiment was performed using ICRF-193 instead of VM-26, those high molecular weight species were detectable with or without nuclease treatment (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 4). In addition, the amounts of unconjugated hTOP2 species (hTOP2α and hTOP2β) were about the same with or without nuclease treatment (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes 2 and 4), indicating that ICRF-193, in contrast to VM-26, does not induce the formation of covalent hTOP2-DNA complexes. These experiments suggest that SUMO-1-hTOP2 conjugates formed in cells treated with VM-26 but not with ICRF-193 are covalently linked to chromosomal DNA. Consistent with this interpretation, we have also shown that the formation of SUMO-1-hTOP2α conjugates occurs in CEM cells but not in VM-26-resistant CEM/VM-1 cells (Fig.5). CEM/VM-1 cells are known to express a mutant form of hTOP2α, which is highly resistant to VM-26-induced formation of TOP2α cleavable complexes (33Fernandes D.J. Danks M.K. Beck W.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4235-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The presence of a 160-kDa form of hTOP2α in CEM/VM-1 cells has been reported previously (33Fernandes D.J. Danks M.K. Beck W.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4235-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 43Danks M.K. Schmidt C.A. Deneka D.A. Beck W.T. Cancer Commun. 1989; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Figure 5VM-26 induces SUMO-1 conjugation to TOP2α in CEM but not VM-26-resistant CEM/VM-1 cells. The same number of CEM and CEM/VM-1 cells were treated with 100 μm VM-26 for 30 min. Cells were then lysed by the alkaline lysis procedure, and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-hTOP2α antibodies (upper panel) and anti-hTOP1 antibodies (lower panel). The hTOP2α conjugates induced by VM-26 were indicated by a bracket. Lanes 1 and 2, lysates of CEM cells with and without VM-26 treatment, respectively. Lanes 3 and 4, lysates of CEM/VM-1 cells with and without VM-26 treatment, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The above experiment suggests that SUMO-1 conjugation to hTOP2 may be triggered by a direct signal from hTOP2 (e.g.an altered conformation of hTOP2 in the presence of either VM-26 or ICRF-193) rather than an indirect signal from the broken DNA strands. To test this notion, we have monitored the formation of SUMO-1 conjugates in cells treated with heat shock as well as agents known to damage either protein or DNA. As shown in Fig.6 A, heat shock treatment of HeLa cells at 45 °C for 10 min resulted in a greatly elevated level of SUMO-1 conjugates. Interestingly, concomitant with the increase in the level of SUMO-1 conjugates, the unconjugated SUMO-1 pool decreased to an undetectable level (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). These results suggest that, upon heat shock, the unconjugated SUMO-1 pool is rapidly mobilized to form SUMO-1 conjugates. The increase in the levels of SUMO-1 conjugates was also observed in HeLa cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 6 B) orN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Fig. 6 C). No increase in the level of SUMO-1 conjugates was observed in HeLa cells treated with cisplatin, which is known to damage DNA (Fig. 6 E). Except at very high doses (200 and 2000 J/m2), UV irradiation resulted in little increase in the level of SUMO-1 conjugates (Fig.6 D). To determine the cellular distribution of SUMO-1 conjugates upon heat shock treatment, HeLa cells with and without heat shock were fractionated into cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions (Fig. 7). Without heat shock, except for a 90-kDa protein which is SUMO-1-conjugated RanGAP1 (7Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), nearly all SUMO-1 conjugates were in the nuclear fraction (Fig.7 A, compares lanes 4 and 5). Upon heat shock, the level of SUMO-1 conjugates in the nuclear fraction (N) was greatly increased, whereas SUMO-1 conjugates in the cytoplasmic fraction remained undetectable (Fig. 7 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). To ensure that the lack of SUMO-1 conjugates in the cytoplasmic fraction is not because of a loss of cytoplasmic proteins during fractionation, a duplicate gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and shown in Fig. 7 C. We have also monitored the levels of ubiquitin conjugates in HeLa cells with or without heat shock treatment. The same gel as shown in Fig. 7 A was stripped and reblotted with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. As shown in Fig.7 B, heat shock greatly increased in the levels of ubiquitin conjugates in both the cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions. The effect of heat shock on the increase in SUMO-1 conjugates may be because of two possibilities; one is that heat shock could partially unfold some nuclear proteins making them better substrates for SUMO-1/UBC9. The other is that heat shock could either stimulate the activity of UBC9 and/or inhibit the activity of the de-SUMOylation enzyme, resulting in the increase in the steady state level of SUMO-1 conjugates. To test the latter possibility, we have performed the following experiment (Fig. 8). Previous studies have demonstrated that TOP1-mediated DNA damage induced by camptothecin specifically induces accumulation of SUMO-1-hTOP1 conjugates (4Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (4051): 4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, HeLa cells treated with camptothecin resulted in the formation of a ladder of bands, which have previously been identified to be SUMO-1-hTOP1 conjugates (Fig. 7,lane 2). These SUMO-1-hTOP1 conjugates did not increase in abundance upon heat shock as would be expected if the latter possibility were true. They in fact dramatically decreased in their abundance (Fig. 8, compare lanes 2 and 4). The decrease in abundance of SUMO-1-hTOP1 conjugates is probably because of heat (45 °C)-induced reversal of hTOP1 cleavable complexes followed by de-SUMOylation (data not shown). This result thus argues against the latter possibility and favors the former possibility that unfolding of nuclear protein induced by heat shock directly signals SUMO-1 modification. SUMO-1, a ubiquitin-like protein, has been identified to be conjugated to many important cellular proteins (for review, see Ref.34Kretz-Remy C. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consequently, SUMOylation has been suggested to be involved in diverse biological functions such as regulation of ubiquitin conjugation in the case of IκBα (35Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), regulation of protein transport in the case of RanGAP1 (36Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J.

Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent studies have suggested that SUMO-1-hTOP1 conjugates may be involved in the repair of topoisomerase I-mediated DNA damage (4Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (4051): 4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that VM-26 induces SUMO-1 modification of both hTOP2 isozymes, hTOP2α and hTOP2β, in HeLa cells. The role of UBC9 and SUMO-1 in this system has been further corroborated by the demonstration of physical interactions between hTOP2 and UBC9 and between hTOP2 and SUMO-1. VM-26 is a TOP2 poison, which traps DNA-hTOP2 in a ternary complex in which TOP2 is covalently linked to the 5′-phosphoryl ends of the double strand break (27Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that VM-26-induced SUMOylation of hTOP2 is greatly reduced in CEM/VM-1 cells, which are defective in VM-26-induced formation of the ternary complex (Fig. 5). Consequently, the effect of VM-26 on SUMOylation of hTOP2 is because of the formation of these ternary complexes rather than other unidentified side effect(s) of VM-26. However, it is unclear whether SUMO-1 conjugation to hTOP2 is signaled by hTOP2 because of its conformational change and/or an indirect response because of a DNA damage response. To differentiate between these two possibilities, another TOP2 inhibitor, ICRF-193, was used. ICRF-193 belongs to a different class of TOP2 inhibitors that inhibit the catalytic activity of TOP2 without trapping the covalent ternary complex (i.e. no topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage). In the presence of ATP, ICRF-193 is known to lock TOP2 into a circular clamp conformation (31Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that ICRF-193 also induces SUMO-1 conjugation to hTOP2. As expected, the SUMO-1-hTOP2 conjugates induced by ICRF-193, unlike those induced by VM-26, were not covalently linked to DNA. This result suggests that the signal for SUMO-1 conjugation to hTOP2, at least in the case of ICRF-193, is not from DNA damage. Previous studies have also demonstrated that in the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by VM-26 is greatly (over 50-fold) stimulated (44Mao Y., Yu, C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was suggested that the ATP- or AMP-PNP-bound form of TOP2 is the major target of VM-26. This ATP- or AMP-PNP bound form of TOP2 has also been shown to be a circular protein clamp (31Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It seems possible that it is the circular protein clamp conformation(s) of TOP2 that signals SUMO-1 conjugation to TOP2 in cells treated with either ICRF-193 or VM-26. Our studies have also demonstrated that hTOP2 physically interacts with both SUMO-1 and UBC9. One could speculate that the conformational change associated with the formation of the circular protein clamp could either enhance hTOP2 interaction with SUMO-1 and/or UBC9 or bring SUMO-1 and UBC9 into proper geometry on the enzyme surface for effective SUMO-1 conjugation to hTOP2. Alternatively, the circular clamp conformation could increase the k cat of the SUMO-1 conjugation reaction. We are in the process of testing these possibilities in an in vitro SUMOylation system. Clearly, further experiments are necessary to establish whether SUMO-1 conjugation to hTOP2 is signaled by TOP2 conformational change(s) or an unknown mechanism(s) (e.g. a DNA damage response). We have also examined the effect of some stress conditions on SUMO-1 conjugation in HeLa cells. These stress conditions are known to cause protein unfolding (e.g. heat shock) and/or protein damage (e.g. H2O2 and NEM). Among the various stress conditions, heat shock and H2O2treatment are most effective in increasing the levels of SUMO-1 conjugates in the nucleus. NEM exhibited less effect compared with heat shock and H2O2. Within 10 min of heat shock at 45 °C, the levels of SUMO-1 conjugates in HeLa cells were greatly elevated. Concomitantly, the unconjugated SUMO-1 pool was rapidly exhausted. Except for the 90-kDa SUMO-1-conjugated RanGAP1, all SUMO-1 conjugates were shown to be in the nuclear fraction. The simplest explanation is that heat shock induces partial unfolding of some nuclear proteins. These unfolded proteins trigger their SUMO-1 conjugation. However, it is also possible that SUMO-1 conjugates may exist in a dynamic state being constantly formed and de-SUMOylated. In this case, heat shock might increase the steady state level of SUMO-1 conjugates by affecting the enzymes (e.g. UBC9 and the SUMO-1-specific protease) involved in SUMOylation and de-SUMOylation. If this were true, the levels of all SUMO-1 conjugates should be elevated upon heat shock. However, careful inspection of Fig.6 A has revealed that heat shock appears to induce additional SUMO-1 conjugates without affecting some of the existing SUMO-1 conjugates. In addition, the level of camptothecin-induced SUMO-1-hTOP1 conjugates was decreased rather than increased after heat shock treatment. These results argue against an effect of heat shock on SUMOylation and/or de-SUMOylation enzymes. Thus, it seems plausible that heat shock may cause unfolding of certain nuclear proteins that directly signal their SUMO-1 conjugation. The effect of H2O2 can be similarly explained. H2O2 is known to damage both DNA and protein via reactive oxygen species. These damaged proteins may somehow signal SUMO-1 conjugations. This result may be particularly significant, because cells are constantly under oxidative stress. SUMOylation may thus be evolved as a defense mechanism for repair/removal of damaged nuclear proteins. The effect of UV irradiation on SUMOylation is interesting. At low doses of UV, little effect on SUMOylation was observed. However, at high doses (over 200 J/m2), SUMOylation of nuclear proteins was significantly increased. It has been reported that UV irradiation increases SUMOylation of p53 (40Muller S. Dejean A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5137-5143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,41Gostissa M. Hengstermann V.F. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Our preliminary study has also demonstrated that UV induces SUMOylation of hTOP1. 2Y. Mao and L. F. Liu, unpublished results. UV irradiation is known to damage both nucleic acids and proteins (45Tyrrell R.M. EXS. 1996; 77: 255-271PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the effect of UV on SUMOylation of nuclear proteins is because of DNA damage or protein damage requires further clarification. It should be pointed out that whereas our studies have demonstrated the involvement of SUMO-1 in modifying topoisomerases and nuclear proteins, we cannot rule out the possibility that SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 may also be involved (8Lapenta V. Chiurazzi P. van der Spek P. Pizzuti A. Hanaoka F. Brahe C. Genomics. 1997; 40: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46Chen A. Mannen H. Li S.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 1161-1174PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown that camptothecin can induce SUMO-2/3-hTOP1 conjugates in addition to SUMO-1-hTOP1 conjugates in mammalian cells.2 The fate of SUMO-1-modified nuclear proteins remains unclear. SUMO-1 conjugates could be destined for degradation by interacting with the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway or for repair/refolding by some unknown mechanisms. Our current studies have demonstrated that topoisomerases are attractive models for studying SUMO-1 function because of the availability of specific inhibitors of different classes. Clearly, further studies are necessary to reveal the function of SUMO-1 in the repair of topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage and more generally in regulating nuclear protein functions. We thank Drs. Fritz Boege, Jaulang Hwang, and Dr. William Beck for providing us with anti-hTOP2β antibodies, anti-hTOP2αβ antibodies, and CEM/VM1 cells, respectively."

Using in vitro ubiquitination assays, we found that the Ring finger of cIAP2 alone possesses intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity and promotes substrate-independent ubiquitination. It also promotes ubiquitination of caspases 3 and 7 but not caspase-1. The Ring fingers of c-Cbl and Apc11 failed to promote caspase-7 ubiquitination, suggesting that the Ring finger of cIAP2 itself is involved in substrate recognition."

Keratin 19 (K19) is unique because it has been implicated as a marker of stem cells in some tissues, such as the hair follicle in the skin. It is also associated with malignant transformation in esophageal and pancreatic cancers. Here, we show that the K19 promoter is active in a subset of gastrointestinal cancer cells derived from esophageal and pancreas but inactive in other contexts. This activity was mapped to a short region containing an overlapping binding site for gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF/KLF4) and Sp1. GKLF has a higher binding affinity and is the predominant binding factor in cells with low Sp-1 protein levels. Pancreatic acinar cells normally do not express K19, but overexpression of GKLF and Sp1 in these cells leads to aberrant expression, similar to what is observed in pancreatic cancer. These results demonstrate the functional interaction of ubiquitous and tissue-restricted transcription factors in determining tissue- and neoplasm-specific patterns of gene expression.

Keratin proteins can be further subdivided in two different types, the acidic type I (K9–20)1 and basic type II (K1–8) keratins (1Jorcano J.L. Rieger M. Franz J.K. Schiller D.L. Moll R. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 257-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Quinlan R.A. Schiller D.L. Hatzfeld M. Achtstatter T. Moll R. Jorcano J.L. Magin T.M. Franke W.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Genomics. 1991; 9: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). There is at least one pair of acidic and basic keratins expressed as heterodimers in any given epithelial tissue throughout development and differentiation. For example, in stratified epithelia, basal cells are characterized by the expression of K5 with K14/K15. Upon differentiation, stratified keratinizing epithelia express K1 and K10, whereas nonkeratinizing stratified epithelia (e.g. the human esophagus) express K4 and K13. Simple epithelia express K8 and K18 (4Nadeau J.H. Berger F.G. Cox D.R. Crosby J.L. Davisson M.T. Ferrara D. Fuchs E. Hart C. Hunihan L. Lalley P.A. et al.Genomics. 1989; 5: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Regulation of keratin expression in the differentiating stratified squamous epithelium is orchestrated by a complex interplay of both ubiquitous and tissue-specific transcription factors (5Byrne C. Tainsky M. Fuchs E. Development. 1994; 120: 2369-2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Eckert R.L. Welter J.F. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms provides insights into the normal program of differentiation, as well as dedifferentiation, during malignant transformation. Moreover, possible progenitor stem cells can be potentially identified or defined by studying keratin gene expression (7Jones P.H. Harper S. Watt F.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), as exemplified by the hair follicle. The most striking exception to the keratin-pair rule is the smallest known acidic keratin, namely K19. K19 has no known basic type II keratin partner, although its expression is often found in cells that express K8 (2Quinlan R.A. Schiller D.L. Hatzfeld M. Achtstatter T. Moll R. Jorcano J.L. Magin T.M. Franke W.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 455: 282-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 8Sun T.T. Tseng S.C. Huang A.J. Cooper D. Schermer A. Lynch M.H. Weiss R. Eichner R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 455: 307-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). K19 has the highly conserved α-helical central domain that is essential for filament formation. However, this keratin lacks the C-terminal nonhelical “tail domain” present in other acidic keratins. K19 is fully competent in filament formation with a basic keratin partner in vitro, although these complexes are unstable (9Fradette J. Germain L. Seshaiah P. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, in some tissues, K19 can substitute for K18, the usual partner of K8 (10Baribault H. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1675-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In K18 knockout mice, K19 compensates for the loss of K18 expression (11Magin T.M. Schroder R. Leitgeb S. Wanninger F. Zatloukal K. Grund C. Melton D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Stasiak et al. (12Stasiak P.C. Purkis P.E. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that K19 might act as “neutral” keratin in terms of differentiation. By dimerization with any early synthesized basic type II keratin and with resulting delayed expression of the usual type I keratin partner, a cell could be held in a “flexible state of differentiation” (12Stasiak P.C. Purkis P.E. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human K19 gene was sequenced by Bader et al. (13Bader B.L. Magin T.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10058Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the gene localizes to chromosome 17q21-q22 (15Bader B.L. Jahn L. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 47: 300-319PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ceratto N. Dobkin C. Carter M. Jenkins E. Yao X.L. Cassiman J.J. Aly M.S. Bosco P. Leube R. Langbein L. Feo S. Romano V. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 77: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The murine K19 gene shows high homology to its human counterpart (17Lussier M. Filion M. Compton J.G. Nadeau J.H. Lapointe L. Royal A. Gene. 1990; 95: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the gene is located in the acidic keratin cluster on mouse chromosome 11 (17Lussier M. Filion M. Compton J.G.

Genomics. 1994; 24: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Precursor cells in different tissues display high K19 levels, and upon differentiation, K19 expression is epithelial cell-specific. For example, in the developing pancreas, duct-like precursor cells harbor high K19 expression. After these precursor cells transdifferentiate into endo- and exocrine compartments, K19 expression resides predominantly in ductal epithelial cells, whereas islet cells show markedly decreased K19 expression, and acinar cells are K19 negative (19Bouwens L. Lu W.G. De Krijger R. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Likewise, the fetal liver shows high K19 expression. Upon differentiation, hepatocytes lose expression of K19, whereas its expression is retained in bile ducts (20Stosiek P. Kasper M. Karsten U. Liver. 1990; 10: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sites of K19 expression in the human adult include the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and colon. In the human skin, K19 expression is limited to a small portion of cells in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle, but no expression is evident in the interfollicular suprabasal epidermis (12Stasiak P.C. Purkis P.E. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These K19-positive cells in the hair follicle demonstrate features of slow-cycling cells and may represent stem cells (21Michel M. Torok N. Godbout M.J. Lussier M. Gaudreau P. Royal A. Germain L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1017-1028PubMed Google Scholar). Many premalignant and malignant tissues display K19 expression, such as dysplasia and carcinoma of squamous epithelia and adenocarcinoma of the lung, breast, pancreas, stomach and colon (22Bartek J. Bartkova J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Rejthar A. Kovarik J. Lukas Z. Vojtesek B. Histochem. J. 1986; 18: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Little is known about the regulation of K19 expression. We hypothesized that the transcriptional regulation of K19 is important in understanding differentiation programs in different cell types, namely squamous epithelial and pancreatic ductal cells, and that differences may arise from the manner in which K19 is regulated by different transcriptional factors. In this study, we describe the tissue-specific activity and regulation of a 5′ 2.0-kb fragment flanking the K19 gene. We have identified a critical element that is an important determinant of basal transcription of this gene and is involved in its tissue-specific expression. The interplay between gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF/KLF4) and Sp1 modulates K19 promoter activity through this cis-regulatory element and contributes to tissue specificity of K19 expression. In particular, GKLF regulates K19 expression in pancreatic ductal, but not acinar, cells, whereas GKLF and Sp1 cooperate to modulate K19 expression in esophageal squamous epithelial cells. T.T, TE-12, Hs766T, Panc-1, Capan-2, ARIP, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC) were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C as subconfluent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine (all reagents obtained from Sigma). AR42J cells (ATCC) were grown in Ham's F-12K medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum. Experiments were carried out in the log phase of growth after the cells were seeded for 24 h. For luciferase reporter gene assays, transient transfection of cells was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (5′-3′, Inc.). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/35-mm well and transfected 24 h later. Per 35-mm well, 0.5–2 μg of the respective K19 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were transfected. The transfectant mixture consisted of a 250-μl solution of 125 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.05), 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 6 mmglucose. After 12 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline followed by exchange with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as above. AR42J and ARIP cells were transfected using the lipsomal DNA transfer technique. After an attachment period of 12 h, cells were incubated with 800 μl of the transfection mixture containing 0.5–2.0 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE reagents in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated for 5 h, followed by exchange with fresh media supplemented with fetal calf serum. For cotransfection studies, 1 μg of either Sp1 or GKLF expression vector were used. 48 h after the start of transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 250 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity of 100 μl of cell lysate was determined using 100 μl of luciferase reagent (Promega) by measurement of relative luciferase units in a luminometer (MLX microtiter plate luminometer, Dynex Technologies). All controls were performed using the same amount of DNA of the respective empty vector. Transfection efficiency was routinely monitored by transfection with 1 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase in each set of experiments. Luciferase activity was determined, and the results of luciferase activity for each subset of experiment were corrected accordingly. Transfections were performed in triplicate, and the results of at least three independent experiments were calculated as the mean ± S.E. values for luciferase activity. A 2.0-kb BamHI fragment containing the 5′ regulatory region of the mouse K19 gene (17Lussier M. Filion M. Compton J.G. Nadeau J.H. Lapointe L. Royal A. Gene. 1990; 95: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Two different clones were independently sequenced in sense and antisense direction using vector-specific primers. In addition, four additional internal primers were designed to obtain the complete sequence (Table I). Results were aligned and compared for both clones, and the complete –1970 to +46 K19 DNA sequence established. Sequencing was performed by the dye terminator cycle sequencing method (ABI) in the automated DNA sequencing facility of the University of Pennsylvania.Table ISequences of K19 promoter-specific primersPrimerNucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′)Sequencing primers K19 INT1 5′GAG TCC TTC TAC CAC TGA TTC K19 INT2 3′CTT AGA AAT CAC ACC CCT CTG K19 INT3 5′TGA AGA CAA GAG GAC TGA CTT K19 INT4 3′CAG AGT GGG ACA TCT TCA TAAK19 promoter deletion primers K19–1970 5′CGG GGT ACC AAG TTC CTT TCT AAG ACC CA K19–960 5′CGG GGT ACC GAA TTG TTG CAC TGC AGG CT K19–654 5′CGG GGT ACC AGG GAA GGG TGG AGG TGT CTT K19–288 5′CGG GGT ACC GAA GTT AGA GTT GTC TAA GC K19–181 5′CGG GGT ACC AAG GAC TGA GAC CTC TGG CT K19–102 5′CGG GGT ACC ATA TTT GCA CTC TGG GAG CTT K19–58 5′CGG GGT ACC TCA ACA TCT CCA TCC CCC TT K19+46 3′AGG GAG CTC GGA AAA AGG GAC GCA GGT CTSp1 binding site mutant primers and oligonucleotides K19-Sp1–198 MT 5′AGT GGG CTG G TT CGG GGC AGC TCT GGG AA K19-Sp1–198 MT 3′AGA GCT GCC CCG AA C CAG CCC ACT CCA AAG K19-Sp1–62 MT 5′GGA AAT TTC TGA TAC CCG AA C CTT CAA CAT K19-Sp1–62 MT 3′GGA GAT GTT GAA GG T T CG GGT ATC AGA AAT K19-Sp1–33 MT 5′ATC CCC CTT CCC G AA CCG GGC ATA AAA AG K19-Sp1–33 MT 3′TTT TAT GCC CGG TT C GGG AAG GGG GAT GGK19–81 to –48 wild-type oligonucleotides K19–81 WT 5′GGA AAT TTC TGA TAC CCG CCC CTT CAA CAT K19–48 WT 3′GGA GAT GTT GAA GGG GCG GGT ATC AGA AATGATA binding site mutant oligonucleotides K19-GATA-71 MT 5′GGA AAT TTC T CT TAC CCG CCC CTT CAA CAT K19-GATA-71 MT 3′GGA GAT GTT GAA GGG GCG GGT A AG AGA AATGKLF binding site mutant primers and oligonucleotides K19-GKLF-58 MT1 5′GGA AAT TTC TGA TAC CCG CC A A TT CAA CAT K19-GKLF-58 MT1 3′GGA GAT GTT GAA TT G GCG GGT ATC AGA AAT K19-GKLF-58 MT2 5′GGA AAT TTC TGA TAC CCG CCC C GG CAA CAT K19-GKLF-58 MT2 3′GGA GAT GTT G CC GGG GCG GGT ATC AGA AATNucleotides in boldface represent the mutated nucleotides (MT) compared to the wild-type sequence (WT).

The –1970+46 K19 luciferase reporter vector, designated K19–1970, was constructed by PCR amplification of the DNA using the K19-pcDNA3.1 plasmid as template. For directional subcloning of the PCR product into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 basic (Promega), KpnI and SacI restriction enzyme sites were generated using the K19–1970 5′-primer and K19+46 3′-primer, respectively (Table I). Serial deletions, designated K19–960, K19–654, K19–288, K19–181, K19–102, and K19–58, were accordingly generated by combining the respective 5′-primer (Table I) and the K19+46 3′-primer. The PCR was performed using 20 ng of plasmid DNA, 200 μm each dNTP, 0.5 μm each primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a 1× reaction buffer provided by the manufacturer. After an initial 60-s denaturation step at 94 °C, 30 cycles of amplification were done as follows: denaturation, 60 s at 94 °C; annealing, 60 s at 60 °C; extension, 2 min at 72 °C, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. For all constructs, a single PCR product of the expected size was generated. The PCR products and pGL3 basic vector were digested with KpnI and SacI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs), agarose gel-purified (Qiagen), and ligated with T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). All constructs were subjected to confirmatory DNA sequencing. The plasmids were purified by a modified alkaline lysis method (Qiagen). Mutations of the Sp1 sites at –198, –62, and –33 and GKLF site mutants (MT1 and MT2) at position –58 in the full-length K19 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlap extension PCR (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotide primers (Table I) containing the mutated nucleotide sequence were designed to generate two PCR fragments having overlapping ends in a primary amplification reaction. In this first step, wild-type K19–1970+46 cDNA was used as template. The first PCR amplification step of each mutant required the outer K19–1970 5′-primer and the respective internal mutant 3′-primer to generate one PCR fragment. The second PCR fragment was generated using the respective internal mutant 5′-primer and the outer K19+46 3′-primer. The PCR products for each mutant in this first amplification step were gel purified (Qiagen) and combined in a subsequent “fusion” PCR. The overlapping ends of these fragments anneal and serve as template and as primer for the second amplification reaction. Using the outer K19–1970 5′-primer and the K19+46 3′-primer, the different mutated full-length K19 promoter fragments were generated. PCR components and amplification conditions for first and second steps were the same as described above. The mutated full-length K19 promoter fragments were then subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector as outlined above. All constructs were subjected to confirmatory sequencing. Construction of the expression vectors containing human GKLF and Sp1 cDNAs was described previously. Briefly, the cDNA of human GKLF was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 HIS (Invitrogen) (24Jenkins T.D. Opitz O.G. Okano J. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10747-10754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A 4.0-kb XbaI fragment containing the cDNA of human Sp1 was obtained form the pEVR2-Sp1 vector (25Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). K19, Sp1, and GKLF protein expression was determined using lysates from subconfluent cell cultures. For the preparation of total cell lysates, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, detached from culture dishes with a plastic cell scraper, and resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% aprotinin (Sigma). 10 μg of total protein from each sample was separated on a 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the protein was transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.). After transfer, membranes were stained with 0.1% Ponceau S solution (Sigma) to confirm equal loading of proteins. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h. The mouse monoclonal anti-keratin 19 antibody (Sigma) and the rabbit GKLF anti-serum (provided by V. Yang) were used at a 1:2000 dilution in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. A polyclonal rabbit anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used in a 1:1000 dilution in the same solution. Secondary antibody, either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was used at a 1:4000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected with a chemiluminescence system (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts from different cell lines were prepared as described by Schreiber et al. (26Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) except that the buffers were supplemented with a mixture of 0.5 μg/ml protease inhibitors (aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 5 μg of nuclear protein extracts was used as determined by a colorimetric protein method (Bio-Rad protein assay). Oligonucleotide DNA probes were synthesized by the phosphoramidite procedure (Integrated DNA Technologies), purified by gel electrophoresis, and annealed. 5 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides was radiolabeled with α-32P. Radiolabeling was done by a Klenow fill-in reaction in a buffer consisting of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 33 μm dATP, 33 μm dGTP, 33 μm dTTP, 0.33 μm[α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products), and 1 unit of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EMSAs were carried out by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extract with 5 fmol of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe (20,000 cpm) in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the samples were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide, 0.25× Tris borate gel and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 2 h. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) at 80 °C for 1–12 h. For competition experiments, the nuclear extract was co-incubated with a 100× excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. Sequences of wild-type and mutated oligonucleotides are summarized in TableII. Immune supershift assays were performed using the Sp1 and GKLF antibodies. The antibody was preincubated with the nuclear extract at room temperature for 15 min prior to the addition of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe. Generation and purification of recombinant GKLF protein was described previously (24Jenkins T.D. Opitz O.G. Okano J. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10747-10754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recombinant Sp1 protein was obtained from Promega.

Royal A. Gene. 1990; 95: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was completely sequenced. Using overlapping internal primers, the sequence was confirmed for two independent clones containing this fragment (GenBankTM accession number AF237661). The proximal 350 base pairs correspond to the published sequence containing the ATA box and putative transcription start site (GenBankTMaccession number M316120) (17Lussier M. Filion M. Compton J.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) reveals several potential cis-regulatory elements, including several AP-1 and ets factor binding sites, previously shown to regulate expression for other keratins. Of particular interest, there are three canonical Sp1 sites at –198, –62, and –33 bp, two of which (–198 and –62) are also conserved in the human K19 gene (15Bader B.L. Jahn L. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 47: 300-319PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lussier M. Filion M. Compton J.G. Nadeau J.H. Lapointe L. Royal A. Gene. 1990; 95: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The full-length K19 (–1970+46) fragment was subcloned into the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector. After transient transfection of a panel of different cell lines, K19 promoter activity was determined, and a dose-response curve was established for each cell line (Fig. 1 A). K19 promoter activity also correlated with expression of the endogenous K19 protein (Fig. 1 B). As a model for simple epithelia, we focused on a panel of pancreatic cancer lines of different origin with a well characterized keratin expression profile (28Rosewicz S. Stier U. Brembeck F.

Cell lines with a ductal origin (Panc-1 and Capan-2) demonstrated the highest K19 promoter activity, consistent with the observation of high K19 protein expression in these (Fig.1). Hs766T, representing an undifferentiated pancreatic cancer cell line, demonstrated low but dose-dependent K19 promoter activity. In contrast, pancreatic cancers cells of acinar origin (AR42J and ARIP) had little, if any, reporter gene activity, which corresponded to the absence of endogenous K19 protein expression (Fig.1). These results, in the aggregate, support the notion that K19 plays a more important in the regulation of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells than pancreatic acinar cells. As a model for the stratified squamous epithelium, we examined two esophageal cancer cell lines, T.T and TE-12. Both cell lines displayed a dose-dependent K19 promoter reporter gene activity (Fig.1 A) with evidence of endogenous K19 protein (Fig.1 B). This result is consistent with the expression of K19 in normal and malignant human esophageal cells. 3T3 fibroblasts served as a negative control because they do not harbor K19 promoter activity or protein expression. In order to determine the localization of important cis-regulatory elements within the K19 promoter, we constructed serial deletions of the K19 promoter at –960, –654, –288, –181, –102, and –58 bp that were designed to not disrupt putative cis-regulatory elements based upon computer analysis. These constructs were generated by PCR using the full-length promoter as template and subcloned into the luciferase reporter system. The activity of these deletion constructs was tested in TE-12 and Panc-1 cells as models for stratified and simple epithelia, respectively (Fig. 2). Both cell lines displayed a similar pattern of promoter activity. High level K19 promoter activity was observed using the –960, –654, and –288 deletion constructs. This was followed by a significant reduction of approximately 50% in TE-12 and 70% in Panc-1 cells at –181. At –102, activity was further decreased about 50% in both cell lines. At –58 bp, almost no activity was found. Thus, the region critical for K19 expression resides between –58 and –288 bp. Of note, two canonical Sp1 DNA binding sites are located in within this region, one in the plus strand at –198 and another in the minus strand at –62; of note, another Sp1 DNA binding site is located at –33 bp. We next analyzed whether these Sp1 DNA binding motifs could participate in the regulation of basal K19 promoter activity, especially because Sp1 is known to modulate the expression of other keratins (6Eckert R.L.

Previous findings indicate that PPARγ2 transcription is regulated by members of the C/EBP family. We demonstrate here that C/EBPα and C/EBPδ, but not C/EBPβ, induce the activity of the PPARγ2 promoter in transiently transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and bind to two juxtaposed low affinity C/EBP binding sites. Results obtained with chimeras containing interchanged C/EBPα-C/EBPβ N-terminal transactivation domain and C-terminal DNA binding dimerization domain indicate that the N-terminal part of C/EBPβ prevents it from binding to the PPARγ2 promoter. Indeed, deletion mutants of C/EBPβ lacking the N-terminal part of the molecule are able to bind to the PPARγ2 promoter. We further demonstrate that deletion of a region located between amino acids 184–212, upstream of the DNA binding domain, permits C/EBPβ binding to the PPARγ2 promoter, implicating an inhibitory region in C/EBPβ for modulating DNA binding specificity to the PPARγ2 promoter. In summary, this study indicates that C/EBPβ but not C/EBPα or C/EBPδ is unable to bind to C/EBP binding sites in the mouse PPARγ2 promoter. The lack of binding is due to a region N-terminal of the C/EBPβ DNA binding domain.

Obesity is a serious problem for humans in industrialized countries and a contributing factor for several diseases including type II diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and atherosclerosis (1Grundy S.M. Barnett J.P. Dis. Mon. 1990; 36: 641-731PubMed Google Scholar). It results from an excessive accumulation of white adipose tissue, composed of adipocytes, which play a central role in energy storage and release of lipid metabolites. Among the factors orchestrating adipocyte differentiation, the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)1 and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) are two key transcription factors (2Spiegelman B.M.

PPARγ has received considerable attention because of the fact that PPARγ synthetic ligands, such as thiazoladinedione, are potent insulin-sensitizing drugs administrated to type II diabetic patients (2Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Two PPARγ isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, are expressed in different tissues; the latter is reported to be restricted to adipose tissue and mammary glands (4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I.

Compared with PPARγ1, PPARγ2 contains an additional N-terminal region composed of 30 amino acids, and distinct promoters regulate the expression of these two isoforms (5Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.-M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.-C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

C/EBPs are expressed in a number of tissues and are involved in the regulation of several biological processes such as acute phase response, inflammatory and immune response, cell proliferation and differentiation, and control of energy metabolism (7Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 8Poli V. J. Biol.

C/EBP family members display highly similar C-terminal basic DNA binding domains and leucine zipper dimerization domains but exhibit different N-terminal regions containing the activation domains. Consequently, the various C/EBP proteins form both homodimers and heterodimers and bind to a common DNA consensus sequence (7Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression is regulated at the translational level via a leaky ribosome scanning mechanism. The C/EBPα mRNA is translated to 42- and 30-kDa proteins, both of which are activators that differ in their transcriptional potencies (10Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Translation of the C/EBPβ mRNA generates three different products: two transactivator proteins of 35 and 32 kDa called LAP1 and LAP2 (liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein 1 and 2) and a dominant negative form of 20 kDa called LIP (liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein). The inhibitory activity results from the deletion of the transactivation domain in the 151 amino acids of the N-terminal region, which is truncated in LIP. Homodimers or heterodimers containing LIP bind to C/EBP binding sites but are transcriptionally inactive (11Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). In addition, some C/EBP family members act as inhibitors; C/EBPζ (also called CHOP and GADD153) harbors a dimerization domain but not a functional DNA binding domain. Consequently, homodimers and heterodimers containing C/EBPζ fail to bind C/EBP binding sites (12Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The cell type specificity of C/EBP-regulated gene expression is thought to result from the tissue-restricted and temporal expression of a family member and combinatorial interactions with other transcription factors or coactivators (13Lee Y.-H.

Several extracellular signaling pathways can regulate the activity of C/EBPs, especially C/EBPβ, through the activation of different kinases and the subsequent phosphorylation of C/EBPs (9Darlington G.J.

In summary, the regulation of C/EBP activity is complex and integrates a network of specific protein expression and signal transduction pathways. PPARγ and C/EBPs are significantly elevated during adipocyte differentiation. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expression is transient and precedes the expression during terminal differentiation of C/EBPα and PPARγ, which act cooperatively to complete adipogenesis (2Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 3Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

C/EBPα and C/EBPδ transactivate the mouse PPARγ2 promoter via sites located at positions −340 bp and −327 bp relative to the transcriptional start site (24Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Shi X.M. Blair H.C. Yang X. McDonald J.M. Cao X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but no data has been shown to support a transactivation effect of C/EBPβ on the mouse PPARγ2 promoter. We investigate here the transcriptional activity of various C/EBP isoforms on the mouse PPARγ2 promoter and demonstrate that in contrast to C/EBPα and C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ is unable to bind to C/EBP binding sequences and to stimulate PPARγ2 promoter activity. Cloning of the mouse PPARγ2 promoter into the p19 luciferase vector and different C/EBPs into pEFbos vector have been described previously (24Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The human p21WAF1/CIP1gene promoter linked to the luciferase reporter vector was provided by Dr. M. Liu (26Liu M. Iavarone A. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31723-31728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Full-length murine coding sequences from the following vectors were excised with the restriction enzymes indicated: C/EBPα (EcoRI/HindIII fragment from MSV/C/EBP), C/EBPβ (EcoRI/BamHI from MSV/C/EBPβ), and C/EBPδ (EcoRI/BamHI from MSV/C/EBPδ) (vectors were provided by Dr. S. L. McKnight) (7Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Each fragment was subcloned into the polylinker site of pSVSPORT 1 expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) and pBluescript II KS (pKS) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The two C/EBPα-C/EBPβ hybrids were generated by excision of XcmI/HindIII fragments from pSVSPORT1 C/EBPα and pSVSPORT1 C/EBPβ, and the C/EBPα and C/EBPβ fragments were ligated in the C/EBPβ and C/EBPα vectors excised with XcmI/HindIII, respectively. Internal deletion constructs (pMEXCRP2Δ163–191, Δ116–191) were originally generated as published as the second translation form of C/EBP (27Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. P. F. Johnson. ANcoI/PstI fragment of the coding sequences containing the internal deletion were inserted into pKS C/EBPβ excised with NcoI/PstI. The numbering system used hereafter refers to the full-length C/EBPβ isoform (Δ184–212C/EBPβ, Δ137–212C/EBPβ). A Kozak sequence (referred to as KOZ) was generated around the first ATG of the coding sequence by replacing the EcoRI/SphI fragments of pKS C/EBPβ, pKS Δ184–212C/EBPβ, and pKS Δ137–212C/EBPβ with a double-stranded oligonucleotide flanked byEcoRI/SphI restriction sites (the sense primer: 5′-AATTCCACCATGGACCGCCTGCTGGCCTGGGACGCAGCATG-3′). The coding sequences were then isolated as EcoRI/XbaI fragments and inserted into pSVSPORT1. N152C/EBPβ was generated by replacing an Asp-718/NcoI fragment from pKS C/EBPβ and replacing it with a double-stranded oligonucleotide flanked by Asp718/NcoI sites (the sense primer: 5′-GTACCGAATTCCAC-3′). The coding sequence isolated as anAsp718/XbaI fragment was inserted into pSVSPORT1. KOZ-N208 and KOZ-N213 C/EBPβ (the latter containing two additional amino acids, A and K, at the N terminus) were generated by deletion of the EcoRI/XcmI fragment in pKS C/EBPβ and replacing this fragment with double-stranded oligonucleotides flanked by restriction sites EcoRI/XcmI. The sense oligonucleotides were 5′-AATTCCACCATGGCGCCCGCCAAGGCCAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCACCATGGCGCCCGCCCAAGGCCAAGGCCAAGAAG-3′ for KOZ-N213 and KOZ-N208, respectively. KOZ-N202 and KOZ-N191 C/EBPβ were generated by deletion of an EcoRI/KasI fragment of pSVSPORT1 KOZ-N208C/EBPβ and replacement of this fragment with double-stranded oligonucleotides ended withEcoRI/KasI restriction sites. The sense oligonucleotides were 5′-AATTCCACCATGGCGGGGCCGCCGGCG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCACCATGGCCGACGCCAAGGCCGCGCCCGCCGCCTGCTTCGCGGGGCCGCCGGCG-3′ for KOZ-N202 and KOZ-N191C/EBPβ, respectively. All the constructs were restriction-mapped, and constructs containing synthesized oligodeoxynucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) were sequenced. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies used for Western blot analysis and supershift assays were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody references are 14AA, C19, and C22 for C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ, respectively, except that in Fig. 5 Δ198 was used as a C/EBPβ antibody. Preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells (105 cells/well in 6-well plates) were transiently transfected with 100 ng of PPARγ2 or p21 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs and 50 ng of each expression construct or empty vector, as a control. The transfection assays, using an adenovirus system, and the luciferase assays were performed as described previously (28Krishnan V. Elberg G. Tsai M.-J. Tsai S.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Expression of the various C/EBP constructs cloned in pSVSPORT1 was performed in COS-1 cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) transiently transfected using diethylaminoethyl-dextran. The transfection and preparation of the COS-1 whole cell extracts was performed as described (29Busch K. Martin B. Baniahmad A. Renkawitz R. Muller M. Mol.

One μg of protein from each transfected cell extract was loaded and fractionated on 12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted on nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoreacted using different C/EBP antibodies. Detection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-1 cell extracts overexpressing different C/EBP constructs were used for this assay. The probes, which were double-stranded oligonucleotides, were end-labeled with radioactive [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP and purified on a Sephadex G25 column.

The reaction buffer at a final volume of 12 μl contained 3.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70mm KCl, 3.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.07% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (molecular biology grade), 1 μg poly dIdC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 100 ng of shredded salmon sperm DNA (molecular biology grade). The protein-DNA complexes were separated on non-denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel at 190 V for 3h at 4 °C in TBE buffer (80 mm Tris-borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The gels were dried and submitted for autoradiography (12–30 h). In the experiments presented in Figs. 5, 7, and 8, 0.5% (w/v) 3-([(3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate (Sigma) was added to the reaction buffer to reduce nonspecific binding.Figure 7Binding activity of C/EBP β truncated proteins containing the C-terminal DNA binding domain and the dimerization domain of C/EBP β.

Fig. 1 shows that C/EBPα and C/EBPδ transactivate the PPARγ2 promoter by 4- and 7-fold, respectively. In contrast, C/EBPβ inhibits the basal promoter activity by approximately 70%. As a control for C/EBPβ inhibitory action, the cells were cotransfected with p21 promoter/luciferase gene, a known target gene promoter for both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ (23Chinery R. Brockman J.A.

Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2008-2014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stimulated the activity of the p21 promoter (Fig. 1). These experiments demonstrate that C/EBPβ is unable to activate the PPARγ2 promoter. We further investigated the modulating function of different C/EBPβ isoforms on PPARγ2 promoter activity. The expression of the LAP1 isoform of C/EBPβ was enhanced by the insertion of a Kozak sequence around the first start codon as described previously (11Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), whereas LIP was generated by deletion of the coding sequence for the 151 N-terminal amino acids. The different C/EBPβ constructs were cotransfected with the PPARγ2 promoter-luciferase vector in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The expression of different forms of protein products was detected by an immunoblot analysis of the cell extracts, using a C/EBPβ antibody. Fig. 2 A shows that the C/EBPβ construct induced the synthesis of 35- and 32-kDa proteins, corresponding to the molecular masses of LAP1 and LAP2, respectively. The insertion of the Kozak sequence in the C/EBPβ construct induced the production of LAP1, whereas the LIP construct generated a 17-kDa protein. LIP expression was undetectable in the cells transfected with full-length C/EBPβ constructs. The luciferase activity in these cell extracts demonstrated that full-length C/EBPβ (LAP1), the mixture of LAP1 and LAP2, or the truncated form of C/EBPβ (LIP) failed to stimulate PPARγ2 promoter activity. In contrast, the activator protein LAP1 or the mixture of LAP1 and LAP2, but not LIP, activated the p21 promoter (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that the inhibitory activity of C/EBPβ on the PPARγ2 promoter is not mediated by preferential production of the dominant negative form of C/EBPβ, LIP. Instead, the full-length C/EBPβ is unable to activate the mouse PPARγ2 promoter, unlike the activity displayed by C/EBPα and C/EBPδ. To further examine the mechanism involved in the differential activation of the PPARγ2 promoter by C/EBP, we analyzed C/EBP binding to previously identified binding sites on the PPARγ2 promoter (24Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These binding sites are composed of a core of two C/EBP half-sites (GCAAT). As a control, the sequence on the PPARγ2 promoter was mutated to form two adjacent C/EBP consensus binding sequences (TTGCGCAAT), created by changing the 5′ flanking sequences adjacent to the core C/EBP recognition element (31Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6919-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). C/EBP proteins were produced in COS-1 cells by transfection of various C/EBP constructs. The expression of the different C/EBPs in the cell extracts was analyzed by Western blot and detected using C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ antibodies (Fig.3 A). C/EBP expression was not detectable in the control extract, consistent with the specific overexpression of different C/EBPs in the transfected cells. Binding analysis by a gel shift assay using C/EBP binding sites on the PPARγ2 promoter as a probe showed that C/EBPα and C/EBPδ, but not C/EBPβ, were able to bind to the C/EBP binding sites. As a positive control, we demonstrate that all three C/EBPs bind to the C/EBP consensus binding sequence with high efficacy. Addition of different C/EBP antibodies selective for each of the C/EBPs resulted in a supershift (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that C/EBP family members exhibit differential binding abilities to the non-consensus C/EBP binding sites on the PPARγ2 promoter and subsequently demonstrate different transactivation activities. We further characterized the binding activity of the various C/EBPs to the binding sites on the PPARγ2 promoter in comparison to the consensus sequence. The binding of radiolabeled oligonucleotides was studied in the presence of increasing concentrations of different non-labeled oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig.4, the binding of C/EBPα and C/EBPδ to the radiolabeled C/EBP binding sites on the PPARγ2 promoter was competed at high concentrations of the homologous competitor (IC50 = 105 ± 35 and 200 ± 50 nm, respectively). In comparison, a consensus C/EBP binding sequence competed at lower concentrations (IC50 = 1.65 ± 0.15 and 0.45 ± 0.15 nm for C/EBPα and C/EBPδ, respectively). The binding of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ to the radiolabeled consensus sequence was competed by the homologous non-labeled oligonucleotide (IC50 = 7.8 ± 2.4, 0.25 ± 0.1, and 1.3 ± 0.3 nm, respectively) but was hardly affected by non-labeled PPARγ2 promoter oligonucleotide, even at high concentrations. These results indicate that the C/EBP binding sites on the PPARγ2 promoter display a much lower binding affinity as compared with the consensus sequence. Because C/EBPβ fails to bind to PPARγ2 promoter binding sites and inhibits the basal activity of the PPARγ2 promoter, we assumed that C/EBPβ competed for endogenous C/EBPα or C/EBPδ homo/heterodimers binding by producing inactive C/EBPα/β or C/EBPβ/δ heterodimers. Fig.5 A shows the effect of different combinations of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ expression on the transactivation of the mouse PPARγ2 promoter linked to the luciferase gene. C/EBPα and C/EBPδ activated the promoter 3.6 ± 1.4- and 14.1 ± 3.0-fold, respectively, and the combination of C/EBPα and C/EBPδ activated the promoter 3.3 ± 0.7-fold. The combination of C/EBPα or C/EBPδ expressed with C/EBPβ did not transactivate PPARγ2 promoter over the basal promoter activity (1.6 ± 0.5- and 1.5 ± 0.6-fold activation, respectively). These results suggest that C/EBP heterodimers exhibited the activity of the less active member. The combination of C/EBPβ with other C/EBP members showed higher activity than C/EBPβ alone. It is possible that the homodimer fraction of the other C/EBP was present and that C/EBPβ was not in excess, preventing it from heterodimerizing with endogenous C/EBPs. However, C/EBPβ abolished the activity of both C/EBPα and C/EBPδ. To further investigate whether heterodimers bind to the C/EBP binding sequence, we performed a gel shift experiment in which the different combinations of C/EBPs were expressed in COS cells and were supershifted by different C/EBP antibodies, allowing the identification of the species bound to the oligonucleotides. Fig.5 B shows that the different C/EBPs bound to the consensus sequence were specifically supershifted by their specific antibody, with no cross-reactivity of the selective antibodies with the other C/EBP members. C/EBPδ antibody showed a poor supershift ability compared with the other antibodies but instead completely inhibited the C/EBPδ binding. Fig. 5, C and D demonstrates the formation of heterodimers when two different C/EBP members were coexpressed. Fig. 5 C shows the binding of the different C/EBP combinations to the non-consensus C/EBP binding sequence, and Fig. 5 D shows the binding to the consensus sequence. The binding to the consensus sequence showed that heterodimers were formed, and their binding was supershifted by the antibodies selective for each of the C/EBP members present in the heterodimer. The binding of C/EBPα-C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ-C/EBPδ mixtures was totally supershifted with C/EBPα antibody, consistent with the fact that C/EBPα was expressed in relative excess, forming a homodimer. In contrast, heterodimers containing C/EBPβ did not bind to the non-consensus sequence as illustrated by the fact that C/EBPβ antibody was unable to supershift the binding of C/EBPs on the non-consensus sequence (Fig. 5 C). These results demonstrat"
https://openalex.org/W1978234864,"GATA-1 and other vertebrate GATA factors contain a DNA binding domain composed of two adjacent homologous zinc fingers. Whereas only the C-terminal finger of GATA-1 is capable of independent binding to the GATA recognition sequence, double GATA sites that require both fingers for high affinity interaction are found in several genes. We propose a mechanism whereby adjacent zinc fingers interact to influence the binding and transactivation properties of GATA-1 at a subset of DNA-binding sites. By using two such double GATA sites we demonstrate that the N-terminal finger and adjacent linker region can alter the binding specificity of the C-terminal finger sufficiently to prevent it from recognizing some consensus GATA sequences. Therefore, the two zinc fingers form a composite binding domain having a different DNA binding specificity from that shown by the constituent single C-terminal finger. Furthermore, we compare two of these double sites and show that high affinity binding of GATA-1 to a reporter gene does not necessarily induce transactivation, namely the sequence of the DNA-binding site can alter the ability of GATA-1 to stimulate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2051993525,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is involved in multiple processes including cell growth and differentiation. In particular, TGF-β has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic lung diseases. In this study, we examined regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by TGF-β1 in primary human lung fibroblasts. TGF-β1 treatment resulted in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activation in a delayed manner, with maximal activity at 16 h. ERK activation occurred concomitantly with the induction of activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding, a nuclear factor required for activation of multiple genes involved in fibrosis. AP-1 binding was dependent on ERK activation, since the MEK-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitor PD98059 inhibited TGF-β1-induced binding. Induction of the receptor tyrosine kinase-linked growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) protein expression temporally paralleled the activation of ERK/AP-1. Induction of AP-1 by TGF-β1-conditioned medium was observed at 2 h, similar to AP-1 induction in response to exogenous bFGF. Dependence of ERK/AP-1 activation on bFGF induction was demonstrated by inhibition of TGF-β1-induced ERK/AP-1 activation when conditioned medium from TGF-β1-treated cells was incubated with bFGF-neutralizing antibody. Together, these results demonstrate that TGF-β1 regulates the autocrine induction of bFGF, resulting in activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and induction of AP-1 binding.

Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 544-597Crossref Scopus (2979) Google Scholar). In addition, it is of key biological importance in the pathogenesis of a number of disease states characterized by fibrosis and tumorigenesis (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 544-597Crossref Scopus (2979) Google Scholar, 3Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). All three isoforms of TGF-β are capable of binding to three types of receptors (TGF-β receptors I–III) (reviewed in Ref. 4Derynck R. Feng X.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Unlike the type III receptor, a betaglycan, phosphorylation of the type I and II receptors, which are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, is required for cellular responses to TGF-β and mediates TGF-β signal transduction. It has been suggested that differential signaling from the type I and II receptors mediates specific gene induction responses (4Derynck R. Feng X.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 5Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Fafeur V. O'Hara B.

Many of the mechanisms defined for TGF-β-induced postreceptor signaling has focused on early immediate signaling molecules such as Smads (8Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), members of the Src family of kinases (9Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) as well as members of the Rac-Ras family of GTPases (10Musci I. Skorecki K.L. Goldberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16567-16572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, most studies examining TGF-β signaling have been performed in immortalized or transformed cell lines. In contrast, the signaling mechanisms employed by TGF-β in primary cell cultures or in nontransformed cells are poorly understood. In fibrosis, although cell growth occurs, it is dysregulation of ECM synthesis favoring tissue repair that is the primary pathogenic process. Thus, when examining signaling mechanisms governing the pathogenesis of fibrosis, it may be more meaningful to do so in primary fibroblasts, where the main function is not dysregulated cell growth. TGF-β is a known activator of the AP-1 transcription factor, which is composed of homo- or heterodimers of Fos and Jun proteins. Many TGF-β responses are mediated by AP-1 (11Urı́a J.A. Jiménez M.G.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, TGF-β regulation of ECM deposition involves AP-1-dependent genes such as human collagenase types 1 and 3 (14Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3210) Google Scholar), the type I collagen gene, and the TGF-β gene itself. Interestingly, in cells that exhibit a positive proliferative response to TGF-β, the induction of AP-1-regulated c-jun and collagenase genes is delayed with the maximal response achieved following TGF-β treatment by 24 h (15Angel P. Karin M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proceedings of the Matrix Metalloproteinase Conference. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Karlsuhe, FRG1992: 156-164Google Scholar). Although AP-1 is known to mediate many of the cellular responses of TGF-β, the mechanisms controlling AP-1 induction by TGF-β are only partially understood. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are known regulators of AP-1 (reviewed in Ref. 16Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). In particular, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK-1p44mapk and ERK-2p42mapk) and the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) and p38 are involved in the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of AP-1 activity. TGF-β has been shown regulate several MAP kinase pathways, but the mode of activation appears to be highly variable and cell type-specific. TGF-β1 triggers a rapid 3–4-fold induction of ERK-1 activity in NIH 3T3 cells (10Musci I. Skorecki K.L. Goldberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16567-16572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Functionality of ERK-1 in regulation of gene expression was demonstrated in NIH 3T3 cells by transfection of a dominant negative ERK-1 mutant, which reduced TGF-β1 stimulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter activity by over one half (10Musci I. Skorecki K.L. Goldberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16567-16572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Other investigators have demonstrated rapid ERK activation by TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in untransformed intestinal epithelial cells (17Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, these cells required high doses of TGF-β and needed to be in the exponential phase of growth before exhibiting a response (17Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Induction of ERK-2 by TGF-β3 was also observed in breast carcinoma cells and implicated in the negative regulation of cell growth (18Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β has also been shown to have a role in the activation of both the JNK and p38 SAPK pathways, initially through the cloning of the upstream regulator TGF-β-activated kinase (19Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2001-2008Crossref Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have shown that TGF-β-regulated gene expression requires activation of transcription factors ATF-2 or c-Jun. Activation of these transcription factors and their target genes is dependent on the concomitant activation of either the JNK or p38 SAPK pathways (9Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C.

However, JNK can be activated in 15 min in human fibrosarcoma cells (22Hocevar B. Brown L.T. Howe P.H. EMBO. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in 12 h in 293T cells (23Zhou G. Lee S. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13133-13138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mechanism of activation is cell type-dependent. Nevertheless, rapid or slow JNK activation leads to AP-1-dependent gene activation. TGF-β has been implicated in a number of fibrotic diseases of the lung involving the pulmonary parenchyma (3Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). TGF-β induction of AP-1 regulates a number of genes that can disrupt the normal homeostasis of the ECM to promote fibrosis. However, as discussed, the regulation of AP-1 by TGF-β is poorly understood because the regulatory MAP kinase pathways controlling AP-1 activity have diverse responses to TGF-β, depending on the cell type. Therefore, to understand the role of MAP kinases in TGF-β1 responses in the human lung, we examined the regulation of AP-1 and upstream MAP kinase activation by TGF-β1 in primary human lung fibroblasts. Human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90, Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ (source: lung fibroblasts from still birth fetus at 40 weeks gestation)) were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 106cells/ml on 100-mm Petri dishes and grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Experiments were performed on cells that had undergone less than 40 doublings and no evidence of senescence by light microscopy. When cultures achieved 90–100% confluency, serum was withdrawn from the culture medium for 48 h (i.e.the time required to achieve a growth-arrested/quiescent state). Cells were treated with porcine platelet-derived TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) for increasing periods of time (0–24 h) in the absence of serum. Cell extracts were then prepared as outlined below. All experiments described below were performed at least in duplicate. Conditioned medium from TGF-β1-treated (16 h) IMR-90 cells was also used in some experiments to treat cultured human lung fibroblasts grown under identical conditions as described. Inhibitors used in these studies included the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem) and the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 (Calbiochem). Pretreatments were for 1 h at the doses indicated. For experiments involving the receptor inhibitor suramin (Sigma), cells were treated with 300 mm suramin for 1 h before and 4 h after treatment with TGF-β1. Cells were grown and treated with bFGF (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) (10 ng/ml) for similar time periods as the TGF-β1 treatments, and extracts were prepared as described below. For neutralizing antibody experiments, cultured fibroblasts were treated for 2 h with TGF-β1-treated conditioned medium in the presence or absence of polyclonal anti-human bFGF neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems). The dose used was 10 times the neutralizing dose (ND50) recommended by the manufacturer. Following cell treatments as described above, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by scraping, and centrifuged. Cell extracts were prepared by incubating cells suspended in 0.3 ml ofwhole cell extract lysis buffer at 4 °C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mmEGTA, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, and protein content was determined by the Bradford protein assay (26Bradford M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207427) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed by incubating 0.5 ng of the metallothionein IIa AP-1 site oligonucleotide (27Mendelson K.G.

Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with 3 μg of whole cell extract for 30 min at room temperature. Reaction products were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide, 0.25× TBE gel and electrophoresed at 350 V for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Gels were vacuum-dried, and autoradiography and semiquantitative densitometry were performed. MAP kinase activity was measured in immune complexes using myelin basic protein as the substrate (29Van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Lutrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sahue M. Lutrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed by binding 2 μg of ERK-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Repligen, Cambridge, MA) at room temperature for 30 min. 50 μg of protein from whole cell extracts was then added and gently rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitated immune complexes were then washed twice with Triton lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and once with kinase assay buffer/protease inhibitors (125 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The kinase reaction was performed by incubating the immune complexes with a 20-μl reaction mix containing 0.1 mg/ml of myelin basic protein (Sigma), 25 μm dATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then resolved by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and dried, and autoradiography was performed. Semiquantitative analysis was performed by ImageQuant software on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Data were expressed as degree of kinase activity relative to control. Whole cell lysates (50 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were soaked in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol) for 20 min at room temperature, and gel proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (wet transfer). The blot was blocked with TBST (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies to ERK-1, p38, JNK, bFGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-ERK, and phospho-p38 (New England Biolabs) at 4 °C overnight, washed three times with TBST, and incubated for 1 h with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Chemiluminescent signal was detected using ECL (NEN Life Science Products). Many of the key genes that promote degradation or repair of the extracellular matrix are regulated by AP-1. To determine whether TGF-β1 altered AP-1 activity in primary human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90), cells were treated for increasing time periods with TGF-β1, and cellular extracts were prepared. These extracts were analyzed for DNA binding to AP-1 using EMSA. Fig.1 A demonstrates activation of AP-1 by TGF-β1. Slight induction of AP-1 binding by TGF-β1 was observed by 2 h compared with control. Strong induction of AP-1 binding was observed by 6 h (2.4-fold) with maximum and sustained activation at 16–24 h (2.6-fold). In contrast, strong induction of AP-1 binding by bFGF (shown in Fig. 1 B) occurred earlier, beginning at 2 h (2.8-fold) with maximum and sustained binding at 16–24 h (3.8-fold). These results demonstrate that while TGF-β1 can induce AP-1 binding in primary lung fibroblasts, activation is delayed relative to that observed by bFGF, a classical mitogen that binds to receptor tyrosine kinases. TGF-β has been shown to activate ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase pathways in multiple cell systems (9Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol.

Furthermore, each pathway can induce AP-1 binding. To determine which pathway(s) regulated TGF-β-induced AP-1 binding, we initially examined the activation of p38 and JNK SAPKs by TGF-β1. Fibroblast extracts (which demonstrated TGF-β1-induced AP-1 activation; Fig. 1 A) were assayed for activation of p38 and JNK (Fig. 2,A and B). Using a JNK immunoprecipitation kinase assay, no JNK activation was observed in the TGF-β1-treated samples. Immunoblotting for phospho-p38 revealed rapid phosphorylation of p38 protein within 30 min and continued through 2 h. Phosphorylation was reduced at 6 h and almost completely lost by 24 h. Immunoblotting did not reveal an increase in the amount of p38 protein in TGF-β1-treated samples. However, the temporal activation of p38 MAP kinase was different from that observed for TGF-β1-induced AP-1 binding, suggesting that other pathways may be important in AP-1 activation. Extracts were assayed for ERK-1 and ERK-2 activity using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay (Fig. 2 C). ERK activation by TGF-β1 was observed at 2 h but did not reached maximum activity until 16 h. Densitometry revealed that activation was on average 5-fold over control activation at 24 h. Western immunoblotting with the phospho-ERK antibody confirmed TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of ERK-1 and -2 beginning at 2 h with maximal stimulation by 16 h. Unlike p38 MAP kinase, the activation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 by TGF-β1 temporally paralleled that of AP-1 binding. Western immunoblotting revealed that the level of ERK-1 protein was identical between control and treated samples, suggesting that the activation of ERK occurred via phosphorylation rather than induction of ERK protein. To further assess the relationship between the delayed TGF-β1-induction of AP-1 binding and ERK activation, cultured human lung fibroblasts were treated with TGF-β1 for 16 h in the presence and absence of 10 μm PD98059, an MEK-1 inhibitor. Cellular extracts were prepared, and EMSA for AP-1 binding was performed. TGF-β1-induced AP-1 DNA binding was completely inhibited by PD98059 (Fig.3 A). To ensure that PD98059 compound inhibited ERK activity, the same samples were subjected to immunoblotting for phosphorylated ERK-1 and -2. TGF-β1-induced ERK phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by PD98059 (Fig.3 B). Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity by SB203580 (1, 10, and 100 μm) did not inhibit the activation of AP-1 by TGF-β1 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that TGF-β1-induced ERK activation is required for TGF-β1 induction of AP-1 binding. The delayed activation of ERK and AP-1 by TGF-β1 suggested that they could be secondary effects mediated by growth factor(s) induced by TGF-β1. TGF-β has previously been shown to induce bFGF and FGF receptor-1 and -2 (FGFR-1 and FGFR-2) (30Pepper M.S. Belin D. Montesano R. Orci L. Vasalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 31Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Rajan T. Fanburg B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that TGF-β1 may induce a growth factor and/or its receptor as part of an autocrine loop. As an initial test of this hypothesis, cultured human lung fibroblasts were treated in the presence and absence of 300 mm suramin, an inhibitor of growth factor-receptor interactions, and AP-1 DNA binding was determined by EMSA. As expected, the inhibition of AP-1 binding by suramin was observed when fibroblasts were pretreated with suramin before the addition of TGF-β (Fig.4 A). Similar levels of inhibition were observed when suramin was administered 4 h after treatment with TGF-β1 (Fig. 4 A). In addition, the administration of suramin either before or after treatment with TGF-β1 completely inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK-1 and 2 (Fig.4 B). Importantly, the inhibition of AP-1 and ERK activation when suramin was added at a time that TGF-β1 receptor signaling had been completed and the receptor had been internalized (i.e. 4 h after TGF-β1 treatment) suggested that an autocrine growth factor was involved in mediating this effect (32Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Masui T. Harris C.C. Sporn M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To determine if a secreted growth factor induced by TGF-β1 was involved in mediating TGF-β1-induced ERK/AP-1 activation, conditioned medium (CM) from cells treated with TGF-β1 (16 h) was used to stimulate naive cells over shorter time periods. A time-dependent induction of AP-1 by TGF-β1-CM was observed with maximum induction at 2 h (Fig.5 A). The result was suggestive of a primary effect and was similar to that previously observed with the receptor tyrosine kinase-linked growth factor, bFGF (Fig.1 B). Supporting the autocrine loop hypothesis, we have previously shown that TGF-β1 induces FGFR-1 (Bek) and FGFR-2 (Flg) in IMR-90 cell cultures (31Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Rajan T. Fanburg B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β1 has also been shown to induce bFGF protein in other cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Thus, Western immunoblotting was used to examine bFGF protein expression in IMR-90 fibroblasts treated with TGF-β1. A time-dependent induction of bFGF protein by TGF-β1 occurred in a more rapid manner beginning at 2 h, with sustained and maximal induction for up to 24 h (Fig.5 B). Furthermore, the induction of bFGF was inhibited by actinomycin D (0.05 μg/ml), suggesting that the induction of bFGF by TGF-β1 required protein synthesis. These results demonstrating early induction of AP-1 by TGF-β1-CM (Fig. 5 A) and co-induction of FGF receptors (31Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Rajan T. Fanburg B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and bFGF (Fig. 5 B), support the hypothesis of a TGF-β1-induced autocrine loop. To determine whether bFGF was the putative growth factor responsible for TGF-β1-induced ERK activity and AP-1 binding, human lung fibroblasts were treated for 2 h with TGF-β1-CM in the presence and absence of bFGF-neutralizing antibody. Extracts were subjected to EMSA for AP-1 binding. The neutralizing antibody completely inhibited conditioned medium-induced activation of AP-1, while control antibody had no effect (Fig. 6 A). Immunoblotting for phospho-ERK performed on the same samples demonstrated activation of ERK-1 and -2 by conditioned medium from TGF-β1-treated fibroblasts. In addition, the phosphorylation of ERK-1 and -2 by conditioned medium was also inhibited by bFGF-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 6 B). These results demonstrate that TGF-β1 stimulates an autocrine loop involving bFGF. TGF-β is a cytokine that plays an integral role in fibrosis. Its signal transduction pathway is only partially defined. In this series of experiments using primary human lung fibroblasts, it was demonstrated that TGF-β1 results in the delayed and sustained activation of ERK-1/ERK-2 and AP-1. Furthermore, activation of ERK and AP-1 are mediated by a TGF-β1-induced autocrine loop involving basic FGF. Fig. 7 depicts a proposed pathway for this autocrine loop. To our knowledge, this is the first description of activation of ERK by TGF-β1 via this mechanism. Previous investigators have described the rapid and immediate induction of ERK by TGF-β1 in many different cell types (10Musci I. Skorecki K.L. Goldberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16567-16572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol.

The description of the kinetics by which TGF-β1 activates ERK has been highly variable. Hartsough et al. (17Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) demonstrated rapid and sustained (90 min) activation of ERK in exponentially proliferating cultures of intestinal epithelial cells in which DNA synthesis was inhibited by TGF-β1. Chin et al. demonstrated that rapid and sustained activation (4 h) of ERK by TGF-β1 was associated with TGF-β1-induced rescue from apoptosis in murine macrophages (34Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11362-11368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Musci et al. (10Musci I. Skorecki K.L. Goldberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16567-16572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) observed that modulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and type I collagen promoter activity by TGF-β1 occurred in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, where TGF-β1-induced activation of ERK was early and immediate and sustained for up to 3 h. TGF-β2 in high doses (25 ng/ml) also has been shown to stimulate rat primary glomerular mesangial cells in a biphasic fashion with the initial rapid increase in activity of ERK-1/ERK-2 followed by a second persistent level of activity beginning at 4 h and rising steadily to 24 h (36Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An important distinction between our study and those of others, in which the kinetics of ERK and AP-1 activation are different than that observed here, is the cell type used. Previous reports of TGF-β-induced ERK activation have been, for the most part, shown in transformed or immortalized tumor cells. Signaling mechanisms in such cells may be “programmed” to grow and may have a low threshold for the activation of ERK. In contrast, primary cells are not necessarily predisposed toward growth. Thus, the delayed activation of ERK in the IMR-90 cells used in this study may be related to the untransformed nature of these cells. It also has been suggested that cellular quiescence may explain the absence of ERK activation in response to TGF-β1 in certain cell types (37Chatani Y. Tanimura S. Miyoshi N. Hattori A. Sato M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30686-30692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, in this study, cells underwent prolonged serum starvation prior to TGF-β1 stimulation, and TGF-β1 results in continued quiescence of these cells. Therefore, in contrast to findings by other investigators, ERK activation was observed even in quiescent cells. In contrast to ERK activation, TGF-β1 treatment of human pulmonary fibroblasts resulted in a rapid activation of the stress-activated p38 MAP kinase, while JNK activation was not observed. The variability in TGF β1-SAPK activation has been observed previously, with some cell types showing rapid and marked activation of SAPK, while other cell types possess minimal or absent activity (9Atfi A.

Activation of the SAPK pathways has been associated with apoptosis and cell differentiation and induction of collagenase-3 (38Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39Nakamura K. Shirai T. Morishita S. Uchida S. Saeki-Miura K. Makishima F. Exp.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study, using inhibitor assays, the activation of p38 MAP kinase was not required for AP-1 activation, and its functional role was not examined. Other signaling processes are also rapidly activated by TGF-β1, in particular, Smads (8Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). However, we did not examine the immediate early signaling pathways that led to bFGF induction. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the ERK pathway functions as a mechanism for the counterbalanced regulation of TGF-β-induced Smad signaling (41Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Again, although Smad signaling was not examined in this study, bFGF-induced ERK activation by TGF-β1 may in fact oppose early TGF-β1-induced signaling events. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) classically results in strong induction of the MAP kinase, ERK (42Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 44Force T. Boneventre J.V. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown in IMR-90 fibroblasts that TGF-β1 regulates FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1; Bek) and FGF receptor-2 (FGFR-2; Flg) but not receptors for other mitogens that stimulate the ERK pathway, such as platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (31Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Rajan T. Fanburg B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Regulation of the expression and release of bFGF protein by TGF-β has also been observed by other investigators in a number of cell types including fibroblasts (30Pepper M.S. Belin D. Montesano R. Orci L. Vasalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 31Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Rajan T. Fanburg B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mavier M. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1986-1996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this report, ERK and AP-1 activation were inhibited by the exogenous administration of suramin (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that both control and TGF-β1-stimulated fibroblasts were secreting a factor into surrounding medium that was inducing basal and TGF-β1-induced activation of ERK and AP-1. A time-dependent increase in cellular bFGF protein in response to TGF-β1 was found at similar time points to ERK/AP-1 activation (Fig. 5 B). In addition, induction of AP-1 by conditioned medium of TGF-β1-treated cells occurred at a similar time course to that observed in response to exogenous recombinant bFGF (Fig. 5 A). This data, together with the inhibition of TGF-β1-induced ERK/AP-1 activation by bFGF-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 6, A and B), provided compelling evidence that the putative autocrine factor was bFGF. The employment of autocrine loops by cytokines and growth factors is not an unusual phenomenon. TGF-β1 and bFGF can function in complementary or opposing roles. For example, in pulmonary and corneal fibroblasts, TGF-β1 stimulates the release of bFGF, and their interaction has been implicated in potentiation of mitogenesis (31Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Rajan T. Fanburg B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,45Kay E.P. Lee M.S. Seong G.J. Lee Y.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, both cytokines are profibrotic. Indeed, persistent tissue fibrosis is observed in mice with the simultaneous application of both cytokines compared with TGF-β or bFGF alone (48Shinozaki M. Kawara S. Hayashi N. Kakinuma T. Igarashi A. Takehara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Conversely, differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, an integral process in fibrogenesis, is inhibited by bFGF (49Mattey D.L. Dawes P.T. Nixon N.B. Slater H. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1997; 56: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). bFGF is a potent inhibitor of basal and TGF-β-induced collagen α2(I) gene expression in human skin fibroblasts (50Ichi Y. Smith E.A. Leroy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Rheum. 1997; 24: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar). In myofibroblasts, bFGF has been shown to mediate the mitogenic but not the profibrotic effect of TGF-β1 (47Rosenbaum J. Blazejewski S Preaux A.M. Mallat A. Dhumeaux D. Mavier M. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1986-1996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this study, the human lung fibroblasts are quiescent and do not undergo mitogenesis or apoptosis when treated with TGF-β1 (data not shown). This suggests that TGF-β1, in human lung fibroblasts, regulates bFGF for another function, probably involved in the alteration of ECM or cellular differentiation functions of TGF-β. In support of this hypothesis, Rao et al. demonstrated in myoblasts that bFGF and TGF-β treatments resulted in different kinetics of D-type cyclin expression during terminal differentiation, with maximal induction of cyclin D1 expression at 4 h following bFGF treatment and 16 h following TGF-β1 treatment (51Rao S.S. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4093-4100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Both TGF-β1 and bFGF are known to stimulate increased binding of AP-1. In this study, TGF-β1-induced binding of AP-1 was secondary to the autocrine induction of bFGF. In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, bFGF alters the expression of human interstitial collagenase via induction of its AP-1-dependent promoter (52Aho S. Rouda S. Kennedy S.H. Qin H. Tan E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 treatment of human pulmonary fibroblasts may regulate bFGF to initiate continued matrix degradation, thus counterbalancing or opposing its own usual function of tissue repair. Recently, it has been observed that alteration of the expression of cell surface-specific FGFR family members, which have different affinities for members of the FGF family, dictates regulation of MMP-1 in response to bFGF (25Pilcher B.K. Gaither-Ganim J. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18147-18154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported in IMR 90 fibroblasts that TGF-β1 up-regulates the expression of FGFR-1 and FGFR-2, which have high affinities for bFGF (31Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Rajan T. Fanburg B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that TGF-β1, in human pulmonary fibroblasts, could also be regulating gene transcription in response to bFGF through the induction of specific FGF receptors.

As part of lineage determination, a sizable fraction of RA-treated cultures die by apoptosis. Applying natural long-chain C16-ceramides as well as membrane-permeable C2/C6-ceramide analogs caused apoptosis, whereas the biologically nonactive C2-dihydroceramide did not. Treating PCC7-Mz1 stem cells with a neutral sphingomyelinase or with the ceramidase inhibitor N-oleoylethanolamine elevated the endogenous ceramide levels and concomitantly induced apoptosis. Addition of RA caused an increase in ceramide levels within 3–5 h, which reached a maximum (up to 3.5-fold of control) between days 1 and 3 of differentiation. Differentiated PCC7-Mz1 cells did not respond with ceramide formation and apoptosis to RA treatment. The acidic sphingomyelinase contributed only weakly and the neutral Mg2+-dependent and Mg2+-independent sphingomyelinases not at all to the RA-mediated production of ceramides. However, ceramide increase was sensitive to the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1, suggesting a crucial role for the de novo synthesis pathway. Enzymatic assays revealed that ceramide synthase activity remained unaltered, whereas serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a key enzyme in ceramide synthesis, was activated ∼2.5-fold by RA treatment. Activation of SPT seemed to be mediated via a post-translational mechanism because levels of the mRNAs coding for the two SPT subunits were unaffected.

Successful removal of cells with minimum disturbance of the surrounding tissue is achieved by a process called programmed cell death or apoptosis. In contrast to the striking heterogeneity of cell death induction pathways, the execution of the death program often involves identical molecules and is associated with characteristic morphological and biochemical changes (1Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12780) Google Scholar). It has been reported that, during brain development, 20–80% of all neurons are eliminated by apoptosis (2Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 435-501Crossref Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). The reasons for this massive neuronal cell death are discussed in the context of, for example, correction of erroneous projections, creation of pathways for axonal outgrowth, numerical limitations imposed by mechanisms involving successive cell doubling, and transient functions of the eliminated neurons (reviewed in Refs. 2Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 435-501Crossref Scopus (2754) Google Scholarand 3Burek M.J. Oppenheim R.W. Koliatsos V. Ratan R. Cell Death and Disease of the Nervous System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998Google Scholar). Although some of these hypotheses have received experimental support in individual systems, none appear to be generally applicable, and it is unlikely that a single explanation exists. Neurons seem to be produced in excess to allow competition for contacts with their cellular partners and thus adjust their numbers to provide sufficient enervation of their targets, a process called the “neurotrophic strategy” (reviewed in Ref. 4Pettmann B. Henderson C.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 633-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). During recent years, a novel type of neural programmed cell death has become evident. In several systems, it was demonstrated that neuronal cells die very early during neurogenesis and, in some cases, well before the period of target contact (5Blaschke A.J. Staley K. Chun J. Development. 1996; 122: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yaginuma H. Tomita M. Takashita N. McKay S.E. Cardwell C. Yin Q.W. Oppenheim R.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3685-3703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During chick development, cells die in the early neural tube (embryonic days 2–3) shortly after becoming post-mitotic or even during the cell cycle (7Homma S. Yaginuma H. Oppenheim R.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 345: 377-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Preventing this programmed cell death by administering caspase inhibitors blocks neural tube closure (8Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Raff M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Also, widespread programmed cell death was discovered to commence after embryonic day 10 in the murine cerebral cortex (5Blaschke A.J. Staley K. Chun J. Development. 1996; 122: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of dying cells were found within zones of proliferating cells rather than in regions of post-mitotic cells. At present, neither the exact biological function nor the specific mechanisms regulating this new form of neural cell death during pattern formation are known. A satisfactory biochemical analysis of this cell death during early neurogenesis is hampered in vivo due to the lack of specific markers for dying cells and of sufficient material, to problems of drug application, and to the fact that development of neural cells is not synchronized. To evade these limitations, it was desirable to establish and to employ an appropriate in vitro cell system. We reported earlier that the teratocarcinoma cell line PCC7-Mz1 adequately mimics early steps of neural development (9Lang E. Mazauric-Stüker M.-L. Maelicke A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Berger C. Reinhardt S. Rentrop M. Bachmann M. Weiser T. Link T. Wienrich M. Jahn R. Maelicke A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 230-245PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jostock R. Rentrop M. Maelicke A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), including the processes of determination, differentiation, and apoptosis (12Herget T. Specht H. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Maelicke A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following incubation with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA),1 PCC7-Mz1 cells cease proliferation and differentiate, over a period of several days, into a tissue-like pattern of neurons, astroglial cells, and fibroblasts (9Lang E. Mazauric-Stüker M.-L. Maelicke A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,10Berger C. Reinhardt S. Rentrop M. Bachmann M. Weiser T. Link T. Wienrich M. Jahn R. Maelicke A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 230-245PubMed Google Scholar). The embryonic carcinoma cell line PCC7-Mz1 may therefore be considered as a clone of pluripotent cells of neuroectodermal origin and serve as a model of neural development. We recently reported that apoptosis may be part of early neurogenesis, i.e. when PCC7-Mz1 stem cells become committed to their specific cell lineages (12Herget T. Specht H. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Maelicke A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Within 24 h of RA treatment, a considerable fraction (∼23%) of the PCC7-Mz1 culture detaches and dies, whereas the remaining cells of the culture begin to differentiate along their specific lineages (neuronal, astroglial, and fibroblast). Apoptosis was characterized by nuclear condensation, intranucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA, activation of caspases, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Neurotrophic factors were ineffective in preventing this cell death, as was also shown for early cell death in the avian cervical cord (6Yaginuma H. Tomita M. Takashita N. McKay S.E. Cardwell C. Yin Q.W. Oppenheim R.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3685-3703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that cell autonomous mechanisms are responsible. Therefore, apoptosis may be instructed by the gene regulatory program that controls cell lineage determination and the formation of patterns of neuroectodermal derivatives. This notion is supported by the finding that Bcl-2, a negative regulator of apoptosis, becomes up-regulated in PCC7-Mz1 cells within a few days of RA treatment. Increase in Bcl-2 expression accompanies neural differentiation and is conversely related to the extent of apoptosis, which rapidly declines once the neuronal network starts to emerge in PCC7-Mz1 cultures, i.e. 2–3 days after treatment with RA. Hence, expression of Bcl-2 seems to provide protection from apoptosis for PCC7-Mz1 cells that have already achieved a certain level of differentiation. The intracellular signaling pathways leading to apoptosis in PCC7-Mz1 cells depend on caspases, but do not seem to involve conventional or novel members of the protein kinase C gene family (12Herget T. Specht H. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Maelicke A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we study the role of ceramide (N-acyl-erythro-sphingosine), which has been shown to act as a key signaling molecule in a distinct signal transduction pathway, in the sphingomyelin pathway or cycle, consisting of hydrolysis and resynthesis (reviewed in Refs. 13Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar and 14Hannun Y.A.

Extracellular agents such as the cytokines tumor necrosis factor α, nerve growth factor, interferon, interleukin-1–6, and CD95-L (all binding to cell-surface receptors) and vitamin D3 and dexamethasone (acting via nuclear receptors) were shown to initiate rapid ceramide generation by activation of sphingomyelinases (13Hannun Y.A.

One of the most interesting and intriguing properties of ceramide is the induction of apoptosis in cells in culture and in vivo (20Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Ceramide generation was measured under various conditions that are known to lead to apoptosis, and ceramide levels were shown to increase in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (21Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.-C. Ehlert D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), withdrawal of serum (22Jayadev S. Liu B.

It was demonstrated that lymphoblasts from patients with Niemann-Pick disease, an inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase (SMase), and acid SMase-deficient mice show defects in, but not total loss of, the apoptotic response (25Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The role of this lipid second messenger in both differentiation and RA-induced apoptosis of neural cells is so far only poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed, by utilizing the PCC7-Mz1 system, the significance of ceramide in early neural determination. We show that ceramide induces apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner and, furthermore, that RA induces an elevation of cellular ceramide levels in PCC7-Mz1 stem cells by de novo synthesis. Ceramide production was independent of sphingomyelinase and ceramide synthase action, but was due to activation of serine palmitoyltransferase. Interestingly, ceramide causes only apoptosis, but not neural determination or differentiation. Furthermore, we isolated subclones of PCC7-Mz1, which were unable to produce ceramides upon RA treatment and therefore did not undergo programmed cell death in response to RA. The mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line PCC7-Mz1 is a subclone of the PCC7-S-AzaR1 (clone 1009) cell line. Culture conditions, growth characteristics, and the RA-induced differentiation pattern have been described previously (9Lang E. Mazauric-Stüker M.-L. Maelicke A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,10Berger C. Reinhardt S. Rentrop M. Bachmann M. Weiser T. Link T. Wienrich M. Jahn R. Maelicke A. Eur. J.

PCC7-Mz1 cells were grown in plastic tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow, Meckenheim, Germany) supplemented with 12.5% fetal calf serum (batch 148, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) at 37 °C in humidified air and 10% CO2. RA-resistant cells were selected by culturing PCC7-Mz1 cells in the presence of 0.1 μm RA. Proliferating cell colonies were isolated by ring cloning, and individual clones (R-clones) were established. Stock cultures of R-clones were cultivated in the presence of 0.01 μm RA, which was omitted for the experimental cultures. Prior to induction of differentiation, PCC7 cells were seeded at a density of 1.75 × 104 cells/cm2 in plastic culture dishes. For differentiation, cultures were treated with 0.1 μm RA (final concentration; Sigma, Munich, Germany) 1 day after plating. 24 h later, the culture medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 12.5% fetal calf serum, 0.1 μm RA, and 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Treatment with fumonisin B1 and desipramine (Sigma) was carried out 1 h before adding RA. C16-ceramide (Sigma) was applied according to the method described by Ji et al. (26Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, C16-ceramide was dissolved in ethanol/dodecane (98:2, v/v; Sigma), thoroughly mixed with the medium. and added to PCC7-Mz1 cells plated the day before in a 96-well plate (5 × 104 cells/well). The final concentration of the solvent was <0.5% ethanol and 0.01% dodecane. For quantification of the degree of cell death in cell culture, we employed the viability assay based on the reduction of tetrazolium salt to formazan by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (27Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45894) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously (12Herget T. Specht H. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Maelicke A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used instead of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. The light absorbance at 405 nm of the medium including all factors but without cells was determined and subtracted from the absorption readings with cells. At least eight wells/sample point were analyzed. Each experiment was repeated three times. Cells were cultivated in 6-cm dishes, and genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (12Herget T. Specht H. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Maelicke A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in the medium were collected by centrifugation (2000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of cell lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Adherent cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), detached with a rubber policeman, and centrifuged. This cell pellet was also resuspended in 20 μl of cell lysis buffer. The lysed cells were immediately incubated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) and then with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 50 °C for 1 h each. The reactions were stopped by heat treatment at 70 °C for 10 min. The samples were kept at 56 °C, and 15 μl of prewarmed sample buffer (1% low-melt agarose, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 40% sucrose) was added. The samples were then loaded onto a 1.4% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the DNA band pattern was visualized under UV light using ethidium bromide. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (12Herget T. Specht H. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Maelicke A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Reinhardt S. Maelicke A. Herget T. Eur. J.

To prepare extracts of apoptotic cells, detached PCC7-Mz1 cells in the supernatant were collected by centrifugation (2000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium ortho-vanadate). Adherent cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped off the dish with 200 μl of lysis buffer using a rubber policeman. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the BCA reagents (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) by semidry blotting. The membranes were blocked with PBS/Triton (0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2) supplemented with 5% low-fat milk powder for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the monoclonal nClathrin antibody (1:1500; kindly provided by R. Jahn, Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen) (10Berger C. Reinhardt S. Rentrop M. Bachmann M. Weiser T. Link T. Wienrich M. Jahn R. Maelicke A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 230-245PubMed Google Scholar) or affinity-purified rabbit GAP-43 antiserum (1:4000) (28Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Reinhardt S. Maelicke A. Herget T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), both diluted in PBS/Triton with 1% low-fat milk powder, or with polyclonal rabbit caspase-3 antiserum (sc-7148, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg), diluted 1:200 in PBS/Triton containing 1% low-fat milk powder and 2% fetal calf serum. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000 in PBS/Triton with 1% low-fat milk powder; Dako Corp., Hamburg, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature to detect bound anti-GAP-43 antibodies, respectively. Membranes were washed again with PBS/Triton, and secondary antibodies were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions using medical x-ray films (Fuji). Cellular ceramide levels were estimated by the diacylglycerol kinase assay and by employing charring densitometry of TLC plates. Total cellular ceramide levels were quantified by the diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase assay as32P incorporated upon phosphorylation of ceramide to ceramide 1-phosphate by diacylglycerol kinase (30Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Grassmé H. Weller M. Koppenhoefer U. Dichgans J. Sandhoff K. Lang F. Gulbins E. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PCC7-Mz1 cells were plated in 25-cm tissue culture dishes at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2. The following day, cultures were treated with various factors; and at the indicated times, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in glass tubes. After centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), lipids were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/hydrochloric acid (1n; 100:100:1, v/v/v), 170 μl of buffered saline solution (135 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2), and 30 μl of 100 mm EDTA. The lipids of the organic phase were transferred to a new glass tube and dried under a stream of N2. Lipid extracts were then subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis (0.1 m KOH in methanol for 1 h at 37 °C) to remove glycerophospholipids. 500 μl of chloroform, 270 μl of buffered saline solution, and 30 μl of 100 mm EDTA were added. After drying the organic phase with N2, in vitro phosphorylation of extracted ceramide was performed as described by the manufacturer (RPN 200 kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol; ICN) was used to start the reaction. After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by extraction of lipids with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/hydrochloric acid (1 n; 100:100:1, v/v/v), 170 μl of buffered saline solution, and 30 μl of 100 mm EDTA. The lower organic phase was dried under N2. The samples were resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v) and spotted on Silica Gel 60 high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), which were activated in a saturated atmosphere of acetone shortly before usage. Ceramide 1-phosphate was resolved by TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (75:25:5, v/v/v) as solvent and migrated as a single spot at RF = 0.25. Linearity of the assay was established using purified C16-ceramide (Sigma). Phosphorylation was detected and quantified by a phosphoimager (Bio-Rad 250) using the program Molecular Analyst. Total lipids were isolated according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh V. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42411) Google Scholar). For separation of ceramide from other neutral lipids, dried samples were resolved in chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v) and spotted onto Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plates. Purified C16- and C18-ceramides were loaded as standards. The TLC plates were placed in an equilibrated chamber; and for ceramide analysis, the solvent system dichloromethane/methanol/acetic acid (100:2:5, v/v/v) was used. The TLC separation was followed by visualization and quantification of phospholipids by charring of the plates with cupric reagent as described previously (32Schütze S. Krönke M. Balkwill F.R. Cytokines: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 93-110Google Scholar). The plates were dried for 10 min at 180 °C, cooled down to room temperature, and exposed to a solution of 10% copper(II) sulfate in 8% aqueous phosphoric acid for 15 s. After drying for 2 min at 110 °C, charring was performed at 176 °C for ∼10 min. For quantification, the charred TLC plates were surveyed by two-dimensional laser scanning densitometry (Personal Densitometer, Molecular Dynamics, Inc.), and calculations were performed using the PC-BAS TINA program (Raytest). Sphingomyelinase activity was assessed in vitroby the enzymatic micellar assay. PCC7-Mz1 cultures grown in 10-cm dishes were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by repeated squeezing through a needle. Concentrations of soluble proteins in extracts were estimated with the BCA method, and 10 μg of protein was used for the selective determination of neutral Mg2+-dependent and Mg2+-independent and acid sphingomyelinase activities. The buffer for neutral Mg2+-dependent sphingomyelinase was 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; that for neutral Mg2+-independent was 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; and that for acidic sphingomyelinase was 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The reaction took place in a volume of 50 μl and was started by adding 0.05 μCi of [methylcholine-14C]sphingomyelin with a specific activity of 52 Ci/mmol (ICN) and a 350 μg/ml final concentration of unlabeled sphingomyelin from bovine brain (Sigma). As a positive control, isolated neutral sphingomyelinase from Staphylococcus aureus (Calbiochem) was utilized instead of cell extracts. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 800 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 250 μl of H2O. After phase separation by centrifugation, radioactivity in 200 μl of the aqueous phase was measured by scintillation counting using 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Zinsser, Frankfurt, Germany). 1 day after plating, PCC7-Mz1 cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the culture dish with a rubber spatula, and concentrated by centrifugation. Microsomal membranes were prepared as described (33Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Persaud R.S. McLouglin M. Ehleitr D. Zhang N. Gatei M. Lavin M. Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were homogenized in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, and lysates were pelleted at 800 ×g for 5 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 35 min, and the microsomal membrane pellet was resuspended in 1.0 ml of homogenization buffer. For assaying ceramide synthase (sphinganine N-acyltransferase) activity, sphinganine and palmitoyl-CoA were used as substrates (33Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Persaud R.S. McLouglin M. Ehleitr D.

The reaction mixture (in a total volume of 1.0 ml) contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 μl of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 20 μm sphinganine ("
https://openalex.org/W2126943184,"We have analyzed the folding state of cytosolic proteins imported in vitro into lysosomes, using an approach originally developed by Eilers and Schatz, (Eilers, M., and Schatz, G. (1986) Nature 322, 228-232) to investigate protein import into mitochondria. The susceptibility toward proteases of mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), synthesized in a coupled transcription-translation system with rabbit reticulocytes, decreased in the presence of its substrate analogue, methotrexate. This analogue complexes with high affinity with the in vitro synthesized DHFR and locks it into a protease-resistant folded conformation. DHFR was taken up by freshly isolated rat liver lysosomes and methotrexate reduced this uptake by about 80%. A chimeric DHFR protein, which carries the N-terminal presequence of subunit 9 of ATP synthase preprotein from Neurospora crassa fused to its N terminus, was taken up by lysosomes more efficiently. Again, methotrexate abolished the lysosomal uptake of the fusion protein, which was partially restored by washing of methotrexate from DHFR or by adding together methotrexate and dihydrofolate, the natural substrate of DHFR. Immunoblot analysis with anti-DHFR of liver lysosomes and of other fractions, isolated from rats starved for 88 h and treated with lysosomal inhibitors, suggests that DHFR is degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy. Competition with ribonuclease A and stimulation by ATP/Mg(2+) and the heat shock cognate protein of 73 kDa show that the lysosomal uptake of the fusion protein also occurs by this pathway. It is concluded that the lysosomal uptake of cytosolic proteins by chaperone-mediated autophagy mainly occurs by passage of the unfolded proteins through the lysosomal membrane. Therefore, this mechanism is different from protein transport into peroxisomes, but similar to the import of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."

KATP channel openers (minoxidil, cromakalim, and pinacidil) increased cellular DNA synthesis, whereas KATP channel blockers (quinidine and glibenclamide) attenuated DNA synthesis. The channel inhibitor glibenclamide decreased the clonogenicity of HepG2 cells without inducing cytotoxicity or apoptosis. To demonstrate the specificity of drugs for K+ channels, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made. Hepatocytes revealed K+ currents with KATP channel properties. These K+ currents were augmented by minoxidil and pinacidil and attenuated by glibenclamide as well as tetraethylammonium, in agreement with established responses of KATP channels. Reverse transcription of total cellular RNA followed by polymerase chain reaction showed expression of KATP channel-specific subunits in rat hepatocytes and human liver cell lines. Calcium fluxes were unperturbed in glibenclamide-treated HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes following induction with ATP and hepatocyte growth factor, respectively, suggesting that the effect of KATP channel activity upon hepatocyte proliferation was not simply due to indirect modulation of intracellular calcium. The regulation of mitogen-related hepatocyte proliferation by KATP channels advances our insights into liver growth control.

(1992) Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes, 2nd Ed., pp. 115–139 and 472–503, Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MAGoogle Scholar). Membrane currents through ATP-sensitive K+ channels, KATP, have been recorded in diverse cell types, including pancreatic β cells; skeletal, cardiac, and vascular myocytes; neurons; and renal epithelial cells (2Cook D.L.

The KATP channel is a heteromultimer composed of at least two types of subunits, an inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir6.x) and a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (8Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd A.E., II Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Kir6.x subunits form the pore, and SUR subunits impart regulatory activity (9D'hahan N. Jacquet H. Moreau C. Catty P. Vivaudou M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The KATP channels are inhibited by sulfonylureas,e.g. glibenclamide and tolbutamide, and activated by diverse substances designated as potassium channel openers (10Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 11Edwards G. Weston A.H. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1995; 9: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which include benzopyrans (cromakalim, levcromakalim, and pinacidil), cyanoguanidines, thiogormamides, pyrimidines (minoxidil), and benzothiadiazines (diazoxide). The activity of KATPchannels is dependent upon the energy state of the cell. Various subunits (Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1, and SUR2) form channel subtypes with differences in expression among different organs (10Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Kir6.2 and SUR1 form the characteristic K+ channel in pancreatic β cells, where an increase in intracellular ATP levels, such as following increased glucose availability, causes channel closure, plasma membrane depolarization, and activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels, which finally triggers insulin release (10Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 12Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that potassium channels regulate the growth and proliferation of many cell types. For example, receptor-coupled, voltage-sensitive, and calcium-sensitive K+ channels regulate proliferation in lymphocytes, adipocytes, and epithelial cells derived from the skin, breast, bladder, and stomach (13Harmon C.S. Luts D. Ducote J. Skin Pharmacol. 1993; 6: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Wondergem R. Cregan M. Strickler L. Miller R. Suttles J. J. Membr.

Physiol. 1995; 162: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This regulation seems to occur at the level of cellular DNA synthesis because inhibition of K+ channel activity synchronizes cells in G0/G1 (16Deutsch C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 334: 251-271PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in fibroblasts, the Ca2+-sensitive potassium channel has been found to regulate intracellular signal transduction events that concern mitogenic activity (17Stanley R.G. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 107-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Information concerning the role of K+ channels in hepatocytes has been relatively limited. Early studies with primary rat hepatocytes by Sawanobori et al. (18Sawanobori T. Takanashi H. Hiraoka M. Iida Y. Kamisaka K. Maezawa H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed a wide range of resting membrane potentials, along with non-rectifying linear current-voltage relationships and no effect on these currents after norepinephrine or Ca2+ administration. In guinea pig hepatocytes, Capiod and Ogden (19Capiod T. Ogden D.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1989; 409: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have established the presence of Ca2+-activated, delayed-rectifier K+ currents. Similarly, Ca2+-sensitive and cAMP-dependent K+ channel currents were reported in HTC rat hepatoma cells by Lidofsky (20Lidofsky S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7115-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Embryonic chick hepatocytes have been shown to possess large conductance voltage-gated and Ca2+-activated channels (21Pon D.C. Hill C.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 171: 87-94Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Henderson et al. (22Henderson, R. M., Graf, J., and Boyer, J. L. (1989)Am. J. Physiol. G1028–G1035Google Scholar) found inwardly rectifying K+ channels in primary rat hepatocytes that were unperturbed by voltage or Ca2+ stimulation. K+channel activity was also found to regulate additional processes in hepatocytes, such as cell volume (23Graf J. Haddad P. Haussinger D. Lang F. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 11: 202-220PubMed Google Scholar). Our own interest in hepatic K+ channels concerned potential relationships between K+ channel activity and liver growth control, which involves growth factor-mediated activation of intracellular signaling cascades and other cellular events (24Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). The general hypothesis was that modulation of K+ channel activity would affect hepatic DNA synthesis. We studied primary rat hepatocytes as well as several established human cancer cell lines to analyze the effects of KATP channel regulation upon cell proliferation. The results showed that KATP channels play significant roles in regulating hepatocyte proliferation. Glibenclamide, pinacidil, and minoxidil were from RBI (Natick, MA). Cromakalim, quinidine, and ATP sodium salt were from Sigma. To obtain stock solutions, glibenclamide and pinacidil were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (10 mm stocks; Sigma); quinidine was dissolved in ethanol (20 mm stock); minoxidil and cromakalim were dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium (1 μmand 1 mm stocks, respectively; Life Technologies, Inc.); and ATP was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (10 mm stock). Recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF)1 was from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Tetraethylammonium (Sigma) was dissolved in water (1 m stock). Primary hepatocytes were isolated from F344 rats with a two-step perfusion using 0.03% collagenase as described previously (25Rajvanshi P. Kerr A. Bhargava K.K. Burk R.D. Gupta S. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were pelleted in 45% PercollTM in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain viable cells. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells were plated on borosilicate coverslips (Corning Inc., Horseheads, NY) and tissue culture dishes coated with rat tail collagen. Primary hepatocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). HepG2, HuH-7, and HFL cells are cancerous liver epithelial cell lines derived from the human liver (26Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 27Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano M. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zahler M.H.

These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with antibiotics and fetal bovine serum. Cell morphology was observed under phase-contrast microscopy. All experiments were in triplicate at least and repeated many times. Changes in the number of cells were determined by plating cells at a density of 5 × 104/cm2 in 24-well plates. The medium was changed every 48 h. Cells were trypsinized and counted in a modified Neubauer hemocytometer at 1, 3, and 5 days after culture. To determine DNA synthesis rates, primary hepatocytes were plated at a density of 2 × 104/cm2, and HepG2, HuH-7, and HFL cells were plated at 1 × 104/cm2. Two hours later, drugs affecting potassium channel activity or vehicle alone was added to cultured cells. Primary rat hepatocytes were cultured with and without 10 ng/ml hHGF and incubated with drugs for 44–46 h. HepG2, HuH-7, and HFL cells were cultured for 22–23 h. This was followed by the addition of 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and trichloroacetic acid-precipitable DNA was extracted as described previously (29Gupta S. LaBrecque D.R. Shafritz D.A. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured by liquid scintillation counting with normalization to DNA content. All experiments were in triplicate at least and performed on 3–10 occasions. Colony-forming assays were undertaken by plating 1000 cells in 100-mm culture dishes. The drugs were added 72 h after plating the cells. The culture medium was changed every 48 h until colonies became visible at 18 days of cell culture. To count colonies, cells were fixed in 100% ethanol for 10 min, followed by staining with 4% crystal violet in 0.2 m citric acid. The number of colonies was counted with an AlphaImager 2000 instrument (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). To determine changes in cell viability, utilization of thiazolyl blue (MTT; Sigma) was measured. Cells were plated at a density of 1.3 × 105/cm2 in 96-well plates. After drug treatments, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml MTT in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 60 min at 37 °C. The MTT-containing medium was removed; cells were lysed; and the intracellular formazan product was solubilized in isopropyl alcohol for quantitation atA 560. In aliquots, total protein was measured by the Bio-Rad assay using bovine γ-globulin standards. To demonstrate apoptosis, cells were fixed in 75% methanol and 25% glacial acetic acid for 15 min at room temperature, washed twice with water, air-dried, and incubated for 15 min with 8 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. The stained cells were examined by epifluorescence at 365–400 nm. The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique was used to demonstrate apoptosis with a commercial kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, followed by quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for another 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture at 37 °C for 30 min. The peroxidase system was used to visualize nuclei with evidence of apoptotic lesions. The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to record currents under voltage-clamp conditions (30Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar). Glass pipettes with tip diameters of ∼1–2 μm were fabricated from borosilicate capillary tubing and fire-polished. Cells on coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber on an inverted microscope equipped with patch-clamp micromanipulators. The chamber perfusion flow rate was 750 μl/min, and the bath volume was 250 μl. The external solution contained 170 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 4 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, and 5 mm glucose. The internal pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm UDP. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. All recordings were obtained without ATP in solutions. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The holding potential was maintained at −20 or −33 mV, and voltage steps were applied from 80 to −160 mV in 20-mV increments. An Axopatch-1C patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) controlled by a PC computer was used for recordings. Data were analyzed with pClamp6 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Changes in intracellular calcium levels were demonstrated in HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes plated on glass-bottomed microwells (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Cells were loaded with a 15 μmconcentration of the intracellular calcium indicator Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 45 min. Loaded cells were rinsed with Tyrode's solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.45 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mmglucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.0–7.2) and examined under an epifluorescence microscope. The ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence emitted at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths was obtained using a combined system of optic filter wheel (Sutter Instrument Co., Burlingame, CA) and shutter (Uniblitz, Rochester, NY) driven by an OEI computer (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The images were acquired with an intensified CCD camera and analyzed with Metafluor imaging system software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Fura-2 fluorescence ratio images were continuously acquired at a rate of 0.3 Hz before and after inducing Ca2+ fluxes with ATP to HepG2 cells at an effective concentration of 50 μm. To establish conditions for demonstrating Ca2+ fluxes in primary rat hepatocytes, we stimulated cells with hHGF in concentrations ranging from 5 to 600 ng/ml within 1–3 h after plating cells as well as after 24 h of cell culture. Hepatocytes were pulsed with hHGF for 2 min and then switched to Tyrode's solution. After pilot studies to determine effective conditions, primary rat hepatocytes were pulsed with 12 ng/ml hHGF for 2 min, followed by incubation in Tyrode's solution and sequential recordings at 5-min intervals for 15–20 min. Intracellular calcium levels were obtained from regions of interest by measuring the ratio of Fura-2 intensity during excitation at 340 and 380 nm after applying the following calibration equation: [Ca2+] i =K d ((R −R min)/(R max −R))(F 380(min)/F 380(max)), where [Ca2+] i is the calculated intracellular calcium concentration, K d is the dissociation constant of Ca2+ with Fura-2 dye (K d = 224 nm) (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), R is the ratio intensity,R min is the ratio of the intensity at zero calcium, R max is the ratio of the intensity at saturated calcium, F 380(min) is the fluorescence intensity at zero calcium at 380 nm (insensitive to calcium), and F 380(max) is the fluorescence intensity with saturated calcium at 380 nm. Total RNA was extracted from cells with the guanidium thiocyanate method using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). A commercial system (Access RT-PCR, Promega, Madison, WI) was used for one-step reverse transcription-PCR for amplifying rat Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1, and SUR2 as well as β-actin to serve as an internal control for semiquantitative comparisons with previously described primers (6Lee K. Dixon A.K. Freeman T.C. Richardson P.J. J. Physiol. ( London ). 1998; 510: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, primers were synthesized in our DNA synthesis facility to amplify human Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1, and SUR2. The effective primers for human sequences were as follows: Kir6.2, 5′-AGC CCA AGT TCA GCA TCT CTCC (forward) and 5′-CCA GAA ATA GCA TAG TGA CAA GTGCC (reverse); and SUR1, 5′-GAC CCG CAG GAA GGA GAT GAC (forward) and 5′-ACC ACA ACT GGA CAG CAG GAAC (reverse). Control reactions, where no reverse transcription was performed and where no template RNA was added, were included. cDNAs were amplified for 50 cycles by denaturing at 92 °C for 2.5 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1.5 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. The data were analyzed with SigmaStat 2.0 software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The significance of differences was determined by Student's t tests, χ2 test, and analysis of variance, as appropriate. The general experimental design concerned analysis of proliferation in cultured hepatocytes after the addition of drugs known either to open KATP channels (minoxidil, cromakalim, and pinacidil) or to inhibit KATP channel opening (quinidine and glibenclamide). Since primary rat hepatocytes exhibit limited DNA synthesis in culture, we induced DNA synthesis in these cells by exposure to 10 ng/ml hHGF for 48 h. Initial experiments were undertaken to analyze the effects of DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes. Minoxidil, cromakalim, and pinacidil increased DNA synthesis in hHGF-stimulated rat hepatocytes by severalfold (up to ∼20-fold; p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 A). Stimulation of rat hepatocytes with hHGF itself increased DNA synthesis by 4–10-fold compared with untreated control cells (p < 0.05). Interestingly, DNA synthesis was not increased in rat hepatocytes treated with K+ channel openers in the absence of hHGF. The optimal stimulatory drug concentrations were as follows: minoxidil, 500 nm (range tested, 100–1000 nm); cromakalim, 5 μm (range tested, 5–25 μm); and pinacidil, 100 μm (range tested, 5–200 μm). In contrast, culture of rat hepatocytes with tetraethylammonium, quinidine, or glibenclamide significantly inhibited hHGF-induced DNA synthesis. More extensive analysis with quinidine (12.5–250 μm) and glibenclamide (50–200 μm) showed that hHGF-induced DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited. Use of these drugs suppressed DNA synthesis induced by the combination of hHGF and K+ channel openers. In a typical experiment, 10 ng/ml hHGF increased DNA synthesis by 15 ± 3-fold and hHGF plus 500 nm minoxidil by 32 ± 6-fold above untreated control cells, whereas in response to 12.5 or 25 μm quinidine, DNA synthesis induced by hHGF and minoxidil decreased to 17 ± 1-fold and decreased further to 7 ± 1-fold above untreated control cells with 50 μmquinidine (p < 0.05, analysis of variance). Treatment of rat hepatocytes with glibenclamide showed efficient suppression of hHGF-mediated DNA synthesis (Fig. 1 B). To exclude whether inhibition of DNA synthesis could have been due to drug toxicity, utilization of MTT by cells was analyzed. It was noteworthy that neither quinidine nor glibenclamide was cytotoxic to our primary hepatocytes or HepG2, HuH-7, and HFL cell lines across the range of drug concentrations tested. However, changes in the morphology of primary hepatocytes were observed following treatment with glibenclamide (Fig. 2). The most characteristic feature was that cells appeared more rounded in culture dishes. When DNA fragmentation was analyzed by staining HepG2 cells or primary rat hepatocytes with the DNA-binding Hoechst 33258 dye, there was no evidence of increased apoptosis (Fig. 2, E andF). TUNEL staining showed the presence of some apoptosis in untreated control primary rat hepatocytes at 48 h of cell culture (∼10%), which was in agreement with the generally limited survival of primary hepatocytes under these conditions. In contrast, only occasional apoptotic nuclei were detected in hepatocytes following culture with hHGF. TUNEL positivity in glibenclamide-treated hepatocytes did not increase, and apoptosis rates remained similar to those in untreated control cells or hHGF-treated cells (Fig. 2,G and H). In control liver tissue from rats subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury, TUNEL staining showed extensive apoptosis. Further studies were undertaken in cultured HepG2, HuH-7, and HFL cells. These cells did not show significant changes in DNA synthesis after culture with 10 ng/ml hHGF. Therefore, studies were conducted by culturing these cells for 24 h with either 25 μmquinidine or 100 μm glibenclamide in the absence of hHGF. The studies showed that both K+ channel inhibitors suppressed DNA synthesis significantly by 2–5-fold in HepG2, HuH-7, and HFL cells (p < 0.05, t tests). In contrast, within 24 h of culture, exposure to 500 nmminoxidil increased DNA synthesis in HepG2 cells by 1.5-fold (p < 0.05, t test). Although a trend for greater DNA synthesis was observed in HuH-7 and HFL cells cultured with 100 μm pinacidil, this did not reach statistical significance, indicating a difference in the responsiveness of various cell lines. To determine whether inhibition of DNA synthesis was associated with sustained impairment in cell replication, we cultured HepG2 cells with 100 μm glibenclamide and measured cell numbers in culture dishes for up to 5 days. The number of untreated control cells increased by 468 ± 94% between 1 and 5 days of culture. In contrast, the number of glibenclamide-treated cells increased by 350 ± 44% during this period (p < 0.05, analysis of variance). Additional studies were undertaken to demonstrate whether clonogenic capacity of HepG2 cells was altered by glibenclamide treatment. In our colony-forming assay, at 18 days of culture, 1735 ± 61 colonies formed in dishes containing control cells, which were treated by vehicle alone, whereas 934 ± 51 colonies (56 ± 9%) formed in dishes containing 100 μm glibenclamide (p = 0.001, ttest). This suggested that inhibition of K+ channel activity affected DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, including perturbation of clonogenic capacity. The intact rat liver contained Kir6.1 and SUR1 mRNAs as well as SUR2 mRNA, although the abundances of Kir6.1 and SUR2 were greater in the rat heart compared with the rat liver (Fig. 3 A). The expression of Kir6.2 mRNA in the intact rat liver was uncertain in our hands; and therefore, analysis of Kir6.2 expression in rat hepatocytes was not pursued further. When primary rat hepatocytes were cultured for 48 h, it was still possible to detect Kir6.1, SUR1, and SUR2 mRNAs, although SUR2 mRNA was detected only at low levels (Fig.3 B). Neither hHGF nor glibenclamide altered the overall abundance of Kir6.1 or SUR2 mRNA in primary rat hepatocytes. In contrast, SUR1 mRNA expression was perturbed. In rat hepatocytes treated with glibenclamide alone compared with no treatment, the relative SUR1 mRNA expression, after normalization for β-actin expression, was consistently decreased (Fig. 3 B). Densitometric scanning showed that this decrease ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 in three independent experiments performed. In two of these three experiments, the addition of hHGF prevented glibenclamide-induced decreases in SUR1 mRNA expression. These data suggested that glibenclamide inhibited SUR1 expression, whereas hHGF could potentially prevent glibenclamide-induced inhibition of SUR1 expression. Our findings concerning Kir6.1 and SUR expression in primary rat hepatocytes were in agreement with the observations of Kir6.1 protein expression by Suzuki et al. (32Suzuki M. Kotake K. Fujikura K. Inagaki N. Suzuki T. Gonoi T. Seino S. Takata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), who studied plasma and mitochondrial membranes from primary rat hepatocytes with immunofluorescence. Also, Inoue et al. (33Inoue Y. Emoto M. Inoue H. Kaku K. Kaneko T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 284: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed binding of radiolabeled glibenclamide to hepatocyte membranes, which is in agreement with the presence of SUR in hepatocytes. Further verification of our findings concerning modulation of SUR expression will be facilitated by the availability of reliable antibodies, e.g.Western blot analysis, but this is lacking at present. In HepG2, HuH-7, and HFL cells, we were able to detect Kir6.2 as well as SUR2 mRNAs by RT-PCR. We were unable to obtain PCR products for Kir6.1 and SUR1 in our cell lines. There was no change in Kir6.2 and SUR2 mRNA expression after treatment with glibenclamide alone, which was similar to primary rat hepatocytes. To determine the functional expression of KATP channels in hepatocytes, we performed whole-cell current recordings with the patch-clamp technique. ATP, an inhibitor of KATP channel activity, was excluded from the internal pipette solution, and 5 mm UDP, a channel activator, was included. In primary hepatocytes cultured for 24 h, the reversal potential shifted toward the equilibrium potential for K+ upon the addition of minoxidil (n = 6) and pinacidil (n = 3) (Fig.4 A and TableI). The current-voltage plot in Fig. 4 A shows a minoxidil-activated current with some inward rectification in isolated hepatocytes. This current was inhibited by glibenclamide (Table I), which was in agreement with KATPchannel activity. The subtraction of current recorded in the presence of glibenclamide from K+ channel openers yielded an inward current of 16 ± 19 pA/pF and an outward current of 48 ± 70 pA/pF with a reversal potential of −64 ± 2 mV in primary rat hepatocytes.Table IElectrophysiological analysis of cellsConditionPrimary rat hepatocytesHepG2 cellsInward current density at −140 mVOutward current density at 80 mVReversal potentialInward current density at −140 mVOutward current density at 80 mVReversal potentialpA/pFpA/pFmVpA/pFpA/pFmVBasal, untreated171 ± 132135 ± 139−8 ± 1718 ± 3722 ± 42−48 ± 26Pinacidil-activated1-aData demonstrate pinacidil-activated currents, which were obtained by subtraction analysis of currents under untreated basal conditions and after pinacidil treatment of cells.33 ± 6218 ± 31−71 ± 2411 ± 1219 ± 28−55 ± 16Pinacidil plus glibenclamide1-bData show the KATPcomponent of the total currents and wer"
https://openalex.org/W2025239531,"Most general anesthetics including long chain aliphatic alcohols act as noncompetitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). To locate the sites of interaction of a long chain alcohol with the Torpedo nAChR, we have used the photoactivatible alcohol 3-[3H]azioctanol, which inhibits the nAChR and photoincorporates into nAChR subunits. At 1 and 275 μm, 3-[3H]azioctanol photoincorporated into nAChR subunits with increased incorporation in the α-subunit in the desensitized state. The incorporation into the α-subunit was mapped to two large proteolytic fragments. One fragment of ∼20 kDa (αV8-20), containing the M1, M2, and M3 transmembrane segments, showed enhanced incorporation in the presence of agonist whereas the other of ∼10 kDa (αV8-10), containing the M4 transmembrane segment, did not show agonist-induced incorporation of label. Within αV8-20, the primary site of incorporation was αGlu-262 at the C-terminal end of αM2, labeled preferentially in the desensitized state. The incorporation at αGlu-262 approached saturation between 1 μm, with ∼6% labeled, and 275 μm, with ∼30% labeled. Low level incorporation was seen in residues at the agonist binding site and the protein-lipid interface at ∼1% of the levels in αGlu-262. Therefore, the primary binding site of 3-azioctanol is within the ion channel with additional lower affinity interactions within the agonist binding site and at the protein-lipid interface.

However, in recent years, evidence for the direct interaction between general anesthetics and specific proteins has accumulated (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). In particular, at clinically effective concentrations most volatile general anesthetics perturb ligand-gated ion channels. For example, they enhance agonist action on inhibitory receptors including most GABAA1 and glycine receptors. They also noncompetitively inhibit excitatory receptors such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and serotonin 5HT3 receptor. These ion channels belong to a superfamily that is composed of five homologous subunits arranged as a pseudopentamer with each subunit composed of a large N-terminal extracellular segment and four transmembrane segments, M1-M4. The two agonist binding sites are located in the N-terminal extracellular segment at subunit interfaces. Based on photoaffinity labeling and mutational analyses of the nAChR, the M2 segments of each subunit are α-helices arranged around the central axis and contribute to the lumen of the nAChR ion channel. Additionally, several nAChR noncompetitive antagonists have been shown to bind within the lumen of the ion channel (2Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 3Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J.

Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Although evidence exists for direct binding of anesthetics on ligand-gated ion channels, the binding sites have not been clearly located. In the GABAA and glycine receptors, mutational analyses have identified two residues, one each in the transmembrane segments M2 and M3, which modulate the action of a variety of general anesthetics, including long chain alcohols (5Wick M.J. Mihic S.J. Ueno S. Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Brozowski S.J. Ye Q. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6504-6509Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6McGurk K.A.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These residues have been hypothesized to contribute to an anesthetic site (8Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchines V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), but other groups (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 9Pistis M. Belelli D. McGurk K. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 515: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Birnir B. Tierney M.L. Dalziel J.E. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have suggested that these and neighboring residues act allosterically on anesthetic sites elsewhere in the receptor. In muscle nAChR, single channel studies with long chain alcohols and other anesthetics, such as isoflurane, suggest that these anesthetics bind within the ion channel. The open channel state in the presence of these drugs is characterized by flickering, similar to that seen with QX-222, an aromatic amine channel blocker (11Dilger J.P. Liu Y. Vidal A.M. Eur. J. Anaesthesiol. 1995; 12: 31-39PubMed Google Scholar). However, butanol and hexanol do not compete with QX-222 for a common binding site (12Dilger J.P. Vidal A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 169-175PubMed Google Scholar). In flux studies with nAChR-rich membranes from Torpedo electric organ, octanol and heptanol do compete with each other but not with procaine (13Wood S.C. Tonner P.H. Dearmendi A.J. Bugge B. Miller K.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of muscle nAChR has shown that the nature of the residue at the M2 position 10′ (based on numbering from the conserved positive charge at the N terminus of M2), facing the lumen of the ion channel, can increase the potency of long chain alcohols and isoflurane as channel blockers (14Forman S.A. Miller K.W. Yellen G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 574-581PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the difficulty of interpreting mutational studies in this highly allosteric family of receptors, a complementary approach, photoaffinity labeling, is attractive. The photoaffinity general anesthetic 3-azioctanol was developed (15Husain S.S. Forman S.A. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Olsen R.W. Pratt M.B. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as a probe of the binding sites of long chain alcohols. This compound acts as an anesthetic in tadpoles, producing a loss of righting reflex with an EC50of ∼160 μm, an EC50 that is about one-third of the potency of octanol. For the GABAA receptor, 3-azioctanol potentiates the response to submaximal concentrations of GABA, and it inhibits agonist activation of muscle-type nAChR. Additionally, 1 μm 3-[3H]azioctanol was shown to photoincorporate into subunits of the Torpedo nAChR with preferential incorporation into the α-subunit in the presence of agonist. This agonist-dependent incorporation was localized to a 20-kDa fragment containing the first three transmembrane fragments. In the present work, 3-[3H]azioctanol has been used as a photoaffinity probe to localize further the sites of interaction of a long chain alcohol with Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes. The primary site of incorporation in the presence of agonist was mapped to αGlu-262, at the C terminus of αM2. Additional sites of incorporation were found although at lower efficiency than the incorporation at αGlu-262. The levels of incorporation at 1 and 275 μm indicated that the incorporation at αGlu-262 approached saturation across this concentration range, whereas the incorporation at the other sites increased linearly. Therefore, αGlu-262 is within the high affinity binding site of long chain alcohol anesthetics. nAChR-enriched membranes were isolated fromTorpedo californica electric organ (16Pedersen S.E. Sharp S.D. Liu W.-S. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10489-10499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final membrane suspensions were stored in 38% sucrose at −80 °C under argon. The membranes used here contained 0.5–2.0 nmol of acetylcholine binding sites per milligram of protein. 3-[3H]Azioctanol and nonradioactive 3-azioctanol were synthesized as described previously (15Husain S.S. Forman S.A. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Olsen R.W. Pratt M.B. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the 3-[3H]azioctanol was ∼11 Ci/mmol. This stock was stored at −20 °C in CH2Cl2, which was removed via evaporation immediately prior to the addition of membranes or isotopic dilution. For studies of incorporation at concentrations higher than 1 μm 3-[3H]azioctanol, this stock was isotopically diluted with a stock of nonradioactive 3-azioctanol, 11 mm (concentration determined by the absorbance of 3-azioctanol at 350 nm (15Husain S.S. Forman S.A. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Olsen R.W. Pratt M.B. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) in Torpedo physiological saline (TPS: 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0), to a final specific activity of ∼0.04 Ci/mmol. This dilution was prepared immediately before addition to membranes. Staphylococcus aureus glutamylendopeptidase (V8 protease) was from ICN Biomedical Inc, endoproteinase Lys C (EndoLysC) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and phencyclidine from Alltech Associates. Gallamine triethyl iodide was from Lederle, phenyltrimethylammonium from Aldrich, and trifluoroacetic acid was from Pierce. 1-Azidopyrene (1-AP) was purchased from Molecular Probes. 10% Genapol C-100 was from Calbiochem. Nicotine, d-tubocurarine, and carbamylcholine were from Sigma. Pancuronium was from Organon; α-bungarotoxin (αBgTx) was purchased from Biotoxins, Inc. For analytical labeling experiments, freshly thawed Torpedo membranes were diluted with TPS and pelleted (15000 × g) for 30 min, and the pellets were resuspended in TPS at 2 mg/ml protein (∼1 μm nAChR). Membrane aliquots (100 μg per condition) were combined with 3-[3H]azioctanol in the absence or presence of other ligands as noted in the figure legends. When one of the conditions contained αBgTx, the samples were incubated for 2 h in the dark at room temperature in glass vials; otherwise, the samples were irradiated within 3 min of the addition of drugs. The suspensions were irradiated at 365 nm (Spectroline lamp EN-16) for 10 min in a plastic 96-well plate on ice. The incorporation in the presence of carbamylcholine after 10 min of photolysis was near the half-maximal incorporation in nAChR α-subunit, with the maximum near 40 min of photolysis. The incorporation in the α-subunit in the presence of carbamylcholine without irradiation was 4% of the levels seen following 10 min irradiation. For the remainder of the experiments, the photolysis was carried out for 10 min. The suspensions were diluted with sample loading buffer and directly submitted to SDS-PAGE. For proteolytic mapping of 3-[3H]azioctanol-labeled α-subunit with S. aureus V8 protease (17Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), labeling was carried out with 400 μg (analytical mapping) or 10 mg (preparative) nAChR-rich Torpedo membranes. For analytical mapping, samples were photolyzed in a 24-well plate, whereas for preparative mapping the samples were photolyzed in glass screw-top vials with a stir bar. Following photolysis, the membrane suspensions were pelleted as described above. For analytical mapping, samples were resuspended in sample buffer and submitted to SDS-PAGE. For preparative mapping, samples were resuspended at 2 mg/ml in TPS. The samples were labeled further with 1-AP (19Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) to ease identification and isolation of subunits and fragments from gels. 1-AP (62.5 mm in Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 500 μm. After a 90-min incubation, the samples were photolyzed for 15 min on ice using a 365 nm lamp (Spectroline EN-16). Membranes were pelleted (15,000 × g) for 30 min, resuspended in sample buffer, and submitted to SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), with modifications (18White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For analytical gels, the polypeptides were resolved on a 1-mm thick 8% acrylamide gel and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (0.25% w/v in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid). For autoradiography, the gels were impregnated with fluor (Amplify, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed at −80 °C to Eastman Kodak X-OMAT film for various times (6–8 weeks). Additionally, incorporation of3H into individual polypeptides was quantified by scintillation counting of excised gel slices (21Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For analytical V8-mapping gels, following electrophoresis, the gels were briefly stained with Coomassie Blue and destained to allow visualization of the subunits. The α-subunits were then excised and placed directly into individual wells of a 1.5-mm mapping gel, composed of a 5-cm 4.5% acrylamide stacking gel, and a 15-cm 15% acrylamide separating gel. Into each well was added 1:1 gram subunit:gram S. aureus V8 protease in overlay buffer (5% sucrose, 125 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.8). The gel was run at 150 V for 2 h, and then the current was turned off for 1 h. The gel was then run at constant current overnight until the dye front reached the end of the gel. The gel was stained, and 3H was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For preparative labeling, the polypeptides were resolved on a 1.5-mm thick 8% acrylamide gel. The α-subunit was identified in 8% gels by 1-AP fluorescence and then excised and loaded directly onto the 1.5-mm mapping gels. The α-subunit proteolytic fragments of ∼20 kDa (αV8-20) and ∼10 kDa (αV8-10) were identified by fluorescence and excised. The region between αV8-20 and αV8-10 was excised to isolate αV8-18. The excised proteolytic fragments were isolated by passive elution into 0.1m NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS (19Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The eluate was filtered (Whatman No. 1) and concentrated using MilliporeMr 5,000 concentrators. To remove excess SDS, acetone was added to the concentrate. Following incubation at −20 °C overnight, the peptides were pelleted. For EndoLysC digestion, acetone-precipitated subunits or subunit fragments were resuspended in 15 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 0.1% SDS. EndoLysC (1.5 milliunit in resuspension buffer) was added to a final volume of 100 μl. The digestion was allowed to proceed for 7–9 days before separation of fragments by HPLC. For S. aureus V8 protease digestion in solution, acetone-precipitated peptides were resuspended in 15 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 0.1% SDS. V8 protease in resuspension buffer was added to a final concentration of 1:1 (w/w) and incubated at room temperature for 3–4 days before separation of fragments by HPLC. For trypsin digestion, acetone-precipitated peptides were resuspended in a small volume (40 μl) of 100 mmNH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.8. Genapol C-100 and trypsin were added to a final concentration of 0.02% SDS, 0.5% Genapol C-100, and 1:1 (w/w) trypsin. The digestion was allowed to proceed 3–4 days at room temperature prior to separation of the fragments by HPLC. Proteolytic fragments from enzymatic digestion of αV8-20 and αV8-10 fragments labeled with 3-[3H]azioctanol were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC (22Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), using a Brownlee C4-Aquapore column (100 × 2.1 mm, 7-μm particle size). Solvent A was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol. A nonlinear gradient (Waters Model 680 gradient controller, curve No. 7) from 25 to 100% solvent B in 80 min was used. The rate of flow was 0.2 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The elution of peptides was monitored by absorbance at 215 nm, and the fluorescence from 1-AP was detected by fluorescence emission (357-nm excitation, 432-nm emission). Additionally, aliquots from the fractions were taken to determine the distribution of3H by liquid scintillation counting. Intact αV8-18 and αV8-18 proteolytic fragments were also purified by HPLC (23Cohen J.B. Sharp S.D. Liu W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23354-23364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a Brownlee C4-Aquapore column. Solvent A was 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. A linear gradient with several steps was used: 0 min, 10% solvent B; 10 min, 10% solvent B; 25 min, 25% solvent B; 45 min, 40% solvent B; 65 min, 60% solvent B; 75 min, 100% solvent B. The rate of flow was 0.25 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Measurements were determined as for the purification of the fragments of enzymatic digestion. Automated N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems Model 477A protein sequencer with an in-line 120A PTH analyzer. HPLC samples (450-μl fractions) were directly loaded onto chemically modified glass fiber disks (Beckman) in 20-μl aliquots, allowing the solvent to evaporate at 40 °C between loads. Sequencing was performed using gas-phase trifluoroacetic acid to minimize possible hydrolysis. After conversion of the released amino acids to PTH-amino acids, the suspension was divided into two parts. One portion, approximately one-third, went to the PTH analyzer whereas the remaining two-thirds were collected for scintillation counting. Yield of PTH-amino acids was calculated from peak height compared with standards using the Model 610A Data Analysis Program Version 1.2.1. Initial and repetitive yields were calculated by a nonlinear least squares regression to the equation M= I0 × R n, where M is the observed release, I0 is the initial yield, R is the repetitive yield, and n is the cycle number. PTH-derivatives known to have poor recovery (Ser, Arg, Cys, and His) were omitted from the fit. Incorporation of radioactivity in fragments and residues was quantified based on the results of sequence analysis. For the αV8-20 and αV8-10 fragments, approximately equal aliquots were subjected to either liquid scintillation counting or sequence analysis. Prior to sequencing, these samples (because they contained SDS) were treated on the sequencing filters for 4 min with gas-phase trifluoroacetic acid, followed by a 5-min wash with ethyl acetate. To estimate incorporation in large subunit fragments (αV8-20 and αV8-10) or in fragments isolated by HPLC, incorporation was calculated as the 3H loaded divided by three times the observed initial yield of the sequence (three times because only one-third of the PTH-amino acids was measured for mass calculations). Because even under favorable conditions less than 50% of the material loaded is capable of being sequenced, this calculation is an overestimate. For incorporation at specific residues, the mass of that residue was calculated from the initial and repetitive yields. The increased 3H release in that cycle (cpmn–cpmn-1) was divided by twice the mass of that cycle (twice because 2-fold more PTH-amino acids were assayed for 3H than for mass). In this calculation, the radioactivity released and the mass levels reflect only the sequenced material. Initial experiments were designed to characterize the general pattern of photoincorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol and to test the sensitivity of photoincorporation to various ligands. For these initial experiments, two concentrations of 3-[3H]azioctanol were used, 1 μm (11 Ci/mmol) and 275 μm (0.04 Ci/mmol). For inhibition of Torpedo nAChR using flux assays, the IC50 of 3-azioctanol is ∼100 μm. 2M. A. Kloczewiak and K. W. Miller, unpublished data.Therefore, 1 μm 3-[3H]azioctanol was well below the concentration necessary for inhibition of 50% of the nAChR, whereas 275 μm 3-[3H]azioctanol was a concentration sufficient to produce greater than 50% inhibition. Isotopic dilution of 3-[3H]azioctanol resulted in the presence of similar levels of 3H in the samples containing 1 μm and 275 μm3-[3H]azioctanol. Membranes (2 mg/ml protein) were equilibrated with 3-[3H]azioctanol in the presence and absence of 2 mm carbamylcholine. After irradiation for 10 min at 365 nm, the pattern of incorporation was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography or scintillation counting of gel slices. As seen in the fluorograph of the 8% polyacrylamide gel (Fig.1 A) at both 3-[3H]azioctanol concentrations in the absence of carbamylcholine, the principal polypeptide labeled was a 34-kDa polypeptide identified as a mitochondrial chloride channel (VDAC) (24Blanton M.P. Dangott L.J. Raja S.K. Lala A.K. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8659-8668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The 3H incorporation in VDAC, although not affected by the presence of carbamylcholine, was reduced by 50% at the higher concentration of 3-[3H]azioctanol. This decrease suggests specific incorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol in VDAC, which is inhibited by excess non-radioactive 3-azioctanol. The 3H incorporation in other non-receptor polypeptides (rapsyn (43 kDa) and the α-subunit of (Na+/K+)-ATPase (αNK)) was not altered by the presence of carbamylcholine and appeared similar at 1 and 275 μm 3-[3H]azioctanol. Of the nAChR subunits, α was labeled most strongly. Incorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol into the α-subunit was dependent on the conformational state of the nAChR, as the presence of agonist resulted in enhanced incorporation into the α-subunit but not in non-nAChR polypeptides. Based on scintillation counting of excised gel slices, the increase in incorporation was on average ∼5-fold at 1 μm 3-[3H]azioctanol (Fig. 1 B) and ∼3-fold at 275 μm. The presence of agonist also increased the incorporation in the β-subunit, although only by ∼1.4-fold at 1 μm. Because the 3-[3H]azioctanol at 275 μm had an ∼275-fold lower specific activity, the observed similarity in the3H incorporation in the α-subunit at the two conditions indicated that the α-subunit labeled in the presence of 275 μm 3-[3H]azioctanol contained ∼275-fold more moles of 3-azioctanol per mol of subunit. The enhancement of 3-[3H]azioctanol photolabeling in the α-subunit by carbamylcholine as well as other cholinergic agonists and competitive antagonists (Fig. 2) was determined by quantification of 3H incorporation in gel slices. At concentrations sufficient to fully occupy the ACh site, the agonists phenyltrimethylammonium and nicotine increased 3-[3H]azioctanol photoincorporation in the α-subunit to the same extent as carbamylcholine. The presence of the competitive antagonists d-tubocurarine and gallamine, known to partially desensitize the receptor (25Pedersen S.E. Papineni R.V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31141-31150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Medynski D.C. Histrionicotoxin and Aromatic Amine Interactions with Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor from Torpedo: Characterization of Equilibrium Binding and Kinetic Properties. Ph.D. thesis. Harvard University, 1983Google Scholar), resulted in incorporation in the α-subunit ∼60% of that seen in the presence of carbamylcholine, whereas for pancuronium, a competitive antagonist that is not known to desensitize the receptor, 3-[3H]azioctanol incorporation into the α-subunit was similar to that seen in the absence of carbamylcholine. No effect of these cholinergic drugs was seen on the incorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol into non-nAChR polypeptides including rapsyn (43 kDa), calelectrin (37 kDa), or the (Na+/K+)-ATPase α-subunit (data not shown). The dependence of nAChR α-subunit-labeling upon carbamylcholine concentration indicated that the enhanced labeling was a property of the desensitized state of the nAChR. Incorporation as a function of carbamylcholine concentration was well fit by a single site model, with a K = 4 μm (data not shown). Whereas this value for the concentration of carbamylcholine producing 50% enhancement was higher than the directly measuredKeq of 0.1 μm (27Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), this discrepancy was not unexpected because the photolabeling experiment was carried out at a concentration of ACh sites of 2.2 μm. The effects of several noncompetitive antagonists on the incorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol at 1 μm were also tested (Fig. 3 A). For membranes equilibrated with carbamylcholine, the 3H incorporation in the nAChR α-subunit was insensitive to the presence of 1 mm octanol. At 100 μm, meproadifen, an aromatic amine noncompetitive antagonist, reduced the incorporation by ∼50%. Two other aromatic amine noncompetitive antagonists, phencyclidine and QX-222, failed to inhibit the incorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol in the α-subunit (data not shown). The presence of these noncompetitive antagonists did not affect the incorporation in the other nAChR subunits (data not shown) nor the incorporation in non-nAChR polypeptides including rapsyn (43 kDa), VDAC (34 kDa), and calectrin (37 kDa) (data not shown). The effects of meproadifen were also studied in the presence of 275 μm 3-[3H]azioctanol (Fig. 3 B). At that concentration the presence of carbamylcholine resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in the incorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol in the α-subunit over that seen in the absence of carbamylcholine. In the presence of carbamylcholine, meproadifen reduced the incorporation by ∼50%. In the absence of carbamylcholine, meproadifen actually enhanced the 3-[3H]azioctanol incorporation. In the presence of αBgTx, meproadifen did not alter the 3-[3H]azioctanol incorporation in the α-subunit. The incorporation in rapsyn (43 kDa) was not affected by the presence of these cholinergic drugs. The incorporation of 3-[3H]azioctanol in nAChR α-subunit was measured over a range of 3-[3H]azioctanol concentrations, using a constant specific activity of 3-[3H]azioctanol (Fig. 4). The incorporation in the (Na+/K+)-ATPase α-subunit (open symbols) increased linearly across the range of concentrations tested and was not affected by the presence of cholinergic drugs. For membranes equilibrated with carbamylcholine, the incorporation in the α-subunit increased up to ∼1 mmand then appeared to saturate. At all concentrations, the incorporation in the presence of αBgTx was less than that seen in the absence of added drugs although at ∼2 mm the incorporation in the presence of αBgTx was similar to that seen in the presence of carbamylcholine. In the absence of drug, the incorporation appeared to increase nearly linearly up to 1 mm, and then the incorporation increased sharply, surpassing the incorporation in the presence of carbamylcholine at 2 mm. However, the higher incorporation in the absence of carbamylcholine showed high variability. The total 3H incorporation at ∼2 mm 3-[3H]azioctanol was ∼0.25 mol of 3-[3H]azioctanol/mol of α, based on the reported counting efficiency (25%) of the toluene-based gel mixture used (21Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The distribution of 3-[3H]azioctanol incorporation within the α-subunit was examined by digestion of the labeled subunit with S. aureusV8 protease under conditions that are known to generate four large non-overlapping fragments resolvable by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5, inset). The largest fragment, a 20-kDa peptide (αV8-20), begins at αSer-173 and contains the first three membrane spanning regions, αM1, αM2, and αM3 (18White B.H. Cohen J.B.

Proliferation assays confirmed that MCF-7 cells were highly responsive to FGF-2 complexed with GAGB, whereas migration assays indicated that FGF-1/HSGAGA combinations were stimulatory for the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells.

Cross-linking demonstrated that FGF-2/HSGAGB primarily activated FGFR1, which in turn up-regulated the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase; in contrast, FGF-1/HSGAGA led to the phosphorylation of equal proportions of both FGFR1 and FGFR2, which in turn led to the up-regulation of Src and p125FAK. MDA-MB-231 cells were particularly responsive to vitronectin substrates in the presence of FGF-1/HSGAGA, and blocking antibodies established that they used the αvβ3 integrin to bind to it.

They are also involved in many forms of cancer cell growth and metastasis (5Burgess A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Sashihara S. Tsuji S. Matsui T. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). There have been at least 17 different isoforms of this factor so far described, and one of the major themes of FGF biology has been the ongoing effort to discover how each factor delivers a biologically relevant signal in ways that are tissue-specific. This problem is compounded by the fact that there are four different major forms of FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase, each of which can be spliced by differential exon usage into multiple species (7Galzie Z. Kinsella A.R. Smith J.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8Uruno T. Komi A. Imamura T. Seikagaku. 1998; 70: 446-453PubMed Google Scholar). Exactly which form of FGF binds to which FGFR to drive a particular biological outcome in any tissue remains unclear. It is known that FGFs use an accessory form of receptor to bind to their cognate cell-surface receptors more efficiently. These are heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan (HSGAG) sugars, which are usually found as part of transmembrane or cell-associated proteoglycan complexes (9Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Exactly how HS interacts with the FGFs so that they can bind to their high affinity receptors remains controversial (7Galzie Z. Kinsella A.R. Smith J.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); it may simply be the case that they passively dimerize the FGFs, or FGFRs, so that signal transduction can occur (10Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100 Suppl. 11: S67-S75Google Scholar). Recently, more interesting hypotheses have asserted that domains within HS chains are able to cross-link FGFs with FGFRs to form activated ternary complexes (11Jang J.H. Wang F. Kan M. In Vitro Cell.

This is coincident with the variable expression of FGFRs as either long three-Ig loop forms or shorter two-loop forms seen more often in malignant cells (22McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar); the shorter forms of receptor bind HS more avidly and are thus activated more easily than the native longer forms. FGFs, particularly the archetypal forms FGF-1 and FGF-2, have been detected within human breast tumors as well as normal breast epithelial and myoepithelial cells (23Rudland P.S. Platt-Higgins A.M.

Barraclough R. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 63: 1-20PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2 is mitogenic for breast epithelial cell lines such as MCF-7 and T-47D, although hormone-independent MDA-MB-231 cells do not become sensitive to FGFs until inhibitory HS is removed from their surfaces by chlorate treatment (28Delehedde M. Deudon E. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Biochemical purification of HS from both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells reveals very different HS profiles, lending support to the idea that the behavior of breast tumor cells in an FGF-rich environment is contingent upon these accessory sites (28Delehedde M. Deudon E. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has recently received important support from biosensor assays (29Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), where it was found that FGF-2-binding HS occurred with two separable activities: one strongly held FGF-2 away from cognate cell receptors, and the other, of lower affinity, appeared to be permissive for FGF-2 and its receptors. We have previously purified forms of HS from a neuroepithelial cell line that have affinities for either FGF-1 or FGF-2, depending on the phenotypic state of the cells (19Brickman Y.G. Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Brickman Y.G. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F.

Development. 1992; 116: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar). When the cells are maintained in proliferative phase, their HS chains remain relatively short and moderately sulfated; as they begin to differentiate, the chains become longer and more complex, with greater degrees of sulfation. These chains have been purified and shown to have FGF-potentiating activity on a wide variety of other cell types, including amphibian cells (31Walz A. McFarlane S. Brickman Y.G. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F. Holt C.E. Development. 1997; 124: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to explore the differences in response to FGFs that could be induced in breast cancer cells by HS preparations with known specificities. Proliferation and migration assays were carried out on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of GAGA, which potentiates the actions of FGF-1, or GAGB, which potentiates FGF-2 (20Brickman Y.G. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4350-4359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). FGFR profiles for each cell type were obtained by RT-PCR, and the activation of the receptors by FGF/GAG combinations was monitored by cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and phosphotyrosine assays. The results indicate that the different HS preparations activate different combinations of FGFRs, which in turn leads to differential activation of MAPK, Src, FAK, and integrins and thus rates of breast cancer proliferation and migration. We conclude that HSGAGB interacts with FGF-2 to drive proliferation through FGFR1 and that HSGAGA interacts with FGF-1 to drive a mixed proliferation and migration signal through FGFR1/FGFR2 association. We conclude that extracellular HS can help direct the phenotypic behavior of breast cancer cells through the differential activation of FGFRs.

Briefly, 8 × 107 cells from 40–60 mice embryos of the appropriate ages were cultured in serum-free medium for harvesting and fractionation. The conditioned medium from either the embryonic day 10 or 12 cells was chromatographed on DEAE-Sephacel, and fractions were treated with neuraminidase, chondroitin ABC lyase, and Pronase. HS chains were removed from the core protein with NaBH4, and samples were run on Sepharose CL-6B columns for sizing of the released HS chains. [3H]Thymidine and [35S]cysteine/methionine were from ICN. Heparitinase I (heparin-sulfate lyase, EC 4.2.2.8) was obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo). Western blot bands were visualized with ECL+ reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitated on a Storm Fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) using NIH ImageQuant software.

Heparin (low molecular mass) was from Sigma. Matrigel was from Calbiochem. The human breast tumor cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and routinely grown as monolayer cultures. They were maintained in improved modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 20 mm HEPES, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 5 μg/ml insulin. Cells were maintained in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cultures were washed three times in modified Eagle's medium and replaced with medium containing the appropriate ligands. Cells in exponential phase growth were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and starved for 24 h in fresh serum-free medium containing transferrin (30 μg/ml). Either FGF-1 or FGF-2 was then added at 5 ng/ml with nominated amounts of HS, and the cells were incubated for 24 h in 24-well plates. By this point S phase synthesis had reached a maximum, and 1.5 μm [3H]thymidine was added to the cultures for a further 1 h; cells were then prepared for scintillation counting (19Brickman Y.G. Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In some experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with heparitinase I (0.05 IU/ml) for 3 h prior to the assay, with the same dose added upon addition of the FGF/HS combinations and every 8 h through the 24-h assay period. Cells (2 × 105) were plated onto Matrigel-coated substrates (32Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J.A. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) in 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes and allowed to settle and adhere for 30 min within an incubator. They were then removed to a heated stage within a CO2-controlled environment surrounding an Olympus IM35 inverted phase microscope. Cells were monitored over 150 min by time-lapse video recording (Panasonic TL260 set at 1 frame/6 s capture rate). Rates of cell movement were assessed by the digital image analysis system, which converted the video into the Quicktime format. The movement of 50 cells per treatment was assessed, and the whole experiment was repeated twice. To assess which integrin receptor class might be involved in migration, anti-integrin blocking antibodies (100 μg/ml) were added to the medium as the cells were placed in the controlled environment surrounding the microscope stage. Movement was assessed as described above. To confirm specific blocking by the antibodies, cells were cultured on murine vitronectin, laminin, thrombospondin, or collagen IV (Sigma; all applied at a coating concentration of 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature). These were coated over a control layer of poly-l-ornithine (32Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J.A. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) in the presence of soluble FGF/HS ligand combinations. Amounts of each of the FGFR IIIb and IIIc isoforms were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using the same primers as described previously (19Brickman Y.G. Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T.

In addition, an extra primer spanning an intron (5′-AAGTCTCAGTAATCCTCTCAATCG-3′), directed against the N terminus of FGFR1, was used to assess the amounts of long three-Ig loop FGFR1 forms as opposed to the shorter two-Ig loop forms. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (5 × 107) were maintained in serum-free medium in 10-cm plastic dishes for 24 h, and their RNAs were extracted with TriPure Isolation reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RT-PCR (Titan One-Tube, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then performed with the appropriate receptor isoform primers. The same RNA batch preparation was used for all the FGFR determinations within a series. Each receptor isoform RNA isolate was then independently assessed for optimal cycling conditions for amplification, both by varying total RNA concentration and the number of amplification cycles according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cycling conditions for amplification were 2 min at 94 °C; 10 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s; annealing at 52 °C for 30 s; elongation at 68 °C for 45 s, followed by prolonged elongation for 7 min for 68 °C. For FGFR1, for a set 0.5 μg of total RNA, signals were in the linear range for 17–28 cycles; for FGFR2, 22–33 cycles; for FGFR3, 21–28 cycles; and for FGFR4, 35–45 cycles. Determination of the levels of PCR product was by capillary electrophoresis through 0.2-μm polyacrylamide-coated capillaries in a P/ACE System 2100 (Packard Instrument Co.) using laser-induced fluorescence (argon laser at 488 nm, with the emission collected through a band-pass filter at 520 nm using the exact method in the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Injection of samples was over 60 s, with separation at 175 V/cm. Levels of expression were quantified by integrating peak areas in relative fluorescence units for the primers (i.e. the PCR product as compared with the total fluorescence). Binding of FGF/HSGAG combinations was carried out essentially according to the methods of Spivak-Kroizman et al. (33Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells, pre-exposed to [35S]cysteine/methionine for 18 h, were washed and resuspended in serum-free medium and exposed to different FGF/HSGAG combinations as described below. Some preparations of MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with heparitinase I as detailed above to remove inhibitory HS species that might interfere with the binding results. After 60 min in the presence of the cross-linker DSS (0.3 mm in Me2SO), the cells were pelleted (800 rpm for 5 min), lysed on ice (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmbenzamide, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations in the clarified lysates were determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR1, anti-FGFR2, anti-FGFR3, or anti-FGFR4 antibodies according to the methods of Lin et al. (34Lin H.Y. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. Halegoua S. Hayman M.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4579-4587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); boiled (5 min); and subjected to 5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and receptor complexes were revealed by autoradiography using Kodak XAR film. Bands were analyzed with NIH ImageQuant software. Some cells in suspension were exposed to various FGF/HS combinations for a period of 5–30 min and lysed as described above. Lysates were clarified by the addition of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pansorbin, Calbiochem), followed by centrifugation and protein concentration determination. Aliquots of the supernatant of each sample (1 mg) were incubated with anti-FGFR antibodies for 1 h on ice. Pansorbin was added for an additional 30 min, and the pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed, boiled in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and the membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 overnight at 4 °C, rinsed, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed and visualized as described above with the ECL+ reagent. MAPK activity was determined by immunoprecipitation of lysates with anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies as described above and revealed on gels with an in vitroassay using myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate, where the phosphorylated myelin basic protein was visualized by autoradiography (35LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Src kinase activity was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Src monoclonal antibody 327 (35LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The antibody complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 10 mm MnCl2) and were subsequently incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min. The phosphorylated proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by autoradiography. Subsequently, immunoblot analysis was performed using the anti-Src-2 antibody (35LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The activity of FAK was assessed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with rabbit anti-mouse FAK antibody (Sigma) and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10. The effects of various concentrations of HSGAGs on the response of cells to FGF-1 or FGF-2 in serum-free medium were assessed by both microscopic examination (Fig. 1) and thymidine incorporation after 24 h of exposure. The stimulatory effect of the HSGAGs was dose-dependent, although they had a much greater effect on the MCF-7 cells than on the MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.2). The greatest potentiating effect of HSGAGB on MCF-7 cells was reached at 5 μg/ml with an FGF-2 concentration of 5 ng/ml; at higher levels, its potentiating effects began to decline, consistent with it now interfering with the access of the growth factor to the cell surface. In all cases, where the incorrect combination of FGF-2/HSGAGA or FGF-1/HSGAGB was used, no effects were seen above controls. The stimulatory effects of HSGAGA and FGF-1 on MCF-7 cells were not as dramatic as those of HSGAGB, but were greater than controls. The effects of HSGAGs and FGFs on native MDA-MB-321 cells were very much less than those on MCF-7 cells, indeed almost negligible, consistent with previous findings that demonstrated an endogenous, FGF-inhibitory HS species associated with these cells (28Delehedde M. Deudon E. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although pretreating the cells with heparitinase I reduced the inhibitory effects of endogenous HS on the cells, an effect noted by Rahmoune et al. (29Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) after sodium chlorate treatment, the HSGAG potentiation was less than for the MCF-7 cells. We used low concentration heparitinase I treatment here as a milder and more specific form of removal of these endogenous inhibitory HS sequences and maintained it in the medium during treatment with the FGF/HSGAG combinations. Although it is likely that the maintained heparitinase I treatment affects the exogenous experimental HSGAGs, we have previously shown it to liberate active, FGF-binding GAG subdomains from HS chains (18Brickman Y.G.

Nonetheless, it was clear with these cells that the FGF-2/HSGAGB combination provided a greater drive for proliferation than did the FGF-1/HSGAGA combination.Figure 2Dynamics of DNA synthesis in MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells maintained in FGF/HS ligand combinations for 24 h and tritiated thymidine for the last hour. Native MCF-7 cells (black bars) or heparitinase I-pretreated MDA-MB-231 cells (white bars) were left alone (control (Con)) or exposed to porcine heparin alone (5 μg/ml), to HSGAGB or HSGAGA alone (5 μg/ml), to FGF-2 alone (5 ng/ml), to FGF-2 and nonspecific heparin (5 ng/ml to 5 μg/ml), to FGF-2 with the incorrect HSGAGA (50 μg/ml), or to increasing levels of HSGAGB in the presence of a fixed FGF-2 concentration (5 ng/ml). Analogous experiments were carried out on the two cell types with FGF-1. The pretreatment was used to try to nullify the effects of endogenous inhibitory HS species on this cell type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The addition of FGF-1/GAGA to substrates led to noticeable changes in the cell morphologies of both the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells; the cells became much more stellate, with greater proportions of lamellipodia and filopodia and trailing edges (Fig. 1). As this influence seemed to be a stimulus for cells to move, we quantitated rates of cell migration on different FGF/HS combinations with time-lapse photomicrography. Dispersed cells were plated onto either designated FGF/HS-coated substrates or Matrigel and allowed to adhere, and their movements were recorded over the following 150 min. These tapes were then processed through the digital image analysis system. The cells showed by far the greatest migratory behavior in medium containing FGF-1/HSGAGA. Although this effect was greatest for the highly motile MDA-MB-231 cells, it could also be seen in the more quiescent MCF-7 cells (Fig.3). Increases in motility were seen on HSGAGA or FGF-1 alone, but the effects of their combination were additive and led to noticeably greater migratory speeds. Interestingly, these speeds were not maintained over the 150 min, but plateaued out after ∼60 min. In contrast, the motility observed when either MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to FGF-2, either alone or in combination with HSGAGB, was barely above control levels. In all cases where the incorrect combination of FGF-2/HSGAGA or FGF-1/HSGAGB was used, no effects were seen above controls. An RT-PCR assay designed specifically to detect the expression of the IIIb and IIIc variant forms of the FGFRs was used to analyze the expression of these isoforms in the breast cells essentially as described previously (19Brickman Y.G. Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that the quantitation was accomplished by laser-induced fluorescence after capillary electrophoresis. Although differential splicing within the FGFR genes generates many variants within a single receptor type, splicing events that particularly influence receptor affinity for a specific FGF involve the C-terminal half of the Ig-like loop III in the extracellular domain. Studies on the genomic organization of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 have shown that each of these genes contains two exons, b and"

RNA was isolated from 25 human liver samples and used to generate full-length copies of soluble epoxide hydrolase cDNA. The resulting cDNAs were polymerase chain reaction amplified, sequenced, and eight variant loci were identified. The coding region contained five silent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two variant loci resulting in altered protein sequence. An amino acid substitution was identified at residue 287 in exon 8, where the more common arginine was replaced by glutamine. A second variant locus was identified in exon 13 where an arginine residue was inserted following serine 402 resulting in the sequence, arginine 403–404, instead of the more common, arginine 403. This amino acid insertion was confirmed by analyzing genomic DNA from individuals harboring the polymorphic allele. Slot blot hybridization analyses of the liver samples indicated that sEH mRNA steady-state expression varied approximately 10-fold. Transient transfection experiments with CHO and COS-7 cells were used to demonstrate that the two new alleles possess catalytic activity using trans-stilbene oxide as a model substrate. Although the activity of the glutamine 287 variant was similar to the sEH wild type allele, proteins containing the arginine insertion exhibited strikingly lower activity. Allelic forms of human sEH, with markedly different enzymatic profiles, may have important physiological implications with respect to the disposition of epoxides formed from the oxidation of fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid-derived intermediates, as well in the regulation of toxicity due to xenobiotic epoxide exposures.

Epoxide intermediates are often chemically reactive and unstable in aqueous environments. Consequently, a number of chemical epoxides have been implicated as critical initiators of diverse cellular damage, including protein and RNA adduction as well as genetic mutation (1Parkinson A. Klaassen C.D. Biotransformation of Xenobiotics: Casarett & Doull's Toxicology. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1996: 113-186Google Scholar, 2Hammock B.D. Storms D.H. Grant D.F. Sipes I.G. McQueen C.A. Gandolfi A.J. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Elsevier Sciences, Inc., New York1997: 283-305Google Scholar). Cellular regulation of epoxide disposition is therefore a decisive issue underlying mechanisms of molecular toxicology. Five structurally distinct epoxide hydrolases (EC 3.3.2.3) have been identified in vertebrates, and these can be distinguished based on their respective physical properties of molecular weight, pH optima, and cellular localization (2Hammock B.D. Storms D.H. Grant D.F. Sipes I.G. McQueen C.A. Gandolfi A.J. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3. Elsevier Sciences, Inc., New York1997: 283-305Google Scholar). DNA encoding mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH1; formerly referred to as cytosolic EH) has been characterized from human (3Beetham J.K. Tian T. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem.

Genet. 1995; 95: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas the xenobiotic-metabolizing microsomal EH (mEH) gene, EPHX1, has been placed at 1q42.1 (11Hartsfield Jr., J.K. Sutcliffe M.J. Everett E.T. Hassett C. Omiecinski C.J. Saari J.A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 44-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other epoxide hydrolases that have been identified include a cholesterol-metabolizing microsomal enzyme (12Watabe T. Kanai M. Isobe M. Ozawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2900-2907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and two soluble proteins, hepoxilin hydrolase (13Pace-Asciak C.R. Lee W.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11570-11575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These three epoxide hydrolases have very limited and unique substrate specificities and, at least in the latter instance, a different catalytic mechanism. Endogenous epoxides may be important effector molecules eliciting hormone-like responses in various organ systems. For example, arachidonic acid undergoes oxidization to an array of monoepoxides that can be enzymatically hydrolyzed to corresponding dihydrodiols (15Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Estabrook R.W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 16Fitzpatrick F.A. Murphy R.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 229-241PubMed Google Scholar, 17McGiff J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 339-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These metabolites can possess vasodilatory properties on the vascular system, with specific arachidonic acid epoxides and corresponding diol regioisomers exhibiting different physiological potencies (18VanRollins M. Kaduce T.L. Fang X. Knapp H.R. Spector A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14001-14009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, arachidonic acid 11,12-epoxide was demonstrated to function as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, following generation via a cytochrome P450 2C-mediated reaction (19Fisslthaler B. Popp R. Kiss L. Potente M. Harder D.R. Fleming I. Busse R. Nature. 1999; 401: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, cytochrome P450 2J2 has been identified as a potential source of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids that function to inhibit leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall (20Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Regulation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid incorporation into phospholipids, a mechanism to modulate their biological effects, is likely mediated by sEH (21Weintraub N.L. Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Chatterjee P. Spector A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2098-H2108PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of the respective epoxygenase activities, in concert with the hydrolytic reactions catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase, are likely to be important determinants of blood pressure control and inflammatory processes. Another important lipid epoxide is the linoleic acid-derived product leukotoxin (cis-9,10-epoxyoctadec-12(Z)-enoic acid), which is associated with multiple organ failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome seen in some severe burn patients (22Kosaka K. Suzuki K. Hayakawa M. Sugiyama S. Ozawa T. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1994; 139: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence was presented indicating that the leukotoxin diol metabolite, generated by sEH, is a likely initiator of this severe toxicity (23Moghaddam M.F. Grant D.F. Cheek J.M. Greene J.F. Williamson K.C. Hammock B.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Soluble epoxide hydrolase may thus support both advantageous and deleterious reactions in its role as a processor of endogenous epoxides. Mammalian sEH proteins demonstrate amino acid conservation in excess of 70%, as deduced from full-length cDNA clones (24Beetham J.K. Grant D. Arand M. Garbarino J. Kiyosue T. Pinot F. Oesch F. Belknap W.R. Shinozaki K. Hammock B.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In particular, the carboxyl-terminal region of the primary sequences are very highly conserved among these mammalian species, approaching 87% similarity (including conservative amino acid substitutions). Little is currently known with respect to interindividual human sEH protein sequence variation. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences derived from two reports (3Beetham J.K. Tian T. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Sandberg M. Meijer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) shows inconsistencies at 3 positions and predicts human sEH proteins of differing length (554 versus 555 residues). Interindividual human sEH variation has been implied from studies showing differences in specific activity (26Mertes I. Fleischmann R. Glatt H.R. Oesch F. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in the metabolism of epoxide-containing drugs (27Norris K.K. DeAngelo T.M. Vesell E.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and in correlative aspects of sister-chromatid exchange in leukocytes (28Kramer A. Frank H. Setiabudi F. Oesch F. Glatt H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, individuals with high blood levels of fatty acid epoxides and cholesterol epoxides have been identified (29Fahlstadius P. Lipids. 1988; 23: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Wrensch M.R. Petrakis N.L. Gruenke L.D. Miike R. Ernster V.L. King E.B. Hauck W.W. Craig J.C. Goodson III, W.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2168-2174PubMed Google Scholar). These phenotypes may be due simply to differences in relative enzyme levels (e.g. due to differences in sEH penetrance), or to the presence of allelic differences. Genetic polymorphisms influencing sEH structure may be envisioned that alter epoxide hydrolysis efficiencies, thus impacting important physiological processes requiring a distinct balance between cellular levels of epoxides and their corresponding dihydrodiols. In the present investigation, we identify and characterize allelic variation in the transcribed region of the human soluble epoxide hydrolase gene. The nucleotide sequence polymorphisms discovered include nonconservative alterations that encode changes at two amino acid loci. In vitro expression and transient transfection experiments demonstrate that the sEH allelic variants are catalytically active, but exhibit distinctive biological behavior. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Life Technologies, Inc. (Täby, Sweden). Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) or Life Technologies, Inc., if not stated otherwise. Radiochemicals were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Bucks, United Kingdom). DNA sequence analyses were performed on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer, or an ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer, using the ABI Prism BigDye or dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing chemistry (Perkin-Elmer, Chatsworth, CA). Total RNA isolated from the livers of 25 unrelated individuals in an organ bank (31Hassett C. Lin J. Carty C.L. Laurenzana E.M. Omiecinski C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was used to estimate steady-state expression, and for the synthesis of cDNA templates. Ten micrograms of total RNA from each of the liver samples was applied to a nylon membrane as described previously (31Hassett C. Lin J. Carty C.L. Laurenzana E.M. Omiecinski C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). [32P]dCTP-labeled hybridization probe, derived from the wild type sEH full-length cDNA, was random primed (Ambion, Austin, TX), hybridized, and washed under stringent conditions (32Hassett C.

The membrane was stripped of the cDNA probe, and rehybridized with an oligomer complementary to 18 S rRNA essentially as described (33Hassett C. Aicher L. Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Autoradiographic signals obtained from each probing were quantified using densitometry, and steady-state sEH mRNA levels were normalized to 18 S rRNA signal intensities (31Hassett C. Lin J. Carty C.L. Laurenzana E.M. Omiecinski C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Five μg of total liver RNA was treated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.5 units of DNase I (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in a final volume of 9.5 μl including 10.5 mm dithiothreitol and 20 units of RNasin (Promega). After heat inactivation for 10 min at 72 °C, 260 ng of oligo(dT)12–18 primer and 1.5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide were added and samples were transferred to 42 °C. A prewarmed reaction mixture was added to each sample (final volume 20 μl), the temperature was increased slowly (approximately 15 min) to 50 °C, and incubation proceeded for 1 h followed by a 15-min incubation at 55 °C. The added premixture contained 1.0 μmol of Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 μmol of KCl, 60 nmol of MgCl2, 10 nmol of each dNTP, 0.1 μmol of dithiothreitol, and 100 units of SuperScriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). At the completion of first strand synthesis, samples were heat inactivated for 15 min at 70 °C and then treated with 2 units of RNase H to remove RNA complementary to the cDNA prior to PCR. PCR amplification of the sEH-coding region was accomplished using a forward primer (5′-GCATCTCCCAGGTTAGCT-3′) located 35–52 base pairs upstream of the translation start codon, and a reverse primer (5′-TCCATGCAAGATGTGTGTA-3′) located 82–100 base pairs downstream of the translation stop codon. Thus, in addition to the coding region of human sEH that comprises 1668 nucleotides including the stop codon, an additional 35 base pairs of upstream and 82 base pairs of downstream sequence were characterized. The Expand™ High fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as per the manufacturer's directions, with the following modifications. Samples were initially heated at 94 °C for 3 min, and then amplified by 30–35 cycles of denaturation (25 s at 94°), annealing (30 s at 50 °C), and extension (2 min and 20 s at 72 °C). Finally, cDNA ends were flushed at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were purified on Qiaquick™ purification columns (Qiagen) before agarose gel electrophoresis to estimate quantity and purity of samples. The purified PCR products were sequenced using a minimum of five primers targeted to the sEH cDNA. Additional primers also were employed in order to generate DNA sequence from the opposite strand for the resolution of discrepancies and to confirm the presence of polymorphic loci. New PCR reaction sets, and subsequent DNA sequencing, were similarly conducted to reconfirm polymorphisms and to exclude PCR artifacts where differences existed from the wild type (Wt) sequence. Data were initially collected and processed by Applied Biosystems DNA sequencing analysis software. Further assembly and editing of the files was performed using Genepro™ and MacVector™ computer software. To determine the functional effects of amino acid variation, sEH alleles were obtained from individuals possessing polymorphisms and cloned into the pBluescript SK+ vector. In this procedure, primers were modified to introduce unique BamHI (forward primer: 5′-TA G G ATC C CCCAGGTTAGCTGCG-3′) andXbaI (reverse primer: 5′-AT T C T AGA TGTGTGTAAGGCCACC-3′) restriction sites into the sEH PCR products (restriction sites are shown in bold italicized face; mismatches necessary to create artificial sites are underlined). The expected sequence of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the resultant clones. Three unique sEH-allelic constructs were excised from the pBluescript hosts and subcloned into the BamHI/XbaI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequence of each sEH allele was reconfirmed after subcloning. Plasmids were prepared using Wizard ion exchange columns from Promega. Quantitation and purity of the plasmids was determined by spectrophotometric readings and agarose gel electrophoresis. Both CHO and COS-7 cell lines were utilized for transient transfection experiments. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 (v/v) in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin-streptomycin. Plasmid transfections were mediated by the Dosper™ liposomal reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At the termination of each experiment, cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline before harvest and centrifuged (400 × g for 5 min) at 4 °C followed by resuspension in ice-cold 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). CHO or COS-7 cells were seeded in dishes with 5 ml of medium at a density of 4 × 105 cells/6-cm dish. The following day, at approximately 50% confluency, the media was replaced with 3 ml of serum-free medium and the cells were transfected with 2.025 μg of each human sEH allele or pcDNA3 construct, 0.225 μg of pcDNA3-CAT, and 9 μg of Dosper reagent. Six hours after transfection the medium was replaced with 5 ml of medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested for enzymatic analysis at several time points up to 48 h (CHO cells) or 58 h (COS-7 cells) following transfection. Petri dishes (10 cm diameter) were seeded with CHO or COS-7 cells in 13 ml of medium at a density of 2 × 106 cells per dish. The following day, when cells were approximately 50% confluent, the media was replaced with 6.5 ml of serum-free media and cells were transfected with 4.5 μg of each human sEH construct or pcDNA-3 vector, 0.4875 μg of pcDNA3-CAT and 19.5 μg of Dosper™ reagent. Six hours following transfection the media was replaced with 15 ml of media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection, and stored at 4 °C until enzymatic assays were conducted over the course of 25 days. Each human sEH construct, or mock-transfected control, was performed in duplicate Petri dishes, and cells from each group were combined at the end of the experiment. Preliminary experiments indicated certain sEH allelic proteins were especially sensitive to freeze-thaw procedures. Therefore, sEH enzyme measurements were subsequently performed on non-frozen cell extracts. Epoxide hydrolase activity was assayed (34Gill S.S. Ota K. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) usingtrans-[3H]stilbene oxide as substrate (t-SO). The final substrate concentration was 100 μm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 1–2 h depending on the activity of the respective fractions. The substrate and product were separated by extraction with isooctane and an aliquot of the aqueous phase was analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Potential background activity in the samples due to glutathione conjugation was taken into account by extracting the aqueous phase with hexanol. All measurements were performed at least in duplicate with fresh, resuspended non-lysed cells. Normalization of t-SO activity was achieved by the concurrent transfection of CAT-expressing plasmids with each sEH or mock-control transfection. The sEH wild type sample displaying the highest CAT expression at each time point was used to normalize the other samples according to their respective CAT activity. The variation in CAT activity was usually less than 15% between the samples. An aliquot of transfected CHO or COS-7 cells, resuspended in ice-cold 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), was lysed by 3 cycles of freeze-thawing, and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and briefly frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Samples were subsequently stored at −20 °C until use. CAT assays were performed according to a protocol supplied with the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). [14C]Chloramphenicol and its acetylated products were separated by TLC on silica gel plates (LK6DF; Whatman Biosystems, Maidstone, UK). After overnight exposure to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), CAT activity was analyzed by densitometry using ImageQuant software (version 3.22; Molecular Dynamics). Genomic DNA was isolated from four livers (numbers 127, 133, 135, and 137) and restricted with 4 enzymes (BamHI,EcoRI, KpnI, and SacI). Ten micrograms from each digest were size-separated on a 0.85% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane under denaturing conditions, as described previously (32Hassett C. Richter R.J. Humbert R. Chapline C. Crabb J.W. Omiecinski C.J. Furlong C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10141-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The Southern blotted DNA was hybridized with an sEH cDNA probe (prepared as described above), washed under stringent conditions (32Hassett C. Richter R.J. Humbert R. Chapline C. Crabb J.W. Omiecinski C.J. Furlong C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10141-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and exposed to x-ray film for 5 days. The liver samples used in this study originated from a bank primarily composed of potential organ donors, and the demographic characteristics of this population have been described previously (33Hassett C. Aicher L. Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Slot blot hybridization to random primed cDNA fragments confirmed that each of the 25 liver samples expressed sEH mRNA. Following normalization to 18 S rRNA levels, expression of sEH mRNA was determined to vary approximately 10-fold among individuals in this population as judged by quantitative computer densitometry of the resulting autoradiograms (data not shown). In the coding and flanking regions, 15 of 25 individuals possessed identical sEH nucleotide sequences, and this allele is designated wild type (Wt). The Wt sEH sequence was identical to that reported previously (25Sandberg M. Meijer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the remaining 10 individuals demonstrated additional alleles, with polymorphisms located at eight distinct loci (Table I).Table INucleotide and corresponding amino acid sequences in the EPHX2 gene of 25 human subjectsLiver SampleNucleotide polymorphismAmino acid polymorphism1041593A > C, and1703A > G1051593A > C, and 1703A > G106Wt108Wt1091236C > T,1593A > C, and 1703A > G114Wt118860G > A, 1593A > C, and 1703A > GR287Q119Wt120860G > A, 1593A > C, and 1703A > GR287Q121Wt124Wt12563C > A; 63C > A127Wt128Wt1291206–1207insCGTArg402–403ins131Wt133849G > A, 921A > G, 1206–1207insCGTArg402–403ins134Wt135Wt136Wt137860G > A, 1593A > C, and1703A > GR287Q138Wt139Wt140Wt141860G > A, 1593A > C, and 1703A > GR287QThe “A” residue of the initiator methionine codon (ATG) is denoted nucleotide +1. The numbering of nucleotides and amino acids is based on the published genomic EPHX2 sequence (25Sandberg M. Meijer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Polymorphism designations are according to recommendations (35Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab The “A” residue of the initiator methionine codon (ATG) is denoted nucleotide +1.

Polymorphism designations are according to recommendations (35Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Only one individual was identified with a homozygous polymorphic locus, subject number 125, who possessed a silent transversion (C > A) at nucleotide 63 (Table I). It may be noteworthy that this sample was obtained from the only Hispanic individual in our study population, and the mutant locus was not observed in other samples. Other synonymous mutations within the sEH protein-coding region were observed at nucleotide positions 849, 921, 1236, and 1593. A base substitution was also detected in the 3′ noncoding region of the sEH transcript, at nucleotide 1703. The two remaining polymorphisms identified from these analyses were missense mutations, affecting sEH protein composition. Four individuals possessed a G > A substitution at nucleotide 860, located in exon 8. This change results in a nonconservative amino acid substitution of Gln for Arg at amino acid 287 of the sEH protein. In addition, an insertion of the trinucleotide “CGT” after nucleotide 1206 in exon 13 was identified in two subjects (numbers 129 and 133). This mutation, which does not alter the reading frame, results in the insertion of an Arg residue immediately following Ser402. This polymorphism was confirmed independently from genomic DNA isolated from samples 129 and 133 and amplified using a forward primer in intron 12 (5′-GGCACAGGTAGGGTGCTTG-3′) and a reverse primer in intron 13 (5′-CCCAGTAGAGTGAGGACCTC-3′) of theEPHX2 gene. The resulting PCR products were sequenced and the trinucleotide insertion (encoding the additional Arg residue) was observed in both samples (in addition to the Wt allele), establishing that this polymorphism was not an artifact of reverse transcription during cDNA synthesis from sEH mRNA. The trinucleotide insertion is centrally located in exon 13 (25), thus a splice junction processing error is unlikely to explain its occurrence. As recommended (35Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), this insertion is designated Arg402–403ins. Human sEH polymorphisms identified in this investigation are summarized in Table II. A total of eight polymorphic loci were discovered in the 25 human sEH cDNA sequences (50 alleles), including 5 transitions, 2 transversions, and 1 insertion. The observed frequency for each variant was greater than 1%, and therefore these represent true human genetic polymorphisms. Using the 5′-nuclease assay to discriminate alleles (36Holland P.M. Abramson R.D. Watson R. Gelfand D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stern D.F. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar and 2Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Although ErbB-2 has a potential ligand-binding ectodomain, no direct ligand has yet been identified. In its role as a co-receptor, ErbB-2 enhances the signaling capacity of its dimerization partners. The association of ErbB-2 with these various receptors is, however, entirely ligand-dependent. In the absence of growth factor ErbB-2 is reported to interact with CD44, an adhesion receptor, in ovarian carcinoma cell lines (3Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Chu A. Iida N. Zhang L. Hung M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27913-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and with a large plasma membrane glycoprotein complex in microvilli of a mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (4Li Y.

ErbB-2 has also been demonstrated to form ligand-dependent complexes with the IL-6 receptor component gp130 (5Qiu Y. Ravi L. Kung H.-J. Nature. 1998; 383: 83-085Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and Trk A (6Tagliabue E. Castiglioni F. Chirelli C. Madugno M. Asnaghi L. Somenzi G. Melani C. Ménard S. J. Biol.

ErbB-2 was originally identified as the transforming oncogeneneu in which a point mutation in the transmembrane domain is responsible for its oncogenic potential (7Bargmann C.I. Hung M.-C.

ErbB-2 also functions as an oncogene when overexpressed (9Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 10Hudziak R.M. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar). ErbB-2 overexpression in breast cancer is associated with a poor prognosis (12Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar), and hence it is a target for therapeutic reagents, including monoclonal antibodies and drugs (13Kirschbaum M.H. Yarden Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 34 (suppl.): 52-60Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Frequently, antibodies that decrease the growth of ErbB-2-expressing tumors also reduce the level of ErbB-2 by a mechanism that is unclear. Hence, the transforming activity of ErbB-2 is related to structural changes or changes in its level of expression. The benzoquinoid ansamycin antibiotics geldanamycin and herbimycin were first isolated from the culture broths of several actinomycete species (14DeBoer C. Meulman P.A. Wnuk R.J. Peterson D.H. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1970; 33: 442-447Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 15Omura S. Iwai Y. Takahashi Y. Sadakane N. Nakagawa A. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1979; 32: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and described as inhibitors of tyrosine kinase-dependent growth (16Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Hori M. Uehara Y. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1587-1590PubMed Google Scholar, 17Uehara Y. Murakami Y. Sugimoto Y. Mizuno S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 780-785PubMed Google Scholar). These compounds, particularly geldanamycin, have tumorical activity toward numerous tumor cell lines (18Whitesell L. Shifrin S.D. Schwab G. Neckers L.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar), including those that overexpress ErbB-2 (19Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar). This action toward tumor cell lines is attributed to the capacity of geldanamycin to induce the degradation of several important signal transducers important in mitogenic pathways. These targets include protein kinases, such as Src, Raf, FAK, and ErbB-2, and other growth regulating proteins, such as p53 (20Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the geldanamycin-induced degradation of these various molecules is centered on the Hsp90 family of chaperones, because Hsp90 is the major intracellular protein that binds geldanamycin (20Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 21Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Geldanamycin has been shown to dissociate Hsp90 from various proteins and thereby inhibit their function, such as the nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptors, or to induce their metabolic degradation, such as Src, Raf, and p53. In the case of ErbB-2, association with Hsp90 has not been reported. However, it has been reported that the glucose-regulated chaperone GRP94, an Hsp90 family member that is localized to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, does associate with ErbB-2 in a geldanamycin-sensitive manner (22Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P. Bitton R. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Whitesell L. Schnur R. Moyer J.D. Nickers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4974-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin-induced degradation of ErbB-2 is reported to involve, presumably as a consequence of the dissociation of GRP94, the polyubiquitination of ErbB-2 and its proteosomal degradation (23Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). On the basis of GRP94 localization, these studies would suggest an interaction with the ErbB-2 ectodomain in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and drug-induced degradation during receptor biosynthesis. Others, however, have suggested that this interpretation does not account for the quantitative aspects of ErbB-2 degradation induced by geldanamycin (24Hong R.-L. Spohn W.H. Hung M.-C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1884-1891PubMed Google Scholar). We have explored the question of how geldanamycin induces ErbB-2 degradation and show that the ErbB-2 kinase domain is essential for sensitivity of geldanamycin. Also we show that geldanamycin induces fragmentation of ErbB-2 within the carboxyl-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain and that the resulting transmembrane fragment is degraded by a mechanisms that involves the formation of intracellular vesicles. Geldanamycin,N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal (ALLN), folimycin, proteasome inhibitor I, and 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-vinylsulfone were purchased from Calbiochem. Batimastat (BB94) was a generous gift of Dr. P. Dempsey (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). TAPI-O was obtained from Peptide International. Other protease inhibitors, protein G or protein A, and ECL reagents were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody (Ab5) against ErbB-2 extracellular domain and monoclonal antibody (Ab3) against carboxyl terminus of ErbB-2 were purchased from Oncogene Science. Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR extracellular domain (Ab13 and Ab14), monoclonal antibody (Ab2) against the ErbB-4, and monoclonal antibody (Ab8) against ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain were from NeoMarkers. Goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa 488 for confocal microscopy was from Molecular Probes. Human ErbB-2 cDNA and NIH 3T3 cell lines with overexpressed ErbB-2 or EGF receptor/ErbB-2 chimeric receptors were generous gifts from Dr. Pier Paolo Di Fiore (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy) and have been previously described elsewhere (25Sorkin A. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3021-3028PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 for heterologous fusion proteins to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and monoclonal antibody to GFP were obtained from CLONTECH. Human mammary tumor-derived SKBr3 cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in McCoy medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, COS 7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and all fibroblast cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. Cells were grown to about 80% confluency then washed two times, and treated with indicated drugs in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For transfection and expression of GFP fusion protein, COS 7 cells were grown to ∼70% confluency overnight and transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacture's recommendations (10 μg of plasmid DNA mixed with 16 μl of LipofectAMINE were used per 60-mm tissue culture dish). The cells were grown for 48 h before assays. The ErbB-2 kinase domain and cytoplasmic region cDNA fragments were generated by PCR with high fidelity VENTR DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs). Following the numbering of Yamamoto et al. (26Yamamoto T. Ikawa S. Akiyama T. Semba K. Nomura N. Miyajima N. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Nature. 1986; 319: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar), the kinase domain fragment and cytoplasmic domain fragment correspond, respectively, to residues 715–990 and 676–1255 of ErbB-2. To prepare these two fragments the following primers were synthesized: upstream primer with SacI restriction site 5′-GGG ATC CTC ATC AAA CGA GCT CAG AAG ATC-3′ (primer 1), downstream primers withXbaI restriction sites 5′-ACT ACG TCC AGT TCT AGA TCA CAC TGG CAC GTC CAG ACC-3′ (primer 2), 5′-GTA GAA GGT GCT GTC TAG AGG ACT GGC TGG-3′ (primer 3). PCR products were cloned into pEGFP-C1 vector by using SacI andXbaI sites. Constructs with ErbB-2 carboxyl terminus and its truncation fragments fused to GFP were prepared by megaprimer approach. The carboxyl-terminal domain fragment corresponds to residues 991–1255 or ErbB-2 (26Yamamoto T. Ikawa S. Akiyama T. Semba K. Nomura N. Miyajima N. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Nature. 1986; 319: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar).

One strand of this product was used as the 3′ primer in a second round of PCR with primer 1.

To prepare construct with ErbB-2 kinase domain and EGF receptor carboxyl terminus (residues 959–1186, according to Ullrich et al. (27Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W.

PCR product was used in second round of PCR to generate EGF receptor carboxyl terminus with primer 5′-CAT TTG CCA AGT CCT CTA GAC TCC AAC TTC-3′ (upstream primer). The cDNA fragment for ErbB-2 kinase domain was prepared as described above with primers 1 and 3. Both products were cut with XbaI and ligated. Then cDNA fragment was cloned into pEGFP vector throughSacI and SalI restriction sites. All the constructions described above were verified by sequencing in the regions that underwent genetic manipulations. After indicated treatments, the cells were solubilized by scraping with rubber policeman into cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4). The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation (14,000 ×g, 10 min). Receptors were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of the indicated antibody immobilized on protein G or protein A by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the complexes were washed with lysis buffer three times and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer for 7.5% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated 1 h at room temperature with the indicated blotting antibody in TBSTw buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% nonfat milk), washed three times in the same buffer, and incubated 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse antibody or protein A. The membranes were then washed five times in TBSTw and visualized by ECL. Cells were grown 1–2 days on Lab-Tek Chamber slides to 50–70% confluency, treated for indicated times with geldanamycin, and fixed by adding freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and incubated for 1 h or overnight. Fixed SKBr3 and 3T3 cells were washed three times in PBS, permeabilized by incubation in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with fluorescene dye-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, washed five times, and dried. Fixed COS 7 cells expressing GFP fusion protein were observed directly. To measure the extent of ErbB-2 degradation in cells treated with geldanamycin, we have used, in parallel, antibodies that react with ectodomain or carboxyl-terminal domain epitopes of ErbB-2. The results, as shown in Fig.1 A, demonstrate that immunoreactivity to both ectodomain and carboxyl-terminal domain antibodies is rapidly lost following exposure to geldanamycin. The cells employed in this experiment, SKBr3, overexpress ErbB-2, and quantitation of the data indicates that in these cells the half-life of ErbB-2 is approximately 2 h in the presence of geldanamycin. Others have reported a similar half-life for ErbB-2 under these conditions (19Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar) and contrasts with the reported half-life of about 7–9 h for ErbB-2 under normal conditions (28Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 29Stern D.F. Kamps M.P. Cao H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3969-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This influence of geldanamycin on ErbB-2 metabolic stability is reasonably specific because no significant decrease in the structurally related receptors ErbB-1 or ErbB-4 was detected following geldanamycin treatment of A-431 cells or T47–17 cells, respectively (Fig. 1 B). To map the region of ErbB-2 that mediates geldanamycin sensitivity, we initially employed chimeric receptors in which the cytoplasmic domain of the EGF receptor is replaced by that of ErbB-2 (EGFR/ErbB-2CD) or in which the carboxyl-terminal domain of the EGF receptor is replaced by the corresponding region of ErbB-2 (EGFR/ErbB-2CT). These chimeric receptors are expressed in NIH 3T3 cells and have been described previously (25Sorkin A. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3021-3028PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig.2 show that following the addition of geldanamycin the chimeric receptor having the entire ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain is sensitive to drug-induced degradation, whereas the chimeric receptor that contains only the carboxyl-terminal domain of ErbB-2 is not influenced by the presence of geldanamycin. In this experiment the EGFR/ErbB-2CD receptor has a half-life of approximately 3.9 h in the presence of geldanamycin. In the same background the ErbB-2 receptor has a half-life of about 3.3 h in the presence of this drug (data not shown). Therefore, the ectodomain of ErbB-2 does not have a significant role in determining the sensitivity of this receptor to geldanamycin-induced degradation. Given the data in Fig.1 B showing that the EGF receptor is not sensitive to geldanamycin, these results suggest that the kinase domain and/or juxtamembrane region of the ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain mediate sensitivity to geldanamycin-induced degradation. This conclusion is consistent with the results of Miller et al. (19Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that an ErbB-2 internal deletion mutant lacking the kinase domain was not degraded in the presence of geldanamycin. To directly test the possibility that the kinase domain determined geldanamycin sensitivity, we constructed GFP fusion proteins with the ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain (GFP-ErbB-2CD), the ErbB-2 kinase domain (GFP-ErbB-2KD), the ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal domain (GFP-ErbB-2CT), or the EGF receptor kinase domain (GFP-EGFRKD). These fusion proteins were expressed in COS 7 cells and tested for sensitivity to geldanamycin by blotting lysates with antibody to GFP after incubating the cells in the absence or presence of the drug. The results are shown in Fig.3. As a control, we tested the sensitivity of GFP to geldanamycin, and, as shown in Fig. 3 A(lanes 1 and 2), treatment with geldanamycin for 6 h induced no decrease in the cellular level of GFP. Also, there was no geldanamycin-induced degradation of the GFP fusion proteins containing the carboxyl terminus of ErbB-2 (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 4) or the entire cytoplasmic domain of ErbB-2 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 6). However, the GFP fusion protein containing the ErbB-2 kinase domain (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4) was rapidly degraded in the presence of geldanamycin, whereas there was no degradation of a fusion protein containing the EGF receptor kinase domain (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–8). The results in Fig. 3 B are quantitated in Fig. 3 C and show the increased sensitivity of the ErbB-2 kinase domain to geldanamycin compared with the EGF receptor kinase domain. In this system, the lack of sensitivity to geldanamycin is, on the basis of previous data as expected for fusion proteins containing the ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal domain or the EGF receptor kinase domain. That the fusion protein containing only the ErbB-2 kinase domain is rapidly degraded in the presence of geldanamycin indicates that the kinase domain is sufficient to mediate its degradation. However, the lack of degradation of the fusion protein containing the entire ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain was unexpected and is in apparent discordance with the geldanamycin-induced degradation of the EGF receptor/ErbB-2 chimeric receptor, which contains the entire ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4). These latter results suggested that perhaps within the context of cytosolic GFP fusion proteins, but not in the transmembrane ErbB-2 molecule, the ErbB-2 carboxyl terminus had a protective effect on the sensitivity of the kinase domain to degradation induced by geldanamycin. To test this possibility we constructed a series of GFP fusion proteins containing the ErbB-2 kinase and carboxyl-terminal domains with progressive deletions of the ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal domain. The geldanamycin sensitivity of these constructs, when expressed in COS 7 cells, is shown in Fig.4. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 19 residues (Δ1236–1255, lanes 3 and 4) or 59 residues (Δ1196–1255, lanes 5, 6) did not increase sensitivity of the fusion proteins to degradation in the presence of geldanamycin. However, increased sensitivity to geldanamycin-induced degradation was observed when deletions of 105 or more residues were made in the ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal domain (lanes 7–14). Hence, loss of the amino-terminal half of this carboxyl-terminal domain significantly increases the sensitivity of the ErbB-2 kinase domain to geldanamycin. In this series of fusion proteins we also determined whether the carboxyl-terminal domains of the EGF receptor would abrogate sensitivity of the ErbB-2 kinase domain to geldanamycin. Hence, we prepared a fusion protein construct to encode the kinase domain of ErbB-2 and carboxyl-terminal domain of the EGF receptor. When this molecule was expressed in COS 7 cells, the results (Fig. 4 B) showed complete sensitivity to geldanamycin-induced degradation in contrast to the fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal sequences of ErbB-2 (lanes 1 and 2). The above results, which indicate a role of the ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal domain in determining the sensitivity of ErbB-2 kinase domain to geldanamycin-induced degradation, suggested that perhaps the carboxyl-terminal region of the transmembrane receptor might be cleaved following the addition of geldanamycin and that this event may be necessary for subsequent degradation of the ErbB-2 molecule, perhaps in a manner that required localization at the plasma membrane and not in the cytosol. Therefore, we re-examined the geldanamycin-induced degradation of the chimeric EGF receptor/ErbB-2CD molecule, whose degradation in the presence of geldanamycin was shown in Fig. 2(lanes 1–4). If the carboxyl terminus is, in fact, cleaved prior to degradation, then the antibodies used in the experiment shown in Fig. 2 would not detect the remaining membrane-localized fragment because they are to an epitope in the ErbB-2 carboxyl terminus. Hence, we tested the geldanamycin-induced degradation of this molecule using an antibody to the EGF receptor ectodomain. As shown in Fig.5, this antibody detected both the native 185-kDa form of the chimeric receptor plus a geldanamycin-induced fragment of approximately 135 kDa (lanes 2 and3). As shown in lane 5, the formation of this fragment in cells exposed to geldanamycin was blocked by the presence of the protease inhibitor ALLN and to a lesser extent by lactacystin (data not shown). We next attempted to confirm that geldanamycin induced a carboxyl-terminal cleavage in the native ErbB-2 molecule as well as the chimeric receptor. To test this we used SKBr3 cells and an antibody to an epitope in the ErbB-2 ectodomain. As shown in Fig.6 A (lane 2) incubation of these cells with geldanamycin for 6 h resulted in the loss of the native ErbB-2 molecule, and no fragment was detected. This result is similar to that reported in Fig. 1 A(lanes 5–8). We reasoned that perhaps in these cells the fragment was metabolically unstable and might be detectable if the geldanamycin treatment were performed at a low temperature to reduce metabolic degradation. In this part of the experiment (lanes 3 and 4), geldanamycin was added to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the cells were cooled to 4 °C and incubated for an additional 5 h. Under these conditions an ErbB-2 fragment of 135 kDa was detectable, and in the presence of ALLN this fragment was not detected. These data indicated that endogenous ErbB-2 is cleaved within the cytoplasmic domain in geldanamycin-treated cells. A number of protease inhibitors were tested without success for their capacity to prevent degradation of the 135-kDa ErbB-2 fragment produced in response to geldanamycin. However, the cathepsin B inhibitor CA074-Me (30Authier F. Métioui M. Bell A.W. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33723-33731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) did stabilize the level of the ErbB-2 fragment in geldanamycin-treated cells (Fig. 6 B). Because cathepsin B is mainly localized in late endosomes (31Mort J.S. Buttle D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), we tested compounds that interfere in the acidification and/or processing of endosomes. As shown in Fig. 6 C (lanes 1–5), chloroquine, monensin, and folimycin each significantly increased accumulation of the 135-kDa ErbB-2 fragment in geldanamycin-treated cells. In the absence of geldanamycin, none of these compounds revealed major immunoreactive bands other than the native ErbB-2. Detection of this accumulated 135-kDa fragment was not possible when an antibody to the ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal domain was employed (lanes 6–10), supporting the conclusion that this fragment is produced by a cleavage at the carboxyl terminus of ErbB-2. If ErbB-2 is cleaved at the carboxyl terminus such that an antibody epitope is lost from the native molecule, an antibody to a carboxyl-terminal epitope may be able to detect the released fragment if it is sufficiently metabolically stable. That such a carboxyl-terminal ErbB-2 fragment can be detected in lysates from geldanamycin-treated cells blotted with an antibody to the ErbB-2 carboxyl terminus is shown in Fig. 7. As demonstrated in Fig. 7 A, the presence of protease inhibitors ALLN or proteasome inhibitor I reveals the presence of a 23-kDa ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal fragment produced during geldanamycin exposure of SKBr3 cells. The data in Fig. 7 B show the influence of incubation time in geldanamycin on the accumulation of this fragment in SKBr3 cells. The fragment is readily detected within 1 h following the addition of geldanamycin. The previously described 135-kDa ErbB-2 fragment is also readily detected in the same period of time (data not shown). The capacity of folimycin, chloroquine, or monensin to increase accumulation of the 135-kDa ErbB-2 fragment suggests that this fragment is normally degraded by a mechanism that involves endocytic vesicles. Therefore, we used confocal microscopy to determine whether ErbB-2 is internalized during geldanamycin treatment. Following drug or vehicle exposure for 6 h, the cells were fixed and permeabilized prior to incubation with antibody to ErbB-2 and fluorescene-conjugated second antibody. Shown in Fig.8 are SKBr3 cells with endogenous ErbB-2 (Fig. 8, A and B), NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing transfected ErbB-2 (Fig. 8, C and D), and COS 7 cells transiently expressing a GFP fusion protein with the ErbB-2 kinase domain (Fig. 8, E and F). In the absence of geldanamycin, the transmembrane form of ErbB-2 is clearly expressed at the cell surface in SKBr3 (Fig. 8 A) and NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 8 C), whereas the GFP fusion protein is located in the cytosol of COS 7 cells (Fig. 8E). In each case the distribution is changed dramatically following geldanamycin incubation, such that immunoreactivity is concentrated in intracellular vesicles, which mimic the appearance of lysosomes (Fig. 8, B, D, andF). The vesicles could be detected within 2 h of geldanamycin consistent with the time course of ErbB-2 degradation. The presence of either ALLN or folimycin decreased the redistribution of ErbB-2 immunoreactivity observed in the presence of geldanamycin (data not shown). Also, the GFP fusion protein with the entire ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain, which we have previously shown is metabolically stable in the presence of geldanamycin (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 6), was not redistributed in the presence of the drug (data not shown). In this manuscript we report several novel aspects of the mechanism by which geldanamycin induces the degradation of ErbB-2. Using antibodies to both ectodomain and carboxyl-terminal epitopes, we detect two fragments of ErbB-2 produced following geldanamycin incubation. One fragment of 135 kDa represents the ErbB-2 ectodomain plus the transmembrane domain and part of the kinase cytoplasmic domain. A second fragment of approximately 23 kDa is also detected under these conditions and represents the carboxyl-terminal domain of ErbB-2. These fragments are detectable within 30–60 min of geldanamycin addition to cells and continue to be detected for several hours. These two fragments do not, however, account for the entire mass of the native ErbB-2 molecule. In previous studies of geldanamycin-induced ErbB-2 degradation, fragments of this molecule have not been detected. This is likely due to two factors. The first is the absence of appropriate inhibitors and the second is the use of different antibodies for sequential precipitation (cytoplasmic domain epitope) and blotting (ectodomain epitope). Based on the characteristics of these fragments, at least two mechanisms can be proposed to account for the generation of these fragments (Fig. 9). In model I, an endoproteolytic cleavage within the carboxyl-terminal domain could directly generate the observed 23-kDa fragment plus a 160-kDa fragment representing the rest of the ErbB-2 molecule. Subsequent cleavage of this latter fragment within the kinase domain could generate the observed 135-kDa fragment plus a small fragment of approximately 27 kDa that is undetectable with available immunologic reagents. Alternatively, it can be proposed that fragments are produced in the order predicted in model II. In this case an endoproteolytic event within the kinase domain would directly generate the observed 135-kDa transmembrane fragment plus a fragment of about 50 kDa. Subsequent cleavage of this latter fragment would produce the observed 23-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain fragment. In either model intermediate fragments have not been detected (the 160-kDa fragment in model I or the 50-kDa fragment in model II), and this may be due to the rapidity with which the second cleavage occurs. We prefer the scheme depicted in model I for the following reasons. Our data show that expression of the ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain as a cytosolic GFP fusion protein is not sensitive to geldanamycin-induced degradation, whereas a GFP fusion with the ErbB-2 kinase domain without the carboxyl-terminal domain is sensitive to geldanamycin-induced degradation. Also, the transmembrane ErbB-2 receptor is sensitive to degradation induced by geldanamycin. This suggests that proteolytic cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal domain may be restricted topologically within the cell to an area near the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and not available to mediate cleavage of the cytosolic GFP fusion protein containing the entire ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain. The exact protease(s) that generate these ErbB-2 fragments in response to geldanamycin have not been identified. The metabolic stability of ErbB-2 in cells is likely complex, and ectodomain cleavage by metalloprotease activity has been reported (32Zabrecky J.R. Lam T. McKenzie S.J. Carney W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1716-1720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Codony-Servat J. Albanell J. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Arribas J. Baselga J.

In these experiments we have not observed ectodomain fragmentation, which produces fragments of different sizes than those we have detected in geldanamycin-treated cells. The data in this manuscript indicate that complex series of proteolytic events are involved in the degradation of ErbB-2. This would include the proteosome as well as cathepsin B, an endosomal protease. Mimnaughet al. (23Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) reported that lactacystin (10 μm), a proteosome inhibitor, blocked the geldanamycin-induced loss of the 185-kDa native form of ErbB-2. We find that lactacystin (10–40 μm) only partially prevents cleavage of the native ErbB-2 molecule and that ALLN is more effective in this regard. ALLN, like lactacystin, is a proteosome inhibitor, but it also inhibits other proteases such as calpain and cathepsin B and L. However, various calpain inhibitors (calpain inhibitor III, calpain inhibitor V, and calpastatin) do not block geldanamycin-induced fragmentation of ErbB-2 in our system. In our experiments geldanamycin induces the formation of intracellular vesicles containing ErbB-2. Previously the accumulation of such vesicles was only reported after a prolonged 22-h incubation in the presence of geldanamycin and was attributed to the relocalization of newly synthesized ErbB-2 molecules (22Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P. Bitton R. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Whitesell L. Schnur R. Moyer J.D. Nickers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4974-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). We observed the much more rapid formation of intracellular ErbB-2-containing vesicles, within 2 h of geldanamycin exposure. These vesicles also form when cells expressing the cytosolic GFP fusion protein with the ErbB-2 kinase domain are treated with geldanamycin. Also, the formation of these vesicles containing ErbB-2 is blocked by agents that interfere in the processing and acidification of endosomes, such as chloroquine, folimycin, and monensin. Hence, we conclude that these vesicles containing ErbB-2 are derived from the plasma membrane and that endosomal proteases, such as cathepsin B, participate in the degradation of internalized ErbB-2. The manner in which these vesicles are actually formed is, however, not clear. Inhibitors of cathepsin B, such as CA074-Me, have been shown to inhibited degradation of EGF and the EGF receptor within endosomes (30Authier F. Métioui M. Bell A.W. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33723-33731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Lastly, our results indicate that the kinase domain of ErbB-2 mediates sensitivity to geldanamycin. Previously, Miller et al. (19Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the ErbB-2 mutants lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain or the kinase domain are not degraded in cells treated with geldanamycin. Our analysis of chimeric receptors and GFP fusion protein agrees with that data. Geldanamycin induces the metabolic degradation of other protein kinases, such as Raf and Src. In the case of Raf, in particular, the geldanamycin-binding protein Hsp90 along with another protein p50 cdc37 interact with the raf kinase domain (36Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N. Cochran B.H. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 37Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It seems likely that a geldanamycin-binding protein, perhaps Hsp90, also interacts with the ErbB-2 kinase domain and, in the absence of geldanamycin, assists in the maintenance of this kinase domain in an active conformation. Given the intracellular abundance of proteins such as Hsp90, this interaction could be of low affinity and not readily detected by assays such as co-immunoprecipitation. Additional experiments will explore this issue. We appreciate the assistance of Sue Carpenter in preparation of the manuscript, and we thank David Coon for technical assistance."

In this study, we used two complementary approaches to investigate the function of cellular gangliosides in the response of mammalian fibroblasts to growth factors. First, inhibition of glucosyl ceramide synthase by a new specific inhibitor ofd-l-threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol-HCl (glucosylceramide synthase), which depletes cellular gangliosides at a concentration of 1 μm without causing an increase in ceramide levels, blocked epidermal growth factor-stimulated proliferation of fibroblasts.

Conversely, enrichment of cellular gangliosides by preincubation of the mouse and human fibroblasts with exogenously added gangliosides enhanced growth factor-elicited cell proliferation.

Thus, we considered it important to assess the influence of gangliosides present in their normal physiological location,i.e. in the cell plasma membrane, upon growth factor-induced signal transduction and proliferation. Several experimental approaches can be used to study the functions of endogenous gangliosides. One is to assess the effect of eliminating these molecules. Experiments in this direction have included sialidase gene transfection (7Meuillet E.J. Kroes R. Yamamoto H. Warner T.G. Ferrari J. Mania-Farnell B. George D. Rebbaa A. Moskal J.R. Bremer E.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 234-240PubMed Google Scholar), gene transfer (8Birkle S. Ren S. Slominski A. Zeng G. Gao L. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the development of a partial ganglioside knockout mouse (9Zhao J. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Furugen R. Miyazaki H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the application of enzyme inhibitors (10Rani C.S. Abe A. Chang Y. Rosenzweig N. Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have used the last approach in the present study. Specifically, we usedd-l-threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol-HCl (PPPP), a newly discovered specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (11Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), to inhibit ganglioside synthesis and down-regulate ganglioside expression. Glucosylceramide synthase is the key enzyme for glycosphingolipid synthesis. It catalyzes the synthesis of glucosylceramide from ceramide and glucose, which is the first step in the synthesis of neutral glycosphingolipids and, thus, gangliosides. We used PPPP rather than the widely studied related glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, d-PDMP, becaused-PDMP also causes ceramide accumulation (13Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Inokuchi J. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 183-213PubMed Google Scholar), and ceramide (14Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) and its metabolic products such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (15Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar) may act as second messengers and affect cell growth. In contrast, at a concentration ≤1.0 μm, PPPP has most recently been shown to specifically inhibit glucosylceramide synthesis, leading to the inhibition of ganglioside synthesis, without causing increased cellular ceramide levels (12Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). By this approach to blocking ganglioside synthesis, it is possible to test the hypothesis that cellular gangliosides are physiological modulators of growth factor-mediated cell proliferation. As a model system for studying growth control and cell cycle progression, the response of mammalian fibroblasts to growth factors is well established (16Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C.F. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson Jr., J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Proliferation of fibroblasts in vitrorequires growth factors, which are usually provided by fetal bovine serum. Upon the withdrawal of growth factors,e.g. serum deprivation, fibroblasts enter a nondividing G0 state, characterized by low metabolic activity. The subsequent addition of growth factors induces fibroblast proliferation. Using this model, we examined the role of cellular gangliosides in growth factor-induced proliferation. In fibroblasts that were induced to enter a quiescent state by serum deprivation and then stimulated by the addition of growth factors, the inhibition of cellular ganglioside synthesis effectively blocked the expected proliferative response. Conversely, and consistent with the above findings, enrichment of gangliosides in the plasma membrane by preincubation of the fibroblasts with exogenous gangliosides enhanced the growth factor-induced proliferative response. In addition, GD1a 2Gangliosides are abbreviated according to the nomenclature of L. Svennerholm (1963) J. Neurochem. 10, 613). GM3, NeuNAcα2–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer; GD3, NeuNAcα2–8NeuNAcα2–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer; GD1a, NeuNAc α2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4(NeuNAcα2–3)Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer. acted like a growth factor when cells were pretreated with the ganglioside, stimulating both mouse and human fibroblast proliferation. Finally, this study documents differential effects of preincubationversus continuous incubation of cells with gangliosides on growth factor-dependent cell proliferation. Whereas preincubation of cells with gangliosides enhanced growth factor-dependent proliferation, high concentrations of ganglioside GD1a inhibited cell proliferation when continuously present in the culture medium during incubation of fibroblasts with growth factors, as previously reported (17Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2434-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All growth factors were purchased from Sigma. EGF (6 kDa; mouse submaxillary glands, receptor grade) was reconstituted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). IGF-I (human recombinant) was reconstituted with 0.1 m acetic acid. PDGF (28 and 31 kd; human platelets) was reconstituted with 0.01 mm acetic acid and stored in plastic vials. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 16.4 kd; pituitary glands) was reconstituted with DMEM. All stock solutions were stored at −70 °C. Growth factors were directly added to the culture medium by diluting the stock solutions before use. Synthetic GM3 (d18:1–C18:0), which we previously studied in assays of lymphoproliferation (19Ladisch S. Hasegawa A. Li R. Kiso M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Ladisch S. Hasegawa A. Li R. Kiso M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Akira Hasegawa of Gifu University (Gifu, Japan). GD1a (bovine brain), GM3 and GD3(bovine buttermilk), and PPPP were purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Gangliosides were dissolved in serum-free medium and diluted in the culture medium for each assay. PPPP was dissolved in ethanol to a concentration of 1 mm and kept as a stock solution at −20 °C. For each experiment, PPPP was directly added into the culture medium. The final concentration of ethanol in the culture medium was ∼0.1% (v/v). Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured in fibroblast growth medium (FGM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT), 0.5 ml of insulin, 0.5 ml of human fibroblast growth factor, and 0.5 ml of GA1000 (Clonetics). For serum-free culture, fibroblast basal medium (FBM) was used. Cells from passages 3–7 were used for this study. The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines, Swiss 3T3, Balb/c 3T3 (Balb/3T3 clone A31), and 3T3-L1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. The culture medium was changed every 3 days. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS.d-[6-3H]-Galactose (specific activity, 25 Ci/mmol) and d-[6-3H]-glucosamine hydrochloride (specific activity, 30 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added to the culture medium (1 μCi/ml). The cells were incubated with the radiolabeled sugars for 5–7 h to label the cellular gangliosides (21Kong Y. Li R. Ladisch S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), washed with complete medium directly in the flask, and harvested by trypsinization. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline prior to processing for ganglioside purification, as described below. Total lipid extracts of cell pellets and culture supernatants were obtained by extracting the lyophilized starting material twice with chloroform, methanol (1:1, by volume) for 18 h at 4 °C with stirring. Gangliosides were isolated by partitioning the dried total lipid extract in diisopropyl ether, 1-butanol, 17 mm aqueous sodium chloride (6:4:5, by volume) (22Ladisch S. Gillard B. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Gangliosides, in the lower aqueous phase, were further purified by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration and quantified as nanomoles of lipid-bound sialic acid by the modified resorcinol method (23Ledeen R.W. Yu R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 139-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Ganglioside-associated radioactivity was quantified by β-scintillation counting. HPTLC analysis of gangliosides was performed using 10 × 20-cm precoated silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck). The plates were developed in chloroform, methanol, 0.25% aqueous CaCl2·2H20 (60:40:9, by volume) to separate gangliosides, which were stained as purple bands with resorcinol-HCl (23Ledeen R.W. Yu R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 139-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled gangliosides were revealed by exposing the HPTLC plate to XRP-OMAT x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). 14C-Labeled rat brain gangliosides (24Quarles R.H. Brady R.O. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which were prepared in our laboratory, were used as a standard. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were plated at 1–2 × 103 cells/well in 96-well flat bottom culture plates (area = 0.32 cm2; Corning Glass, Corning, NY) in DMEM with 10% FBS and incubated overnight. The culture medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing either 1 μmPPPP or 0.1% ethanol (solvent vehicle), and the cells were cultured for 3 days. Then, the culture medium was removed, and serum-free medium or low serum medium (0.5 and 1% FBS) containing either 1 μm PPPP ± growth factors or 0.1% ethanol ± growth factors were added to the plates. After an 18–24-h incubation, the cells were pulsed with 50 μl of [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml) for 2–3 h and harvested by a cell harvester. [3H]Thymidine uptake was measured by β-scintillation counting (Betafluor; National Diagnostics, Manville, NJ). The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples. After treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with 1 μm PPPP or 0.1% ethanol, cellular ceramide and sphingomyelin were analyzed as described previously (10Rani C.S. Abe A. Chang Y. Rosenzweig N. Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline directly in the flask and harvested by trypsinization. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted twice with 4 ml of chloroform, methanol (1:1). The supernatants were pooled. Chloroform (5 ml) and 0.9% NaCl (4 ml) were added to the pooled supernatants, which were vortexed, sonicated for 2 min, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The lower phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in chloroform, methanol (1:1). For HPTLC analysis of ceramide, the equivalent of 400 μg of cellular protein was spotted on an HPTLC plate and developed in chloroform, acetic acid (9:1, by volume). Ceramide (type III; Sigma) was used as a standard. For HPTLC analysis of sphingomyelin, 400 μg of cellular protein equivalent of sphingomyelin was spotted on an HPTLC plate and developed in chloroform, methanol, water (65:25:4, by volume). Bovine brain sphingomyelin (Matreya) was used as a standard. After development, the HPTLC plate was submerged in a charring reagent (3% cupric acetate; 10% phosphoric acid) and visualized by charring at 130 °C for 20 min. Densitometric scanning analysis of the bands was performed using a Shimadzu CS-930 dual-wavelength TLC scanner. The protein content of the pellet was determined by the Lowry method (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 266-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 cells were plated at 5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS. On the following day, 100 μl of fresh culture medium containing 14C-labeled sphingomyelin ([choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin; specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) was added to each well. At different time points, cells were harvested, and the uptake of 14C-labeled sphingomyelin was determined as pmol/103 cells. Fibroblasts were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates (area = 0.32 cm2; Corning Glass) in DMEM containing 10% FBS (Swiss 3T3 cells) or FGM containing 2% FBS (NHDF cells). In selected assays, fibroblasts were also seeded at 3 × 104 cells/well in the larger 24-well plates (area = 1.9 cm2; Corning Glass). The medium was replaced with fresh medium ± gangliosides or ± sphingomyelin on the following day. After an 18-h incubation, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were starved overnight in serum-free DMEM in the case of mouse embryonic fibroblasts or serum-free FBM in the case of NHDF cells. This medium was then replaced with serum-free medium ± EGF, and the cells were further cultured for 24 h. In some experiments the starvation period was omitted, and following incubation of the cells with gangliosides for 18 h, the culture medium was replaced directly with serum-free medium ± EGF, and the cells were further cultured for 24 h. During the final 3 h, the cells were pulsed with 50 μl of [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml) and harvested by a cell harvester. [3H]Thymidine uptake was determined by β-scintillation counting. In selected experiments, [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was also determined as described previously (17Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these same conditions, in parallel experiments cell counts of the 24-well plates were performed after trypsinization of the cells. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of duplicate or triplicate cultures. Scheme FS1 shows the two major experimental conditions that were used to evaluate the effect of gangliosides on cell proliferation. The difference between control groups and treatment groups was determined using Student's t test (two tailed, unpaired). To provide the basis for studying the role of cellular gangliosides in growth factor-induced fibroblast proliferation, we modulated ganglioside metabolism by targeting glucosylceramide synthase using the specific enzyme inhibitor, PPPP (11Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 611-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We studied Swiss 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts that contain GM3 and GD1a as the major ganglioside components. By resorcinol assay, the ganglioside content of Swiss 3T3 cells was found to be 7.1 nmol of lipid-bound sialic acid/mg of protein. To determine the kinetics of inhibition of ganglioside synthesis by PPPP, we cultured Swiss 3T3 cells in medium containing either 1 μm PPPP or 0.1% ethanol (solvent control) for up to 4 days. During the final 6 h, radiolabeled sugars were added to the culture medium. As shown in Fig.1 A, exposure of Swiss 3T3 cells to 1 μm PPPP rapidly inhibited ganglioside synthesis. As measured by metabolic radiolabeling, the rate of ganglioside synthesis was reduced from 725 to 164 dpm/mg of protein/h or 22% of the control within one day of treatment (Fig.1 A). By day 4, the rate of ganglioside synthesis was reduced to 6% of the control level. The HPTLC autoradiogram of metabolically radiolabeled gangliosides isolated from PPPP-treated cells confirmed the inhibitory effect of PPPP on ganglioside synthesis (Fig.1 B). When the effect of PPPP on cellular ganglioside content was examined, a rapid and time-dependent depletion of the cellular gangliosides was observed (Fig. 1 C). After Swiss 3T3 cells were exposed to 1 μm PPPP for 3 days, the cellular gangliosides were nearly completely depleted. The blocked ganglioside synthesis confirmed that PPPP is a potent inhibitor of ganglioside synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells.Figure 6Effect of preincubation with gangliosides on fibroblast [3H]thymidine uptake. Swiss 3T3 (left panels) and NHDF (right panels) cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate in DMEM with 10% FBS (Swiss 3T3 cells) or FGM with 2% FBS (NHDF cells). The medium was replaced with fresh culture medium ± ganglioside GD1a or GM3 on the following day. After an 18-h incubation with gangliosides, the medium was removed, and the cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight. This medium was then replaced with serum-free medium ± EGF, and the cells were further cultured for 24 h. Cell proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine uptake.

Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS containing either 1 μm PPPP or 0.1% ethanol for up to 4 days and were radiolabeled with [14C]galactose and [14C]glucosamine hydrochloride during the final 5 h as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cells were then harvested, and the gangliosides were purified. Ganglioside-associated radioactivity was measured by β-scintillation counting (A) and analyzed by HPTLC autoradiography (B).14C-Labeled rat brain gangliosides (RBG; 800 dpm) were used as a standard. The HPTLC plate was exposed to x-ray film for 2 weeks. In Panel C, the total cellular gangliosides were analyzed by HPTLC. Gangliosides were stained with resorcinol hydrochloride reagent. Human brain gangliosides (HBG; 6 nmol) were used as a standard. Lane C in both Panels B and C shows the gangliosides isolated from cells cultured in medium containing vehicle solvent (0.1% ethanol). Approximately 500 μg of protein-equivalent gangliosides were loaded on each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Swiss 3T3 cells are responsive to a number of growth factors, including EGF, bFGF, PDGF, and IGF-I. In the initial experiments, we examined the stimulation of proliferation of Swiss 3T3 cells by EGF. The dose-response curve (Fig.2 A) shows that 2 ng/ml EGF causes optimal stimulation of cell proliferation. This was true over a 10-fold range of cell densities (0.2–2.0 × 104cells/well, which equals 0.62–6.2 × 104cells/cm2) (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that this cell line is a good model for studying the role of gangliosides in modulating cell proliferation. To evaluate the effect of inhibition of ganglioside synthesis and depletion of cellular gangliosides on EGF-induced proliferation, we pretreated Swiss 3T3 cells with 1 μm PPPP or 0.1% ethanol (control) in normal culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) for 3 days. The cells were then incubated for 24 h in culture medium containing either 0.5% FBS ± 2 ng/ml EGF or 1% FBS ± 2 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 2 C). Cell proliferation was measured as DNA synthesis by [3H]thymidine uptake. When cells were incubated with EGF in culture medium containing 0.5% FBS, there was a 6-fold stimulation of [3H]thymidine uptake as compared with that of cells cultured in the absence of EGF. PPPP treatment of the cells caused 91% inhibition of the EGF-stimulated increase in [3H]thymidine uptake (Fig. 2 C). [3H]Thymidine uptake was similarly inhibited by PPPP treatment when cells were incubated with EGF in 1% FBS culture medium (Fig. 2 C) or in serum-free medium (not shown). The stimulation of proliferation by EGF was blocked whether cells were incubated with EGF in 1% FBS medium for 24 h or for 48 h (Fig. 2 D). Thus, in subsequent experiments, we incubated the cells with EGF for 18–24 h in low serum medium. When Swiss 3T3 cells were exposed to 1 μm PPPP for only 3 h during the [3H]thymidine pulse, [3H]thymidine uptake was not affected, indicating that PPPP itself did not affect the transport of [3H]thymidine through the cell plasma membrane. When cells were pretreated with 1 μm PPPP for 3 days and then washed to remove the enzyme inhibitor before incubation with EGF for 24 h, the [3H]thymidine uptake was 78% of the control (cells treated with EGF in 1% FBS medium + 0.1% ethanol). These results show that the inhibition of cell proliferation by PPPP was reversible and suggest that the inhibition of cell proliferation by PPPP is not toxic to the cells. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the inhibition of ganglioside synthesis down-regulates EGF-induced proliferation of Swiss 3T3 cells. We confirmed these findings in a second murine fibroblast cell line. Balb/c 3T3 cells were first exposed to 1 μm PPPP or 0.1% ethanol (control) in normal culture medium for 3 days. The cells were then incubated with or without EGF for 24 h in low serum (1% FBS) medium in the presence or absence of PPPP (1 μm). Under these conditions, the inhibition of cellular ganglioside synthesis completely blocked EGF-induced proliferation (Fig.3 A). In addition, depletion of cellular gangliosides inhibited proliferation induced by optimal concentrations of bFGF, PDGF, and IGF-I by 62, 50, and 69%, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar inhibitory effects on growth factor-induced cell proliferation were also observed in 3T3-L1 cells and Swiss 3T3 cells, again suggesting that the effects were not restricted to a single cell line. Ceramide is the precursor of glucosylceramide. Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthesis could possibly cause the accumulation of cellular ceramide. Because ceramide has been shown to cause cell growth arrest in a number of cell types (14Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), we examined whether exposure of the cells to PPPP caused ceramide accumulation. In fact, when Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated with 1 μm PPPP for up to 72 h, the ceramide level remained unchanged from that of control cells (2.22 ± 0.14 versus 2.24 ± 0.12 μ g of ceramide/mg of protein, control versus PPPP-treated cells, Fig. 4 A). This result is consistent with those of Lee et al. (12Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, the multiple bands of ceramide representing different fatty acyl chains also appeared unchanged (Fig. 4 A). These findings exclude the possibility that the antiproliferative effects of ganglioside depletion are due to ceramide accumulation. We further analyzed the effect of PPPP exposure on cellular sphingomyelin. HPTLC analysis (Fig. 4 B) shows sphingomyelin to migrate on the HPTLC plate as multiple bands (because of different fatty acyl chains in the ceramide portion). After a 24-h exposure to PPPP, the cellular sphingomyelin content, particularly the fast migrating band that contained the Cys24 fatty acyl chain, increased markedly (Fig. 4 B). This increased sphingomyelin level in PPPP-treated cells was persistent over the 72-h experimental period, and at 72 h was twice as high as the control level (11.7 ± 2.6 versus 23.3 ± 2.5 μg of sphingomyelin/mg of protein; control versus P4-treated cells, Fig. 4 B). Thus, PPPP does not cause ceramide accumulation but does result in increased sphingomyelin levels. To determine whether increased sphingomyelin content in PPPP-treated cells was responsible for the inhibition of growth factor-induced proliferation, we assessed the effect of addition of exogenous sphingomyelin on Swiss 3T3 cells. We first confirme"

However, whether activity is strictly necessary for synapse elimination has not been resolved directly. Here we report that synaptic terminals occupying motor endplates made electrically silent by tetrodotoxin and α-bungarotoxin block were frequently displaced by regenerating axons that were also both inactive and synaptically ineffective. Thus, neither evoked nor spontaneous activation of acetylcholine receptors is required for competitive reoccupation of neuromuscular synaptic sites by regenerating motor axons."

In this work, we report studies on the interaction between Sgs1 and DNA topoisomerase III in vitro and in vivo. Affinity chromatography experiments with various fragments of Sgs1, a 1447-amino acid polypeptide, suggested that its N-terminal one-fifth was sufficient for interaction with DNA topoisomerase III. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays also indicated that a fragment Sgs1(1-283), containing residues 1-283, inhibited the binding of DNA topoisomerase III to single-stranded DNA. A shorter protein fragment containing residues 1-107 also showed partial inhibition in these assays. Studies of a sgs1 top1 double mutant lacking both Sgs1 and DNA topoisomerase I showed that the slow growth phenotype of this double mutant is suppressed by expressing full-length Sgs1, but not Sgs1 without the N-terminal 107 amino acid residues. In sgs1 top3 cells devoid of DNA topoisomerase III, however, expression of full-length Sgs1 or Sgs1 lacking the N-terminal 107 amino acid residues has the same effect of reducing the growth rate of the double mutant. These in vitro and in vivo data indicate that Sgs1 and DNA topoisomerase III physically interact and that this interaction is physiologically significant."
https://openalex.org/W1616845142,"Low density lipoproteins (LDLs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. LDL has been shown to be mitogenic and proapoptotic for vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood and may result from an alteration in intracellular mitogenic signaling either directly by LDL or indirectly through an autocrine effect involving growth factor secretion and/or growth factor receptor expression. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an autocrine/paracrine factor for vascular smooth muscle cells and has potent anti-apoptotic effects. Thus, we hypothesized that part of the proliferative responses to LDLs may be explained by its modulation of IGF-1 or IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression. Treatment of rat vascular smooth muscle cells with increasing doses of native LDL dose-dependently increased IGF-1 mRNA by up to 2.6-fold; however, native LDL had no effect on IGF-1R mRNA expression. In contrast, the same doses of oxidized LDL significantly reduced IGF-1 and IGF-1R mRNA by 80 and 61%, respectively, and reduced IGF-1 and IGF-1R protein expression by 63 and 46%. In addition, native and oxidized LDL significantly increased IGF-1-binding protein-2 and IGF-1-binding protein-4 expression as measured by Western ligand blot. Most interestingly, anti-IGF-1 antiserum completely inhibited LDL-induced but not serum-induced increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation, indicating a requirement for IGF-1 in the LDL-stimulated mitogenic signaling pathway. In summary, these results suggest that native and oxidized LDLs have differential effects on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression. Because IGF-1 is a potent survival factor for vascular smooth muscle cells, our findings suggest that moderately oxidized LDL may favor proliferation of smooth muscle cells, whereas oxidized LDL may contribute to plaque apoptosis by local depletion of IGF-1 and IGF-1R. Low density lipoproteins (LDLs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. LDL has been shown to be mitogenic and proapoptotic for vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood and may result from an alteration in intracellular mitogenic signaling either directly by LDL or indirectly through an autocrine effect involving growth factor secretion and/or growth factor receptor expression. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an autocrine/paracrine factor for vascular smooth muscle cells and has potent anti-apoptotic effects. Thus, we hypothesized that part of the proliferative responses to LDLs may be explained by its modulation of IGF-1 or IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression. Treatment of rat vascular smooth muscle cells with increasing doses of native LDL dose-dependently increased IGF-1 mRNA by up to 2.6-fold; however, native LDL had no effect on IGF-1R mRNA expression. In contrast, the same doses of oxidized LDL significantly reduced IGF-1 and IGF-1R mRNA by 80 and 61%, respectively, and reduced IGF-1 and IGF-1R protein expression by 63 and 46%. In addition, native and oxidized LDL significantly increased IGF-1-binding protein-2 and IGF-1-binding protein-4 expression as measured by Western ligand blot. Most interestingly, anti-IGF-1 antiserum completely inhibited LDL-induced but not serum-induced increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation, indicating a requirement for IGF-1 in the LDL-stimulated mitogenic signaling pathway. In summary, these results suggest that native and oxidized LDLs have differential effects on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression. Because IGF-1 is a potent survival factor for vascular smooth muscle cells, our findings suggest that moderately oxidized LDL may favor proliferation of smooth muscle cells, whereas oxidized LDL may contribute to plaque apoptosis by local depletion of IGF-1 and IGF-1R. insulin-like growth factor-1 IGF-1 receptor rat aortic smooth muscle cells insulin-like growth factor-binding protein low density lipoprotein oxidized LDL Smooth muscle cell proliferation is a major step in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9970) Google Scholar). During restenosis after angioplasty, the accumulation of smooth muscle cells in the neointima is believed to be due to the combined process of cell proliferation and directed migration of arterial cells toward the intima. Both of these processes are potently stimulated by growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)1 (2Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Both IGF-1 and its receptor have been shown to be highly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions (3Grant M.B. Wargovich T.J. Ellis E.A. Caballero S. Mansour M. Pepine C.J. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Polanco J.I. Berciano M.T. Lafarga M. Leon J. Pocovi M. Rodriguez-Rey J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is also believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Foam cells, one of the hallmarks of atherosclerotic plaques, develop when monocyte-derived macrophages or smooth muscle cells within the arterial wall take up oxidized LDL (OxLDL) via scavenger receptors (5Witztum J.L. Lancet. 1994; 344: 793-795Abstract PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). There is a broad and continuous spectrum of oxidized LDL from so-called minimally modified LDL to fully oxidized LDL. These different forms of LDL may exert quite distinct biological properties (6Navab M. Berliner J.A. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Territo M.C. Lusis A.J. Shih D.M. Van Lenten B.J. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), but they also have common effects, such as the increase in smooth muscle cell growth (7Chatterjee S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 111: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Auge N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Negre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem.

Although a large body of data supports a role for both oxidative modifications of lipids and vascular smooth muscle cell mitogenesis in atherogenesis, mechanistic links between these two events are poorly elucidated and may result from the triggering of a mitogenic intracellular signal either directly by LDL or indirectly through an autocrine effect involving growth factor secretion and/or growth factor receptor modulation. Therefore, we tested the possibility that LDL through modulation of IGF-1 or IGF-1R expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) may increase DNA synthesis. Our results show that native or moderately modified LDL has quite distinct effects on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression when compared with fully oxidized LDL and that the effect of native or moderately modified LDL on smooth muscle cell proliferation depends at least in part on an autocrine or paracrine response elicited by the release of IGF-1. Cell culture media were purchased from Life Technologies (Basel, Switzerland). The antisera against rat IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 were a kind gift from Dr. S. Shimasaki (La Jolla, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against rat IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Iodinated IGF-1 was from NEN Life Science Products, and [3H]thymidine was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RASMC (kindly provided by Dr. K. Griendling, Emory University, Atlanta, GA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Prior to experiments, cells were serum-starved for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 μg/ml transferrin and 0.2 mm ascorbic acid (10Libby P. O'Brien K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by density ultracentrifugation from healthy human plasma and then dialyzed against EDTA-free phosphate-buffered saline to remove EDTA (11Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). OxLDL was prepared by incubating LDL with 5 μm CuSO4 for 2 h at 37 °C. The extent of modification was assessed by measuring the level of hydroperoxides (PerOXoquant, Pierce) (12Ou P. Tritschler H.J. Wolff S.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The average level of hydroperoxides were 16.7 ± 2.8 and 86.0 ± 4.7 nmol/mg LDL protein for native LDL and OxLDL, respectively, which is similar to previously published data (13Yoshida H. Quehenberger O. Kondratenko N. Green S. Steinberg D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All lipoproteins were used for experiments within 2–3 weeks after preparation. RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (14Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μg of total RNA was hybridized with [32 P]UTP-labeled antisense IGF-1R and IGF-1 riboprobe and cohybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase riboprobe (15Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. Saboutry S.E. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). After overnight hybridization at 42 °C and RNase digestion, samples were proteinase K-treated, phenol-extracted, and analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide/8 mol/liter urea denaturing gel electrophoresis. Densitometric analyses were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Homologous displacement binding assays were performed as described previously (16Ververis J.J. Ku L. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, RASMC cultured under serum-free conditions treated with or without native LDL or OxLDL for 24 h in 24-well plates were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-IGF-1 and 0–0.1 μmunlabeled IGF-1 for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in ice-cold binding buffer and solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH before counting. All assays were performed in duplicate for each experimental point. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND program. Specific IGF-1 immunoreactivity of cell-conditioned medium was determined as described previously (14Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell medium was dialyzed, lyophilized, and chromatographed using Bio-Gel P-30 polyacrylamide columns (Bio-Rad). IGF-1 fractions were assayed using a polyclonal anti-IGF-1 rabbit antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow, UCLA). Standard curves were generated using human recombinant IGF-1. Supernatants from RASMC treated with or without native LDL or OxLDL were subjected to Western ligand blotting using 4 × 105 cpm of125I-labeled IGF-1 as described previously (17Ververis J. Ku L. Delafontaine P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1994; 307: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Corresponding bands were confirmed by Western immunoblot to be of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 origin. After 48 h under serum-free conditions, cells were treated with or without native LDL or OxLDL in the presence or absence of either control IgG, IGF-1 antiserum, IGF-1, or anti-IGFBP-2 and anti-IGFBP-4 antibody for 24 h. One μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added during the last 2 h of the incubation period. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min in 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice, washed two times with ice-cold 95% ethanol, and lysed in 0.2 n NaOH. Samples were measured by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate. RASMC were incubated in the presence or absence of native LDL (100–250 μg/ml), OxLDL (100– 250 μg/ml), or staurosporine (1 μm) as a positive control for 48 h. Attached and floating cells were combined and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.8% SDS) followed by incubation with 500 units/ml RNase A and 20,000 units/ml RNase T1 for 1 h at 37 °C and 20 mg/ml proteinase K for 4 h at 50 °C. DNA fragmentation was then assessed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel. All experiments were performed at least three times. Comparison between groups was performed with Student'st test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Whereas native LDL dose-dependently increased IGF-1 mRNA expression up to 2.6-fold (p = 0.02), OxLDL caused a marked decrease after 24 h (p = 0.004) (Fig. 1). In contrast, native LDL had no significant effect on the expression of IGF-1R mRNA, and 100 μg/ml OxLDL reduced IGF-1R mRNA expression by 80% (p = 0.0008) (Fig. 1). In preliminary experiments, we found that native LDL produced a time-dependent increase in IGF-1 mRNA expression, with the biggest change after 12 and 24 h. We therefore chose the 24 h time point for all subsequent experiments (data not shown). To determine whether the effects seen with native LDL or OxLDL on IGF-1 and IGF-1R mRNA expression could also be observed at the protein level, cells treated with or without native LDL or OxLDL were assessed for IGF-1 protein by radioimmunoassay and for the number of IGF-1R binding sites by radioligand binding assays. Similarly to its effects on IGF-1 mRNA, native LDL dose-dependently increased IGF-1 protein in the cell supernatants by up to 3.2-fold (p = 0.05) when compared with control cells, whereas OxLDL markedly reduced the expression by 63% (p = 0.003) (Fig. 2). In contrast to its effect on IGF-1R mRNA expression, native LDL caused a small but significant increase in IGF-1R binding sites (p = 0.003), whereas OxLDL reduced IGF-1R protein expression by half, confirming the results on IGF-1R mRNA expression (p = 0.003) (Fig.3).Figure 3Native LDL increases and OxLDL decreases IGF-1R protein. RASMC were incubated with or without lipoproteins for 24 h. Radioligand binding studies were performed, and Scatchard analysis done using the LIGAND program. Shown is the percentage of increase in IGF-1R number of control (mean ± S.E. from 3–6 experiments). For definition of column labels, see Fig. 1legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to synthesis of IGF-1, vascular smooth muscle cells also synthesize and secrete various forms of IGFBPs, such as IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5 (18Cohick W.S. Gockermann A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Duan C.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These IGFBPs have been shown to have multiple functions, such as carrier functions in blood, storage of IGFs, inhibition of IGF-1 actions by preventing access to IGF-1R, and potentiation of the mitogenic response by providing a stable pool of growth factor (reviewed in Ref. 20Kelley K.M. Oh Y. Gargosky S.E. Gucev Z. Matsumoto T. Hwa V. Ng L. Simpson D.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 619-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that lipoproteins may interfere with vascular smooth muscle growth by acting on the IGF-1-binding proteins. Indeed, native LDL and OxLDL both significantly increased IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 expression as measured by Western ligand blot. However, there was no difference whether native LDL or OxLDL was used (Fig.4). Lipoproteins have been shown to increase DNA synthesis and to be responsible at least in part for the increase in vascular smooth muscle proliferation (9Auge N. Andrieu N. Negre-Salvayre A. Thiers J.-C. Levade T. Salvayre R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19251-19255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Libby P. Miao P. Ordovas J.M. Schaefer E.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 124: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, there are contradictory reports as to the effect of OxLDL on DNA synthesis. Because we observed that native LDL markedly increased IGF-1 protein expression, we hypothesized that this increase may in part explain the stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis. Therefore, we tested whether LDL augmented DNA synthesis in RASMC and whether this increase could be blocked by co-incubation with an antiserum against IGF-1. Native LDL dose-dependently increased thymidine incorporation and both antisera tested (obtained from the authors of Ref. 22Delafontaine P. Ku L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 33: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and from the National Institutes of Health) were effective in reducing this increase to control levels. Anti-IGF-1 antisera did not decrease fetal bovine serum-induced DNA synthesis, and control IgG had no effect (Fig.5). In contrast, we observed that OxLDL and extensively oxidized LDL (i.e. CuSO4oxidation for 24 h instead of 2 h) had opposite effects on DNA synthesis, which is in agreement with previous reports (8Auge N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Negre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and may reflect the inhibitory effect of OxLDL on IGF-1 expression (Fig.6). Addition of exogenous IGF-1, however, only partially blunted the depressor effect of OxLDL on thymidine incorporation (Fig. 6).Figure 6Decreasing effect of OxLDL on thymidine incorporation is partly inhibited by IGF-1. After 48 h of serum starvation, RASMC were treated with increasing doses of OxLDL in the presence or absence of exogenous IGF-1. Thymidine incorporation was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are mean ± S.E. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because we observed an up-regulation of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 induced by LDL and because IGFBP-4 is an inhibitory binding protein, whereas IGFBP-2 can be stimulatory or inhibitory, we also tested the possibility that the increase in DNA synthesis induced by native LDL and the decrease induced by OxLDL could be even further augmented by blocking IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-4. Thus, anti-rat IGFBP-2 and anti-IGFBP-4 were co-incubated along with native LDL or OxLDL. Control IgG had no effect on basal thymidine incorporation (data not shown), whereas anti-IGFBP-2 caused a small but significant decrease in basal thymidine incorporation and anti-IGFBP-4 potentiated basal DNA synthesis, confirming the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-4 (18Cohick W.S. Gockermann A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Anwar A. Zahid A.A. Phillips L. Delafontaine P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (TableI). However, neither co-incubation with anti-IGFBP-2 nor anti-IGFBP-4 changed native LDL or OxLDL-induced effects on DNA synthesis (Table I).Table IEffect of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 antibodies on native and oxidized LDL-induced DNA synthesisConditionBasal+ Anti-IGFBP-2+ Anti-IGFBP-4Control100 ± 077.4 ± 13.4187.4 ± 34.1Native LDL, 100 μg/ml207.3 ± 14.2185.4 ± 6.2180.5 ± 25.4Oxidized LDL, 100 μg/ml12.5 ± 5.512.3 ± 3.712.2 ± 2.9DNA synthesis of RASMC treated with or without native or oxidized LDL (100 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 antibodies (each at 1.2 μg/ml) was determined by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation.

Note that anti-IGFBP-2 and anti-IGFBP-4 significantly changed basal thymidine incorporation (p < 0.05). Oxidized LDL is cytotoxic to vascular cells and has been shown to induce apoptosis in smooth muscle cells, macrophages (24Bjorkerud B. Bjorkerud S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), endothelial cells (25Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Galle J. Zeiher A.M. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and lymphoid cells (26Escargueil-Blanc I. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also recently observed that in advanced human atherosclerotic lesions, poor IGF-1 and IGF-1R immunoreactivity in smooth muscle cells correlated well with increased OxLDL and Bax staining and that OxLDL up-regulated Bax protein expression in coronary smooth muscle cells in culture. 2Okura, Y., Brink, M., Itabe, H., Scheidegger, K. J., Kalanjos, A., Delafontaine, P. (2000) Circulation, in press. Because native LDL and OxLDL showed opposite effects on IGF-1 expression in the present studies, we assessed whether the reduction in IGF-1 expression by OxLDL could explain the well known effect on apoptosis in these cells. DNA fragmentation experiments revealed that only OxLDL, and not native LDL, caused DNA laddering (Fig. 7). Our results indicate that native LDL and OxLDL have differential effects on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression in smooth muscle cells and that the enhanced DNA synthesis observed with native or moderately oxidized LDL is at least partly linked to autocrine or paracrine release of IGF-1, whereas the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects of OxLDL may be rather related to its inhibitory effect on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression. Recent evidence suggests that LDL is atherogenic and that oxidative modification of LDL to OxLDL enhances its atherogenicity (27Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because IGF-1 is an important progression factor for smooth muscle cells and because IGF-1 expression is increased after balloon injury (28Cercek B. Fishbein M.C. Forrester J.S. Helfant R.H. Fagin J.A. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and in atherosclerotic lesions (4Polanco J.I. Berciano M.T. Lafarga M. Leon J. Pocovi M. Rodriguez-Rey J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it was of interest to us to compare the effects of native or minimally oxidized LDL and OxLDL on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression. Interestingly, so-called native LDL induced quite opposite effects on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression in RASMC when compared with OxLDL. Whereas native LDL caused an increase in IGF-1 mRNA, OxLDL greatly reduced basal expression of IGF-1. The effect was dose-dependent and was already evident starting at a very low dose of 10 μg/ml of OxLDL. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a regulation of IGF-1 by LDL in smooth muscle cells in vitro. In contrast, native LDL had no significant effect on IGF-1R mRNA expression but caused a small increase in IGF-1R protein levels. Similarly to its effect on the ligand, OxLDL reduced basal expression of IGF-1R. This is somewhat in contrast to the previous report by Polanco et al. (29Polanco J.I. Albajar M. Pocovi M. Rodriguez Rey J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), who described a 2-fold increase in IGF-1R mRNA expression after LDL treatment, although no specification as to the extent of modification of LDL was made. This discrepancy may be explained by either the use of a different cell line (rat aortic smooth muscle line A10 versus primary RASMC) or by the different dose of LDL (50 mg/ml in Ref. 29Polanco J.I. Albajar M. Pocovi M. Rodriguez Rey J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar versus 100 μg/ml in our study). In addition, we serum-starved our cells prior to stimulation with LDL. It is well known that the extent of oxidative modification of LDL may differ tremendously between isolations and method of oxidation. This may explain the lack of effect of native LDL on IGF-1R. The decrease in IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression by OxLDL, however, is in agreement with recent findings from our laboratory demonstrating a decrease in IGF-1 and IGF-1R immunoreactivity in the presence of positive OxLDL staining in human atherosclerotic lesions.2 Our results on the effect of native LDL or OxLDL on IGF-1 and IGF-1R mRNA expression were confirmed at the protein level. Native LDL at 100 μg/ml caused an 3-fold increase in IGF-1 mRNA and IGF-1 protein, whereas OxLDL at the same concentration decreased IGF-1 mRNA by 2.6-fold and IGF-1 protein expression by 2.7-fold. However, although native LDL did not increase basal expression of IGF-1R mRNA, it did increase it at the protein level. At present, it is not known why only a change at the protein level was found. The effect on IGF-1R expression by native LDL, although significant, was rather subtle. The number of IGF-1Rs was increased 1.5-fold by 100 μg/ml native LDL. Similarly to its effect on IGF-1R mRNA, OxLDL also decreased IGF-1R protein expression. These results clearly suggest that native LDL and OxLDL regulate mRNA and protein expression in opposite ways. It is now well known that IGF-1 is a strong mitogen and chemoattractant for smooth muscle cells (2Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 30Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These growth-promoting effects of IGF-1 are mediated through the IGF-1R, a tyrosine kinase receptor. However, the bioactivity of IGF-1 is further modulated by several high affinity binding proteins (IGFBPs) present in the vasculature (18Cohick W.S. Gockermann A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Duan C.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These IGFBPs control the distribution of IGF-1 between extracellular and cellular compartments and can also alter IGF-1 bioactivity by modulating its interaction with its receptor (31Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that vascular smooth muscle cells secrete several IGFBPs, among them IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 (17Ververis J. Ku L. Delafontaine P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1994; 307: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Cohick W.S. Gockermann A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell.

Forrester J.S. Fagin J.A. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 646-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), that are in turn cleaved by specific proteases that degrade the respective binding proteins to fragments with low or absent affinity for IGF-1 (31Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the major two IGFBPs found to be secreted by RASMC were IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4. Both were dose-dependently increased in the conditioned medium after stimulation with native LDL or OxLDL; however, there was no difference between the up-regulation induced by native LDL or OxLDL. We have previously shown that IGFBP-4 mRNA is greatly increased in the hypertensive aorta along with IGF-1 (35Anwar A. Delafontaine P. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because IGFBP-4 is considered to inhibit IGF-1 growth effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (18Cohick W.S. Gockermann A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), one may speculate that increases in IGFBP-4 by high levels of LDL serve to modulate and potentially limit local proliferative responses to IGF-1. The combination of inhibiting IGF-1 expression and at the same time decreasing IGF-1 bioavailability by increasing IGFBP-4 may be one of the mechanisms whereby OxLDL induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis in smooth muscle cells. In contrast, both stimulatory (36Bourner M.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Siegel N.R. Krivi G.G. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37Chambery D. de Galle B. Babajko S. J.

J. 1989; 258: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 39Gockerman A. Prevette T. Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) properties have been attributed to IGFBP-2, depending on cell context and the presence of certain factors, such as platelet-poor plasma. Experiments under basal conditions suggest that IGFBP-2 is rather stimulatory and IGFBP-4 inhibitory because anti-IGFBP-2 attenuated, whereas anti-IGFBP-4 potentiated basal DNA synthesis. The latter is in good agreement with previous results from our laboratory, in which anti-IGFBP-4 further increased thrombin-induced DNA synthesis (23Anwar A. Zahid A.A. Phillips L. Delafontaine P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, because neither anti-IGFBP-2 nor anti-IGFBP-4 had any effect on native LDL or OxLDL effects on thymidine incorporation, it is difficult to draw clear conclusions as to whether IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 act in a stimulatory or inhibitory manner in our context. Thus, it seems that changes in IGF-1 and IGF-1R levels account for the bulk of the stimulatory or inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis induced by native LDL and OxLDL rather than the levels of IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-4. The spectrum of oxidation of LDL is broad and ranges from so-called minimally modified LDL to extensively oxidized LDL (40Steinberg D. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 32: 469-472PubMed Google Scholar). These forms of LDL differ structurally and in their biological effects on vascular cells. Generally, native LDL has thiobarbituric acid reactive values of <1 nmol/mg LDL protein, minimally modified LDL has values of 10–15 nmol/mg (41Scheidegger K.J. Butler S. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21609-21615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and OxLDL generally has values of >30 nmol/mg LDL protein (42Han J. Hajjar D.P. Febbraio M. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21654-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The level of hydroperoxides measured by the Fox assay (43Jiang Z.Y. Hunt J.V. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar) suggests that what we assumed to be native LDL was actually already somehow modified and corresponded more to minimally oxidized LDL. Nevertheless, our results clearly show that LDL containing various amounts of hydroperoxide levels have different effects on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression in RASMC. These results may have important implications for understanding the growth-promoting effects of LDLs in the vascular wall. Thus, minimally oxidized LDL could promote growth of smooth muscle cells and other cells, such as macrophages, by increasing IGF-1 or IGF-1R gene expression in the vasculature. Macrophages and macrophage cell lines have previously been shown to secrete and express both IGF-1 and IGF-1R (44Hochberg Z. Hertz P. Maor G. Oiknine J. Aviram M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Arkins S. Rebeiz N. Biragyn A. Reese D.L. Kelley K.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because smooth muscle cells (along with other cell types) have the ability to modify LDL, this minimally modified LDL may accelerate lesion progression through activation and secretion of growth factors, adhesion molecules, or cytokines. In contrast, if minimally modified LDL is further oxidized, the decrease in IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression induced may contribute to apoptosis of the smooth muscle cells and thereby facilitate plaque instability or rupture. The finding that only OxLDL caused apoptosis, as measured by DNA fragmentation, is in agreement with this hypothesis. Obviously, more experiments are needed to fully comprehend this phenomenon and to determine whether LDLs have similar effects on IGF-1 or IGF-1R expression in other cells implicated in atherogenesis, such as macrophages. Low density lipoproteins exhibit a variety of biological properties, ranging from gene modulation of growth factors or adhesion molecules, changing the motility of monocyte/macrophages and the vasomotor properties of arteries, being cytotoxic (reviewed in Ref. 46Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar), and also being mitogenic for smooth muscle cells (8Auge N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Negre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways involved in the cellular effects triggered by native LDL or OxLDL, however, are only poorly understood. More recently, the proliferative effects of LDL have been attributed to induction of platelet-derived growth factor-AA, (47Stiko-Rahm A. Hultgardh-Nilsson A. Regnstrom J. Hamsten A. Nilsson J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (48Kim H.H. Yoo S. Lee W.S. Rhim B.Y. Hong K.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 383: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression (47Stiko-Rahm A. Hultgardh-Nilsson A. Regnstrom J. Hamsten A. Nilsson J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) as well as to the involvement of phospholipase D (49Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Hart C.M. Parthasarathy S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2005-2016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the sphingomyelin-ceramide signaling pathway (9Auge N. Andrieu N. Negre-Salvayre A. Thiers J.-C. Levade T. Salvayre R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19251-19255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that part of the proliferative responses of native and moderately OxLDL may be due to their effect on IGF-1 expression. Our data indicate that native LDL increased basal DNA synthesis and that this increase was completely blocked by co-incubation with rabbit IGF-1 antiserum, whereas control IgG had no effect, indicating a requirement for IGF-1 in the LDL-stimulated mitogenic signaling pathway. Our findings confirm earlier observations that moderately modified LDL stimulates smooth muscle cell DNA synthesis. More importantly, they suggest that this increase may be explained by autocrine or paracrine release of IGF-1. The finding that OxLDL did not stimulate DNA synthesis in our study but rather decreased it may be due to the depressor effect of OxLDL on IGF-1 expression. Also, the fact that the depressor effect of OxLDL on thymidine incorporation could only be partially reversed by adding IGF-1 may be explained by the reduction of IGF-1R induced by OxLDL. Thus, even high concentrations of IGF-1 could not compensate for the decrease in IGF-1R density. However, autocrine/paracrine IGF-1 is likely not the sole mediator of the increase in DNA synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells induced by modified LDL. Thus, recent reports have implied a role for increased platelet-derived growth factor-BB secretion (48Kim H.H. Yoo S. Lee W.S. Rhim B.Y. Hong K.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 383: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), a platelet-activating factor-like activity within the OxLDL (50Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A.

DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17791-17797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). IGF-1 is a potent survival factor and is known to exert antiapoptotic actions in several cell types (52Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). On the other hand, OxLDL has been shown to be cytotoxic and promote apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (24Bjorkerud B. Bjorkerud S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 53Morel D.W. Hessler J.R. Chisolm G.M. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2225-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dual effect of nativeversus OxLDL, i.e. its strong stimulation of IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression or in contrast its profound reduction, depending on the degree of oxidation of the LDL particle, is compatible with the conclusion that LDLs can exhibit quite different biological actions (6Navab M. Berliner J.A. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Territo M.C. Lusis A.J. Shih D.M. Van Lenten B.J. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Thus, LDLs play not only a role in atherogenesis but may also be involved in apoptotic changes due to the reduction of IGF-1 induced by OxLDL in vascular smooth muscle cells. This may be important in explaining vascular smooth muscle cell depletion in atherosclerotic lesions, which has been linked to plaque fissuring and acute coronary events (55Davies M.J. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 56Libby P. Geng Y.J. Aikawa M. Schoenbeck U. Mach F. Clinton S.K. Sukhova G.K. Lee R.T. Curr. Opin.

In summary, we have shown that native LDL and OxLDL have quite distinct effects on IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression. Whereas native LDL increases IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression, OxLDL decreases the basal expression of both the ligand and the receptor. However, LDL, whether native or oxidized, increased expression of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 to a similar degree. The requirement for IGF-1 in DNA synthesis induced by native LDL suggests that IGF-1 may be at least part of the signaling pathway mediating LDL effects on vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2046448349,"The capacity of inflammatory cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to cleave tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and alter its activity was investigated. MMP-7 (matrilysin) rapidly cleaved TFPI to a major 35-kDa product. In contrast, MMP-1 (collagenase-1), MMP-9 (gelatinase B), and MMP-12 (macrophage elastase) cleaved TFPI into several fragments including the 35-kDa band. However, rates of cleavage were most rapid for MMP-7 and MMP-9. NH(2)-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that MMP-12 cleaved TFPI at Lys(20)-Leu(21)(close to Kunitz I domain and producing a 35-kDa band), Arg(83)-Ile(84) (between Kunitz I and II domains), and Ser(174)-Thr(175) (between Kunitz II and III domains). MMP-7 and MMP-9 cleaved TFPI at Lys(20)-Leu(21) with additional COOH-terminal processing. These MMPs did not cleave tissue factor (TF), factor VII, and factor Xa. Proteolytic cleavage by MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-9, and MMP-12 resulted in considerable loss of TFPI activity. These observations indicate specific cleavage of TFPI by MMPs, which broadens their substrate profile. Co-localization of MMPs, TF, and TFPI in atherosclerotic tissues suggests that release of MMPs from inflammatory cell leukocytes may effect TF-mediated coagulation."

Biol. Chem.274, 34523–34526). Here we show that binding of (Gly-Pro-Pro)n peptides to HSP47 can be detected using the two-hybrid system in yeast if a trimerizing domain is fused to the C termini of the peptides. Some peptides interacted with HSP47 at a lowered assay temperature at 24 °C but not at 30 °C, indicating the importance of conformational change of the substrate peptides. To analyze the spectrum of HSP47 substrate sequences, we performed two-hybrid screening of collagen-like peptides in designed random peptide libraries using HSP47 as a bait. In selected peptides, the enrichment ratio calculated for each amino acid residue correlated strongly with the contribution of the residue to triple-helix stability independently determined using synthetic collagen model peptides. Taken together, our results suggest that HSP47 preferentially recognizes collagenous Gly-X-Y repeats in triple-helical conformation.

Koide, unpublished observation. it appears that HSP47 may function through specific binding to the helix-forming portions of procollagen. However, the function of HSP47 at the molecular level remains unclear. In a previous report, we showed that typical collagen model peptides ((Pro-Pro-Gly)n, n ≥ 7) were recognized by HSP47 in an in vitro binding assay (5Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The strength of this interaction increased with increasing length of the model peptides, and the interaction was negatively regulated by prolyl 4-hydroxylation at the second Pro residues of the triplets. In immature procollagen α-chains (preproto α-chains), Pro is the most common amino acid residue in the X and Ypositions of Gly-X-Y triplets, but a variety of residues other than Pro are also found in both positions (6Ramshaw J.A.M. Shah N.K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The longest uninterrupted series of (Gly-Pro-Pro)n repeats in a preprotocollagen is the five-repeat series (n = 5) found in the human, bovine, chick, rat, and mouse α1(I) chain. And the longest (Pro-Pro-Gly)n repeats are also the five repeats in the human α2(I) chain. The initial aims of the present study were to elucidate amino acid preferences in HSP47 substrate peptides and to try to identify a putative consensus sequence for HSP47 binding using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen collagenous sequences. We developed a method of detecting specific interaction between HSP47 and collagen model peptides using the yeast two-hybrid system. Using this method, we analyzed the effects of model (Gly-Pro-Pro)n substrate length and assay temperature on interaction with HSP47. We also investigated the effect of amino acid replacement in the (Gly-Pro-Pro)n peptides as a function of assay temperature. Finally, we constructed two peptide libraries containing diverse collagen-like sequences and screened these libraries for HSP47 binding sequences using the yeast two-hybrid system. The data obtained in this study highlighted the conformational basis of HSP47 substrate preference rather than identifying a consensus sequence for HSP47 binding. Restriction enzymes, Taq polymerase (ExTaq), DNA ligase, and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd. (Kusatsu, Japan). DNA fragments were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan). Chemicals were purchased from either Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) or Wako Pure Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan). DNA sequencing was carried out on an ABI PRISM 377A sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). The identities and orientations of the inserts of all plasmid constructs, except for those in random peptide libraries, were confirmed by sequencing. To generate pYL94 encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to HSP47, the mouse hsp47 gene (7Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Nakai A. Kudo H. Saga S. Nagata K. Eur. J.

The resulting 1.2-kb fragment was subcloned into pT7Blue T-Vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate pYL42. pYL42 was digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and the 1.2-kbBamHI-EcoRI fragment was subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pAS2–1 (CLONTECH) to yield pYL94. To construct pYL97 encoding the GAL4-activation domain (AD) fused with the K100-C1q-like domain, the DNA fragment encoding the C1q-like domain of the K100 gene (GenBankTM accession numberAB044560) was amplified by PCR with the primers YOR68–6 (5′-TTA GGA TCC ACG CGG CCG GGG CTA TC-3′) and YOR68–7R (5′-GGG GAA TTC TCA GTC AGC ATA AAT AAT AAA-3′).

The yeast strain CG-1945 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, cyh r 2, LYS2::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -HIS3, URA3::GAL4 17-mers(x3) -CYC1 TATA -LacZ) was used for two-hybrid screening and was grown in either yeast-peptone-dextrose or synthetic dropout medium containing appropriate mixtures of amino acids and nucleosides. Introduction of plasmids into yeast cells was performed using YEASTMAKER Yeast Transformation System (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two-hybrid binding assays to detect interaction between HSP47 in the binding hybrid and peptides in the activation hybrids were performed according to the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (CLONTECH). A human lamin C fragment in pAS2–1 (pLAM5′-1,CLONTECH) was used as a negative control. Two-hybrid screening of random collagenous peptide libraries was performed at a culture temperature of 30 °C according to the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (CLONTECH), using HSP47 (pYL94) as a bait. Initial screening was carried out using histidine auxotrophic assays on agar plates, and the resulting positive clones were further screened using β-galactosidase assays on nitrocellulose membranes. Yeast cells harvested from 5 ml of liquid culture were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Lysate proteins (10 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To detect the activation hybrid proteins, anti-GAL4AD monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) was used as a primary antibody, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Escherichia coli JM109 cells carrying pYL103 were grown in 5 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. The expression of the recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm), and the culture was continued for 1 h. Cell lysates were prepared as described elsewhere (9Asada S. Koide T. Yasui H. Nagata K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). GST-K100 Clq-like domain fusion protein in the lysate was adsorbed onto 0.3 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the beads were washed four times with 10 mm Hepes·Na (pH 7.5), 3.7 mm EDTA, 0.4m NaCl. The fusion protein on the beads was cleaved by overnight treatment with 2 units of Factor Xa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Hepes·Na (pH 8.2), 150 mmNaCl containing 1 mm CaCl2 at room temperature. The supernatant containing a recombinant K100 C1q-like domain was collected. For chemical cross-linking, ice-cold solutions of the recombinant K100 C1q-like domain (∼100 μg/ml), GST, ovalbumin, or bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml each) in 50 mm Hepes·Na (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl were mixed with glutaraldehyde (final concentration 0.09%) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 2× Laemmli's SDS sample buffer, and products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In an earlier report (5Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we detected the specific binding of recombinant GST·HSP47 fusion protein to immobilized synthetic (Pro-Pro-Gly)n peptides when n was not less than 7 and showed that prolyl 4-hydroxylation (which converts Pro residues to 4-hydroxyprolyl (Hyp) residues) at the second Pro residue of each triplet has a negative effect on the interaction. As yeast cytosol is unlikely to contain prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, a similar binding assay was performed using the yeast two-hybrid system. A plasmid encoding mouse HSP47 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4BD) was transfected into yeast cells harboring HIS3 and LacZ genes in GAL4-driven reporter constructs. Synthetic DNA fragments containing various numbers of Gly-Pro-Pro repeats were fused to the gene encoding the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD), and these plasmids were also introduced into the yeast cells. The binding of the hybrid proteins expressed in the yeast cells was assessed by growth on histidine-depleted agar plates and by β-galactosidase assay on nitrocellulose membranes. In this system, no interaction was detected between HSP47 and peptides containing 5–10 repeats of (Gly-Pro-Pro) (Fig. 1 A), in contrast to the results of the in vitro solid-phase binding assay using synthetic (Pro-Pro-Gly)n peptides (5Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In parallel with the experiments above, one of the authors (T. Yorihuzi) cloned a gene encoding a novel C1q-like protein, tentatively named K100 protein, from an E17 mouse embryo cDNA library by two-hybrid screening using HSP47 as a bait. The open reading frame of the gene encodes an N-terminal signal sequence and 17 repeats of Gly-X-Y followed by a C-terminal globular domain. The globular domain is equivalent to the so-called C1q module (10Bork P. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Hegyi H. Bork P. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and shows 28 and 34% amino acid identity with the corresponding domains of mouse C1q-B chain and type X collagen, respectively. 4T. Yorihuzi and K. Nagata, manuscript in preparation. Interaction between HSP47 and K100 protein was detected in the two-hybrid system only when the C1q-like domain was present at the C terminus of the Gly-X-Y repeat sequence of K100, although the C1q-like domain itself did not interact with HSP47 (data not shown). We therefore fused the C1q-like domain to the C termini of the (Gly-Pro-Pro)n peptides in the activation hybrids and tested for binding to HSP47. Specific interaction was detected when the number of triplet repeats fused to the C1q-like domain was greater than 7 (Fig. 1 A). This result demonstrates that the interaction between HSP47 and (Gly-Pro-Pro)n peptides can be detected in the yeast two-hybrid system. In the presence of the K100 C1q-like domain, the strength of the interaction depended on the length of the peptides in a manner consistent with our previous observations based on the in vitro binding assay (5Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Next, we wished to clarify the role of the K100 C1q-like domain in HSP47-peptide interactions in the two-hybrid system. To determine whether the K100 C1q-like domain simply stabilized the activation hybrids by preventing enzymatic degradation in the cells, we examined the cellular protein levels of the activation hybrids by Western blotting using anti-GAL4AD antibody. The protein levels of the activation hybrids remained relatively constant, regardless of the presence or absence of the K100 C1q-like domain (Fig. 1 B). The C1q-like domain of type X collagen is reported to form a very stable trimer that remains intact even in SDS-containing buffers (12Frischholz S. Beier F. Girkontaite I. Wagner K. Pöschl E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22409-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We looked for the formation of such a stable trimer by the K100 C1q-like domain using unboiled SDS-PAGE samples of the yeast lysate but did not detect any bands corresponding to the expected molecular mass of a trimer (Fig. 1 B). We further investigated the possible oligomer-forming properties of the K100 C1q-like domain using a more sensitive method. The recombinant K100 C1q-like domain was expressed in E. coli cells, purified, and cross-linked in solution using glutaraldehyde, and the products of the cross-linking reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The major cross-linked products migrated at positions corresponding to dimer and trimer (Fig. 2). Under the same cross-linking conditions, GST (control for dimeric proteins; Ref. 15Maru Y. Afar D.E. Witte O.N. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15353-15357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) migrated as a dimer, whereas no oligomer formation was evident in reactions containing ovalbumin or bovine serum albumin (controls for monomeric proteins) (Fig. 2 A). However, the majority of recombinant K100 C1q-like domain eluted in the monomer fraction on high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration analysis at room temperature (data not shown). These results indicate that the K100 C1q-like domain possesses an intrinsic homotrimer-forming propensity, but the trimer that it forms is not particularly stable. The C1q-like domain fused to the C termini of the (Gly-Pro-Pro)npeptides may, therefore, have moderately stabilized trimers of the activation hybrids in the yeast cells and shifted the melting temperatures of the peptides up to the window of temperatures at which two-hybrid assay can be performed. The thermal stability of collagenous triple-helices is known to depend on the lengths of the peptides; longer peptides show higher melting temperatures than shorter ones consisting of different numbers of the same triplet units (16Fields G.B. Prockop D.J. Biopolymers. 1996; 40: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The result shown in Fig. 1 led us to speculate that a trimeric (or triple-helical) conformation of the (Gly-Pro-Pro)n peptides may be responsible for interaction with HSP47. If this were true, then peptides with fewer than eight repeats of (Gly-Pro-Pro) would be expected to bind to HSP47 at lower temperatures. We therefore carried out two-hybrid binding assays at 24 °C rather than 30 °C. When the two-hybrid assay was performed at 24 °C, we detected binding of (Gly-Pro-Pro)7 to HSP47 (Fig.3 A) even though this peptide did not appear to bind to HSP47 at 30 °C (Fig. 1 A). In preprotocollagen, the native substrate of HSP47, the Xand Y positions of the Gly-X-Ytriplets are often occupied by amino acid residues other than proline. In addition, Pro to Ala substitutions in collagen model peptides are known to decrease the thermal stability of the triple-helical conformation (17Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To investigate structure-activity relationships in HSP47 substrate peptides, Pro residues at either the X or the Y position of (Gly-Pro-Pro)8 were replaced with Ala residues. A single substitution of Ala for Pro at the middleX position of the parent peptide abolished HSP47 binding activity at 30 °C (Fig. 3 B, GAP1). In contrast, a single substitution at the Y position did not affect the binding (GPA1). This difference indicates that Pro residues in the Xand Y positions do not contribute equally to the interaction with HSP47. Double substitution of Pro residues at either Xor Y positions abolished the interaction with HSP47 at both 24 and 30 °C (GAP2 and GPA2). The binding of the Ala-substituted peptides was also dependent on temperature; when the assay was performed at 24 °C, GAP1 displayed HSP47 binding activity. These results imply that not only the trimeric structure but also the triple-helical conformation of the substrate peptides is responsible for their interaction with HSP47. The screening of combinatorial peptide libraries is a powerful strategy for identification of sequences, which interact with a specific protein of interest. This strategy has been successful in identifying binding motifs using synthetic peptide libraries (18Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 19Lam K.S. Salmon S.E. Hersh E.M. Hruby V.J. Kazmierski W.M. Knapp R.J.

Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), and the two-hybrid system in yeast cells (21Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 386: 548-550Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We have applied such a combinatorial library technique to yeast two-hybrid screening. To determine the binding preferences of HSP47 for amino acid residues at the X and Y positions of the substrate collagen-like peptides, we designed random peptide libraries for two-hybrid selection. Because (Gly-Pro-Pro)8combined with a C-terminal K100 C1q-like domain was the minimal peptide required for interaction with HSP47 under the standard assay conditions at 30 °C (Fig. 1 A), the random peptides in the activation hybrid library were fixed to 24-mers (encoding 8 triplets). The Gly residues at every third position were also fixed, because the Gly residues are conserved in all types of collagen. If all of theX and Y residues of (Gly-X-Y)8 are randomized, the theoretical diversity is 2016 = 6.6 × 1020. This value is far beyond the practical limit of diversity that can be screened by colony selection. We therefore constructed two independent peptide libraries, an X library and a Y library, in which six of the eight Pro residues at eitherX or Y positions were randomized (Fig.4). The DNA fragments encoding the randomized peptides were chemically synthesized, amplified by PCR, and inserted in frame between the sequences encoding GAL4AD and the K100 C1q-like domain (Fig. 4). The theoretical diversity of each library is 206 = 6.4 × 107. We next characterized the diversity of each of the peptide libraries expressed in yeast cells by sequence analysis of the transfected plasmid DNA. Of 200 clones chosen at random from the X library, 121 (60.5%) contained uncorrupted inserts encoding 24-mer peptides, and 80 (40%) of 200 randomly chosen clones from the Y library contained normal inserts. The random nature of the amino acid residues present in the degenerate positions was also confirmed by sequence analysis. The frequency of occurrence of each amino acid residue in the degenerate positions of the 200 randomly chosen peptides was taken as the basis for the calculation of enrichment ratios after two-hybrid selection. Using HSP47 as a bait, 1 × 107 clones of the X library were screened. This two-hybrid screening yielded positive clones from neither the histidine auxotrophic selection nor the β-galactosidase assay. The probability that six degenerate X positions are all occupied by Pro residues is 20−6 (= 6.4 × 10−7) and that any five X positions are occupied by Pro residues is 7.3 × 10−5 (= 20−6 × 19 × 6). Because the net clone number screened was estimated to be 6.05 × 106 (= 60.5% of 1 × 107), this result indicates that none of the Pro residues at the X positions can be replaced with any other amino acid residues in the (Gly-Pro-Pro)8 peptide under these assay conditions. Similar selection from 7 × 105 clones of the Y library yielded 88 clones that showed specific interaction with HSP47. The different contributions of the X and Ypositions to interaction with HSP47 was also demonstrated using (Gly-Pro-Pro)n peptides with Ala substitutions (Fig.3 B, compare GAP1 to GPA1). Residues in the Xpositions are more accessible to the solvent in the triple helix (22Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), and (Gly-Pro-Y)n sequences show higher melting temperatures of the triple helix than the corresponding (Gly-X-Pro)npeptides (23Feng Y. Melacini G. Goodman M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8716-8724Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, residues at the X and Ypositions in the Gly-X-Y repeats appear to contribute differently to either the triple helix stability or the formation of the HSP47 binding surface. Because GAP1 interacted with HSP47 at 24 °C (Fig. 3 B), most of the peptides in the X library appear to have failed to form triple-helical structures under the screening conditions at 30 °C. To exclude any possible experimental bias that might have affected the selection, we compared the amounts of the activation hybrids expressed in the HSP47-selected yeast clones with those in randomly chosen negative clones. Protein levels estimated by immunoblotting using anti-GAL4AD antibody were not significantly different between the clones examined, regardless of the HSP47 binding activity of the peptides (Fig. 5). We therefore conclude that the result of two-hybrid selection may be attributed directly to the HSP47 binding property of the substrate peptides. All of the peptide sequences deduced from the DNA sequences of the selected clones are shown in Fig. 6. We could not identify any characteristic order in the primary amino acid sequences of the individual peptides. Most of the amino acid residues were almost uniformly distributed throughout the randomizedY positions of HSP47 binding peptides. Arginine residues, which have been reported to possess a triple-helix stabilizing effect comparable to that of Hyp residues (24Yang W. Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), were most strongly enriched (up to 6-fold) in the HSP47 binding peptides relative to basal values taken from 200 randomly chosen peptides. Proline residues were also highly enriched (about 5-fold). On the other hand, Asp, Phe, Gly, Asn, and Trp residues were apparently excluded (less than 20% of the basal frequency, Fig. 7).Figure 7Enrichment ratios of amino acid residues in peptides selected from the Y library.

Surprisingly, the enrichment ratios for amino acid residues at theY position of our model peptides correlated strongly with the thermal stabilities of corresponding collagen model peptides reported in the literature (Fig. 8). This correlation clearly demonstrates the importance of triple-helical structure in substrate recognition by HSP47. Selection by HSP47 binding from the Y library appears to be attributable to the triple-helix-forming propensities of the substrate peptides. In this study, we have focused on the molecular determinants of HSP47 substrate recognition. In this study, we established a yeast two-hybrid assay system to study the interaction between HSP47 and substrate peptides. Using this assay, we have obtained the following evidence that HSP47 preferentially recognizes triple-helical peptides as binding substrates: 1) a trimerizing domain, such as the K100 C1q-like domain, fused to the peptides was required for detectable interaction (Figs. 1 and 2); 2) some peptides were bound by HSP47 at 24 °C but not at 30 °C, suggesting that the melting temperature of the triple helix may be an important factor in binding (Fig. 3); and 3) amino acid residues, which stabilize the triple helix, such as Arg and Pro, were enriched in the group of peptides selected from the Y library and vice versa (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Although the real function of HSP47 is still ambiguous, the studies on the substrate recognition lead us to some working hypotheses. In the previous paper, we showed that HSP47 prefers Pro residues at theY positions rather than Hyp in the context of the (Pro-Y-Gly)n sequence (5Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Combined with the result shown in this paper, it seems that HSP47 retains triple helical procollagen molecules having less prolyl 4-hydroxylated portions in the ER. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase is also reported to bind to a less prolyl 4-hydroxylated form of single chain procollagen (27Walmsley A.R. Batten M.R. Lad U. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14884-14892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These mechanisms may be expected to ensure the quality of procollagen molecules to be secreted, although it is not known whether HSP47 can exert a quality control mechanism alone or in cooperation with prolyl 4-hydroxylase. It is not clear whether HSP47 exclusively binds to triple helical portions containing Gly-Pro-Pro triplets or other triplets such as Gly-Pro-Arg can be accomodated to the HSP47-binding sites, because all peptides designed for two hybrid screening contain known HSP47 binding sequences such as Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly and Gly-Pro-Pro at both ends of the randomized sites (Fig. 4). If the sequences other than (Gly-Pro-Pro)ncan form HSP47-binding sites, our finding that HSP47 prefers triple helical substrates suggests another role of HSP47; HSP47 might facilitates procollagen folding in the ER by stabilizing partially folded triple helical intermediates that would be otherwise unstable at body temperature. Further biochemical and physicochemical studies using individual model peptides would clarify the molecular function of HSP47 as collagen-specific chaperone. Although we initially undertook two-hybrid screening of the peptide libraries with a view to identifying HSP47 binding motifs in the primary structure, no such motifs were apparent from our results. Instead, we have obtained information regarding the preferred secondary structure of HSP47 substrates (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). It is of note that this is the first case, to our knowledge, in which biological selection from combinatorial libraries has provided information about intermolecular conformation. We believe that the similar two-hybrid method will be a powerful tool to elucidate the substrate conformation of other collagen-binding proteins. We are grateful to Dr. Konrad Beck for valuable discussion."

Horm. 1994; 49: 197-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the protein product is known as the androgen-binding protein (ABP). Testicular ABP has exactly the same primary structure and steroid-binding properties as plasma SHBG and is thought to control androgen-dependent sperm maturation in the male reproductive tract (1Hammond G.L.

Romas N.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but the biological impact of these interactions remains obscure. Studies of human and rabbit SHBG with the luminescent lanthanide, terbium, have indicated that each dimer of SHBG contains four metal-binding sites (7Ross J.B.A. Contino P.B. Lulka M.F. Petra P.H. J. Protein Chem. 1985; 4: 299-304Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At least one of these sites was assumed to bind calcium because calcium ions stabilize the steroid-binding activity of the purified protein (8Rosner W. Toppel S. Smith R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 351: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and enhance SHBG dimer formation (9Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A calcium-binding site was recently located within the amino-terminal laminin G-like domain (G domain) of human SHBG, which was complexed with steroid ligand, but it is at least 20 Å from the closest steroid atom and is not close to the proposed dimer interface (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, a strong difference density peak was observed at the end of strand β6 in this crystal structure but was unsatisfactorily modeled as another calcium-binding site because of multiple conformations of the coordinating side chains (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The location of this second metal-binding site was intriguing because it lies in the vicinity of a disordered region in the crystal structure of the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBG, which loops over the steroid-binding site (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, amino acids within this particular region of human SHBG can be affinity labeled with reactive groups attached to steroid ligands (11Namkung P.C. Kumar S. Walsh K.A. Petra P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18345-18350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their substitution with residues in the corresponding position of rat ABP results in altered steroid-binding specificity (9Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The possibility that the second metal-binding site might have been partially occupied by zinc in our original crystal structure (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was considered because histidine residues are present at the end of strand β6, as well as in the disordered loop over the steroid-binding site. Furthermore, the histidine at the end of strand β6 is next to Asn82, which forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl-group at C17 in the steroid ring D (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that coordination of a metal ion, such as Zn2+, in this position might influence the steroid-binding activity of SHBG. There are large amounts of zinc in the male reproductive tract, especially in locations where SHBG may play a role in regulating the activities of sex-steroids, such as the prostate (12Lahtonen R. Prostate. 1985; 6: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Cowan R.A. Cowan S.K. Giles C.A. Grant J.K. J. Endocrinol. 1976; 71: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to determine if a metal-binding site exists in this region of human SHBG and if its occupancy by zinc influences the steroid-binding specificity of the protein. Crystals of the amino-terminal G domain of SHBG were obtained as described (14Grishkovskaya I. Sklenar G. Avvakumov G.V. Dales D. Behlke J. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 2053-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Single crystals were harvested from the crystallization droplets and soaked for three days in a “soaking solution” (5% polyethylene glycol 400 and 20% isopropanol in 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmCaCl2, 1.5 μm 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 2.5 mm ZnCl2). Before flash cooling to prevent ice formation, the crystals were transferred for 5 min into the soaking solution to which 20% (v/v) glycerol had been added. A data set to 1.7 Å resolution was collected on beamline ID14 at the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble at a wavelength of 0.933 Å using a MarCCD detector. A total of 120 exposures recorded in three different passes, with one and two degree oscillation steps each and aiming at different resolution shells, yielded a 96.3% complete data set with a mergingR-factor of 6.5% in program XDS (15Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). When keeping the Friedel pairs unmerged, the data set is still 95.3% complete (TableI).Table IAnalysis of zinc-soaked human SHBG crystalsData Collection Space groupR32 Cell parameters a, c (Å)104.02, 84.71 Resolution (Å)20–1.7 (1.8–1.7)1-aValues for the highest resolution shell are given in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab The zinc-soaked crystals of SHBG are of space group R32 with cell axes a = 104.02 Å and c = 84.71 Å and are isomorphous to the crystals of the previously reported (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) SHBG model (Protein Data Bank accession number 1d2s). Structure refinement was straightforward, starting with a model consisting of only the polypeptide chain and the bound DHT, and alternating between rounds of visual inspection with program O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and refinement with program REFMAC (17CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Initial Sigmaa-weighted difference density maps (18Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) clearly revealed the locations of the metal ions, and the identity of the bound cations became apparent in a density map calculated with the anomalous differences and shifted model phases. The difference in the anomalous scattering between Zn2+ and Ca2+(f“ = 2.29 and 0.52 at 0.933 Å) gave rise to 17.6 and 11.4 ς peaks at the two Zn2+ locations (sites II and III; see below) but only to a 5.0 ς peak at the Ca2+-binding site. In final refinement rounds, an explicit bulk solvent mask calculated with program XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) was introduced into REFMAC. The final model consists of residues 13–131 and 136–188 of SHBG, one molecule of DHT, and one Ca2+ and two Zn2+ ions (TableI). The model also includes 130 solvent molecules and one isopropanol molecule on top of a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1F5F). Human SHBG was isolated from shbg4-c transgenic mouse serum (20Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as follows: the serum was diluted with an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and (NH4)2SO4was added to 10% saturation at 0 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 × g, the pellet and floating lipid were discarded. To the supernatant, (NH4)2SO4 was added to 50% saturation at 0 °C. The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, the pellet was redissolved in a minimum volume of water, and the solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The dialyzed solution was centrifuged to remove particulate material, and was loaded onto an fast protein liquid chromatography column packed with 8 ml of anion-exchange resin SOURCE 15Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 μmtestosterone. Elution was performed using a linear 0–0.25m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing SHBG were identified using a steroid-binding capacity assay (21Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and combined for dialysis prior to a second round of anion-exchange chromatography on a 1-ml SOURCE 15Q fast protein liquid chromatography column. Fractions (0.5 ml) containing SHBG were again combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration through an Ultrafree 15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore), and subjected to gel filtration on a fast protein liquid chromatography column packed with Superdex 75 and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1M NaCl, 1 μmtestosterone. The fractions containing SHBG were combined for final purification by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Model 491 Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). The yield of pure SHBG was about 70%, and its physicochemical and steroid-binding properties were similar to those reported for SHBG isolated from human serum using steroid-ligand affinity chromatography (22Hammond G.L. Robinson P.A. Sugino H. Ward D.N. Finne J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal G domain (residues 1–205) of human SHBG was produced inEscherichia coli and purified as described earlier (14Grishkovskaya I. Sklenar G. Avvakumov G.V. Dales D. Behlke J. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 2053-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Hildebrand C. Bocchinfuso W.P. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Wild-type human SHBG and a H136Q SHBG variant were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (9Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and serum-free medium from the cells was concentrated by ultrafiltration through PM-30 membranes (Amicon) with a simultaneous change in buffer to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% NaN3. A conventional steroid-binding assay using [3H]DHT as the labeled ligand (21Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) was modified to assess SHBG steroid-ligand interactions in the absence or presence of Zn2+ or other divalent cations. To avoid formation of insoluble phosphates, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2containing 0.1 mg/ml gelatin and 0.1% NaN3 was used as the assay buffer. Equilibrium-binding parameters of SHBG and its mutants were determined by Scatchard analysis (24Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar), and their binding affinities for testosterone or estradiol were assessed relative to DHT, as described previously (21Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The steroid-binding properties of SHBG and its mutants were studied after incubation (10 min at room temperature) with various concentrations of different metal (II) chlorides. These steroid-binding assays were performed in the presence of the same salt at a three times lower concentration. Three different heavy atom-binding sites can be identified in the 1.7-Å structure of zinc-soaked crystals of the amino-terminal G domain of SHBG (Fig.1). Site I is occupied by a calcium ion and is located on the rim of the β-sheet sandwich at the side opposite to the steroid-binding pocket. The Ca2+ is coordinated by seven oxygen atoms forming a pentagonal bipyramid. Two oxygen atoms are provided by the carboxylate group of Asp50, and the carbonyl groups of Glu52 and Ala160 provide two additional oxygen atoms. The remaining oxygen atoms are from three water molecules. This site is identical to the previously described Ca2+-binding site in SHBG (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Site II is in close proximity to the steroid ligand and is occupied by zinc (Fig. 2 A). Zinc is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms provided by the side chains of His83 and His136 and two oxygens from the carboxylate group of Asp65. The coordination shell of the zinc ion appears uneven and incomplete. This suggests that an additional atom, such as the oxygen atom of a solvent molecule, could attach to the zinc ion. Asp65 and His83 are located on two adjacent β-strands; Asp65 is at the beginning of strand β5 and His83 is at the end of strand β6. His136 is the first residue visible in the electron density following the break in the chain trace after residue 131. Residues 130 and 131 were not part of the previously published SHBG structure (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the zinc-soaked crystals, the phylogenetically conserved Leu131 (1Hammond G.L. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford1993: 1-25Google Scholar) is associated with high thermal displacement factors; it packs in between the side chains of Met107 and Met139 and points toward the hydrophobic portion of the steroid. In the original crystal structure of the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBG (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we observed a strong density at site II. Local disorder, and the existence of alternative conformations for the side chains of Asp65 and His83, hinted that this site was only partially occupied in the crystals, and this prohibited the unambiguous identification of the bound metal ion (Fig.2 B). In the zinc-soaked crystals, no disorder is apparent at this position. The height of the crystallographic anomalous signal, as well as the nature of the coordinating ligands, clearly identifies this site as being occupied by zinc. As expected, the refined thermal displacement factor of the site II Zn2+ ion (40.2 Å2) is comparable to those of the coordinating atoms (43.4 Å2 on average). Metal-binding site III is formed by the side chain of His101 from the intersheet crossing segment β7 to β8 and the carboxylate group of Asp117 from the loop segment connecting strand β9 to β10 (Fig. 1). In the previously published SHBG structure, a 2.7 Å salt bridge is formed between these residues. Upon zinc binding, and as visible in the anomalous density map, zinc intercalates between the two side chains and increases the distance between the functional groups to 3.7 Å. Two additional solvent molecules participate in the distorted tetrahedral coordination of the zinc ion. Of all three metal-binding sites, site III is closest to the proposed dimer interface (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of metal ions on the steroid-binding properties of SHBG, the purified protein was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with various metal chlorides (as listed in Table II) at a 1 mm concentration prior to performing a [3H]DHT-binding assay. None of the cations influenced DHT binding to SHBG, but zinc and two chemically related metals, cadmium and mercury, inhibited the ability of estradiol to compete with the labeled ligand for the SHBG steroid-binding site (Table II). An independent experiment, in which [3H]estradiol was used as a tracer, confirmed that 1 mm zinc greatly reduces the affinity of SHBG for this estrogen (data not shown). A more detailed analysis (Fig. 3) revealed that the inhibitory effect of zinc on estradiol binding to SHBG could be detected at 10 μm ZnCl2 and increases progressively with increasing ZnCl2 concentrations. Similar effects of cadmium and mercury appeared at higher concentrations (100 μm to 1 mm) and were less pronounced (Fig.3).Table IIInfluence of various divalent cations on the steroid-binding specificity of human SHBGIonB/B0%—21Mg2+18Ca2+19Co2+20Ni2+21Cu2+18Zn2+55Cd2+41Hg2+36The ability of estradiol to compete with [3H]DHT for the SHBG steroid-binding site was assessed in the absence (−) or presence of 1 mm metal (II) chlorides, and expressed as B/B0,i.e., a ratio of the amounts of [3H]DHT bound to SHBG in the presence (B) or absence (B0) of 1 μmestradiol. The results are the means of data obtained in two experiments; only Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+consistently inhibited the ability of estradiol to compete with [3H]DHT. Open table in a new tab The ability of estradiol to compete with [3H]DHT for the SHBG steroid-binding site was assessed in the absence (−) or presence of 1 mm metal (II) chlorides, and expressed as B/B0,i.e., a ratio of the amounts of [3H]DHT bound to SHBG in the presence (B) or absence (B0) of 1 μmestradiol. The results are the means of data obtained in two experiments; only Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+consistently inhibited the ability of estradiol to compete with [3H]DHT. Analysis of dose-response curves for DHT, testosterone, and estradiol competition of [3H]DHT binding to purified SHBG (Fig.4) further confirmed that the SHBG affinity for androgens was not influenced by zinc, whereas that for estradiol decreased ∼6-fold. Similar results were obtained for SHBG in diluted human pregnancy serum, and in this case 1 mmZnCl2 caused a 3.5-fold reduction in the SHBG affinity for estradiol. As described above, our crystallography data revealed two zinc-binding sites within the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBG. Although this domain seems to contain all the amino acids involved in steroid binding (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of zinc on estradiol binding to SHBG might be mediated by additional metal-coordinating sites in the C-terminal G domain of SHBG via long distance conformational rearrangements. However, we observed that the inhibitory effect of zinc on estrogen binding to the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBG is even more pronounced and can be detected at submicromolar concentrations (Fig.5). Moreover, very low concentrations of zinc (1–10 nm) produced a slight beneficial effect on both androgen and estrogen binding to this isolated domain (data not shown), presumably through stabilization of its structure. On the other hand, high concentrations of zinc (0.1–1 mm) may destabilize this truncated protein as evidenced by a slight decrease in DHT binding (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, competition data (TableIII) show unequivocally that increasing ZnCl2 concentrations from 10 nm to 500 μm alters the steroid-binding specificity of the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBG, i.e. its relative binding affinity for estradiol was approximately five times lower at the highest ZnCl2 concentration, whereas that for testosterone was increased 1.5-fold.Table IIIInfluence of zinc on the binding of androgens and estradiol to the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBGZnCl2IC50 for unlabeled competitorsDHTTestosteroneEstradiolμmnm0.01191102705019763805001773760Dose-response curves were generated for the competition of DHT, testosterone, and estradiol with [3H]DHT (∼ 2 nm) for binding to the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBG produced in E. coli.

Expression of wild type human SHBG and a H136Q human SHBG variant (9Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) allowed us to ascertain which of the two zinc-binding sites identified in the crystal structure has the ability to alter the steroid-binding specificity of human SHBG. The steroid-binding specificity of human SHBG produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells was affected by zinc in almost exactly the same way as SHBG in human serum, i.e. there was an ∼5-fold reduction in affinity for estradiol in the presence of 1 mmZnCl2, whereas the ability of estradiol to displace [3H]DHT from the H136Q SHBG variant (9Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was not influenced by zinc at all. Furthermore, sheep SHBG also contains a Gln instead of His at position 136 (1Hammond G.L. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford1993: 1-25Google Scholar), and analysis of purified sheep SHBG indicated that zinc has no effect on its steroid-binding specificity (data not shown). We have identified three binding sites for metal ions in the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBG. Site I binds calcium, whereas sites II and III bind zinc. The bound metal ion in each site can be identified unambiguously based on the geometry and nature of the coordinating atoms, as well as the height of the anomalous signal in the electron density map. Based on the present data, and a previous estimate that each SHBG subunit contains two potential calcium-binding sites (7Ross J.B.A. Contino P.B. Lulka M.F. Petra P.H. J. Protein Chem. 1985; 4: 299-304Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the carboxyl-terminal G domain of human SHBG probably also contains a calcium-binding site, which seems to be a recurring feature of laminin G-like domain structures (25Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that Ca2+ stabilizes the steroid-binding properties of purified SHBG (8Rosner W. Toppel S. Smith R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 351: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ and Zn2+ promote SHBG dimer formation (9Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Of all three metal sites, site III is closest to the proposed dimer interface formed by residues from strands β7 and β10 (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This site might therefore be responsible for the stabilization of dimer formation, but the changes observed in the presence or absence of zinc in the vicinity of site III are minor and are limited to a widening of the salt bridge between His101 and Asp117. Therefore, we conclude that the zinc effect on dimer formation is the result of an overall stabilization of the monomer, rather than allosteric rearrangements or an immediate involvement of zinc at the dimer interface. In a number of zinc-containing proteins, such as carboxypeptidase A, carboanhydrase, and alkaline phosphatase, Zn2+ can be substituted with Hg2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Co2+, but in most cases this abolishes enzyme activity (26Bertini I. Luchinat C. Bertini I. Gray H.B. Lippard S.J. Valentine J.S. Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, California1994: 37-106Google Scholar). In the case of SHBG, alterations in its affinity for specific steroids are only brought about by a limited group of chemically related metal ions. Moreover, whereas the steroid-binding specificity of SHBG is influenced within a biologically meaningful range of zinc concentrations, these other metals were only effective at levels that are toxic. In this context, although serum concentrations of zinc are only in the μm(10−5m) range, they reach mmconcentrations in some biological fluids, such as human seminal plasma (27Chia S.E. Ong C.N. Chua L.H. Ho L.M. Tay S.K. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 53-57PubMed Google Scholar), and are similarly elevated in human prostate tissues (28Habib F.K. Hammond G.L. Lee I.R. Dawson J.B. Mason M.K. Smith P.H. Stitch S.R. J. Endocrinol. 1976; 71: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The ability of zinc to alter the steroid-binding properties of SHBG was observed in diluted serum, as well as in highly purified SHBG. The zinc-binding site responsible for this must therefore have a high enough affinity to compete with various plasma zinc-binding proteins (29Harris W.R. Keen C. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our studies of an SHBG deletion mutant confirm that the zinc effect on SHBG steroid-binding specificity is mediated by metal-binding sites in its amino-terminal G domain. To identify which of the two zinc-binding sites in this domain is responsible for alterations in steroid-binding specificity, we used an SHBG variant in which the His at position 136 is substituted with Gln (9Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This substitution was chosen because it has a minor effect on the steroid-binding specificity of SHBG (9Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L.

Our data clearly indicate that this substitution eliminates the zinc-induced reduction in SHBG affinity for estradiol and lead us to conclude that zinc exerts its effect on the steroid-binding specificity of SHBG via metal-binding site II. We propose that this can be explained by the following mechanism. In the absence of zinc, Asp65 participates in steroid binding by making a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the hydroxy group at C17 of the steroid, and the side chain of Asp65 is further held in place by a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Thr60 (Fig. 6). Upon zinc binding, this network of hydrogen bonds becomes disrupted because the side chain of Asp65 now turns outwards and participates together with His83 and His136 in zinc binding. A slight displacement of the side chain of Thr60 also takes place, whereas the hydrogen bond between Asn82 and the hydroxyl-group at C17 of DHT remains remarkably unaffected. This is because an almost identical length is observed for this hydrogen bond, namely 2.93 and 2.89 Å, in both structures (Fig. 6). However, these changes in hydrogen bonding of the steroid only affect the affinity of SHBG for estradiol. This indicates that the relative importance of the hydrogen bonds between Asn82 and Asp65 and the hydroxy group at C17 of the steroid molecule differs markedly between C18 and C19 steroid hormones and might be because of small differences in steroid orientation in the binding pocket caused by the absence of the C19 methyl group and/or the aromatic nature of ring A in estradiol. Although this is a reasonable assumption, it needs to be confirmed by further crystallographic analysis of the SHBG steroid-binding site in association with estradiol. The geometry of the zinc-binding site II is very similar to the zinc-binding site in carboxypeptidase A (26Bertini I. Luchinat C. Bertini I. Gray H.B. Lippard S.J. Valentine J.S. Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, California1994: 37-106Google Scholar) except that glutamic acid is replaced by aspartic acid in the case of SHBG. This is intriguing because when the amino-terminal G domain of human SHBG is expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified, it undergoes proteolysis and release from its fusion partner upon storage (23Hildebrand C. Bocchinfuso W.P. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this phenomenon has biological relevance, but the first 12 residues of the purified amino-terminal G domain of SHBG used for crystallography are also lost during storage, 2G. V. Avvakumov and G. L. Hammond, unpublished data. and are presumably removed by proteolysis. Several different crystal structures of proteins containing G domains with a very similar fold have been published recently (10Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Rudenko G. Nguyen T. Chelliah Y. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J.

Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It is interesting that protein-protein interaction sites mapped onto the surface of individual G domains coincide with the steroid-binding region of SHBG. In addition, a Ca2+ ion is bound in laminin G5 at a position that is virtually identical to site II of SHBG, and it has been proposed that this is responsible for the calcium dependence of laminin binding to dystroglycan (31Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In light of what appears to be a conserved multifunctional interaction site in these G domains and the rather complex mechanism revealed here for the modulation of the steroid-binding specificity of SHBG by Zn2+, this region may also be involved in the interaction between SHBG and proteins on the surface of some cells (6Rosner W. Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Nakhla A.M. Romas N.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The histidine at position 136, which plays an important role in coordinating zinc in the metal-binding site II, is not conserved in SHBG molecules from a variety of other mammalian species (1Hammond G.L. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford1993: 1-25Google Scholar). In addition, it is located in a poorly conserved region that spans the disordered loop structure over the steroid-binding site in our human SHBG crystal structures. Sheep SHBG not only lacks a histidine in this region but has an N-glycosylation site that is utilized at a position corresponding to Ser133 in human SHBG (1Hammond G.L. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford1993: 1-25Google Scholar). However, when compared with SHBG from many other subprimate species, sheep SHBG has a relatively high affinity for estradiol, which is not influenced by the presence of zinc. In contrast, rabbit SHBG and rodent ABPs contain a histidine residue within this region, and it remains to be seen whether their steroid-binding properties are also influenced by the presence of zinc. Species-specific effects of zinc on endocrine functions are not without precedent. For example, the binding of human growth hormone to the prolactin receptor is increased remarkably in the presence of zinc (32Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). As shown by mutational and structural studies, the His18, which participates in zinc binding to human growth hormone is conserved only in primates (33Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kosslakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and this explains why growth hormone is not lactogenic in nonprimate species (32Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,33Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kosslakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Even if the zinc-dependent alteration in the steroid-binding specificity of human SHBG is not conserved in other mammalian species, it may serve some specialized function in human tissues where zinc concentrations are high and where SHBG is sequestered from the blood circulation, such as the prostate stroma (12Lahtonen R. Prostate. 1985; 6: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Cowan R.A. Cowan S.K. Giles C.A. Grant J.K. J. Endocrinol. 1976; 71: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this regard, benign prostatic hyperplasia in humans is associated with an excessive activity of sex steroids and/or an imbalance in their relative activities in the stromal compartment of the prostate (34Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Poukka H. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be defined how sex steroids are linked to the genesis of this disease but the levels of estradiol are abnormally high in hyperplastic human prostate stroma (35Krieg M. Nass R. Tunn S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and this may in some way be related to a local alteration in the binding affinity of SHBG for estradiol versus androgens.

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Receptor ligation triggers the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) including Lck, that induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple target proteins, thus enabling the formation of multi-protein complexes. These aggregates contain adaptor proteins such as LAT or SLP76 and signaling molecules including Vav and PLCγ (2Lanzavecchia A. Lezzi G. Viola A Cell. 1999; 96: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Activated PLCγ produces inositol triphosphate, which leads to the release of Ca2+ and the production of diacylglycerol, which mediates activation of PKC family members (3Cantrell D. Annu. Rev.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylation of Vav mediates both activation and down-modulation of Vav effector functions (8Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Activated Vav displays a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) activity for Rac (9Crespo P.

But there is also recent evidence for GEF-independent activation pathways of Vav, such as the Vav-mediated activation of nuclear factor AT (11Kuhne M.R. Ku G. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2185-2190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Gene disruption experiments revealed the importance of Vav for thymic selection, cytoskeletal reorganization, receptor-mediated proliferation, and the activation of NF-κB (12Costello P.S. Walters A.E. Mee P.J. Turner M. Reynolds L.F. Prisco A. Sarner N. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This transcription factor is trapped in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells by association with an inhibitory IκB protein (14Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). T cell costimulation leads to the activation of two homologous kinases, termed IKKα and IKKβ (15Khoshnan A. Kempiak S.J. Bennett B.L. Bae D. Xu W. Manning A.M. June C.H. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5444-5452PubMed Google Scholar). These kinases are contained in the IκB kinase complex (IKC) and phosphorylate IκB proteins, thus allowing ubiquitinylation and degradation of IκB proteins, resulting in the subsequent activation of NF-κB (16Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). IKKs are activated by IKK kinases (IKKKs) including MEKK1, NIK, and MLK3 and further signaling molecules, which remain to be identified (14Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). TCR/CD28-induced NF-κB activation involves the Cot kinase, which activates the IKKs via NIK (17Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as MLK3, a direct binding partner and activator of IKKα and IKKβ (18Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ushmorov A. Dienz O. Wing-Lan Leung I. Lassam N. Scheidereit C. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2556-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There is recent evidence that Vav and PKCθ functionally interact in the process of TCR-induced T cell activation (19Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixero E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and IL-4 transcription (20Hehner S.P. Li-Weber M. Giaisi M. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Schmitz M.L. J.

Equal amounts of protein were tested for DNA binding to the following oligonucleotide, which contains a single NF-κB-binding site. The sense sequence is underlined: 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Duo Lumat LB 9507, Berthold) that was programmed to inject 50 μl of assay buffer and to measure light emission for 10 s after injection according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega Inc.). A β-galactosidase reporter plasmid controlled by a constitutive Rous sarcoma virus promoter was cotransfected to ensure comparable transfection efficiencies. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellets were resuspended on ice for 15 min and for an additional 15 min at 37 °C in 250 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Cell debris was pelleted upon centrifugation, and extracts from antibody-stimulated cells were precleared with protein A/G-Sepharose. Equal amounts of protein contained in the supernatants were mixed with 1 to 2 μg of antibody and 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose and rotated for 4 h on a spinning wheel at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times in Triton X-100 lysis buffer and subsequently boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer prior to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and further analysis by Western blotting as described (20Hehner S.P.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes were purified from heparinized peripheral blood of healthy donors by density centrifugation on Ficoll gradients (Lymphoprep Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). T cells were isolated by negative selection using antibodies specific for CD19 and CD14 and magnetic beads coated with sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Stimulations with αCD3 and/or αCD28 antibodies were done essentially as published (27Portoles P. de Ojeda G. Criado G. Fernandez-Centeno E. Rojo J.M. Cell Immunol. 1999; 195: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and further analyzed as described above. Jurkat T leukemia cells expressing the large T antigen were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies), 2 mg/ml G418, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were electroporated using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) at 950 microfarad/250 V. Stimulations were performed by adding agonistic αCD3 (final concentration 10 μg/ml, clone OKT3) and/or αCD28 (final concentration 10 μg/ml, clone 9.3) antibodies. Immune complex kinases assays using the purified GST-IκB-α (1–54) substrate protein were performed as described (18Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ushmorov A. Dienz O. Wing-Lan Leung I. Lassam N. Scheidereit C. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2556-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A possible cooperation between Vav and PKCθ for the activation of NF-κB was tested by transfection of T cell leukemia Jurkat cells with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene together with increasing amounts of expression vectors for Vav and/or constitutively active PKCθ (PKCθ A/E) (Fig.1 A). Vav expression dose-dependently augmented NF-κB activity, but PKCθ A/E activated NF-κB even more potently. No activation of NF-κB was seen upon expression of PKCα, -ε, or -δ, revealing the importance of the PKC isoform θ for NF-κB activation in T cells (data not shown). However, coexpression of Vav and PKCθ A/E potently activated NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity in a synergistic manner (Fig. 1 A). To test whether this synergism is also apparent at the level of induced DNA binding, we transfected Jurkat cells with different combinations of expression vectors for Vav, PKCθ A/E, or the empty expression vector as a control. Cells were either left untreated or stimulated with αCD3/αCD28 antibodies, and NF-κB DNA binding was determined by EMSAs. Expression of either Vav or PKCθ A/E alone induced DNA-binding of NF-κB, but coexpression of both activators enhanced NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 1 B). Costimulation with αCD3/αCD28 antibodies further triggered DNA binding activity of NF-κB elicited by Vav, PKCθ A/E, or both (Fig.1 B). To test whether this synergistic activation of NF-κB is mediated by the activation of the IKKs or via an IKK-independent mechanism (28Bender K. Göttlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), we analyzed the impact of increasing amounts of coexpressed dominant negative (DN) forms of IKKα and IKKβ on Vav/PKCθ A/E-induced NF-κB activation in Jurkat cells. IKKβ K/A inhibited the Vav/PKCθ-submitted NF-κB activation more completely than kinase-inactive IKKα K/M (Fig.2 A). These results revealed that the Vav- and PKCθ-derived signals depend on IKKβ.Figure 2Vav/PKCθ synergistically activate IKKβ. A, the indicated combinations of expression vectors for Vav and/or PKCθ A/E (5 μg, respectively) were transfected either alone or with increasing amounts of vectors encoding the kinase-dead forms of IKKα or IKKβ and 5 μg of the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat cells. 1 day post-transfection, cells were harvested and tested for luciferase activity and the expression of IKKα and IKKβ. Results from luciferase assays are expressed as average -fold induction relative to unstimulated, vector-transfected cells. Bars indicate standard deviations; mean values of three independent experiments are shown. A fraction of the extract was analyzed by Western blotting for the occurrence of tagged IKKα and IKKβ (lower panel). B, HA-tagged IKKγ (1 μg) was expressed either alone or in combination with PKCθ A/E and/or Vav in Jurkat cells. 18 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared, IKKγ was immunoprecipitated, and kinase activity was determined by immunecomplex kinase assays (KA) using purified GST-IκB-α (1–54) as substrate. An autoradiogram from a reducing SDS gel shows phosphorylation of the recombinant substrate protein and a quantitative evaluation obtained by phosphorimaging (upper panel). A fraction of the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blotting as shown (lower panels). C, the experiment was performed as in B, with the exception that an expression vector for IKKβ was transfected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether Vav/PKCθ can lead to the activation of IKK kinase activity, Jurkat cells were transfected with various combinations of PKCθ A/E and Vav expression vectors together with a low amount of an HA-tagged IKKγ expression vector that allows its incorporation into functional high molecular weight IKCs. 2O. Dienz, unpublished observation. The tagged IKKγ protein was immunoprecipitated,and the activity of coprecipitating IKKs was examined by measuring the phosphorylation of the exogenously added substrate protein (GST-IκB-α (1–54)) by immunecomplex kinase assays (Fig. 2 B). These experiments revealed that the IKC was activated by Vav and even more by PKCθ A/E alone. However, the combined expression of both proteins strongly augmented the enzymatic activity of the IKC. The activation of IKKβ was investigated by employing a similar experimental approach with the exception that a tagged IKKβ protein was transfected instead of IKKγ (Fig. 2 C). IKKβ activity induced by the individual proteins was strongly enhanced upon coexpression of both activators, revealing that the observed transcriptional synergism is also apparent at the kinase level. In contrast, neither PKCθ nor Vav were able to significantly induce IKKα activity (data not shown). The activation signals for the IKC are not completely understood, and the relative contributions of the three IKKKs described so far are not clear. We therefore investigated the role of all three IKKKs for the activation signals derived from Vav, PKCθ, or both. Jurkat cells were transfected with an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene and various combinations of Vav and PKCθ A/E in the absence or presence of DN forms of NIK, MEKK1, and MLK3 (Fig.3 A). The Vav-derived signals were only partially inhibited by DN forms of each of the three IKKKs, raising the possibility that Vav activates the IKC by another, so far unknown pathway. In contrast, the PKCθ- and PKCθ/Vav-generated signals were absolutely dependent on NIK but only incompletely inhibited by DN forms of MEKK1 and MLK3. The upstream signaling events were further characterized by a similar experimental approach employing coexpression of DN forms of various signal transducing and adaptor proteins (Fig. 3 A). DN forms of Rac and MKK4 interfered with Vav-mediated NF-κB activation without affecting PKCθ- and Vav/PKCθ-induced activation pathways. DN forms of MKK7, Cot, Lck, and LAT preferentially inhibited PKCθ- and Vav/PKCθ-mediated signals. Surprisingly, coexpression of a SLP76 variant lacking the SH2 domain did not significantly affect Vav-mediated NF-κB activation, but further boosted Vav/PKCθ-induced NF-κB transcription. This behavior might be explained by the loss of an inhibitory interaction. We also tested the impact of pathway-specific inhibitory compounds on Vav- and/or PKCθ-induced NF-κB activation. Cyclosporin A (which blocks Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent signaling events) and herbimycin A (a PTK inhibitor), interfered preferentially with Vav-derived signaling steps but did not inhibit PKCθ- and Vav/PKCθ-mediated NF-κB activation (data not shown). In summary, these results suggest that any efficient inhibition of PKCθ is concomitant with the loss of Vav/PKCθ-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that PKCθ acts downstream from Vav. To address this question directly, Jurkat cells were transfected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene along with various combinations of active and inactive variants of Vav and PKCθ prior to stimulation with αCD3/αCD28 antibodies as indicated (Fig.3 B). NF-κB-driven gene expression was augmented by Vav expression and further triggered upon T cell costimulation. NF-κB-dependent transcription induced by Vav and/or CD3/CD28 was inhibited upon coexpression of kinase-dead PKCθ K/R (Fig. 3 B) or the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (data not shown). In contrast, expression of the Vav variant VavΔ1–249 inhibited CD3/CD28-triggered NF-κB activation but failed to impair PKCθ A/E-induced transcription (Fig. 3 B). Vav and PKCθ were found to be constitutively associated in T cells (20Hehner S.P. Li-Weber M. Giaisi M. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3829-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Kong Y.Y. Fischer K.D. Bachmann M.F. Mariathasan S. Kozieradzki I. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Bernstein A. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To map the Vav domain mediating this interaction, we expressed the FLAG-tagged Vav protein and various mutants thereof in Jurkat cells. After immunoprecipitation of the endogenous PKCθ protein, the associated Vav proteins were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 A). These experiments revealed that N-terminally deleted Vav variants were still able to coprecipitate with Vav, whereas VavΔ319–356 (lacking the Dbl homology domain) displayed an impaired Vav-PKCθ interaction. VavΔ501–845 showed only a faint residual coprecipitation with PKCθ, revealing the importance of the C-terminal portion for this protein-protein interaction. To address the question whether the mutual binding of both proteins is affected by T cell stimulation events, Jurkat cells were stimulated by αCD3 and αCD28 antibodies either alone or in combination. Coprecipitation experiments revealed that triggering of the T cell receptor alone did not affect constitutive PKCθ-Vav binding. In contrast, CD28 stimulation resulted in a transient dissociation of both proteins, starting from 3 to 5 min after stimulation. CD3/CD28 costimulation resulted in a loss of Vav-PKCθ interaction (Fig. 4 B). Remarkably, the kinetics of the dissociation process were faster, and the reassociation process was slower when compared with CD28 stimulation. Employing a similar experimental approach, constitutive binding between Vav and PKCθ and CD28- or CD3/CD28-induced dissociation of this complex was also observed in primary human T cells (Fig. 4 C). Here we identify the PKC isoform θ as a potent inducer of NF-κB. PKCθ synergized with Vav for the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor required for the expression of numerous immunologically relevant target genes (16Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Vav and PKCθ also cooperate for the induction of JNK, as well as transcription of the IL-2 (19Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixero E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and IL-4 genes (20Hehner S.P. Li-Weber M. Giaisi M. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3829-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), thereby mediating a strong enhancement of upstream signals. Such signal amplification events may be important in the early phase of infection, when only low concentrations of pathogens are present. The described interaction between Vav and PKCθ (20Hehner S.P.

(19Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixero E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), which may be because of differences in the lysis conditions or binding buffers. Here we show mutual binding and induced dissociation of both proteins in primary human T cells, thereby revealing the physiological importance of this regulatory protein-protein interaction. T cell costimulation leads to the dissociation of the Vav-PKCθ complex and the PTK-dependent phosphorylation and plasma membrane recruitment of Vav. Vav itself induces actin polymerization and TCR capping by a PKCθ-independent pathway, but these events are essential for the PKCθ translocation into the SMACs (19Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixero E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Along this line, there is recent evidence that Vav expression promotes PKCθ translocation from the cytosol to the membrane and cytoskeleton (19Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixero E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These results fit our finding that all inhibitors of PKCθ also abrogated the Vav/PKCθ-induced transcriptional synergism, suggesting that Vav is located upstream from PKCθ in the control of the pathway leading to synergistic NF-κB activation. The downstream targets of PKCθ are largely unknown, and it remains to be investigated whether PKCθ acts directly on IKKβ, as described for several atypical PKCs and PKCα (31Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, NF-κB activation by Vav and PKCθ might not only be mediated by the overlapping synergism pathway but also on separate routes. Cyclosporin A inhibited exclusively the Vav-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that only Vav, but not the transcriptional synergism, depends on Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent signaling steps. Similarly, DN forms of Rac and MKK4 impaired only Vav-dependent processes without affecting NF-κB activation induced by the synergistic Vav/PKCθ module. The CD28-dependent dissociation of Vav and PKCθ indicates that mutual binding of both proteins is not required for synergistic NF-κB activation. Along this line, VavΔ501–845 was unable to efficiently bind to PKCθ, but still synergized with PKCθ for NF-κB activation. The signal(s) triggering this dissociation is presently not identified. One possibility is a PKCθ-mediated phosphorylation of Vav, but we failed to detect this by in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation experiments (data not shown). Alternatively, the dissociation may be regulated by the 14–3-3-τ protein, which prevents the costimulation-induced translocation of PKCθ (32Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoy Berard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another candidate is Lck, a regulator of PKCθ function (33Liu Y. Witte S. Liu Y.C. Doyle M. Elly C. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3603-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Vav/PKCθ acted preferentially on IKKβ, which is in line with results from gene disruption experiments showing a predominant role of IKKβ for stimulus-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α (34Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen in future studies whether Vav/PKCθ targets the ”classical“ IKC consisting of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ proteins or differentially composed IKK complexes containing the recently discovered IKKε (35Peters R.T.

Insulin inhibits glucagon gene transcription, and insulin deficiency is associated with hyperglucagonemia that contributes to hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus. Transfecting glucagon-reporter fusion genes into a glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line, a 5′-, 3′-, and internal deletion analysis, and oligonucleotide cassette insertions failed in the present study to identify a single insulin-responsive element in the glucagon gene. They rather indicate that insulin responsiveness depends on the presence of both proximal promoter elements and more distal enhancer-like elements. When the paired domain transcription factor Pax6 binding sites within the proximal promoter element G1 and the enhancer-like element G3 were mutated into GAL4 binding sites, the expression of GAL4-Pax6 and GAL4-VP16 restored basal activity, whereas only GAL4-Pax6 restored also insulin responsiveness. Likewise, GAL4-CBP activity was inhibited by insulin within the glucagon promoter context. The results suggest that insulin responsiveness is conferred to the glucagon gene by the synergistic interaction of proximal promoter and more distal enhancer-like elements, with Pax6 and its potential coactivator the CREB-binding protein being critical components. These data thereby support concepts of insulin-responsive element-independent mechanisms of insulin action to inhibit gene transcription.

Insulin has been shown to stimulate or inhibit the transcription of a great number of genes (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Based on the hormone response element paradigm, there has long been speculation that the effects of insulin are mediated through a common insulin-responsive element (IRE)1 and binding transcription factor (2Alexander-Bridges M.

On the other hand, it has also been suggested that insulin may act independently of an IRE; insulin may rather target arrays of interacting transcription factors at the coactivator level (16Leahy P.

Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 672-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pancreatic islet hormone is a biologic antagonist of insulin and stimulates hepatic glucose production (21Lefèbvre P.J. Diabetes Care. 1995; 18: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 23Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In most species, the glucagon-secreting α-cells are located at the periphery of the islets of Langerhans and are exposed to high concentrations of insulin released from the more centrally located β-cells (21Lefèbvre P.J. Diabetes Care. 1995; 18: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 23Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of glucagon synthesis and secretion by intraislet insulin is thought to be important for the coordinated synthesis and secretion of the biologically antagonistic islet hormones (20Philippe J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 672-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lefèbvre P.J. Diabetes Care. 1995; 18: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J.

Consequently, insulin deficiency in diabetes mellitus is associated with hyperglucagonemia (20Philippe J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 672-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lefèbvre P.J.

The elevated glucagon levels in diabetes contribute to increased hepatic glucose output and hyperglycemia (20Philippe J. J. Clin.

However, the molecular mechanism of inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by insulin is poorly understood. It has been proposed that an enhancer-like element of the glucagon gene, the G3 element, functions as an IRE of the glucagon gene (27Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The present study expands those experiments by demonstrating that not only the G3 element but also other enhancer-like elements of the glucagon gene can confer insulin responsiveness to the nonresponsive truncated glucagon gene promoter in a glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line. The results of the present study suggest that insulin responsiveness is conferred to the glucagon gene by the synergistic interaction between proximal promoter and more distal enhancer-like elements. The paired domain transcription factor Pax6, which binds to the proximal promoter element G1 and the enhancer-like element G3, and its potential coactivator CBP appear as essential components of this synergistic interaction. The data thereby support suggestions of IRE-independent mechanisms of insulin action to inhibit gene transcription. Plasmids pT81Luc (28Nordeen S.K.

An expression vector encoding GAL4-Pax6 fusion protein was prepared as follows. The BamHI-KpnI fragment of the plasmid Pax-sc-35 (obtained from P. Gruss, Göttingen, Germany), containing full-length Pax6 cDNA, was cloned into the BamHI-KpnI sites of pSG424 (36Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar); the HindIII-EcoRV fragment of this plasmid, containing the GAL4-Pax6 fusion protein, was cloned into the HindIII-EcoRV sites of the cytomegalovirus-driven eukaryotic expression vector pBAT14 (obtained from M. German, San Francisco, CA). For preparation of an expression vector encoding the Pax6 paired domain (amino acids 1–248, pPax6-PD) the plasmid pBAT14 m.Pax6 (obtained from M. German,) was digested with BglII and HindIII, blunt-ended by Klenow fill-in reaction, and religated. All constructs were sequenced by enzymatic cycle sequencing to confirm the identity and the orientation of the inserts. The glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line InR1-G9 (37Takaki R. Ono J.

Cells were trypsinized and transfected in suspension by the DEAE-dextran method (29Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 2 μg of indicator plasmid/6-cm dish, unless noted otherwise. Rous sarcoma virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid (0.4 μg/6-cm dish) or cytomegalovirus-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (plasmid pCMV-GFPtpz, 0.5 μg/6-cm dish) were added as second reporters to check for transfection efficiency. When indicated, expression vectors were cotransfected. These cotransfections were carried out with a constant amount of DNA, which was maintained by adding Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics as described above. When indicated cells were treated with insulin (10 nm) for 23 h before harvest, or with forskolin (10 μm), KCl (45 mm), or both for 6 h before harvest. Cell extracts (29Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared 48 h after transfection. The luciferase assay and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay was performed as described previously (29Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thin layer chromatography plates were analyzed with a Fuji PhorphorImager. GFP was measured in the cell extracts using the FluoroCount™ microplate fluorometer (Packard). A stock solution of forskolin (100 mm) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and further diluted in cell culture medium. Insulin was from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany), and a stock solution (10 μm) was prepared in 0.9% saline containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Controls received the solvent only. Glucagon gene transcription is negatively regulated by insulin (20Philippe J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 672-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that 350 base pairs of the glucagon gene promoter are sufficient to confer insulin responsiveness (27Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This is confirmed in Fig. 1, demonstrating that a maximally effective concentration of insulin (10 nm) inhibited the transcriptional activity of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of 350 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene by about 50–60% after transfection into the glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line InR1-G9 (see also Fig. 2, A–C). The concentration of insulin that inhibited glucagon gene transcription by about 50% of the maximum effect was 0.5 nm (data not shown). Glucagon gene transcription is stimulated by cAMP- and membrane depolarization-induced signaling pathways (29Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol.

After stimulation by high potassium-induced membrane depolarization, by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, or both glucagon gene transcription was inhibited by insulin (10 nm) to a similar degree as under basal conditions (Fig. 1). Thus, the -fold stimulation by membrane depolarization and/or cAMP in the absence or presence of insulin was similar, suggesting that insulin does not interfere with the mechanisms that activate glucagon gene transcription in response to these stimuli.Figure 2Inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by insulin depends on the presence of an enhancer-like element of the glucagon gene.

The truncated glucagon gene promoter (136 base pairs) containing the proximal promoter elements G1 and G4 (44Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,45Cordier-Bussat M. Morel C. Philippe J. Mol. Cell.

Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An unconfirmed report proposed that the G3 element (from −268 to −238) is an IRE of the glucagon gene (27Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, it became clear meanwhile that the G3-binding transcription factor is Pax6 (46Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and that Pax6 also binds the G1 element (47Andersen F.G. Heller R.S. Petersen H.V. Jensen J. Madsen O.D. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 48Knepel W. Vallejo M. Chafitz J.A. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), raising new questions about the role of G3 and Pax6 in the glucagon gene response to insulin. We therefore reexamined which DNA sequences are required for the effect of insulin on glucagon gene transcription. Expression of 5′-deleted mutant plasmids in InR1-G9 cells revealed that the insulin responsiveness of the glucagon gene 5′-flanking region was reduced when the 5′ end was shortened from −350 to −292 (Fig.2 A). Insulin inhibited the transcriptional activity of −350GluLuc and −292GluLuc by 62% and 22% (p < 0.01, Student's t test), respectively (Fig. 2 A). However, progressive deletions to −238 and −200 largely restored the effect of insulin (inhibition by 46% of −200GluLuc) (Fig.2 A). Noteworthy, the construct −200GluLuc does not contain the G3 element, indicating that it is not essential for negative regulation of glucagon gene transcription by insulin. This result is in some contrast to data obtained in a previous study (27Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Truncation from −200 to −169 abolished insulin responsiveness (Fig.2 A). This deletion eliminates the G2 element (Fig.2 A). Further deletion to −60 had no effect (Fig.2 A). To further examine the role of the G2 element, this element was internally deleted (construct −350(−210/−136)GluLuc; Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2B, insulin inhibited glucagon gene transcription also after deletion of the G2 element, although somewhat less effectively than the wild type (inhibition by 43% and 66%, respectively). When compared with −350GluLuc (100 ± 3%), the basal activity of −350(−210/−136)GluLuc was 5 ± 1% (n = 9). These results indicate that also the G2 element is not essential for negative regulation of glucagon gene transcription by insulin. When taken together with the results of the 5′-deletion analysis, the data suggest that each of the glucagon gene enhancer-like elements (CRE, G3, G2) are dispensable for the effect of insulin; however, insulin responsiveness of the glucagon gene seems to depend on the presence of one or more glucagon gene enhancer-like elements. To examine this further, three or four copies of the glucagon gene enhancer-like elements CRE, G3A, or G2 were placed in front of the truncated glucagon promoter (−136GluLuc). −350GluLuc was included as a positive control. G3A contains the domain A of G3 (from −262 to −247), which provides the Pax6 binding site and confers strong basal transcriptional activity in islet cell lines (32Wrege A. Diedrich T. Hochhuth C. Knepel W. Gene Exp. 1995; 4: 205-216PubMed Google Scholar, 42Beimesche S. Neubauer A. Herzig S. Grzeskowiak R. Diedrich T. Cierny I. Scholz D. Alejel T. Knepel W. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The truncated glucagon promoter was not responsive to insulin (Fig.2 C), as expected from the 5′-deletion analysis (Fig.2 A). However, insulin inhibited by 30–40% the transcriptional activity of 3xCRE-136GluLuc, 4xG3A-136GluLuc, and 4xG2–136GluLuc (Fig. 2 C). When compared with −136GluLuc (100 ± 3%), basal activity of the constructs was 204 ± 15% (3xCRE-136GluLuc), 51,840 ± 4,244% (4xG3A-136GluLuc), and 1,075 ± 80% (4xG2–136GluLuc) (n = 9 each). Thus, consistent with a previous report (27Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), G3A can confer insulin responsiveness to the nonresponsive truncated glucagon promoter; however, these results show in addition that also the CRE and the G2 element can confer insulin responsiveness to the homologous promoter. In contrast, insulin had no effect on activity conferred to the truncated glucagon promoter by four copies of the Y box element of the murine Eα gene; transcriptional activity was 102 ± 6% in the presence of insulin (10 nm) relative to the untreated controls (n = 8 each). This demonstrates the specificity of the insulin-repressive effect conferred upon the truncated glucagon promoter by the three glucagon gene enhancers. When taken together, the results of the 5′-deletion, internal deletion, and oligonucleotide cassette insertion analysis suggest that insulin responsiveness of the glucagon gene is not conferred by a particular enhancer-like element but rather depends on the presence of at least one of the glucagon gene enhancer-like elements G2, G3, or CRE. To examine the role of proximal promoter elements, a 3′-deletion analysis was performed. Fragments of the glucagon promoter with deletions at their 3′ end were linked to the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (−81 to +52)"

Two structural variants of the hypermodified nucleoside 7-deazaguanosine have been identified in tRNA: queuosine, which is found at the wobble position of the anticodon in bacterial and eukaryotic tRNA, and archaeosine, which is found at position 15 of the D-loop in archaeal tRNA. From homology searching of the Methanococcus jannaschii genome, a gene coding for an enzyme in the biosynthesis of archaeosine (tgt) was identified and cloned. The tgt gene was overexpressed in anEscherichia coli expression system, and the recombinant tRNA-guanine transglycosylase enzyme was purified and characterized. The enzyme catalyzes a transglycosylation reaction in which guanine is eliminated from position 15 of the tRNA and an archaeosine precursor (preQ0) is inserted. The enzyme is able to utilize both guanine and the 7-deazaguanine base preQ0 as substrates, but not other 7-deazaguanine bases, and is able to modify tRNA from all three phylogenetic domains. The enzyme shows optimal activity at high temperature and acidic pH, consistent with the optimal growth conditions of M. jannaschii. The nature of the temperature dependence is consistent with a requirement for some degree of tRNA tertiary structure in order for recognition by the enzyme to occur. tRNA is structurally unique among nucleic acids in harboring an astonishing diversity of modified nucleosides.

Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 165-206Google Scholar). The nature of nucleoside modification in tRNA is considerably varied, from simple methylation of the base or ribose ring to extensive “hypermodification” of the canonical bases, the latter of which is characterized by radical structural changes and can involve multiple enzymatic steps to complete. There are currently over 80 modified nucleosides that have been identified in tRNA, many of which are highly conserved across broad phylogenetic boundaries. The specific contributions that individual modifications make to tRNA function are well established in only a few cases (2Bjork G.R. Kohli J. Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C.T. Chromatography and Modification of Nucleosides Part B: Biological Roles and Function of Modification. Elsevier, Amsterdam1990: 13-67Google Scholar), but it is generally thought that modifications located outside the anticodon region help to maintain the structural integrity of the tRNA, while modifications within and around the anticodon are proposed to play a direct role in increasing translational efficiency and/or fidelity, and in specific cases, to serve as recognition determinants for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (3Muramatsu T. Nishikawa K. Nemoto F. Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Yokoyama S. Nature. 1988; 336: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar,4Muramatsu T. Yokoyama S. Horie N. Matsuda A. Ueda T. Yamaizumi Z. Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9261-9267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the most remarkable modified nucleosides known to occur in tRNA are archaeosine (G*) (5Gregson J.M. Crain P.F. Edmonds C.G. Gupta R. Hashizume T. Phillipson D.W. McCloskey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10076-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and queuosine (Q) (6Kasai H. Ohashi Z. Harada F. Nishimura S. Oppenheimer N.J. Crain P.F. Liehr J.G. von Minden D.L. McCloskey J.A. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4198-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although both nucleosides share an unusual 7-deazaguanosine core structure, they are rigorously segregated with respect to phyla, location in the tRNA, and presumed function. Queuosine is ubiquitous throughout the bacteria and eukarya (7Katz J.R. Basile B. McCloskey J.A. Science. 1982; 216: 55-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), where it occurs specifically at the wobble position (8Kersten H. BioFactors. 1988; 1: 27-29PubMed Google Scholar) in a subset of tRNAs (those coding for Tyr, His, Asp, and Asn). Its location in the anticodon suggests a role in modulating translational fidelity and/or efficiency, and a wealth of physiological studies are consistent with such a role (9Kersten H. Kersten W. Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C.T. Chromatography and Modification of Nucleosides Part B: Biological Roles and Function of Modification. Elsevier, Amsterdam1990: 69-108Google Scholar, 10Marks T. Farkas W.R.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In marked contrast, archaeosine is present exclusively in the archaea, where it is found in the majority of known archaeal tRNAs specifically at position 15 of the dihydrouridine loop (13Sprinzl M. Hartmann T. Weber J. Blank J. Zeidler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17 (suppl.): 1-67Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar), a site not modified in any tRNA outside of the archaeal domain. Its position at a critical interface of the D-loop and T-stem in the tertiary structure of the tRNA is consistent with a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the tRNA. The biosynthesis of the 7-deazaguanosines is only partially understood (Fig. 2). GTP is apparently the primary precursor in the biosynthesis of queuosine (14Kuchino Y. Kasai H. Nihei K. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which in an unknown series of steps is converted to 7-(cyano)-7-deazaguanine (preQ0). PreQ0 is then reduced to PreQ1, and preQ1 is subsequently inserted into the tRNA by the enzyme TGT1in a transglycosylation reaction in which the genetically encoded base (guanine) is eliminated (15Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Okada N. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Ohgi T. Goto T. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The remainder of queuosine biosynthesis occurs at the level of the tRNA and involves the unusual utilization of S-adenosylmethionine in the construction of an epoxycyclopentane ring (17Slany R.K. Bosl M. Crain P.F. Kersten H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), followed by the B12-dependent reduction of the epoxide to give queuosine (18Frey B. McCloskey J.A. Kersten W. Kersten H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2078-2082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a 7-substituted 7-deazaguanine core structure in both queuosine and archaeosine, coupled with the similarity of preQ0 to archaeosine base suggests a parallel biosynthetic pathway in the archaea for archaeosine biosynthesis. In this proposal, the steps leading to preQ0 are presumably identical in both the archaea and bacteria (eukarya are incapable ofde novo biosynthesis of queuosine (8Kersten H. BioFactors. 1988; 1: 27-29PubMed Google Scholar)) and diverge at preQ0, with preQ0 (or a related metabolite such as the amide or archaeosine base) serving as the substrate for an archaeal TGT in the key base substitution reaction. This proposal was strengthened with the identification of an open reading frame (MJ0436) with high sequence homology to theEscherichia coli TGT in the genome of the archaeal hyperthermophile Methanococcus jannaschii (19Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F.

The TGT enzymes are a particularly intriguing family of enzymes for a number of reasons. First, they are the only enzymes involved in RNA modification that catalyze the replacement of a genetically encoded base with a highly modified base. Second, there is remarkable correlation of their modified base substrate with their segregation within the primary phylogenetic domains; bacterial TGTs utilize preQ1, eukaryotic enzymes utilize queuine (21Shindo-Okada N. Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the archaeal enzymes appear to utilize preQ0. Finally, their origin in the different domains is associated with disparate tRNA recognition elements. In bacterial TGT, a UGU sequence at positions 33–35 of an anticodon-like stem-loop is the only essential structural element required for enzyme recognition (22Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Hori H. Yamazaki N. Okada N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32221-32225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), while the eukaryotic TGT appears to require higher order structure in the tRNA (24Grosjean H. Edqvist J. Straby K.B. Giegé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The presence of archaeosine in a different region of the tRNA necessitates recognition elements that are unique to the archaeal enzyme. We report here the cloning and overexpression of the putativetgt gene from M. jannaschii, characterization of the recombinant enzyme, and demonstration of its function as a TGT. This is the first report of the cloning and overexpression of an archaeal TGT and should facilitate further investigation of this enzyme. The syntheses of preQ1, preQ0, archaeosine base, and 7-formamido-7-deazaguanine were carried out as described (25Akimoto H. Imaniya E. Hitaka T. Nomura H. Nishimura S. J. Chem. Soc.

Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie protein reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the method of Bradford (27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins was performed using 12% gels and visualization with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

DNA fragments generated from restriction digests were purified with the GeneClean® II kit (Bio 101) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid midipreparations (∼100 μg) were carried out with the Tip-100 kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Restriction digests and ligations were conducted with enzymes from New England Biolabs, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, U.S. Biochemical Corp., and Stratagene. Analyses of restriction digests were carried out in 0.8–1.4% agarose gels (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid minipreparations (∼15 μg), transformations, ligations, and other standard molecular biology techniques were carried out as described (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). M. jannaschiigenomic DNA was a gift from Professor Carl Woese of the University of Illinois. DNA oligomers for sequencing and tRNA gene construction were synthesized by Operon. DNA sequencing was carried out by the OHSU Core Facility in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology. PCRs were conducted with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermocycler. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting using a Beckman LS 6500 Liquid Scintillation Counter with CytoScint (ICN) scintillation mixture. UV-VIS spectroscopy was conducted with an HP 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. HPLC analysis was carried out with a Hitachi L-7100 multisolvent delivery system equipped with an L-4500A photodiode array detector and controlled via the Hitachi ConcertChrome HPLC software. Cells were disrupted with a Heat Systems-Ultronics W-375 sonicator. Gel electrophoresis was performed with a submarine unit for agarose electrophoresis, a Bio-Rad Mini PROTEAN II unit for protein analysis, and a 20 × 20-cm vertical unit for RNA purification. Protein chromatography was performed by HPLC with POROS resins (PerCeptive Biosystems). Reaction temperatures for enzyme assays were maintained with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermocycler. Activity assays were processed with a Brandel cell harvester. Cloning was performed in E. coli strains DH5α (F−, φ80dlacZΔM15, endA1, recA1,hsdR17 (r-K, m-K), supE44, thi-1, λ−, gyrA1, relA1; Bethesda Research Laboratory), JM101 (supE, thi, Δ(lac-proAB), F'[traD36,proAB+, lacIq,lacZΔM15]; Stratagene), and BL21(DE3) (hsdS, gal (λcIts857, ind 1,Sam7, nin5,lacUV5-T7gene1); Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) as required. Medium components were from Difco. A 314-base pair fragment of DNA directly upstream from MJ0436 was amplified fromM. jannaschii genomic DNA via PCR with Pfupolymerase using the primers MJ-US1 (5′-GCGGAGCTCTAAAAATTCGTTAGGAGG-3′) and MJ-US2 (5′-GCGGAATTCGTCTCCTAACTGAAAAGAAC-3′). Designed into the primers were the restriction enzyme sites SacI andEcoRI (underlined), respectively. The PCR program included an initial hold for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 2 min, 57 °C for 2 min, and 75 °C for 2.5 min. After amplification, the PCR product was gel-purified (2% agarose), subjected to restriction digest with SalI/EcoRI, and ligated into the SalI/EcoRI sites of pBluescript SK(+) to give the plasmid pJL-I-70. The M. jannaschii tgt gene was amplified fromM. jannaschii genomic DNA via PCR with Pfupolymerase using the primers MJ-START (5′-GCGGACTCGAG CATATG ACTTTTGAGATAAAAC-3′) and MJ-S3 (5′-CGCTGCGGATCCTCGTTGATATTCATAATTATC-3′). Designed into the MJ-START primer were the restriction enzyme sites XhoI (italics) and NdeI (underlined), the later as part of the translation initiation codon (boldface) for thetgt gene, while the MJ-S3 primer contained aBamHI site (underlined) downstream from the translation termination codon. The PCR program included an initial hold for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 7 min. After amplification, the PCR product was gel-purified (0.8% agarose), subjected to restriction digest withXhoI/BamHI, and ligated into theXhoI/BamHI sites of pBluescript SK(+) to give the plasmid pYB-I-56. The structure of the tgt gene was confirmed by sequencing and subcloned as anNdeI/BamHI fragment into theNdeI/BamHI sites of the E. coliexpression vectors pET-11a and pARC306N (29Street I.P. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7531-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to give pYB-I-120 and pYB-I-93, respectively. A single colony of E. coliBL21(DE3)/pYB-I-120 was used to inoculate 3 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 250 rpm for approximately 12 h, when a 1-ml aliquot was used to inoculate 100 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, and the cultures were allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C and 250 rpm. A 5-ml portion of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 500 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in 2.8-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 250 rpm until they reached an A 600 of 0.9, at which time IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were grown an additional 4 h, harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min), flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −90 °C. Frozen cell paste (4.0 g) was suspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmEDTA, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the solution was clarified by ultracentrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g). To the supernatant was added solid ammonium sulfate to 65% saturation over 45 min, and after stirring an additional 40 min, the solution was subjected to high speed centrifugation (30 min at 20,000 ×g). The protein pellet was dissolved in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 1 mm DTT and applied to a column of POROS HS, eluting with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 1.5 m. The TGT-containing fractions were pooled; dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT; and applied to a column of POROS HQ, eluting with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 1.5 m. The TGT-containing fractions were pooled; concentrated (Centriprep and Centricon); dialyzed against 50 mm potassium succinate (pH 5.5), 1 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium chloride; and heated at 80 °C for 15 min. The solution was subjected to high speed centrifugation (30 min at 20,000 × g), and the supernatant containing TGT was diluted with an equal volume of 30% glycerol and stored at −90 °C. A synthetic gene coding for H. volcanii tRNASercontaining a T 7 promoter site directly adjacent to the transcriptional start was constructed from six oligonucleotides with overlapping complementarity according to the method of Sampson and Uhlenbeck (30Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Forty picomoles of each oligomer (Table I) were separately phosphorylated with T 4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The phosphorylated oligomers were combined in equal stoichiometry and annealed by heating to 90 °C for 2 min followed by cooling to 25 °C over 2 h. The annealed oligomers were then ligated into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of pUC18 withT 4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer's instructions to give plasmid pDF-II-42. The reaction mixture was transformed directly into competent cells of E. coli DH5α, and positive transformants were identified by blue/white screening and by restriction digests of miniprep plasmid DNA. The structure of the gene was subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IOligonucleotides used for the construction of the tRNA Ser (CGA) gene from H. volcaniiOligonucleotideSequenceT7-ASenTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACTGCAGGT7-SenAATTCCTGCAGTAATACGACSer-S1TCACTATAGCCGAGGTAGCCTAGCCCGGCCAAGGCGGTAGATSer-S2TCGAAATCTACTGTCCATTCGGACACGTGAGTTCAATCTCACCCTCGGCGCCAGSer-AS1GATCCTGGCGCCGAGGGTGAGATTGAACTCACGTGTCCGAATGGACAGTASer-AS2GATTTCGAATCTACCGCCTTGGCCGGGCTAGGCTACCTCGGC Open table in a new tab Template DNA for in vitro transcription was prepared byBstNI digestion of pDF-II-42 according to the manufacturer's instructions, extraction of the reaction mixture with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol followed by chloroform, and precipitation of the DNA with ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol, the precipitated DNA was resuspended in Tris/EDTA (pH 8.0). Transcription reactions (1 ml) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmspermidine, 10 mm DTT, 4 mm NTPs, 50 μg of template DNA, anti-RNase (900 units), inorganic pyrophosphatase (2 units), and T7 RNA polymerase (5 μg). Reactions were run at 25 °C for 6–10 h, followed by the addition of RNase-free DNase (70 units) and incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol followed by chloroform, and the tRNA transcript was precipitated with ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol, the RNA was taken up in 3 mm citrate (pH 6.3) and purified on denaturing 15% PAGE gels. To recover the RNA, the gel was frozen at −90 °C, crushed, and soaked in 3 mm citrate (pH 6.3) for 24 h at 4 °C. The gel suspension was then centrifuged, the supernatant was filtered through a sterile 0.22-μm filter, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. The RNA was redissolved in 3 mmcitrate (pH 6.3), and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the calculated extinction coefficient. Standard activity assays were carried out in 0.2-ml microcentrifuge tubes in a final volume of 50 μl. The assay buffer contained 100 mmsuccinate (pH 5.5), 2 mm DTT, 50 mmKCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and varying concentrations of the RNA and [8-14C]guanine. Assays were preincubated for 2 min at 80 °C and initiated by the addition of enzyme. For investigation of the pH dependence of the enzyme, the assays contained 20 μm [8-14C]guanine, 1.0 μg/μl unfractionated yeast tRNA (type X), and 200 nm TGT. Assays were carried out at 37 °C at the specified pH, using the following buffers: acetate (pH 4.0–5.5), MES (pH 5.0–6.0), succinate (pH 5.5–6.0), PIPES (pH 6.0–7.0), MOPS (pH 7.0–7.5), HEPES (pH 7.5–8.0), and POPSO (pH 8.0–8.5). For the temperature dependence studies, assays were carried out at the specified temperature and contained 20 μm[8-14C]guanine, 200 nm TGT, and either 1.0 μg/μl unfractionated yeast tRNA (Type X) or 0.2 μg/μlE. coli tRNAVal. All assays were terminated after the specified time by the addition of 3 volumes (150 μl) of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the solution was transferred to glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C) mounted on a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, followed by 95% ethanol, and transferred to scintillation vials containing 3 ml of scintillation mixture. Activity assays were carried out by first incorporating [14C]guanine intoE. coli tRNAVal. A solution of 192 μm tRNAVal, 97 μm[8-14C]guanine, 100 mm succinate (pH 5.5), 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT was incubated with 5.3 μm TGT for 90 min at 80 °C. The reaction was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1) followed by chloroform, and after recovery of the aqueous phase the [14C]tRNA was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol and incubation at −20 °C overnight. The [14C]tRNA was pelleted by centrifugation (30 min at 20,000 × g) at 4 °C, washed with 70% ethanol (twice), and dissolved in 3 mm citrate (pH 6.3). The specific activity of the [14C]tRNA was determined by UV spectroscopy and liquid scintillation counting. The concentration of tRNAVal was estimated from the valine acceptor activity provided by the manufacturer (1600 pmol incorporated per A 260 unit). The [14C]tRNA was repeatedly subjected to ethanol precipitation until the specific activity remained unchanged. Activity assays contained the standard assay components with the concentration of the relevant base at 50 μm and the [14C]tRNA at 4.8 μm. Assays were initiated with the addition of 50 nm TGT, terminated after the specified time, and worked up as described above. Activity assays contained the standard assay components with [14C]guanine at 10 μm and unfractionated tRNA from yeast (type X and X-SA; Sigma) or E. coli (type XX; Sigma), E. colitRNAVal (Sigma), or in vitro transcribedH. volcanii tRNASer. The concentration of tRNA was kept at approximately 2 μm for the tRNAVal and tRNASer and at 0.4 μg/μl for the unfractionated tRNA. The molar concentrations of the in vitro transcribed tRNASer and E. colitRNAVal were determined as described above. Reaction assays were initiated with the addition of 50 nm TGT, terminated after the specified time, and worked up as described above. The complete genome of the archaeon M. jannaschiihas recently been reported (19Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L. Geoghagen N.S.M. Weidman J.F. Fuhrmann J.L. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar), and protein homology searching identified an open reading frame (MJ0436) that coded for a protein having significant amino acid homology to bacterial TGT. However, multiple sequence alignment of four bacterial TGTs with the protein product of MJ0436 revealed that a highly conserved N-terminal region present in the bacterial TGTs was absent in the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative archaeal TGT. Since this region includes an absolutely conserved aspartate implicated from the crystal structure of the Zymononas mobilis TGT as the catalytic nucleophile in the elimination of guanine (31Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2850-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15734-15739Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it appeared that the translational start had been misassigned. Inclusion of an additional 55 amino acids encoded by the DNA upstream ofMJ0436 in the alignment revealed the conserved region 20 amino acids upstream from the designated start. This has also been recently noted by Romier et al. (33Romier C. Meyer J.E. Suck D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in their sequence analysis of the active sites of TGTs. Since no in-frame start codons were present upstream of this homologous region, we reasoned that a sequencing error had occurred. To determine the location of the translational start, a region encompassing approximately 320 nucleotides upstream of the start ofMJ0436 was amplified from M. jannaschii genomic DNA via PCR and cloned into the SalI/EcoRI sites of pBluescript SK(+), giving the plasmid pJL-I-70. Sequencing of pJL-I-70 revealed that an adenosine 148 nucleotides upstream ofMJ0436 had been deleted in the original sequence data, producing a frameshift. When the adenosine was included in the sequence, five in-frame start codons and a stop codon were revealed upstream. When this region was included in the multiple alignment, additional regions of homology were apparent, with the penultimate Met codon aligning well with the start of the bacterial enzymes (Fig.3). Having established the putative translational start, the tgtgene was amplified from M. jannaschii genomic DNA via PCR and cloned into the XhoI/BamHI sites of pBluescript II SK(+). After the structure of the tgt gene was confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 4), it was subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of theE. coli expression vector pET11a to give pYB-I-120. The TGT expression vector pYB-I-120 was transformed into competent cells of BL21(DE3) for overexpression of the tgt gene. Positive transformants of BL21(DE3)/pYB-I-120 were screened for TGT production and activity after induction with IPTG, and the most active transformants were selected for synthesis of TGT. Induction by IPTG was accompanied by the appearance of a new protein band at a molecular mass of approximately 75 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.5), in good agreement with the calculated mass of 78 kDa obtained from the amino acid sequence. Maximal production of TGT was observed approximately 4 h after induction with 1 mm IPTG as estimated from activity assays and SDS-PAGE, the latter of which indicated that TGT comprised approximately 10% of soluble protein. The origin of the TGT enzyme from a thermophilic organism prompted us to initially examine heat treatment of the cell-free extract as a preliminary step in the purification. However, significant enzyme activity was lost after incubation for 15 min at either 60 or 80 °C, so we abandoned this approach. Our initial screening of chromatography conditions revealed that TGT eluted in two discreet peaks, one of which contained substantial nucleic acid. When the cell-free extract was subjected to treatment with str"

Their intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis is very low but is enhanced by specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that switch G proteins to their inactive form. We have characterized the activity of recombinant Rab3-GAP on Rab3A in solution. The K m and K d values (75 μm) indicate a low affinity of Rab3-GAP for its substrate. The affinity is higher for the transition state analog Rab3A:GDP:AlFx (15 μm). Thek cat (1 s−1) is within the range of values reported for other GAPs. A mutation in the switch I region of Rab3A disrupted the interaction with Rab3-GAP. Furthermore, Rabphilin, a putative target of Rab3, inhibited the activity of Rab3-GAP on Rab3. Therefore, the Rab3-GAP-binding site involves the switch I region of Rab3 and overlaps with the Rabphilin-binding domain. Substitution of a single arginine residue (Arg-728) of Rab3-GAP disrupted its catalytic activity but not its interaction with Rab3A. We propose that Rab3-GAP, like Ras- and Rho-GAPs, stabilizes the transition state of Rab3 and provides a critical arginine residue to accelerate the GTPase reaction.

GTPase-activating protein guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase calmodulin Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rab family play a pivotal role in controlling membrane trafficking along the endo- and exocytic pathways (1Schimmoller F. Simon I. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22161-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 2Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In their GDP-bound state, Rab proteins are bound to Rab-GDP dissociation inhibitor, which make them soluble in the cytosol. The activation process involves a poorly understood translocation step toward a specific membrane compartment correlated with the exchange of GTP for GDP. This reaction is catalyzed by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GTP-bound Rab proteins then interact with various effectors, the list of which is rapidly growing. The functional cycle ends by GTP hydrolysis mediated by specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 followed by membrane extraction by Rab-GDP dissociation inhibitor. The proportion of Rab in the GTP-bound state, and thus able to interact with target proteins, depends on the respective activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GAPs. It is therefore important to characterize the properties of these regulators of Rab cycle. Rab3 has been implicated in the exocytosis of hormones and neurotransmitters (3Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Annu.

Increasing the amount of GTP-bound Rab3A results in a reduction of the magnitude of the secretory responses (5Holz R.W. Brondyk W.H. Senter R.A. Kuizon L. Macara I.G. J. Biol.

Controlling the amount of Rab3:GTP or the kinetics of the GTPase reaction might therefore be of prime importance in the physiological regulation of the exocytosis process. In yeast, several GAPs for Ypt/Rab proteins have been identified (9Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Du L.L.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). GAPCenA displays some homology with yeast Rab-GAPs, but the sequence of Rab3-GAP seems to be totally different and is not related to any other known protein. Previous studies have shown that the catalytic domain of Rab3-GAP is localized in the last 400 (out of 981) amino acids and that Rab3-GAP is firmly bound to another subunit of 150 kDa, which is not required for the catalytic activity of Rab3-GAP in vitro (15Nagano F.

In this study, we have further characterized the biochemical properties of recombinant full-length Rab3-GAP. We show that the binding affinity of Rab3-GAP for its substrate in solution is low and that the mechanism of action of Rab3-GAP involves a critical arginine residue and an interaction with the switch regions of Rab3. Nucleotides were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and other chemicals from Sigma. Calmodulin was from Calbiochem. The cDNA encoding KIAA0066 (Rab3-GAP), kindly provided by Dr. T. Nagase, was subcloned in frame into pRSETB (Invitrogen) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A two-step PCR strategy was followed to mutate different arginine residues of Rab3-GAP. The corresponding sequences were cloned in pRSETB. pET-3A-Rab3A and pGEX-2T-Rab3A-(1–217) have been described previously (16Zahraoui A. Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. J. Biol.

To express His6-tagged Rab3A-(1–185), a stop codon was introduced by PCR into the sequence of hu-Rab3A, followed by in-frame subcloning into pET-15B (Novagen). The sequences generated by PCR were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Rab3-GAP was found to be highly toxic in Escherichia coli BL21 or DH5α. For expression, freshly transformed C41 cells (a strain kindly provided by B. Miroux and J. Walker, which derived from BL21 DE3 (18Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol.

Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added at A 600 ∼0.7, and the culture was grown overnight at 25 °C.

After thawing, the cells were incubated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C and briefly sonicated. Cell extracts were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Ammonium sulfate (10%, w/v) was added to the supernatant, which was stirred on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate (40%, final concentration) was added to the supernatant, which was stirred on ice for 1 h and spun at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin (all at 5 μg/ml), 0.5 mm Pefabloc. His6-Rab3-GAP was then purified by affinity chromatography on cobalt-agarose (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was estimated to be >80% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Coomassie Blue staining, and densitometry scanning using NIH image (Fig. 7). When required, the protein was concentrated in Biomax 10 centrifugal filters (Millipore). After rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen, the protein was stored at −80 °C without apparent loss of activity.Figure 7Effect of arginine substitutions on the enzymatic activity of Rab3-GAP.

Rab3A-(1–220) was expressed in BL21 DE3 cells and purified as described previously (16Zahraoui A. Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12394-12401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab3A-(1–217) and Rabphilin-(1–206) were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under standard conditions. Purified Rab3 proteins were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GDP. When required the proteins were concentrated in Biomax 10 centrifugal filters (Millipore). The concentration of Rab3 proteins was determined by [3H]GTP (7.7 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) binding. The concentrations of other proteins were determined either by a Bradford assay (Pierce) or by the BCA assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Rab3A was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15% bovine serum albumin, 0.033 μm [γ-32P]GTP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and cold GTP (10-fold molar excess over Rab3). Nucleotides in excess were removed by passage through ProbeQuant G25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 5 mmMgCl2 were immediately added to the eluate, which was stored at 4 °C. [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rab3A (typically 10 pmol) was then incubated with Rab3-GAP for various periods of time (typically 6 min) at 25 °C. At the end of the incubation, the mixture was diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2), applied to a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm, Millipore). The filters were rinsed with 3 × 2.5 ml ice-cold washing buffer, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by scintillation counting. To obtain K m and k cat values, data were analyzed by nonlinear regression with the program “Kaleidagraph” (Synergy Software) using the Michaelis-Menten equation. For the competition experiments, the model equation used wasB = B max S/(S + K d), where Bis the bound ligand, B max the number of binding sites, S the concentration of ligand, andK d the dissociation constant. Rab3A was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP, freed of excess nucleotides by passage through ProbeQuant G25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with Rab3-GAP (0–200 μm) in 7 μl of 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. 20 pmol of GST-Rabphilin () immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (in 5 μl) were added, and the mixture was kept on ice for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) and filtered through glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C). Rab3A was poorly retained on these filters in the absence of GST-Rabphilin and glutathione-Sepharose. The filters were washed with 3 × 2.5 ml and processed for scintillation counting. Calcium-buffered solutions were prepared according to Ref. 19Fohr K.J. Warchol W. Gratzl M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. His6-tagged full-length Rab3-GAP (981 amino acids in length) was found to be highly toxic in E. coli. However, it was readily expressed in a soluble form in the mutant strain C41 (18Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The protein was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography onto cobalt-agarose. Recombinant His6-tagged Rab3-GAP was able to accelerate the hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP bound to Rab3A, as measured in a filter binding assay (Fig. 1). Preliminary experiments did not reveal major differences between prenylated or nonprenylated Rab3A. Therefore, nonisoprenylated Rab3A proteins expressed in E. coli were used in this study. Rab3-GAP was found to be active either on full-length Rab3A-(1–220) or on COOH-terminally truncated Rab3A proteins (Fig. 1). Most of the experiments were performed with His6-tagged Rab3A-(1–185). To determine K m, 50 nm Rab3-GAP was incubated with 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rab3A and increasing concentrations of GTP-loaded Rab3A, for 0–10 min at 25 °C. The initial rate of GTP hydrolysis was determined and plotted as a function of Rab3A:GTP. As illustrated in Fig.2, high amounts of Rab3:GTP were required to saturate the activity of Rab3-GAP on [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rab3A. Values forK m (75 ± 10 μm; mean ± S.D.) and k cat (1 ± 0.3 s−1; mean ± S.D.) of Rab3-GAP were derived from four independent experiments. Since the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Rab3A is ∼3 × 10−4s−1 (data not shown), one can conclude that Rab3-GAP increases GTP hydrolysis rate by a factor of ∼3000. This is significantly less than the acceleration factor determined for Gyps, the GAPs for yeast Ypt/Rab proteins (20Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and Ras-GAPs. However, thek cat values are within the range of values reported for the different GAPs (1–19 s−1(20Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar)). The lower acceleration factor observed for Rab3-GAP may be partly due to the high intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Rab3A. Next, we determined the binding affinity of Rab3 to Rab3-GAP. Increasing amounts of Rab3A loaded with the nonhydrolyzable analog GTPγS were added into a standard GAP reaction (Fig.3 A). Here, the IC50 value was taken as a measure of theK d. A value of 75 ± 28 μm(mean ± S.D.) was derived from six independent experiments. This value is similar to that of K m. Accordingly, Rab3A:GTP and Rab3A:GTPγS behave similarly in competition experiments (Fig. 3 A). Rab3A Q81L was also used to determine the affinity of Rab3A for Rab3-GAP. Glutamine 81 in Rab3A corresponds to glutamine 61 in Ras that plays a critical role in the nucleophilic attack of the γ-phosphate of GTP. Accordingly, this mutated protein has no intrinsic GTPase activity. Even in the presence of large amounts (up to 300 nm) of Rab3-GAP, no GTP hydrolysis could be detected (Fig. 4 B). GTP-loaded Rab3A Q81L competes with wild type Rab3A in a GAP assay (Fig.3 B) with an IC50 value of 5.4 ± 0.4 μm (mean ± S.D., n = 3). The fact that Rab3A Q81L:GTP is a 10-fold more potent inhibitor of Rab3-GAP than GTPγS-loaded Rab3A suggests a difference in their conformational state. Such a difference has been observed previously in the case of Ras. Mutations of Gln-61, and especially Q61L, increase the affinity between p21-Ras:GTP and GAP (21Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It was also reported that p120-GAP has a higher affinity for Ras:GDP:AlF3 than for the triphosphate state (ground state) of Ras (22Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies led to the conclusion that the ternary complex formed by Ras:GDP, Ras-GAP, and AlF3 is a transition state analog (23Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 24Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of Rab3:GDP to interact with Rab3-GAP in the presence of aluminum fluoride. As shown in Fig.3 B, Rab3A:GDP:AlFx is a potent inhibitor of the activity of Rab3-GAP on Rab3A:GTP. The IC50 value determined in these experiments was 15 ± 9 μm(mean ± S.D., n = 3). It seems likely that this value, which is very similar to that determined with Rab3A Q81L, is a measure of the affinity of Rab3A, in the transition state, for Rab3-GAP. GTP hydrolysis is responsible for the disruption of the interaction of G proteins with their effectors. We investigated whether Rab3-GAP was able to act on Rab3A complexed with an effector molecule. Rabphilin is one of the putative effectors of Rab3A (4Darchen F. Goud B. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, the Rab3-binding domain of Rabphilin inhibited Rab3-GAP activity. This indicates that Rab3-GAP- and Rabphilin-binding domains overlap. Rab3A interacts with Rabphilin via its switch I region, which encompasses the so-called effector domain, and via other regions, termed Rab-complementary determining regions, which contact a conserved SGAWFF motif in Rabphilin (25Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In agreement with the ability of Rabphilin to compete with Rab3-GAP, the mutation V55E in the switch I region of Rab3A was found to disrupt the interaction with Rab3-GAP (Fig. 4,B and C). Another putative effector of Rab3 is calmodulin. In the presence of calcium ions, calmodulin (CaM) solubilizes isoprenylated membrane-bound Rab3 (26Park J.B. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of Ca2+/CaM to Rab3 correlates with the effect of Rab3A on the secretory activity of endocrine cells (27Coppola T. Perret-Menoud V. Lüthi S. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. Regazzi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The addition of Ca2+/CaM in the filter assay did not change the activity of Rab3-GAP (Fig.5 A). K m is not affected by the presence of Ca2+/CaM (not shown). Furthermore, Ca2+/CaM did not interfere with the binding of Rab3-GAP to Rab3A, as demonstrated by the fact that the inhibitory effect of GTP-loaded Rab3A Q81L on the activity of Rab3-GAP was not significantly modified by the presence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig.5 B). In the absence of CaM, we did not observe any effect of Ca2+ ions neither on the activity of Rab3-GAP nor on its interaction with Rab3 (Fig. 5 B). The mechanism of GAP action on several GTPases, including Ras and Rho, has been elucidated recently. One important feature of this mechanism is the existence of a critical arginine residue, which is positioned in the active site, binds to the γ-phosphate group and neutralizes the developing charge during the reaction (24Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In Gα subunits, an arginine residue provided by the GTPase itself plays a similar role. It seemed, therefore, possible that Rab-GAPs also use an “arginine finger” to accelerate the GTPase reaction. To identify putative catalytic arginine residues in Rab3-GAP, sequence homology searching was performed. As reported previously (14Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), no significant homology was found with any known protein, including the GAPs for other Rab proteins. However, several uncharacterized sequences were found in sequence data banks with similarity to human Rab3-GAP (Fig. 6). Within this group of sequences, several arginine residues appeared to be conserved. Arginines 619, 700, 728, and 753 belonging to the catalytic domain of Rab3-GAP defined by Fukui et al. (14Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were mutated in alanine. The corresponding proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and tested in the filter assay. Rab3-GAP R619A, R700A, and R753A had a normal activity, but Rab3-GAP R728A was found to be inactive on Rab3A (Fig.7). To ascertain that the reduced activity of Rab3-GAP R728A was not due to improper folding, its interaction with Rab3A was assayed. First, Rab3-GAP R728A was found to compete with wild type Rab3-GAP (Fig.8 A). Second, Rab3-GAP R728A was able to inhibit the binding of GTP-loaded Rab3A to GST-Rabphilin (Fig. 8 B). In these experiments (Fig. 8, A andB), IC50 values were in good agreement with the affinity of Rab3A for Rab3-GAP. At high concentrations, Rab3-GAP R728A had very low but detectable GAP activity (Fig. 8 B). However, this activity was too weak to account for the diminished signal in the Rab3A/Rabphilin binding assay (i.e. the [γ-32P]GTP bound to Rab3A and retained on the filters). The binding of Rab3-GAP to Rab3A Q81L was also assayed. In sharp contrast to wild type Rab3-GAP, the mutated protein did not interact with the GTPase-deficient Rab3A mutant (Fig.8 C). Ras-GAPs and Rho-GAPs act by ordering the switch regions of the GTP-binding protein such that the catalytic glutamine residue is positioned properly and by supplying an arginine residue to the active site (23Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 28Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). ARF-GAP only stabilizes switch II, but coatomer (an effector of ARF) might provide catalytic residues, since it contributes a further ∼1000-fold acceleration of the reaction rate (29Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Gα subunits possess an arginine finger very similar to that of Ras-GAP, which is responsible for the higher intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis, compared with small GTP-binding proteins (30Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 31Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). RGS proteins are GAPs for Gα GTPases, which act by “stabilizing” the switch regions (32Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 33Srinivasa S.P. Watson N. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism responsible for the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis seems to be universal, although the work is shared out differently in each family of GTPases. Our results suggest that Rab3-GAP is functionally related to Ras-GAPs and Rho-GAPs. First, the overlap between Rab3-GAP and Rabphilin-binding sites on Rab3A and the insensitivity of Rab3A V55E to Rab3-GAP argue for an interaction between GAP and the Rab3A switch regions. The higher affinity of Rab3-GAP for the transition state, as mimicked by Rab3:GDP:AlFx, than for the ground state (represented by Rab3:GTPγS) further suggests that Rab3-GAP stabilizes the transition state conformation of the switch regions. Second, the lack of catalytic activity of Rab3-GAP R728A is consistent with Rab3-GAP introducing an arginine finger into the catalytic site. Since Rab3-GAP R728A interacts normally with wild type Rab3A, its loss of function cannot be accounted for by disruption of binding to the substrate. Interestingly, it was found that the mutation R728A disrupted the interaction of Rab3-GAP with the GTPase-deficient Rab3A Q81L protein. This observation might indicate that Arg-728 is positioned, within the Rab3-Rab3-GAP complex, in the vicinity of Gln-81 and, therefore, near the catalytic site. During completion of this work, Albertet al. (20Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) reported the identification of arginine residues essential for the activity of Gyp1 and Gyp7, two yeast Ypt/Rab-GAPs. Arg-458 in Gyp7 contributes a factor of ∼1000 to the total 2 × 105-fold stimulation of the GTPase reaction. Another arginine residue, Arg-615, accelerates the GTPase reaction by ∼30-fold. Arg-615 might be analogous to Arg-903 in p120Ras-GAP or Lys-122 in p50Rho-GAP, which play a role in stabilizing the finger loop. Altogether, these observations suggest that Rab-GAPs also use an arginine finger mechanism to accelerate the reaction. However, the crystal structure of GppNHp-bound Rab3A (35Dumas J.J. Zhu Z. Connolly J.L. Lambright D.G. Structure ( Lond. ). 1999; 7: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) revealed that the γ-phosphate is buried in Rab3A, in contrast to Ras. The side chains of Phe-51 and Ser-31 seem to be detrimental to the insertion of an arginine residue into the catalytic site. Future structural studies of the Rab3-Rab3-GAP complex will have to determine whether Rab3-GAP can open the conformation of the catalytic site to introduce a catalytic residue or whether it accelerates GTP hydrolysis by reorienting intrinsic residues (Ser-31, Ser-53, and Gln-81) in a manner similar to the RGS proteins. Rab3-GAP and Rabphilin binding to Rab3A are mutually exclusive. This finding, which confirms previous observations made with a brain extract enriched in Rab3-GAP activity (36Kishida S. Shirataki H. Sasaki T. Kato M. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22259-22261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raises the question of the mechanisms that control the duration of the GTP signal. Due to the overlap between the binding domain of Rab3-GAP and of the effector, Rab3-GAP would be able to modulate the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis and the duration of the GTP signal only if the lifetime of the Rab3-effector complex were short. In the case of Ras, the lifetime of Ras-Raf1 complex was shown to be short (37Sydor J.R. Engelhard M. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Herrmann C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14292-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hence, Ras-GAP may control the duration of the “on” state and thus the number of Raf1 molecules activated by Ras. In the case of ARF, the scenario differs. ARF:GTP forms a stoichiometric and probably stable complex with coatomer. However, ARF-GAP can interact with this complex and thus controls its duration (29Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The competition between Rabphilin and Rab3-GAP for binding to Rab3 suggests a “Ras-like” catalytic mechanism, but further kinetic studies are required to establish this point. Although Rab3-GAP accelerates the rate of GTP hydrolysis by several orders of magnitude, it has a very low affinity (∼100 μm) for its substrate. The affinities of Gyp1 and Gyp7 for their substrates (K m = 125–400 μm) are also very low (20Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); this is also the case of other GAPs for small G proteins. However, G proteins are associated with membranes, and the reaction thus takes place on the membrane and not in solution. Ras-GAP is located predominantly in the cytosol but translocates to the cell periphery upon tyrosine phosphorylation (38Molloy D.P. Owen D. Grand R.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 39Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Wong G. McCormick F. Williams L.T.

Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The PH domain of GAP1m binds to phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate and mediates the recruitment of the protein to the plasma membrane upon epidermal growth factor-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (41Lockyer P.J. Wennstrom S. Kupzig S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol enhances the activity of ARF-GAP, most likely by promoting the recruitment of the enzyme on the membrane, where the local concentration of the substrate is high (42Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, different mechanisms are used to drive the translocation of GAPs toward membrane compartments. Oishi et al. (43Oishi H. Sasaki T. Nagano F. Ikeda W. Ohya T. Wada M. Ide N. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that Rab3-GAP was enriched in the synaptic soluble fraction. Although the vast majority of Rab3-GAP was found in the cytosol, some immunoreactivity was found in the membrane fractions. Furthermore, the immunostaining of Rab3-GAP in primary cultured hippocampal neurons was not diffuse but enriched at synaptic contacts. It is noteworthy that Burstein et al. (34Burstein E.S. Linko-Stentz K. Lu Z.J. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2689-2692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that a Rab3-GAP activity from rat brain was equally distributed between cytosolic and membrane fractions. Recruitment of Rab3-GAP on membranes could thus account for the targeting of Rab3-GAP to nerve terminals and, most importantly, could facilitate the interaction with its substrates by increasing its local concentration. An attractive possibility is that the subcellular localization of Rab3-GAP is dependent on the noncatalytic p150 subunit. In agreement with Oishi et al. (43Oishi H. Sasaki T. Nagano F. Ikeda W. Ohya T. Wada M. Ide N. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we also observed that overexpression of wild type Rab3-GAP in PC12 cells had no detectable effect on the secretory activity (not shown). Thus, the amount of cellular Rab3-GAP is not limiting. Other factors probably control the activity of Rab3-GAP. Under the conditions used in this study (i.e. in the absence of phospholipids and of isoprenylation of Rab3A), neither calcium ions nor calmodulin had any detectable effect on the activity of Rab3-GAP. Since a number of studies have highlighted the role of GTP hydrolysis by Rab3 in the secretory process, it will be of prime importance to characterize the parameters (like membrane recruitment) that control the activity of Rab3-GAP.

https://openalex.org/W1977227378,"Heat shock and other forms of stress increase glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity in cells, suggesting cross-talk between the heat shock and GR signal pathways. An unresolved question concerning this cross-talk is whether heat shock factor (HSF1) activity is required for this response. We addressed this issue by modulating HSF1 activity with compounds acting by distinct mechanisms: sodium vanadate (SV), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases; and wortmannin, an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase. Using HSF1- and GR-responsive CAT reporters, we demonstrate that SV inhibits both HSF1 activity and the stress potentiation of GR, while having no effect on the hormone-free GR or HSF1. Paradoxically, SV increased hormone-induced GR activity in the absence of stress. In contrast, wortmannin increased HSF1 activity in stressed cells and had no effect on HSF1 in the absence of stress. Using the pMMTV-CAT reporter containing the negative regulatory element 1 site for DNA-dependent protein kinase, wortmannin was found to increase the GR response. However, in cells expressing a minimal promoter lacking negative regulatory element 1 sites, wortmannin had no effect on the GR in the absence of stress but increased the stress potentiation of GR. Our results show that the mechanism by which GR activity is increased in stressed cells requires intrinsic HSF1 activity.

Paradoxically, SV increased hormone-induced GR activity in the absence of stress. In contrast, wortmannin increased HSF1 activity in stressed cells and had no effect on HSF1 in the absence of stress. Using the pMMTV-CAT reporter containing the negative regulatory element 1 site for DNA-dependent protein kinase, wortmannin was found to increase the GR response. However, in cells expressing a minimal promoter lacking negative regulatory element 1 sites, wortmannin had no effect on the GR in the absence of stress but increased the stress potentiation of GR. Our results show that the mechanism by which GR activity is increased in stressed cells requires intrinsic HSF1 activity. glucocorticoid receptor glucocorticoid response element heat shock transcription factor heat shock response element heat shock protein sodium vanadate mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase DNA-dependent protein kinase negative regulatory element 1 nuclear factor-κB mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay dexamethasone The glucocorticoid receptor (GR)1 is a member of the nuclear receptor family of proteins that act as hormone-activated transcription factors (1Evans R.M.

Since the GR is known to be involved in the organismal response to stress (3Munck A. Guyre P.M. Holbrook N.J. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 25-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar), and since the hormone-free GR is known to reside in the cytoplasm as a complex containing heat shock proteins (HSPs) (4Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), we and others have investigated the role of the heat shock response in controlling GR function. Early evidence to suggest a relationship between these responses includes the ability of heat shock or chemical stress (arsenite) to cause nuclear translocation of hormone-free GR in mouse L929 and Chinese hamster ovary cells (5Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shen P. Xie Z.-J. Li H. Sanchez E.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and a partial increase in GR-mediated gene expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells subjected to heat or chemical shock in the absence of hormone (6Shen P. Xie Z.-J. Li H. Sanchez E.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Heat shock-induced nuclear translocation of hormone-free GR has also been documented in the liver of rats subjected to whole-body hyperthermia (7Matic G. Jugoslov. Med. Biochem. 1995; 14: 89-102Google Scholar, 8Matic G. Kipic J. Ristic B. Dundjerski J. Trajkovic D. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as well as in COS cells expressing human GR (9Liu W. Hillmann A.G. Harmon J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence to suggest that heat shock-induced nuclear translocation of hormone-free GR can result in altered expression of endogenous genes has also been accumulating. For example, heat shock treatment of COS and Hela cells in the absence of hormone results in GR-mediated transrepression of the collagenase promoter (9Liu W. Hillmann A.G. Harmon J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while heat shock treatment of murine macrophages results in a pattern of Fc receptor expression or repression that is identical to that observed in response to hormone (10Sivo J. Harmon J.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3450-3454PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, heat shock-induced translocation of hormone-free GR has been implicated in the process of stress-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells (11Smets L.A. Salomons G. Van Rooij H. van den Berg J. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the presence of hormone, heat shock has been shown to have a dramatic effect on reporter gene expression controlled by progesterone receptor (12Edwards D.P. Estes P.A. Fadok V.A. Bona B.J. Onate S. Nordeen S.K. Welch W.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2482-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or GR (13Sanchez E.R. Hu J.L. Zhong S.J. Shen P. Green M.J. Housley P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 408-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Hu J.L. Guan X.J. Sanchez E.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 197-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our laboratory, the potentiation of hormone-induced GR function by heat shock was observed at saturating concentrations of dexamethasone (Dex) agonist (1 μm) and was observed in cells stably transfected with complex (pMMTV-CAT) or minimal (pGRE2E1B-CAT) promoters controlling expression of CAT (13Sanchez E.R. Hu J.L. Zhong S.J. Shen P. Green M.J. Housley P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 408-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the GR-mediated response typically seen in unstressed cells is not maximal, even in the presence of hormone concentrations that yield saturation results for reporter gene expression. Thus, it would appear that heat shock is a mechanism by which a latent response to hormone by the GR can be activated. However, the precise mechanism by which heat shock can control the GR has been little investigated. Since HSF1 is the principal factor regulating the heat shock response in cells, we have, in the present study, examined the role of HSF1 in the stress potentiation of GR. To test the role of HSF1 in this process, we sought the use of compounds that could either selectively inhibit HSF1 activity in stressed cells, or that could increase HSF activity without being an additional cause of stress. We have identified two such compounds, sodium vanadate (SV) and wortmannin. Sodium vanadate has been widely used as an inhibitor of dual-specificity protein phosphatases (15Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), most notably the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase MKP1 (also known as PAC1), inhibition of which appears to explain the ability of SV to induce MAPK activity (16Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 17Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Kelly K. Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Since MAPK family members have been shown to phosphorylate HSF1 within its transcriptional regulatory domain (18Zou J. Salminen W.F. Roberts S.M. Voellmy R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and to inhibit HSF1 activity in response to stress (19Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 20Kim J. Nueda A. Meng Y. Dynan W.S. Mivechi N.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar), the ability of SV to induce MAPK activity has become a useful means by which to inhibit the heat shock response in stressed cells. Although two reports exist demonstrating an inhibitory effect of vanadate on heat shock-induced HSP70 expression (21Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar, 22He L. Fox M.H. Radiation Res. 1999; 151: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), no other studies on the effects of SV on HSF1 activity using endogenous genes or reporter constructs have been described. In this work, we demonstrate that SV can indeed cause inactivation of HSF1-mediated CAT reporter expression in stressed cells and that SV inhibition of HSF1 results in a corresponding inhibition of the stress effect on the GR. Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite that has recently been shown to irreversibly inactivate members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (23Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar, 24Izzard R.A. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2581-2586PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-PK is composed of two major components, a 460-kDa subunit containing catalytic activity (DNA-PKcs) and a heteromeric 70- and 86-kDa subunit (Ku autoantigen) that binds DNA (25Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 26Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Inactivation of DNA-PK by wortmannin occurs by covalent binding at the catalytic domain of DNA-PKcs (24Izzard R.A. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2581-2586PubMed Google Scholar). Although interaction of Ku with DNA can occur nonspecifically at ends of DNA (25Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), specific interaction of Ku with the negative regulatory element 1 (NRE1) response element has recently been described (27Giffen W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1449-1459PubMed Google Scholar, 28Giffen W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M.

Hache R.J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A variety of reports exist to support the notion that DNA-PK can modulate HSF1 activity. First, overexpression of the 70-kDa component of Ku results in reduced levels of HSP70 expression following heat shock (30Yang S.H. Nussenzweig A. Li L. Kim D. Ouyang H. Burgman P. Li G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3799-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells containing reduced levels of DNA-PKcs showed reduced accumulation of HSP70 during recovery from stress, and these cells were much more sensitive to heat shock-induced apoptosis (31Nueda A. Hudson F. Mivechi N.F. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14988-14996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between HSF1 and Ku or DNA-PKcs has been observed (31Nueda A. Hudson F. Mivechi N.F. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14988-14996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), along with DNA-PKcs-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of HSF1 (32Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in a region of HSF1 known to be negatively regulated by MAPKs (32Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Knauf U. Newton E.M. Kyriakis J. Kingston R.E.

Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on the above observations, it can be concluded that wortmannin is an effective inhibitor of DNA-PK. However, the functional effects of DNA-PK on HSF1 remain somewhat contradictory. In order to resolve this issue and to hopefully develop an agent with positive, nonstressing effects on HSF1, we have tested the effects of wortmannin on HSF1 under stress and nonstress conditions. We report here that wortmannin treatment of intact cells results in a marked enhancement of HSF1-mediated CAT expression, but only under stress conditions, suggesting that DNA-PK does indeed act as a negative regulator of HSF1. In cells stably transfected with a GR-responsive CAT reporter, wortmannin treatment caused a corresponding increase in the stress potentiation of GR, under conditions where wortmannin had no effect on GR signaling in the absence of stress. In summary, our results show that down-regulation or up-regulation of HSF1 will result in a corresponding modulation of GR activity in stressed cells. Since the agents used in this study to modulate HSF1 act by distinct mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that the effects of these agents on the GR is due to the existence of a common target controlling both the heat shock and GR pathways. Instead, we propose that the mechanism by which heat shock controls GR transactivation requires HSF1 activity. [3H]Acetate (10.3 μCi/mmol) and [125I]conjugates of goat anti-mouse IgG (11.8 μCi/μg) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (9.0 μCi/μg) were obtained from ICN Radiochemicals. Sodium vanadate, wortmannin, ATP, Me2SO, sodium arsenite, dexamethasone, G418 (Geneticin) antibiotic, acetyl-CoA synthetase, acetyl coenzyme A, Tris, Hepes, EDTA, protein A-Sepharose, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium powdered medium, and horseradish peroxidase conjugates of goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Sigma. Iron-supplemented newborn calf serum and dialyzed fetal bovine serum were from Hyclone. Immobilon P membranes were obtained from Millipore Corp. GenePorter transfection reagent was obtained from Gene Therapy Systems, Inc. The SC-7383 monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated (active) ERK was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). In the p2500-CAT reporter used in this study, expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) is controlled by the human HSP70 promoter containing consensus heat shock elements (HSEs) known to be activated by the binding of heat shock factor (36Dreano M. Brochot J. Myers A. Cheng-Meyer C. Rungger C. Voellmy R. Bromley P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 49: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The pMMTV-CAT plasmid contains the complete mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat promoter (MMTV-LTR) upstream of CAT (37Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Hormonally driven expression of CAT by this reporter is controlled by glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) residing within the LTR region (38Cato A.C.B. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Arnemann J. Beato M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2237-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The pGRE2E1B-CAT minimal reporter is composed of two synthetic GREs derived from the tyrosine aminotransferase promoter linked to the adenovirus E1B TATA sequence (39Allgood V.E. Oakley R.H. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20870-20876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The various CAT reporter-expressing cells lines were established as described previously (13Sanchez E.R. Hu J.L. Zhong S.J. Shen P. Green M.J. Housley P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 408-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Li D.-P. Li Calzi S. Sanchez E.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 223-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse L929 cells were co-transfected with pSV2neo and a 2-fold excess of p2500-CAT (LHSECAT cells), pMMTV-CAT (LMCAT2 cells), or pGRE2E1B-CAT (LGEC cells) using Lipofectin as carrier. This was followed by selection for stably transfected, cloned cell lines using G418 (Geneticin) antibiotic at 0.4 mg/ml. Once established, all cell lines were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418 and 10% iron-supplemented newborn calf serum. For all experiments, the newborn calf serum was stripped of endogenous steroids by extraction with dextran-coated charcoal. Most stress experiments were performed on cells that were at or near confluence, although similar results were obtained with subconfluent cultures. Heat shock treatment was achieved by shifting replicate flasks to a second 5% CO2 incubator set at 43 °C. Typical duration of heat shock treatment was 2 h. Cells were also subjected to chemical shock by the addition of 200 μmsodium arsenite to the medium. In the chemical shock experiments, the arsenite-treated and nontreated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and were then washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and allowed to recover. In the experiments involving sodium vanadate or wortmannin, the drug was typically added to the culture medium for the indicated interval prior to either hormone or stress treatment. At the end of the stress or hormone treatments, the drug-containing medium was washed away, followed by continued culture as indicated for each experiment. Vanadate was prepared according to the method of Gordon (15Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) by dissolving sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4·nH2O) to 500 mm in sterile water and adjusting to approximately pH 10. Prior to use, SV stock solution was heated to boiling until solution was clear and to ensure the presence of the active monomers. Wortmannin stock was 1 mm in Me2SO. Measurement of CAT enzyme activity was performed according to the method of Nordeen et al. (41Nordeen S.K. Green P.P.I. Fowlkes D.M. DNA. 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In this assay, a reaction mixture containing acetyl-CoA synthetase, [3H]sodium acetate, CoA, and ATP is briefly preincubated to enzymatically generate labeled acetyl coenzyme A from CoA and labeled acetate. Acetylation of chloramphenicol was then initiated by adding cell lysate containing CAT enzyme. The reaction was stopped by extraction with cold benzene, and 75% of the organic phase was counted. Cell lysates were prepared by sequential freezing and thawing in 0.25 m Tris, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) and centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Aliquots of lysate containing equal protein content were added to the enzymatic reaction mixtures. Since the GRE- and HSE-containing promoters employed in this study have distinct basal and inducible activities, all data are represented as percentage of control, maximum, or the equivalent. In this way, the relative inhibitory or stimulatory effects of vanadate or wortmannin on HSF1- and GR-mediated CAT expression can be readily seen. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels as described by Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), followed by transfer to Imobilon® polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The relative amounts of MAPK were determined via a quantitative Western blotting technique previously described (43Tienrungroj W. Sanchez E.R. Housley P.R. Harrison R.W. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17342-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which involves incubation of the blots with primary antibody, followed by peroxidase- and125I-conjugated counter antibodies. After color development, the ERK blots were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays for HSF1 were performed according to the protocol of Mosser et al.(44Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, single 75-cm2flasks of LHSECAT cells were subjected to a variety of stress and drug conditions. Cells were harvested, centrifuged, and rapidly frozen at −80 °C. The frozen pellets were resuspended in WCE buffer (20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were either stored at −80 °C or used immediately. EMSA assays were performed by mixing 10 μg of whole cell extract with 0.1 ng (50,000 cpm) of32P-labeled HSE oligonucleotide (5′-GAT CTC GGC TGG AAT ATT CCC GAC CTG GCA GCC GA-3′) and 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol in a final volume of 25 μl. For competition experiments, the binding reactions contained 0.1 ng of the [32P]HSE and a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled HSE. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE. The gels were run at room temperature for 1.5 h at 150 V and were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. The relative amounts of probe-bound HSF1 were then measured by densitometric scanning of the film using the Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst system. In order to test the role of HSF1 in the heat shock-induced potentiation of GR, we have taken advantage of the recently described ability of SV to inhibit HSF1 in stressed cells (20Kim J. Nueda A. Meng Y. Dynan W.S. Mivechi N.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar, 22He L. Fox M.H. Radiation Res. 1999; 151: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In two of these reports, the inhibitory effect of SV on HSF1 activity was based on measurements of heat shock-induced HSP70 expression (21Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar, 22He L. Fox M.H. Radiation Res. 1999; 151: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, no studies on the effects of SV on HSF1 transactivation using reporter constructs have been described. To accurately measure the effects of SV on this HSF1 function, we have stably transfected L929 cells with the p2500-CAT construct (LHSECAT cells), in which high level CAT gene expression is controlled by the human HSP70 promoter (36Dreano M. Brochot J. Myers A. Cheng-Meyer C. Rungger C. Voellmy R. Bromley P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 49: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Dose-dependent inhibition by SV of heat shock-induced CAT expression in the LHSECAT cells can be seen in Fig. 1 A, with maximal inhibition (88.5%) occurring at 500 μm SV. We chose 500 μm SV for the next set of experiments (Fig.1 B), in which the effects of SV on both heat and chemical shock activation of HSF1 transactivation were measured in the LHSECAT cells. The results show that SV can effectively inhibit both heat and arsenite activation of HSF1. The results also show that SV can inhibit HSF1-mediated transactivation when added to the cells immediately after the stress event, a point in time at which HSF1 is presumably already bound to DNA. This result would suggest that the ultimate effect of SV is to primarily inhibit the transcription enhancement activity of HSF1. In order to test the above conclusion, we measured the effects of SV on HSF1 DNA binding ability by use of the EMSA seen in Fig.2. As expected, the results show that heat shock can activate HSF1 binding to HSE-containing oligomers. However, SV did not inhibit the ability of heat shock to activate the DNA binding function of HSF1. Quantitation of our results by densitometric scanning and normalization to the heat shock-activated control (Fig. 2 B) shows that SV treatment of the cells before (SV-HS) or after heat shock (HS-SV) results in almost no change in this function, 82.4 and 89.5%, respectively. This result contrasts with a report by Mivechi and Giaccia (21Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar) in which the authors show that pretreatment of NIH3T3 cells with 500 μm SV results in a near complete inhibition of DNA binding by heat shock-activated HSF1. A similar report by He and Fox (22He L. Fox M.H. Radiation Res. 1999; 151: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) also showed a 2-fold reduction in HSF1 DNA-binding in Chinese hamster ovary cells exposed to 10 μm SV for 24 h. However, our results are consistent with those of Chu et al. (19Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), in which inactivation of HSF1 by overexpression of MAPK kinase and subsequent activation of ERK does not result in loss of HSF1 DNA binding ability. Taken as a whole then, our reporter gene (Fig. 1) and gel shift data (Fig. 2) point to a mechanism in which the primary effect of SV on HSF1 function is at the level of HSF-induced transactivation. Since SV inhibition of HSF1 is reported to involve activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, notably ERK1 and ERK2, and subsequent phosphorylation of HSF1 (20Kim J. Nueda A. Meng Y. Dynan W.S. Mivechi N.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar), we confirmed these responses to SV in our cells. In preliminary experiments, we have observed a time-dependent activation of ERK1 and -2 in response to SV treatment (500 μm) of LHSECAT cells, as measured by Western blotting of whole cell extracts with the SC-7383 antibody against phosphorylated (active) ERK (data not shown). To test the ability of SV-activated ERK to phosphorylate HSF1, we have used an immune complex kinase assay in which total (active and inactive) ERK1, adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads with the SC93 antibody against ERK1, was allowed to phosphorylate human recombinant HSF1.

More important to the goals of our study, however, was the need to measure the extent of ERK1 and -2 activation in response to combined SV, stress, and hormone treatments, since these would be the conditions under which we would determine the role of HSF in the GR response to stress (see below). As can be seen in Fig.3, SV treatment alone resulted in a level of ERK1 and ERK2 activation that is comparable with that seen under combined SV, heat shock, and Dex treatment. Thus, if HSF1 activity is indeed modulated by MAPK, then we would expect about the same level of HSF inactivation under both of these conditions. It was interesting to note from the results of Fig. 3 A that heat shock treatment alone also caused activation of ERK1 and -2, albeit to a lesser degree than vanadate alone. Although this apparent contradiction calls into question the role of MAPK as a negative regulator of HSF1, it is also possible that heat shock activation of MAPK is actually a mechanism by which to achieve autoregulation of the heat shock response. As a test of this idea, we reasoned that other forms of stress that yield higher levels of HSF1 activity should show reduced induction of MAPK. In our LHSECAT cells, we have consistently observed that chemical shock using arsenite produces a stronger CAT response than does heat shock (see Fig. 1 B). We therefore compared MAPK activation in response to both forms of stress (Fig.3 B). The results show that once again HS activati"

In the rat skeletal muscle Na+ channel (μ1), we examined the contribution of charged residues between the P loops and S6 in all four domains to μ-CTX block. Conversion of the negatively charged domain II (DII) residues Asp-762 and Glu-765 to cysteine increased the IC50 for μ-CTX block by ∼100-fold (wild-type = 22.3 ± 7.0 nm; D762C = 2558 ± 250 nm; E765C = 2020 ± 379 nm). Restoration or reversal of charge by external modification of the cysteine-substituted channels with methanethiosulfonate reagents (methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate (MTSES) and methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA)) did not affect μ-CTX block (D762C: IC50, MTSEA+ = 2165.1 ± 250 nm; IC50, MTSES− = 2753.5 ± 456.9 nm; E765C: IC50, MTSEA+ = 2200.1 ± 550.3 nm; IC50, MTSES− = 3248.1 ± 2011.9 nm) compared with their unmodified counterparts. In contrast, the charge-conserving mutations D762E (IC50 = 21.9 ± 4.3 nm) and E765D (IC50 = 22.0 ± 7.0 nm) preserved wild-type blocking behavior, whereas the charge reversal mutants D762K (IC50 = 4139.9 ± 687.9 nm) and E765K (IC50 = 4202.7 ± 1088.0 nm) destabilized μ-CTX block even further, suggesting a prominent electrostatic component of the interactions between these DII residues and μ-CTX. Kinetic analysis of μ-CTX block reveals that the changes in toxin sensitivity are largely due to accelerated toxin dissociation (k off) rates with little changes in association (k on) rates. We conclude that the acidic residues at positions 762 and 765 are key determinants of μ-CTX block, primarily by virtue of their negative charge.

The three-dimensional structure of μ-CTX resembles a tetragonal bipyramid with axial distances of approximately 25 and 20 Å (15Lancelin J.M. Knoda D. Tate S. Yanagawa Y. Abe T. Satake M. Inagaki F.

Despite the wealth of information regarding the three-dimensional structure of μ-CTX, the molecular configuration and components of its molecular receptor in the Na+ channel are much less certain. In contrast to other site I Na+ channel blockers such as tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX), μ-CTX is believed to bind more superficially in the channel pore. The docking site of μ-CTX is comprised of numerous toxin-channel interactions of varying affinities (7Chen L.-Q. Chahine M. Kallen R.G. Barchi R.L. Horn R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Becker S. Prusak-Sochazewski E. Zamponi G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Gordon R.D. French R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8229-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments have identified a number of pore residues that are critical for μ-CTX binding to the channel (8Dudley Jr., S.C. Hannes T. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1657-1665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Kallen R. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the characterization of the toxin footprint on the external vestibule of the channel is incomplete. In the present study, we attempted to identify novel residues that are responsible for interacting with μ-CTX. Within the P loop S6 (P-S6) linkers, located on the N-terminal side of the selectivity filter region, there are a large number of charged residues (in particular, the DIII linker contains five consecutive charged residues in a row) (Fig. 1). Several of the charged residues in P-S6 linkers significantly influence the permeation phenotype of the channel (18Li R.A. Velez P. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that these residues also participate in μ-CTX binding to the channel (by optimizing its orientation via electrostatic interactions with the toxin). To test this hypothesis, we individually neutralized all charged residues in the P-S6 linkers and assessed μ-CTX block of the mutant channels. We identified two negatively charged residues (Asp-762 and Glu-765) in domain II of rat skeletal muscle Na+ channel that, when neutralized to cysteine, increased the IC50 for μ-CTX block by ∼100-fold. The molecular basis of the change in affinity was further investigated by manipulations of the charge at these positions using sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, charge-altering mutations, and kinetic analysis of toxin block in both WT and mutant channels. A preliminary report has appeared (19Li, R. A., Velez, P., (abstr.) Tomaselli, G. F., and Marbán, E. (2000) Biophys. J.78, 87Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed on the rat skeletal muscle (μ1) sodium channel α-subunit (20Trimmer J.S. Cooperman S.S. Tomiko S.A. Zhou J. Crean S.M. Boyle M.B. Kallen R.G. Sheng Z. Barchi R.L.

Janecki M. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 195-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The desired mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. WT and mutant channels were expressed in TSA-201 cells (a transformed HEK 293 cell line stably expressing the SV40 T antigen) using a LipofectAMINE Plus transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). DNA encoding the WT or mutant α-subunit (1 μg/60-mm dish) was added to the cells with LipofectAMINE. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2/5% CO2 for 48–72 h for channel protein expression before electrical recordings. Electrophysiological recordings were performed using the whole-cell patch clamp technique (23Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar) with an integrating amplifier (Axopatch 200A, Axon Instruments). Transfected cells were identified by epifluorescence microscopy. Pipettes were fire-polished with final tip resistances of 1–3 MΩ. Recordings were performed at room temperature in a bath solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Designated amounts of μ-CTX (GIIIB), or MTS reagents (methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate (MTSES) and methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada) were added to the bath when required. The internal recording solution contained (in mm): 35 NaCl, 105 CsF, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. μ-CTX (GIIIB) was continuously applied by bath superfusion during the experiment before washing out. Flow rate was maintained at 10 to 20 ml/min (bath volume was 150 μl). Washout began only after the peak currents had reached a steady-state level. Raw current records were analyzed using customized software. Mutant channels were screened for changes in μ-CTX block affinity by determining the degree of current reduction by the toxin at doses of 30 and (or) 100 nm. Full dose-response relationships were obtained for wild-type and for the D762C and E765C mutant channels. Half-blocking concentrations (IC50) for μ-CTX were determined by least-square fits of the dose-response data to a binding isotherm of the form: I/I0=1/[1+([blocker]/IC50)]Equation 1 where IC50 is the half-blocking concentration,I 0 and I are the peak currents measured from a step depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV before and after application of the blocker, respectively. For kinetic analysis of μ-CTX block, the time course of the change of peak sodium currents elicited by depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV during toxin wash-in or wash-out was fit to a single exponential function using a nonlinear least-squares method for estimation of the time constants τon and τoff. The pseudo first order association rate constant (k on) and the first order dissociation rate constant (k off) were calculated from these time constants using the following relationships. koff=1/τoffEquation 2 kon=((1/τon)−(1/τoff))/[μ­CTX]Equation 3 The kinetically derived equilibrium constant (K D) was determined from the equation, KD=koff/konEquation 4 Data reported are mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using a paired Student's t test at the 5% level. Representative records shown in the figures were single current sweeps. All cysteine mutants expressed functional channels except D1248C, R1250C, K1252C, and E1259C, which did not express measurable currents in 5–10 rounds of transfection. We first screened for changes in susceptibility to current blockade by μ-CTX of these mutants relative to WT channels. Fig. 2 summarizes the half-blocking concentrations (IC50) for μ-CTX block of the cysteine-substituted channels. Most cysteine replacements did not significantly alter μ-CTX sensitivity compared with WT channels (p > 0.05). However, neutralization of the negative charges at positions 762 and 765 in domain II decreased toxin affinity: D762C (IC50 = 2558 ± 250 nm,n = 8) and E765C (IC50 = 2020 ± 379 nm, n = 5) channels were ∼100-fold less sensitive to μ-CTX block than was WT (IC50 = 22.3 ± 7.0 nm, n = 4) (p < 0.05). Fig. 3 compares μ-CTX block of WT, D762C, and E765C channels in more detail. Fig. 3 A shows typical Na+ currents recorded in the absence and presence of μ-CTX. Application of 100 nm μ-CTX to WT channels blocked peak sodium current (I Na) to 22.3 ± 4.0% (n = 9) of the control level. However, even 1 μm μ-CTX produced significantly (p < 0.05) less block of D762C and E765C channels and reduced the peak currents to 71.8 ± 1.7% (n = 8) and 65.2 ± 6.2% (n = 5), respectively. Fig. 3 B shows the corresponding complete dose-response curves for μ-CTX block of these channels. The binding curves of both D762C and E765C channels were shifted to the right relative to WT. All data (both WT and mutant channels) were well-fitted with a binding equation assuming a Hill coefficient of one (i.e. no cooperativity), consistent with μ-CTX blocking the Na+ channel pore in a 1:1 stoichiometry (2Cruz L.J.

As anticipated, when these DII charges were neutralized by replacement with glutamine, the resulting double mutant D762Q/E765Q was also resistant to μ-CTX block. Application of 1 μm μ-CTX incompletely blocked the peak current of this channel to 28.5 ± 2.6% (n = 3) (Fig.3 C). We have recently shown that the P-S6 residues Asp-762 and Glu-765 are accessible from the extracellular surface of the channel; therefore, it is possible that these residues contribute to μ-CTX binding to the Na+ channel by electrostatically interacting with the toxin (19Li, R. A., Velez, P., (abstr.) Tomaselli, G. F., and Marbán, E. (2000) Biophys. J.78, 87Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of charge restoration and reversal at these positions by determining the changes in μ-CTX affinity of D762C and E765C channels after MTSES and MTSEA modification, respectively. MTSES and MTSEA are sulfhydryl-specific modifiers that respectively attach a negatively and positively charged adduct to a free cysteinyl (9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Kallen R. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14865-14868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Figs. 4 and5 demonstrate the effects of MTS modifications on μ-CTX block of D762C and E765C channels, respectively. Representative raw currents through D762C and E765C channels recorded in the absence and presence of μ-CTX are shown (Figs. 4 A and 5 A). In contrast to the predictions of a simple electrostatic interaction, neither MTSES nor MTSEA application altered the toxin sensitivities of D762C channels compared with unmodified channels. Clearly, restoration of a negative charge by MTSES was insufficient to restore the sensitivity of either D762C and E765C mutant channels, and charge reversal by MTSEA also failed to further destabilize toxin block. However, MTS modification does not simply alter side-chain charge; instead, a mixed disulfide is formed, adding a bulky charged adduct. Thus, the failure of charged MTS reagents to restore or further reduce μ-CTX affinity does not rule out an electrostatic contribution to the toxin-channel interaction.Figure 5Effects of charge reversal and restoration at position 765 by MTS agents or point mutations. A, representative Na+ current tracings of D765C, MTSEA-modified E765C, MTSES-modified E765C, E765K, and E765D channels elicited by depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV (−150 mV for MTSEA-modified E765C) in the absence (solid line) and presence (broken line) of μ-CTX as indicated by arrows. Control peak currents were normalized.B, bar graphs summarizing the half-blocking concentrations (IC50) for μ-CTX of the same channels shown inA. Similar to D762C, neither MTSEA (2200.1 ± 550.3 nm, n = 2) nor MTSES (3248.1 ± 2011.9 nm, n = 2) modification affected μ-CTX sensitivity of E765C (2025 ± 450 nm,n = 5). Wild-type μ-CTX sensitivity was restored in E765D (22.0 ± 7.0 nm, n = 4) channels but was further destabilized in E765K (4202.7 ± 1888.0 nm, n = 3) channels. The data presented are the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the negative charges at positions 762 and 765 are indeed critical for toxin-channel interactions, we introduced the point mutations D762E and E765D for charge conservation and D762K and E765K for charge reversal (Figs. 4and 5). Unlike MTSES modification of the cysteine mutants, the charge-conserving mutants D762E (IC50 = 21.9 ± 4.3,n = 6) and E765D (IC50 = 22.0 ± 7.0 nm, n = 4) have wild-type sensitivity to μ-CTX block. Conversely, the D762K (IC50 = 4139.9 ± 687.9 nm, n = 4) and E765K (IC50 = 4202.7 ± 1088.0 nm,n = 3) mutations further destabilized toxin affinity compared with their cysteine-substituted counterparts. Taken together with the MTS experiments, our observations suggest that not only do the negative charges at positions 762 and 765 play a crucial role in determining the μ-CTX sensitivity of the wild-type channel but also the local structural environment in which the residues reside is important for optimal toxin-channel interactions. Furthermore, when the mutations D762K and E765K were combined together, the double charge-reversed mutant (i.e. D762K/E765K) displayed an additional decrease in toxin block when compared with the single mutations alone. Addition of 3 μm μ-CTX blocked peak Na+ current merely to 87.8 ± 3.8% (n= 4) of the control value. This observation suggests that both negative charges participate simultaneously in setting the wild-type blocking affinity. To further characterize the toxin-channel interactions, we measured the time course of onset and offset of μ-CTX block. Fig. 6 shows the time course of the development of and recovery from μ-CTX block of WT, D762C, and E765C channels. Single-exponential fits of these data allow estimation of the time constants τon and τoff and, hence, the rate constants (i.e. k on and k off) for toxin binding and unbinding. Similar kinetic analysis was performed on the charge-conserved D762E and E765D and the charge-reversed D762K and E765K mutant channels. The rate constants for these channels are plotted in Fig. 7. All mutant channels but E765D significantly increased k off (3- to 50-fold, p < 0.05). The largest effects onk off were seen with the charge reversal mutants (50- and 30-fold increases for D762K and E765K channels, respectively,p < 0.05), whereas the charge-conserving D762E (3-fold, p < 0.05) and E765D (1.3-fold,p > 0.05) mutations modestly increasedk off. Despite the significant effects onk off, the same mutations had relatively minor effects on k on (2- to 5-fold decrease,p > 0.05) except for D762K channels, which displayed a 10-fold decrease in k on (p < 0.05). The kinetic equilibrium constants (K D) derived from these association and dissociation rate constants were quantitatively similar to and displayed similar trends as their corresponding equilibrium IC50 values (TableI).Figure 7Logarithmic plot of the dissociation rate constants (k off ) versusthe reciprocal of the association rate constants (k on ). The horizontal andvertical dotted lines, respectively, represent the levels of 1/k on and k off for the WT channels.

Open table in a new tab To further strengthen our hypothesis that Asp-762 and Glu-765 play electrostatic roles in μ-CTX binding to the channel, we also replaced these native negatively charged amino acids with alanine, valine, and leucine. These amino acids are neutral yet less reactive than cysteine and should therefore result in similar effects as with the cysteine mutants, with the additional benefit of enabling us to rule out any nonspecific effects that may arise from cysteine or lysine substitutions. Indeed, D762V, D762A, E765A, and E765L displayed results anticipated from electrostatic theory (TableII). In general, theirk off values were more affected than their values for k on. Similar to their cysteine and lysine counterparts, diverse position 762 mutations showed larger effects on toxin block than mutations at 765 suggesting Asp-762 may play a more critical role than Glu-765 in stabilizing the toxin-channel interactions.Table IIThe effects of D762A, D762V, E765A, and E765L mutations on μ-CTX block of the Na + channelChannelk onk on, mutant/k on, WTk offk off, mutant/k off, WTK dK d, mutant/K d, WTm −1 s −1s −1nmD762A2.9 ± 0.4 × 104 (7) a,b0.36.5 ± 0.9 × 10−3 (9)2-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.7.62.5 ± 0.4 × 102 (7)2-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.16.7D762V1.5 ± 0.4 × 104 (9)2-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.0.21.6 ± 0.2 × 10−22-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.18.82.6 ± 1.1 × 103 (9)2-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.173.3E765A1.6 ± 3.2 × 104 (8)2-bNumbers in parentheses, number of individual determinations.0.21.7 ± 0.2 × 10−32-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.21.5 ± 0.4 × 102 (8)2-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.10E765L6.0 ± 0.9 × 104 (7)0.63.6 ± 0.7 × 10−3 (7)2-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.4.28.0 ± 2.6 × 10 (7)2-bp < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.5.32-a Numbers in parentheses, number of individual determinations.2-b p < 0.05 when compared with WT channels.

However, TTX is much smaller than μ-CTX (molecular weights ∼300 versus ∼2600). Our results indicate that none of the P-S6 cysteine mutants alter TTX block by more than a factor of 3; in the three mutant channels (D762C, E765C, and E1251C) where changes were evident, IC50 values were only modestly reduced (≤2-fold) (Table III).

A critical limiting step in this process is the interaction between the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing subunit of TFIIIC (TFIIIC131) and the TFIIB-related factor Brf1p/TFIIIB70. To facilitate biochemical studies of this interaction, we expressed a fragment of TFIIIC131, TFIIIC131-(1–580), that includes the minimal TFIIIB70 interaction domain defined by two-hybrid studies together with adjacent sequences, up to the end of TPR9, implicated in the assembly reaction. TFIIIC131-(1–580) interacts with TFIIIB70 in solution and inhibits the formation of TFIIIB70·TFIIIC·DNA complexes. In a coupled equilibrium binding assay, the formation of TFIIIC131-(1–580)·TFIIIB70 complexes was adequately described by a single-site binding model and yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 334 ± 23 nm. CD spectroscopy and limited proteolysis experiments defined a well structured and largely protease-resistant core in TFIIIC131-(1–580) comprising part of the hydrophilic amino terminus, TPR1–5, the intervening non-TPR region, and TPR6–8.

On tRNA and other genes containing A and B block promoter elements, the assembly reaction begins with nucleosome repositioning or displacement to enable high affinity binding of TFIIIC to the promoter (3Burnol A.F.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interactions with the A block are thermodynamically weaker than those with the B block, and yet simultaneous binding to both sites occurs over a wide range of distances without regard to helical phasing (2Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5299-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The conformational flexibility of TFIIIC indicated by these studies is also seen during the recruitment of TFIIIB. This is reflected by changes in site-specific photocross-linking of the 131-kDa subunit (TFIIIC131) (6Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and by the ability of TFIIIC to co-direct (with the TATA-binding protein (TBP)) the placement of TFIIIB at different locations on the DNA (7Joazeiro C.A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).In addition to TFIIIB recruitment, recent studies have shown that TFIIIC has other functions and activities in pol III transcription. Subunits of TFIIIC in yeast (8Dumay H. Rubbi L. Sentenac A. Marck C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33462-33468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and humans (9Hsieh Y.J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have been shown to interact either genetically or biochemically with subunits of the polymerase that have been highly conserved through evolution. These studies suggest possible roles for TFIIIC in polymerase recruitment; pol III holoenzyme stabilization (11Wang Z. Luo T. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); and/or the cycle of elongation, termination, and reinitiation. In addition, effects on polymerase recycling have been revealed by the association of human TFIIIC with the positive cofactor PC4 and DNA topoisomerase I (12Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, three novel subunits of human TFIIIC (subunits for which yeast homologs have not been identified in database searches) have been shown to possess histone acetyltransferase activity (4Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Hsieh Y.J. Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7697-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These activities seem likely to be involved in chromatin-templated transcription based on studies of pol II transcription (reviewed in Ref. 13Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). However, the role of this modification in transcription by pol III remains to be determined.The recruitment of TFIIIB by promoter-bound TFIIIC is mediated initially by protein-protein interactions. Based on the sequential pathway of binding established in yeast (14Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) together with other genetic and biochemical studies (discussed below), the TFIIIC·DNA complex is thought to interact initially with the TFIIB-related subunit of TFIIIB (Brf1p/TFIIIB70) via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing subunit, TFIIIC131 (15Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Subsequently, protein-protein interactions between TFIIIB70 and TBP (16Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) facilitate the interaction of TBP with the DNA (17Librizzi M.D. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol.

The presence of TBP helps to stabilize the complex via minor groove interactions similar to those seen in pol II transcription complexes (19Persinger J. Sengupta S.M. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5218-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Complex stabilization may also be provided by the unmasking of a cryptic DNA-binding domain in the carboxyl terminus of TFIIIB70 (20Huet J. Conesa C. Carles C. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18341-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The TFIIIB complex is completed with the addition of TFIIIB90 (B“), which further bends the DNA between the site of TBP binding and the transcription start site (21Grove A. Kassavetis G.A. Johnson T.E. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and alters the pattern of cross-linking of TFIIIC131, TFIIIB70, and TBP in the complex (6Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Persinger J. Sengupta S.M. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5218-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recent studies have added to the complexity of these events by increasing the number of interacting components. Among these, an interaction between the 60-kDa subunit of yeast TFIIIC (TFIIIC60) and TBP (22Deprez E. Arrebola R. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8042-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) together with the high nuclear concentration of TBP and TFIIIB70 (23Sethy-Coraci I. Moir R.D. Lopez-de-Leon A. Willis I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have suggested that TFIIIC131 and TFIIIC60 may function together in recruiting a preformed TFIIIB70·TBP complex. Alternatively, it is possible that the TFIIIC60-TBP interaction occurs transiently during the sequence of conformational changes that characterize TFIIIB recruitment (22Deprez E. Arrebola R. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8042-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similar alternative explanations apply to other reported interactions (e.g. those between the human homolog of yeast TFIIIC95 and the human homolog of TFIIIB70 and TBP, respectively) (10Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Biochemical and genetic data indicate that interactions between the TPR-containing subunit (TFIIIC131) and TFIIIB70 are biologically significant and thus play an important role in TFIIIB recruitment. In particular, mutations in and around TPR2 have been shown to increase transcription in vivo of a tRNA gene bearing a defective A block (24Rameau G. Puglia K. Crowe A. Sethy I. Willis I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The same mutations have also been shown to increase transcription of wild-type and mutant templates in vitro by facilitating the recruitment of TFIIIB70 (25Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made in cells and in extracts of strains overexpressing TFIIIB70 (23Sethy-Coraci I. Moir R.D. Lopez-de-Leon A. Willis I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Lopez-de-Leon A. Librizzi M. Puglia K. Willis I.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These findings are complementary and reveal that the interaction between TFIIIC131 and TFIIIB70 represents a limiting step in the assembly of a pol III transcription complex. Solution studies with immobilized fusion proteins suggest that multiple regions of TFIIIC131 interact with TFIIIB70 (10Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). One such region, defined by two-hybrid experiments as a minimal TFIIIB70 interaction domain, is contained within the hydrophilic amino-terminal region and TPR1 (τ131-1TPR-(1–165)) (15Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As noted above, mutations in adjacent TPRs also contribute to the TFIIIC131-TFIIIB70 interaction. However, the mechanism by which mutations in this region increase the recruitment of TFIIIB70 remains to be established. The favored model in the case of the PCF1-2 mutation (T167I in TPR2) involves a structural change within TFIIIC131 that affects the extent to which the binding reaction can proceed (25Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Changes in the nature and/or accessibility of the TFIIIB70-binding site may also underlie the 4-fold decrease in the two-hybrid interaction that occurs when the minimal TFIIIB70 interaction domain, τ131-1TPR-(1–165), is extended up to the end of TPR9 (15Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The molecular and biochemical basis for these effects is not well understood at the present time and warrants further investigation.We have initiated a biochemical study to investigate the interaction between TFIIIC131 and TFIIIB70. In this work, we report the expression and characterization of a fragment of TFIIIC131, TFIIIC131-(1–580), that interacts with TFIIIB70 in solution and inhibits the formation of TFIIIB70·TFIIIC·DNA complexes. We describe a coupled equilibrium binding assay that indirectly quantifies the interaction between TFIIIC131-(1–580) and TFIIIB70. Limited proteolysis of TFIIIC131-(1–580) together with circular dichroism experiments in the presence and absence of TFIIIB70 provide insights into the structure of the protein and suggest that a conformational change may occur upon formation of the TFIIIC131-(1–580)·TFIIIB70 complex.DISCUSSIONThe interaction between TFIIIB70 and promoter-bound TFIIIC represents an important step in the recruitment of the initiation factor TFIIIB upstream of the transcription start site (6Kassavetis G.A.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8042-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), biochemical studies indicate that in yeast, the interaction between TFIIIB70 and TFIIIC·DNA is the major thermodynamically limited step (23Sethy-Coraci I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28463-28470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The binding of TFIIIB70 to the TFIIIC·DNA complex is mediated by the TPR-containing subunit, TFIIIC131 (15Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and potentially by TFIIIC95 (based on an interaction between the homologous proteins in humans) (10Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, mutations in TFIIIC131 increase the transcription of a mutantsup9-e tRNA gene in vivo and facilitate the recruitment of TFIIIB70 to TFIIIC·DNA complexes in vitro(24Rameau G. Puglia K. Crowe A. Sethy I. Willis I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between TFIIIB70 and TFIIIC131 appears to be limiting for transcription complex assembly in vivo. To study this interaction in greater detail, we expressed a fragment of TFIIIC131, TFIIIC131-(1–580), that encompasses the minimum TFIIIB70 interaction domain (defined by two-hybrid studies) together with additional sequences implicated in the assembly reaction (16Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We showed that TFIIIC131-(1–580) inhibits pol III transcription in vitro (Fig. 1) by binding to TFIIIB70 and by blocking preinitiation complex assembly (Figs. 2 and 3). In addition, we established a coupled equilibrium binding assay in which the formation of TFIIIC131-(1–580)·TFIIIB70 complexes in solution is linked to the inhibition of TFIIIB complex assembly on a tRNA gene template. By quantifying TFIIIB·DNA complexes resolved on native polyacrylamide gels as a function of TFIIIC131-(1–580) concentration, this assay has provided an indirect measure of the interaction between TFIIIB70 and TFIIIC131-(1–580). Simultaneous nonlinear least-squares fitting of multiple data sets to the Hill equation resulted in a Hill coefficient of −1.4 ± 0.2, slightly higher than the theoretical value of unity expected for a noncooperative binary interaction. However, by applying the simplifying assumption that the data are adequately described by a single-site binding model, we determined an apparent dissociation constant of 334 ± 23 nm for the TFIIIC131-(1–580)·TFIIIB70 complex. This relatively low binding affinity is consistent with the limiting nature of the TFIIIC131-TFIIIB70 interaction described above and, considering the size of the two proteins, suggests that the interface between them is quite small (37Janin J. Proteins. 1995; 21: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The coupled binding assay used here is simple and, as indicated by the error, can be performed with high precision. In the absence of direct quantitative assays for this protein-protein interaction, the assay will be useful in analyzing the relative contributions of different regions/domains of TFIIIC131-(1–580) and in examining the effect of activating mutations in TPR2.Examination of the structural organization of TFIIIC131-(1–580) by partial proteolysis showed it to be remarkably resistant to cleavage by a variety of proteases. This was especially noteworthy for trypsin and chymotrypsin because of the large number of potential cleavage sites and because of the location of these sites; potential cleavage sites for one or the other or both enzymes are located in the loops linking each of the 18 TPR helices (Fig. 4 E) (32Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Loops and turns are typically found on the solvent-accessible surface in proteins (38Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1993: 217-238Google Scholar) and are thus often susceptible to cleavage. The proteolysis data therefore imply that the tertiary structure of TFIIIC131-(1–580) is such that the accessibility of these sites in TPR1–8, but not those in TPR9, is restricted. Similarly, the intervening non-TPR region that separates repeats 5 and 6 must be well structured since it is not cleaved readily by trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, or subtilisin (Fig. 4 and data not shown). This result together with secondary structural predictions based on CD (Fig. 5 and above) and the known structure of TPRs support the idea that the intervening non-TPR region is predominantly β-sheet. Accordingly, we suggest that the protease-resistant core of TFIIIC131-(1–580) is likely to result from the packing of the two TPR domains together with the intervening non-TPR domain as opposed to these three domains being structurally isolated from one another. In contrast, parts of the hydrophilic amino-terminal domain are clearly solvent-exposed since this domain is susceptible to cleavage by trypsin and chymotrypsin in two distinct regions.Circular dichroism spectroscopy in the presence of TFE provided evidence that a conformational change involving the acquisition of α-helical structure occurs in TFIIIC131-(1–580). Moreover, a small but reproducible monovalent ion-dependent increase in α-helical structure was detected upon formation of TFIIIC131-(1–580)·TFIIIB70 complexes. With respect to the magnitude of this increase in α-helical structure, we note that the TPR crystal structure predicts a minimum of 228 α-helical residues in TFIIIC131-(1–580). The acquisition of a typical 10-amino acid helix would therefore contribute, at most, a 4% increase in molar ellipticity for this protein alone. In a mixture of TFIIIC131-(1–580) and TFIIIB70, the percent change in molar ellipticity would be reduced by the α-helical content of TFIIIB70 (inferred from the structure of TFIIB) (39Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed modest CD difference spectra are consistent with expectations given the size and structure of TFIIIC131-(1–580) and TFIIIB70.The increase in α-helical structure detected on complex formation could be attributed to either or both proteins. However, the following observations suggest that α-helix formation in the complex occurs largely within TFIIIC131-(1–580). (i) Experiments with TFE demonstrated a significant potential for the acquisition of α-helicity in TFIIIC131-(1–580) (Fig. 5). In contrast, only a small change in the CD spectra of TFIIIB70 was observed in the presence of TFE (data not shown). (ii) The signal detected by CD (molar ellipticity) is proportional to the molar extinction coefficient of the protein, which is 2.7 times higher for TFIIIC131-(1–580) than for TFIIIB70. Thus, in an approximately equimolar mixture of the two proteins, both of which contain significant amounts of α-helix (see above and Refs. 32Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar and 39Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the CD spectrum is predominantly that of TFIIIC131-(1–580) (Fig. 6).An increase in α-helicity in the TFIIIC131-(1–580)·TFIIIB70 complex may result from the stabilization of structure at the interface between the two proteins. This induced fit mechanism has been reported previously for other protein-protein interactions (35McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Ford J. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (, and references therein): 9584-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and is a common feature of many protein-nucleic acid interactions (37Janin J. Proteins. 1995; 21: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 39Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). An intriguing alternative possibility is that α-helical structure may be acquired at a site distal to the binding interface (by the propagation of conformational changes, e.g. see Refs. 40Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 41Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and that the resulting structure may be important for subsequent steps in transcription complex assembly or function. A structural change of this type is compatible with the concerted sequence of conformational changes documented by site-specific DNA-protein photocross-linking during TFIIIC-dependent assembly of TFIIIB (2Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5299-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In particular, TFIIIB70-dependent changes in the structure of TFIIIC appear to be important for allowing entry of TFIIIB90 into the preinitiation complex (42Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TFIIIB70-dependent helix formation in TFIIIC131 could potentially play a role at this step. Further examination of these possibilities will require delimiting the region of helix formation in TFIIIC131-(1–580) and an analysis of mutants that fail to adopt this structure. Transcription factor (TF)1 IIIC is a large multisubunit complex that is responsible for recruiting the RNA polymerase III (pol III) initiation factor, TFIIIB, to the DNA upstream of the transcription start site of 5 S rRNA, tRNA, and related genes (1White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York1998: 82-99Google Scholar, 2Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5299-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On tRNA and other genes containing A and B block promoter elements, the assembly reaction begins with nucleosome repositioning or displacement to enable high affinity binding of TFIIIC to the promoter (3Burnol A.F. Margottin F. Schultz P. Marsolier M.C. Oudet P. Sentenac A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interactions with the A block are thermodynamically weaker than those with the B block, and yet simultaneous binding to both sites occurs over a wide range of distances without regard to helical phasing (2Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5299-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The conformational flexibility of TFIIIC indicated by these studies is also seen during the recruitment of TFIIIB. This is reflected by changes in site-specific photocross-linking of the 131-kDa subunit (TFIIIC131) (6Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and by the ability of TFIIIC to co-direct (with the TATA-binding protein (TBP)) the placement of TFIIIB at different locations on the DNA (7Joazeiro C.A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition to TFIIIB recruitment, recent studies have shown that TFIIIC has other functions and activities in pol III transcription. Subunits of TFIIIC in yeast (8Dumay H. Rubbi L. Sentenac A. Marck C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33462-33468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and humans (9Hsieh Y.J. Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7697-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have been shown to interact either genetically or biochemically with subunits of the polymerase that have been highly conserved through evolution. These studies suggest possible roles for TFIIIC in polymerase recruitment; pol III holoenzyme stabilization (11Wang Z. Luo T. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); and/or the cycle of elongation, termination, and reinitiation. In addition, effects on polymerase recycling have been revealed by the association of human TFIIIC with the positive cofactor PC4 and DNA topoisomerase I (12Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, three novel subunits of human TFIIIC (subunits for which yeast homologs have not been identified in database searches) have been shown to possess histone ac"

Here, we demonstrate that KfiA is an alpha-UDP-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase and that biosynthesis of the K5 polysaccharide involves the concerted action of the KfiA and KfiC proteins. By site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that the acidic motif of DDD, which is conserved between the C family of glycosyltransferases, is essential for the enzymatic activity of KfiA III addition, by Western blot analysis, we determined that association of KfiA with the cytoplasmic membrane requires KfiC but not KfiB, whereas the interaction of KfiC with the cytoplasmic membrane was dependent on both KfiA and KfiB. Likewise, KfiB was only detectable in cytoplasmic membrane fractions when both KfiA and KfiC were present. These data suggest that the interaction between the KfiA, KfiB, and KfiC proteins is essential for the stable association of these proteins with the cytoplasmic membrane and the biosynthesis of the K5 polysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1593511384,"The CC chemokine eotaxin plays a predominant role in eosinophil trafficking in vivo by specifically activating the chemokine receptor CCR3. We have screened a series of synthetic peptides corresponding to extracellular regions of CCR3 for their ability to bind eotaxin. A peptide corresponding to the N terminus of CCR3 (CCR3-(1-35)) bound to eotaxin with a dissociation constant of 80 +/- 38 micrometer. However, linear or cyclic peptides derived from the first and third extracellular loops of CCR3 did not bind to eotaxin. Linear and cyclic peptides derived from the second extracellular loop precipitated upon addition of eotaxin. (1)H-(15)N correlation NMR spectroscopy indicated that an extended groove in the eotaxin surface, whose edges are defined by the N-loop, 3(10)-helical turn, and beta(2)-beta(3) hairpin, is the most likely binding surface for CCR3-(1-35). NMR assignments for CCR3-(1-35) were obtained using two-dimensional and three-dimensional homonuclear NMR experiments. (15)N-Filtered TOCSY spectra indicated that the central region of CCR3-(1-35), surrounding the DDYY sequence, is involved in the interaction with eotaxin. This was supported by the observation that a truncated N-terminal peptide (CCR3-(8-23)) binds to eotaxin with a dissociation constant of 136 +/- 23 micrometer, only slightly weaker than the full-length N-terminal peptide. Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that interactions between the N-loop/beta(3) regions of chemokines and the N-terminal regions of their receptors may be a conserved feature of chemokine-receptor complexes across the CC, CXC, and C chemokine subfamilies. However, the low affinity of the interactions observed in these studies suggests the existence of additional binding regions in both the chemokines and the receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1595931622,"α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) is a highly conserved proteinase inhibitor present in human plasma at high concentration (2–4 mg/ml). α2M exists in two conformations, a native form and an activated, receptor-recognized form. While α2M binds to numerous cytokines and growth factors, in most cases, the nature of the α2M interaction with these factors is poorly understood. We examined in detail the interaction between α2M and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and found a novel and unexpected mechanism of interaction as demonstrated by the following observations: 1) the binding of VEGF to α2M occurs at a site distinct from the recently characterized growth factor binding site; 2) VEGF binds different forms of α2M with distinct spatial arrangement, namely to the interior of methylamine or ammonia-treated α2M and to the exterior of native and proteinase-converted α2M; and 3) VEGF (molecular mass ∼40 kDa) can access the interior of receptor-recognized α2M in the absence of a proteinase trapped within the molecule. VEGF bound to receptor-recognized forms of α2M is internalized and degraded by macrophages via the α2M receptor, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Oxidation of both native and receptor-recognized α2M results in significant inhibition of VEGF binding. We also examined the biological significance of this interaction by studying the effect of α2M on VEGF-induced cell proliferation and VEGF-induced up-regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. We demonstrate that under physiological conditions, α2M does not impact the ability of VEGF to induce cell proliferation or up-regulate Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1599647093,"Calcium-induced aggregation has been proposed to play a role in the sorting and storage of secretory proteins in secretory granules of endocrine cells. The regulation of this process is not known. Hexahistidine epitope tags were used to create aggregation chaperones that enhance the calcium-induced aggregation of secretory granule proteins in vitro. Indeed, 100% recovery of the aggregating target protein was achieved without any modification of the target protein. The aggregation chaperone is not trapped in the aggregates. Co-expression of His6-tagged secreted alkaline phosphatase and the regulated secretory protein chromogranin A resulted in an increased chromogranin storage in secretory granules, and stimulated secretion of chromogranin A increased 50%. However, secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase was not affected by the hexahistidine epitope tag. Thus, calcium-induced aggregation is not a passive process; rather, aggregation and sorting of secretory proteins can be regulated by aggregation chaperones in the secretory pathway of endocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970939018,"We have previously engineered the first superactive analogs of human thyrotropin (hTSH) by using a novel design strategy. In this study, we have applied homology comparisons focusing on the αL3 loop of the common α-subunit of human glycoprotein hormones. Seven highly variable amino acid residues were identified, and charge-scanning mutagenesis revealed three previously unrecognized modification permissive domains and four gain-of-function lysine substitutions. Such gain-of-function mutations were hormone- and receptor-specific and dependent on location and basic charge. Cooperativity of individual substitutions was established in double and triple lysine mutants. In combinations of the most potent αL3 loop analog with two previously characterized loop analogs, a higher degree of cooperativity for the αL3 loop analog compared with both the αL1 loop analog and the hTSH-βL3 loop analog was observed. We demonstrated that spatially distinct regions of the common α-subunit contribute differentially to the interaction of hTSH with its receptor and that combinations of two modified loops on the same and on opposite sides of the hTSH molecule display similar increases in in vitro biopotency. In addition, combination of all three superactive loops showed cooperativity in receptor binding and activation resulting in the most potent hTSH superactive analog described to date."

A short core enhancer sequence of 195 base pairs that corresponded with the major hypersensitive site and possessed position- and orientation-independent enhancer activity in K562 cells. In vitro DNase I footprint analysis revealed four protected regions in the core enhancer; two GATA motifs, an Ets-like motif and an unknown motif. The GATA motifs bound GATA-1 and mutagenesis analysis revealed that the proximal one is critical for the enhancing activity. Homology plot analysis using the 5′ sequence of the mouse RHAG gene revealed four homologous stretches and multiple insertions of repetitive sequences among them; four LINE/L1 and four Alu in the human and as well as one LINE/L1 and one LTR/MaLR in the mouse gene. The highly conservative enhancer region was flanked by SINE and LINE/L1 in both species. These results suggest that the 5′-flanking sequence of RHAG gene is a preferable target sequence for retroviral transposition and that the enhancer was inserted in the same manner, resulting in the acquisition of erythroid dominant expression."
