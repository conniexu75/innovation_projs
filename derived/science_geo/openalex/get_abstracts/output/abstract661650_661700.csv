https://openalex.org/W3093094957,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into target cells. ACE2 has been proposed as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Thus, interferon-induced variability in ACE2 expression levels could be important for susceptibility to COVID-19 or its outcomes. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, transcriptionally independent truncated isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. In The Cancer Genome Atlas, the expression of dACE2 was enriched in squamous tumors of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. In vitro, dACE2, which lacks 356 amino-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. Our results suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, an inflammatory tumor microenvironment or viral co-infections is unlikely to increase the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection. dACE2 is a newly identified isoform of ACE2 that is unable to bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Truncated dACE2, but not full-length ACE2, is induced by interferons and viruses, thus suggesting that such conditions are unlikely to increase cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3092764476,"Network neuroscience has relied on a node-centric network model in which cells, populations and regions are linked to one another via anatomical or functional connections. This model cannot account for interactions of edges with one another. In this study, we developed an edge-centric network model that generates constructs ‘edge time series’ and ‘edge functional connectivity’ (eFC). Using network analysis, we show that, at rest, eFC is consistent across datasets and reproducible within the same individual over multiple scan sessions. We demonstrate that clustering eFC yields communities of edges that naturally divide the brain into overlapping clusters, with regions in sensorimotor and attentional networks exhibiting the greatest levels of overlap. We show that eFC is systematically modulated by variation in sensory input. In future work, the edge-centric approach could be useful for identifying novel biomarkers of disease, characterizing individual variation and mapping the architecture of highly resolved neural circuits. The authors present an edge-centric model of brain connectivity. Edge networks are stable across datasets, and their structure can be modulated by sensory input. When clustered, edge networks yield pervasively overlapping functional modules."
https://openalex.org/W3093109984,"Depletion of mitochondrial copper, which shifts metabolism from respiration to glycolysis and reduces energy production, is known to be effective against cancer types that depend on oxidative phosphorylation. However, existing copper chelators are too toxic or ineffective for cancer treatment. Here we develop a safe, mitochondria-targeted, copper-depleting nanoparticle (CDN) and test it against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We show that CDNs decrease oxygen consumption and oxidative phosphorylation, cause a metabolic switch to glycolysis and reduce ATP production in TNBC cells. This energy deficiency, together with compromised mitochondrial membrane potential and elevated oxidative stress, results in apoptosis. CDNs should be less toxic than existing copper chelators because they favorably deprive copper in the mitochondria in cancer cells instead of systemic depletion. Indeed, we demonstrate low toxicity of CDNs in healthy mice. In three mouse models of TNBC, CDN administration inhibits tumor growth and substantially improves survival. The efficacy and safety of CDNs suggest the potential clinical relevance of this approach. Triple-negative breast cancer is inhibited by depleting mitochondrial copper in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3093374260,"The genome folds into a hierarchy of three-dimensional structures within the nucleus. At the sub-megabase scale, chromosomes form topologically associating domains (TADs)1-4. However, how TADs fold in single cells is elusive. Here, we reveal TAD features inaccessible to cell population analysis by using super-resolution microscopy. TAD structures and physical insulation associated with their borders are variable between individual cells, yet chromatin intermingling is enriched within TADs compared to adjacent TADs in most cells. The spatial segregation of TADs is further exacerbated during cell differentiation. Favored interactions within TADs are regulated by cohesin and CTCF through distinct mechanisms: cohesin generates chromatin contacts and intermingling while CTCF prevents inter-TAD contacts. Furthermore, TADs are subdivided into discrete nanodomains, which persist in cells depleted of CTCF or cohesin, whereas disruption of nucleosome contacts alters their structural organization. Altogether, these results provide a physical basis for the folding of individual chromosomes at the nanoscale."
https://openalex.org/W3093210439,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a regulator of several physiological processes. ACE2 has recently been proposed to be interferon (IFN) inducible, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may exploit this phenomenon to enhance viral spread and questioning the efficacy of IFN treatment in coronavirus disease 2019. Using a recent de novo transcript assembly that captured previously unannotated transcripts, we describe a new isoform of ACE2, generated by co-option of intronic retroelements as promoter and alternative exon. The new transcript, termed MIRb-ACE2, exhibits specific expression patterns across the aerodigestive and gastrointestinal tracts and is highly responsive to IFN stimulation. In contrast, canonical ACE2 expression is unresponsive to IFN stimulation. Moreover, the MIRb-ACE2 translation product is a truncated, unstable ACE2 form, lacking domains required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and is therefore unlikely to contribute to or enhance viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W3093107570,"Congenital hydrocephalus (CH), characterized by enlarged brain ventricles, is considered a disease of excessive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation and thereby treated with neurosurgical CSF diversion with high morbidity and failure rates. The poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and persistence of ventriculomegaly in some post-surgical patients highlight our limited knowledge of disease mechanisms. Through whole-exome sequencing of 381 patients (232 trios) with sporadic, neurosurgically treated CH, we found that damaging de novo mutations account for >17% of cases, with five different genes exhibiting a significant de novo mutation burden. In all, rare, damaging mutations with large effect contributed to ~22% of sporadic CH cases. Multiple CH genes are key regulators of neural stem cell biology and converge in human transcriptional networks and cell types pertinent for fetal neuro-gliogenesis. These data implicate genetic disruption of early brain development, not impaired CSF dynamics, as the primary pathomechanism of a significant number of patients with sporadic CH."
https://openalex.org/W3093292900,"Microglia and peripheral macrophages have both been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although their respective roles have yet to be determined. We now show that macrophages along peripheral motor neuron axons in mouse models and patients with ALS react to neurodegeneration. In ALS mice, peripheral myeloid cell infiltration into the spinal cord was limited and depended on disease duration. Targeted gene modulation of the reactive oxygen species pathway in peripheral myeloid cells of ALS mice, using cell replacement, reduced both peripheral macrophage and microglial activation, delayed symptoms and increased survival. Transcriptomics revealed that sciatic nerve macrophages and microglia reacted differently to neurodegeneration, with abrupt temporal changes in macrophages and progressive, unidirectional activation in microglia. Modifying peripheral macrophages suppressed proinflammatory microglial responses, with a shift toward neuronal support. Thus, modifying macrophages at the periphery has the capacity to influence disease progression and may be of therapeutic value for ALS."
https://openalex.org/W3093008185,"The hippocampal CA2 region is essential for social memory. To determine whether CA2 activity encodes social interactions, we recorded extracellularly from CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs) in male mice during social behavior. Although CA2 neuronal firing showed only weak spatial selectivity, it accurately encoded contextual changes and distinguished between a novel and a familiar mouse. In the Df(16)A+/- mouse model of the human 22q11.2 microdeletion, which confers a 30-fold increased risk of schizophrenia, CA2 social coding was impaired, consistent with the social memory deficit observed in these mice; in contrast, spatial coding accuracy was greatly enhanced. CA2 PNs were previously found to be hyperpolarized in Df(16)A+/- mice, likely due to upregulation of TREK-1 K+ current. We found that TREK-1 blockade rescued social memory and CA2 social coding in Df(16)A+/- mice, supporting a crucial role for CA2 in the normal encoding of social stimuli and in social behavioral dysfunction in disease."

https://openalex.org/W3093432916,"RNA–protein interaction networks govern many biological processes but are difficult to examine comprehensively. We devised ribonucleoprotein networks analyzed by mutational profiling (RNP-MaP), a live-cell chemical probing strategy that maps cooperative interactions among multiple proteins bound to single RNA molecules at nucleotide resolution. RNP-MaP uses a hetero-bifunctional crosslinker to freeze interacting proteins in place on RNA and then maps multiple bound proteins on single RNA strands by read-through reverse transcription and DNA sequencing. RNP-MaP revealed that RNase P and RMRP, two sequence-divergent but structurally related non-coding RNAs, share RNP networks and that network hubs define functional sites in these RNAs. RNP-MaP also identified protein interaction networks conserved between mouse and human XIST long non-coding RNAs and defined protein communities whose binding sites colocalize and form networks in functional regions of XIST. RNP-MaP enables discovery and efficient validation of functional protein interaction networks on long RNAs in living cells. Networks of proteins bound to single RNAs are identified by correlated chemical crosslinking."

https://openalex.org/W3093167007,"Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the second largest pulse crop grown worldwide and ascochyta blight caused by Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Labr. is the most devastating disease of the crop in all chickpea growing areas across the continents. The pathogen A. rabiei is highly variable. The resistant sources available are not sufficient and new sources needs to be identified from time to time as resistance breakdown in existing chickpea varieties is very frequent due to fast evolution of new pathotypes of the pathogen. Therefore, this work was undertaken to evaluate the existing chickpea germplasm diversity conserved in Indian National Genebank against the disease under artificial epiphytotic conditions. An artificial standard inoculation procedure was followed for uniform spread of the pathogen. During the last five winter seasons from 2014–15 to 2018–19, a total of 1,970 accessions have been screened against the disease and promising accessions were identified and validated. Screening has resulted in identification of some promising chickpea accessions such as IC275447, IC117744, EC267301, IC248147 and EC220109 which have shown the disease resistance (disease severity score ≤3) in multiple seasons and locations. Promising accessions can serve as the potential donors in chickpea improvement programs. The frequency of resistant and moderately resistant type accessions was comparatively higher in accessions originated from Southwest Asian countries particularly Iran and Syria than the accessions originated from Indian sub-continent. Further large scale screening of chickpea germplasm originated from Southwest Asia may result in identifying new resistant sources for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3092692245,"Objective There has been growing interest in the use of smart wearable technology to promote physical activity (PA) behaviour change. However, little is known concerning PA patterns throughout an intervention or engagement with trackers. The objective of the study was to explore patterns of Fitbit-measured PA and wear-time over 24-weeks and their relationship to changes in Actigraph-derived moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Methods Twenty-nine intervention participants (88%) from the wearable activity technology and action-planning (WATAAP) trial in colorectal and endometrial cancer survivors accepted a Fitbit friend request from the research team to permit monitoring of Fitbit activity. Daily steps and active minutes were recorded for each participant over the 12-week intervention and throughout the follow-up period to 24-weeks. Accelerometer (GT9X) derived MVPA was assessed at end of intervention (12-weeks) and end of follow-up (24-weeks). Results Fitbit wear-time over the 24-weeks of data was remarkably consistent, with median adherence score of 100% for all weeks. During the intervention, participants recorded a median 8006 steps/day. Daily step count was slightly increased through week-13 to week-24 with a median of 8191 steps/day (p = 0.039). Actigraph and Fitbit derived measures were highly correlated but demonstrated poor agreement overall. Fitbit measured activity was closest to MVPA measured using Freedson cut-points as no bias was observed. Conclusions Step count was maintained throughout the trial displaying promise for the effectiveness of smart-wearable interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour beyond the intervention period. Further worthwhile work should compare more advanced smart-wearable technology with accelerometers in order to improve agreement and explore less resource-intensive methods to assess PA that could be scalable."
https://openalex.org/W3093311161,"Correct reconstruction of macromolecular structure by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) relies on accurate determination of the orientation of single-particle images. For small (<100 kDa) DNA-binding proteins, obtaining particle images with sufficiently asymmetric features to correctly guide alignment is challenging. We apply DNA origami to construct molecular goniometers-instruments that precisely orient objects-and use them to dock a DNA-binding protein on a double-helix stage that has user-programmable tilt and rotation angles. We construct goniometers with 14 different stage configurations to orient and visualize the protein just above the cryo-EM grid surface. Each goniometer has a distinct barcode pattern that we use during particle classification to assign angle priors to the bound protein. We use goniometers to obtain a 6.5-A structure of BurrH, an 82-kDa DNA-binding protein whose helical pseudosymmetry prevents accurate image orientation using traditional cryo-EM. Our approach should be adaptable to other DNA-binding proteins as well as small proteins fused to DNA-binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W3093315735,"Background Identifying the functional materials inside vaping devices can help inform efforts to understand risk. While nicotine E-cigarette components and metals have been characterized in several previous studies, the internal component compositions of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cartridge designs are not as well known. The 2019–20 e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) outbreak has been associated with THC devices containing vitamin E acetate (VEA), possibly mediated by chemical reactions with internal cartridge components and high filament temperatures. Methods We investigate the composition and internal components of 2019 EVALI patient-associated THC vaping devices compared to other THC and nicotine devices from 2016–19, specifically the metal, ceramic, and polymer components likely to be exposed to heat. To do this, we have disassembled forty-eight components from eight used and unused vaping devices under a microscope and analyzed them using X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared micro-spectroscopy. Conclusions The two THC cartridges used by EVALI patients exhibited evidence of localized high temperatures, including charring of the ceramic heating elements and damaged wire surfaces. The newer THC cartridges possessed more ceramic and polymer insulation than older THC or nicotine devices. The combination of ceramics, metals, and high temperatures in newer THC cartridges is consistent with conditions hypothesized to produce VEA reactions during vaping. Nickel and chromium components were detected in all devices, and others contained copper, lead, tin, gold, silicon-rich rubbers, or fluorinated microplastics. These components have the potential to thermally degrade and volatilize if heated sufficiently. These findings do not imply that harmful exposures would occur under all usage conditions, and are most relevant to harm reduction efforts based on avoiding higher internal temperatures. This study was limited to a small sample of cartridges obtained from investigations. Future work should test more device types and internal temperatures under controlled usage conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3093059081,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most general liver disease characterized by a continuum of liver abnormalities ranging from simple fatty liver to advanced stage of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathological drivers of NAFLD are complex and largely undefined. It is increasingly identified that the imbalance between renin-angiotensin system and ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction associated with NAFLD. However, no known empirical research has focused on exploring the effect of the regulation of mitochondrial respiration chain activity by Ang-(1-7)/Mas on the prevention of NAFLD. Here, we evaluated the interaction and relevance of hepatic Ang-(1-7)/Mas-axis challenge with glucolipid metabolism and mitochondrial condition in vivo and in vitro. In this context, we found that Mas deletion in mice contributed to the severe glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis which accompanied by elevated levels of serum/ hepatic alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and triglycerides, as well as the mitochondrial dysfunction. Whereas forced upregulation of Mas or Ang-(1-7) administration could significantly attenuate these consequences by downregulating the expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins and enzymes for gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, activation of Ang-(1-7)/Mas arm could improve the IRS-1/Akt/AMPK pathway and enhance the mitochondrial energy utilization. Considered together, it is becoming extremely hopeful to provide a new perspective for Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis for the therapeutics of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3093174760,"Clusterin (CLU) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein involved in a range of biological processes. We investigated the function of CLU as a novel regulator of adipogenesis. CLU expression increased during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. CLU overexpression promoted adipogenic differentiation of preadipocytes and increased the mRNA levels of adipogenic markers including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparg) and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (Cebpa). Conversely, knockdown of CLU attenuated adipogenesis and reduced transcript levels of Pparg and Cebpa. However, the promoter activities of both the Pparg and the Cebpa gene were not affected by alteration of CLU expression on its own. Additionally, the protein level of Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), an upstream transcription factor of Pparg and Cebpa involved in adipogenic differentiation, was upregulated by CLU overexpression, although the mRNA level of Klf5 was not altered by changes in the expression level of CLU. Cycloheximide chase assay showed that the increased level of KLF5 by CLU overexpression was due to decreased degradation of KLF5 protein. Interestingly, CLU increased the stability of KLF5 by decreasing KLF5 ubiquitination. CLU inhibited the interaction between KLF5 and F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets KLF5. The adipogenic role of CLU was also addressed in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Clu-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Furthermore, CLU enhanced KLF5-mediated transcriptional activation of both the Cebpa and the Pparg promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that CLU is a novel regulator of adipocyte differentiation by modulating the protein stability of the adipogenic transcription factor KLF5."

https://openalex.org/W3092821306,"Objective Community health worker (CHW)-led education is an important strategy to increase awareness and access to breast cancer screening in medically-underserved communities. This study aimed to develop a context-specific, culturally-appropriate training intervention for South Florida CHWs to educate Latinx immigrant farmworkers on breast cancer and early detection. Methods A community-based participatory research (CBPR) study, conducted 2017–2019, informed the design of a training curriculum for CHWs and educational dissemination materials. Twenty-two CHWs were trained and knowledge gains were measuring using a one-group pre-and post-test design. Triangulated evaluation consisted of field observations of CHW-client interactions, CHW self-reports, and rapid assessment surveys of community members. Results A community stakeholder-informed breast cancer training curriculum resulted in significant, sustained breast cancer knowledge gains among CHWs when comparing pre-, post-, and 4–6 month post-training follow-up test scores. Field observations of educational material dissemination, CHW self-reported evaluations, and community rapid assessment surveys at three health fairs demonstrated this was an effective strategy to engage female Latinx farmworkers in breast cancer education. Conclusions Community and key stakeholder participation in the development of a breast cancer educational intervention allowed for tailored design priorities around knowledge-based content, comprehensiveness, relevance, appropriateness, and ease of dissemination to community members. This model of participatory CHW training intervention design can enable future train-the-trainer approaches to disseminate and scale-up evidence-based health education interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3092837847,"Mutant KRAS modulates the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells to confer a growth advantage during hypoxia, but the molecular underpinnings are largely unknown. Using a lipidomic screen, we found that PLCγ1 is suppressed during hypoxia in KRAS-mutant human lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines. Suppression of PLCγ1 in hypoxia promotes a less oxidative cancer cell metabolism state, reduces the formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and switches tumour bioenergetics towards glycolysis by impairing Ca2+ entry into the mitochondria. This event prevents lipid peroxidation, antagonizes apoptosis and increases cancer cell proliferation. Accordingly, loss of function of Plcg1 in a mouse model of KrasG12D-driven lung adenocarcinoma increased the expression of glycolytic genes, boosted tumour growth and reduced survival. In patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas, low PLCγ1 expression correlates with increased expression of hypoxia markers and predicts poor patient survival. Thus, our work reveals a mechanism of cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia with potential therapeutic value."

https://openalex.org/W3094127716,"Obesity has been positively associated with upper gastrointestinal cancers, but prospective data by subtype/subsite are limited. Obesity influences hormonal factors, which may play a role in these cancers. We examined anthropometry, body fat and reproductive factors in relation to oesophageal and gastric cancer by subtype/subsite in the UK Biobank cohort.Among 458,713 UK Biobank participants, 339 oesophageal adenocarcinomas, 124 oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 137 gastric cardia and 92 gastric non-cardia cancers were diagnosed during a mean of 6.5 years follow-up. Cox models estimated multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Body mass index (BMI), hip circumference, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, total body fat and trunk fat were positively associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (highest vs lowest category: HR = 2.33, 95%-CI:1.65-3.28; HR = 1.56, 95%-CI:1.15-2.13; HR = 2.30, 95%-CI:1.47-3.57; HR = 1.71, 95%-CI:1.01-2.90; HR = 2.87, 95%-CI:1.88-4.38; HR = 1.96, 95%-CI:1.30-2.96; HR = 2.34, 95%-CI:1.70-3.22, respectively). Although there were no statistically significant associations in combined sex analyses, BMI (HR = 1.83, 95%-CI:1.00-3.37), waist circumference (HR = 2.21, 95%-CI:1.27-3.84) and waist-to-hip ratio (HR = 1.92, 95%-CI:1.11-3.29) were associated with gastric cardia cancer in men; however, mutual adjustment attenuated the associations for BMI and waist-to-hip ratio. For oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, statistically significant inverse associations were observed among women for BMI, hip circumference, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, total body fat and trunk fat, although they were based on small numbers. In addition, older age at first (HR = 0.44, 95%-CI:0.22-0.88) and last live birth (HR = 0.44, 95%-CI:0.22-0.87) were inversely associated with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and having a stillbirth/miscarriage/termination was positively associated (HR = 1.84, 95%-CI:1.10-3.07).Obesity and abdominal obesity specifically may be a risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia cancer in men. Some reproductive factors may be associated with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in women."
https://openalex.org/W3092757825,"MicroRNAs are important coordinators of circadian regulation that mediate the fine-tuning of gene expression. Although many studies have shown the effects of individual miRNAs on the circadian clock, the global functional miRNA-mRNA interaction network involved in the circadian system remains poorly understood. Here, we used CLEAR (Covalent Ligation of Endogenous Argonaute-bound RNAs)-CLIP (Cross-Linking and Immuno-Precipitation) to explore the regulatory functions of miRNAs in the circadian system by comparing the miRNA-mRNA interactions between Drosophila wild-type strain W1118 and a mutant of the key circadian transcriptional regulator Clock (Clkjrk ). This experimental approach unambiguously identified tens of thousands of miRNA-mRNA interactions in both the head and body. The miRNA-mRNA interactome showed dramatic changes in the Clkjrk flies. Particularly, among ~300 miRNA-mRNA circadian relevant interactions, multiple interactions involving core clock genes pdp1, tim, and vri displayed distinct changes as a result of the Clk mutation. Based on the CLEAR-CLIP analysis, we found a novel regulation of the circadian rhythm and sleep by the miR-375-timeless interaction. The results indicated that Clk disruption abolished normal rhythmic expression of miR-375 and the functional regulation occurred in the l-LNv neurons, where miR-375 modulated the circadian rhythm and sleep via targeting timeless. This work provides the first global view of miRNA regulation in the circadian rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W3092998073,"Background Since the scale-up of the HIV “Treat All” recommendation, evidence on its real-world effect on predictors of attrition (either death or lost to follow-up) is lacking. We conducted a retrospective study using Zimbabwe ART program data to assess the association between “Treat All” and, patient-mix, programmatic characteristics, retention and predictors of attrition. Methods We used patient-level data from the electronic patient monitoring system (ePMS) from the nine districts, which piloted the “Treat All” recommendation. We compared patient-mix, programme characteristics, retention and predictors of attrition (lost to follow-up, death or stopping ART) in two cohorts; before (April/May 2016) and after (January/February 2017) “Treat All”. Retention was estimated using survival analysis. Predictors of attrition were determined using a multivariable Cox regression model. Interactions were used to assess the change in predictors of attrition before and after “Treat All”. Results We analysed 3787 patients, 1738 (45.9%) and 2049 (54.1%) started ART before and after “Treat All”, respectively. The proportion of men was higher after “Treat All” (39.4.% vs 36.2%, p = 0.044). Same-day ART initiation was more frequent after “Treat All” (43.2% vs 16.4%; p<0.001) than before. Retention on ART was higher before “Treat All” (p<0.001). Among non-pregnant women and men, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of attrition after compared to before “Treat All” was 1.73 (95%CI: 1.30–2.31). The observed hazard of attrition for women being pregnant at ART initiation decreased by 17% (aHR: 1.73*0.48 = 0.83) after “Treat All”. Being male (vs female; aHR: 1.45; 95%CI: 1.12–1.87) and WHO Stage IV (vs WHO Stage I-III; aHR: 2.89; 95%CI: 1.16–7.11) predicted attrition both before and after “Treat All” implementation. Conclusion Attrition was higher after “Treat All”; being male, WHO Stage 4, and pregnancy predicted attrition in both before and after Treat All. However, pregnancy became a less strong risk factor for attrition after “Treat All” implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3093333751,"Objective Survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains poor. Most patients are diagnosed in late stages. Early diagnosis increases the chance of survival. We used the proximity extension assay from Olink Proteomics to search for new protein biomarkers with the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of CA125 and HE4 in patients with ovarian tumors. Material and methods Plasma samples were obtained from 180 women with ovarian tumors; 30 cases of benign tumor, 28 cases with borderline tumors, 25 early EOC cases (FIGO stage I) and 97 advanced EOC cases (FIGO stages II-IV). Proteins were measured using the Olink® Oncology II and Inflammation panels. For statistical analyses, patients were categorized into benign tumors versus cancer and benign tumors versus borderline + cancer, respectively. Results We analyzed 177 biomarkers. Thirty-four proteins had ROC AUC > 0.7 for discrimination between benign tumors and cancer. Fifteen proteins had ROC AUC > 0.7 for discrimination between benign tumors and borderline tumors + cancer. HE4 ranked highest for both comparisons. A reference model with HE4, CA125 and age (AUC 0.838 for benign tumors vs. cancer and AUC 0.770 for benign tumors vs. borderline tumors + cancer) was compared to the reference model with the addition of each of the remaining proteins with AUC > 0.7. ITGAV was the only individual biomarker found to improve diagnostic performance of the reference model, to AUC 0.874 for benign tumors vs. cancer and AUC 0.818 for benign tumors vs. borderline tumors + cancer (p < 0.05). Cross-validation and LASSO regression was combined to select multiple biomarker combinations. The best performing model for discrimination between benign tumors and borderline tumors + cancer was a 6-biomarker combination (HE4, CA125, ITGAV, CXCL1, CEACAM1, IL-10RB) and age (AUC 0.868, sensitivity 0.86 and specificity 0.82, p = 0.016 for comparison with the reference model). Conclusion HE4 was the best performing individual biomarker for discrimination between benign ovarian tumors and EOC including borderline tumors. The addition of other carcinogenesis-related biomarkers in a multiplex biomarker panel can improve the diagnostic performance of the established biomarkers HE4 and CA125."

Using census, statistical, digital elevation model (DEM) and network data, this paper employs visual analysis to capture population distribution patterns in China’s 131 border counties from 1982 to 2010. Multiple stepwise regression is carried out to identify the influencing factors of population dynamics in border regions. The main findings include: China’s most heavily populated border areas are primarily in the northeast, northwest, and the Guangxi-Yunnan region, while rapid growth of population is found in western Inner Mongolia, southwest Xinjiang, northwest Tibet, and southern Yunnan. Given the increasingly market-oriented migration mechanism, the national reclamation policy has been no longer effective in population attraction in the new century. Education has significantly lowered and will continuously lower the fertility rate in remote border areas. The factors influencing population growth show a remarkable regional heterogeneity along China’s long border."
https://openalex.org/W3093048584,"The extensively employed limited-gene coverage NGS panels lead to clinically inadequate molecular profiling of myeloid neoplasms. The aim of the present investigation was to assess performance and clinical utility of a comprehensive DNA panel for myeloid neoplasms. Sixty-one previously well characterized samples were sequenced using TSO500 library preparation kit on NextSeq550 platform. Variants with a VAF ≥ 5% and a total read depth of >50X were filtered for analysis. The following results were recorded-for clinical samples: clinical sensitivity (97%), specificity (100%), precision (100%) and accuracy (99%) whereas reference control results were 100% for analytical sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy, with high intra- and inter-run reproducibility. The panel identified 880 variants across 292 genes, of which, 749 variants were in genes not covered in the 54 gene panel. The investigation revealed 14 variants in ten genes, and at least one was present in 96.2% patient samples that were pathogenic/ likely pathogenic in myeloid neoplasms. Also, 15 variants in five genes were found to be pathogenic/ likely pathogenic in other tumor types. Further, the TMB and MSI scores ranged from 0–7 and 0–9, respectively. The high analytical performance and clinical utility of this comprehensive NGS panel makes it practical and clinically relevant for adoption in clinical laboratories for routine molecular profiling of myeloid neoplasms."

The identification of macrophages in vivo in the regenerating muscle could be used as a new diagnostic tool to monitor therapeutic strategies for tissue repair. The use of classical immunolabeling techniques is unable to discriminate between different M2 macrophages and a functional characterization of these macrophages is lacking. Using in situ hybridization coupled with hybridization-chain-reaction detection (HCR), we achieved the identification of M2d-like macrophages within regenerating muscle and applied this technique to understand the role of M2 macrophages in the regeneration of irradiated pig-muscle after adipose tissue stem cell treatment. Our work highlights the limits of immunolabeling and the usefulness of HCR analysis to provide valuable information for macrophage characterization."

However, changes in the presence of this disease across years hampers the effective identification of resistant genotypes to this disease. To avoid the limitations of phenotypic selection under natural pressure, this research aimed to devise an effective strategy to screen disease-resistant genotypes in the absence of high and constant natural pressures. To do so, we investigated the presence of antixenosis and antibiosis as components of resistance to the vector Dalbulus maidis as well as resistance to the pathogen Spiroplasma kunkelii under artificial inoculation conditions in four maize hybrids. The hybrids shown differences in their levels of resistance and target organisms, either the insect vector or the pathogen. Antixenosis and antibiosis to D. maidis were observed in DK72-10. Resistance to S. kunkelii by DK79-10 was seen as a delayed onset of symptoms, and DKB390 showed antixenosis to D. maidis and resistance to S. kunkelii. An association between symptom severity and yield reduction was found, but not between accumulation of pathogen S. kunkelii and symptom severity nor yield. In conclusion, the proposed methodology was efficacious and can aid in the screening of resistant genotypes in breeding programs to reduce the impact of Corn Stunt disease, ensuring that hybrids with good resistance level will be planted by farmers whenever disease occurs."
https://openalex.org/W3093013161,"BACKGROUND Globally, diabetes is a major public health burden that results in more than 3.2 million adult deaths per year. Currently, diabetes is increasingly becoming a major threat to global public health, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although previous studies emphasized knowledge and health beliefs about diabetes among patients living with diabetes, there is minimal evidence about knowledge and perception of risk for developing diabetes at the community level. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception of diabetes mellitus and its associated factors among people in Debre Berhan town, northeast Ethiopia. METHODS A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 participants. The study was carried out from 25 February to 10 March 2019. Data were collected using a structured pretested questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. Data were entered into Epi data V 3.1 and exported to SPSS V 24 for analysis. A variable with p< 0.2 in bivariable analysis was entered into multivariable logistic regression. During multivariate analysis, variables with a p value of ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly associated. RESULT A total of 237 (56.02%) participants had good general knowledge about diabetes mellitus. In the multivariable analysis, participants who were single (AOR = 9.08, CI: 1.72-48), had a family history of diabetes (AOR = 2.83; CI: 1.10-7.24), and had exposure to health education (AOR = 3.27; CI: 2.02-5.31) were associated with good knowledge. In this study, few respondents (20.1%) felt that they had a higher risk of developing diabetes. Two-thirds of respondents (62.4%) saw diabetes is a serious disease. On the other hand, approximately 67% agreed to the perceived benefits of screening. CONCLUSION Almost half of the Debre Berhan community was found to have inadequate knowledge of diabetes mellitus. Married, higher educational status, exposure to health education, and family history of diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with good knowledge. The perceived risk of developing diabetes was low at the community level, although many respondents felt that behavior change is important in the prevention of diabetes. Therefore, policy makers, healthcare managers, and healthcare workers need to work cooperatively to foster community knowledge towards diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W3093057641,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive malignancy with limited effectiveness of standard of care therapies including surgery, radiation, and temozolomide chemotherapy necessitating novel therapeutics. Unfortunately, GBMs also harbor several signaling alterations that protect them from traditional therapies that rely on apoptotic programmed cell death. Because almost all GBM tumors have dysregulated phosphoinositide signaling as part of that process, we hypothesized that peptide mimetics derived from the phospholipid binding domain of Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) could serve as a novel GBM therapeutic. Using molecularly classified patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines, cultured in stem-cell conditions, we demonstrate that cell permeable MARCKS effector domain (ED) peptides potently target all GBM molecular classes while sparing normal human astrocytes. Cell death mechanistic testing revealed that these peptides produce rapid cytotoxicity in GBM that overcomes caspase inhibition. Moreover, we identify a GBM-selective cytolytic death mechanism involving plasma membrane targeting and intracellular calcium accumulation. Despite limited relative partitioning to the brain, tail-vein peptide injection revealed tumor targeting in intracranially implanted GBM PDX. These results indicate that MARCKS ED peptide therapeutics may overcome traditional GBM resistance mechanisms, supporting further development of similar agents."
https://openalex.org/W3093345228,"Acute ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries and the most common cause of disability in adults worldwide. Despite advances in the understanding of stroke pathophysiology, therapeutic options remain limited. In this study, we explored the interaction of Shrm4 and the metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABAB ) in ischemic stroke. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was induced by filament insertion in Shrm4+/+ and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, followed by reperfusion for up to 7 days. Baclofen was administered was used to activate GABAB in vivo during reperfusion. Neurological deficits, motor and memory functions, and infarct volume were determined in the various mouse groups. Furthermore, we also developed an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model in primary neurons to test Shrm4/GABAB interactions in vitro. Shrm4 was observed to decrease infarct volume and neuronal cell loss in penumbra, and rescue neurological deficits in MCAO mice. Notably, Shrm4 also increased pole climbing speed, reduced foot faults, and increased escape latency in the Morris water maze test, while reducing neuron autophagy through an interaction with GABAB receptors. GABAB activation using baclofen further reduced OGD-induced neuron damage in culture and stroke outcomes of MCAO, relative to Shrm4 alone. Taken together, Shrm4-mediated GABAB activation confers neuroprotection by reducing neuronal autophagy in acute ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W3092855142,"Invasive Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) infections are increasingly common among neonates and the elderly. Therefore, GBS surveillance for better antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis strategies are needed. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical aspects of invasive infections and the phenotypic and genetic diversity of infectious isolates from Nara, Japan, collected between 2007 and 2016, by using information from hospital records. GBS strains collected from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were evaluated for capsular types, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), antibiotic susceptibility, antibiotics resistance gene, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Forty GBS isolates (10 from children and 30 from adults) were analyzed, and the distribution of molecular serotype and allelic profiles varied between children and adults. We found the rates of early-onset disease in neonates with birth complications to be higher than that of previous reports, indicating that there could be relevance between complications at birth and early-onset disease. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis strategies may need to be reconsidered in patients with birth complications. In adults, the mean age of the patients was 68 years (male: 63%). Primary bacteremia was the most common source of infection. In the neonates, six had early-onset diseases and four had late-onset diseases. The most frequently identified strains were molecular serotype Ia ST23 (40%) and molecular serotype Ib ST10 (20%) in children and molecular serotype Ib ST10 (17%), molecular serotype VI ST1 (13%), and molecular serotype V ST1 (13%) in adults. Levofloxacin-resistant molecular serotype Ib strains and molecular serotypes V and VI ST1 were common causes of GBS infection in adults but were rarely found in children. Furthermore, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in our study showed that specific clone isolates, that tend to have antibiotics resistance were widespread horizontally for a decade. Continuous surveillance and molecular investigation are warranted to identify the transmission route and improve antibiotic treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3092702025,"Bacterial pathogens are often involved in dermatitis in reptiles. Exact identification of reptile-specific but otherwise uncommon bacterial species may be challenging. However, identification is crucial to evaluate the importance of the detected bacterial species.The aim of this study was to assess the number of aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from skin-derived samples of reptiles which were not reliably identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and to determine their identity.Routine bacterial diagnostics were performed on 235 skin samples, and 417 bacterial isolates were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS. The isolates were grouped into categories based on their first score: category I (≥ 2.00), category II (≥ 1.70 and < 2.00), and category III (< 1.70). Isolates from category III were further investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the following criteria were applied: query cover 100%, e-value rounded to 0.0 and sequence identity (%) > 98.00% for genus identification, and > 99.00% for species identification.The majority of bacterial isolates were in category I (85.1%) or category II (8.4%). In category III (6.5%) results achieved at first by MALDI-TOF MS corresponded to the results of the molecular analysis in 8.0% of isolates at the species level and in 24.0% at the genus level. Bacterial isolates classified as category III were heterogenic in genus (e.g. Chryseobacterium, Devriesea, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Uruburuella), and some have only been described in reptiles so far.Most of the aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from reptile skin achieved high scores by MALDI-TOF MS. However, in the majority of category III isolates MALDI-TOF MS results were different from those of the molecular analysis. This strengthens the need to carefully examine low-scored results for plausibility and to be familiar with the occurrence and morphology of relevant reptile-specific bacterial species (e.g. Devriesea agamarum) as well as with the limits of the database used."
https://openalex.org/W3093086069,"Introduction Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a childhood onset muscular dystrophy leading to shortened life expectancy. There are gaps in published DMD care guidelines regarding recently approved DMD medications and alternative steroid dosing regimens. Methods A list of statements about use of currently available therapies for DMD in the United States was developed based on a systematic literature review and expert panel feedback. Panelists’ responses were collected using a modified Delphi approach. Results Among corticosteroid regimens, either deflazacort or prednisone weekend dosing was preferred when payer requirements do not dictate choice. Most patients with exon 51 skip-amenable mutations should be offered eteplirsen, before or with a corticosteroid. Discussion The options available for medical management of the motor symptoms of DMD are expanding rapidly. The choice of medical therapies should balance expected benefit with side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3093332586,"The persistent and highly transmissible Coxiella burnetii is a neglected infection that negatively affects reproductive parameters of livestock. It is also of zoonotic importance and has been reported to cause devastating human infections globally. Domestic ruminants represent the most frequent source of human infection. Data from Nigeria are very few and outdated. There is a significant gap in up-to-date information on the exposure, spatial distribution and risk factors of infection of this important disease. The exposure to C. burnetii was determined using sensitive serological assays in cattle and small ruminants. A total of 538 animals made up of 268 cattle and 270 small ruminants were sampled from three northern Nigerian states. The proportion of cattle sampled that were seropositive from the study locations were: Kwara 14/90 (15.6%; 95% CI: 8.8–24.7); Plateau 10/106 (9.43%; 95% CI: 4.6–16.7) and Borno 4/72 (5.56%; 95% CI: 1.5–13.6) states. Lower seroprevalence was recorded among the small ruminants sampled, with positives recorded from sheep and goat sampled from only Kwara state 6/184 (3.3%; 95% CI: 1.2–7.0); while none of the small ruminants sampled from Plateau were seropositive. The results of the bivariate analysis showed that none of the tested independent variables (village, age group, sex, breed of cattle, presence of ticks, reproductive status, and management system) were statistically significant factors associated with seropositivity of cattle for antibodies to C. burnetii. Stakeholders involved in animal husbandry should be duly educated on proper disposal of birth products as well as bodily fluids in order to reduce environmental contamination, persistence and human infection."

Furthermore, a DDPG algorithm based on hierarchical learning (H-DDPG) is proposed for the hierarchical analysis of images in intelligent system. Aiming at the problem of image classification in intelligent system, through the setting of simulation environment, the application effect of several algorithms in intelligent electronic music system is evaluated. The results show that: M-DDPG algorithm can more accurately complete the operation of related tasks, the reward received by the intelligent system is more than 0.35, and the test results based on eight tasks are more accurate and effective. Even in the case of task error, the algorithm still shows good training results. H-DDPG algorithm has good effect for complex task processing. The accuracy rate of task test corresponding to intelligent system in different scenarios is above 95%, which is better than other conventional algorithms in task test; the self-reinforcement network algorithm can promote the improvement of image classification effect. Several algorithms proposed show excellent performance in image processing of intelligent system, and have great application potential."
https://openalex.org/W3093198774,"Objectives In this study, localization accuracy and sensitivity to acoustic interaural time differences (ITDs) in subjects using cochlear implants with combined electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) were assessed and compared with the results of a normal hearing control group. Methods Eight CI users with EAS (2 bilaterally implanted, 6 unilaterally implanted) and symmetric binaural acoustic hearing and 24 normal hearing subjects participated in the study. The first experiment determined mean localization error (MLE) for different angles of sound incidence between ± 60° (frontal and dorsal presentation). The stimuli were either low-pass, high-pass or broadband noise bursts. In a second experiment, just noticeable differences (JND) of ITDs were measured for pure tones of 125 Hz, 250 Hz and 500 Hz (headphone presentation). Results Experiment 1: MLE of EAS subjects was 8.5°, 14.3° and 14.7°, (low-, high-pass and broadband stimuli respectively). In the control group, MLE was 1.8° (broadband stimuli). In the differentiation between sound incidence from front and back, EAS subjects performed on chance level. Experiment 2: The JND-ITDs were 88.7 μs for 125 Hz, 48.8 μs for 250 Hz and 52.9 μs for 500 Hz (EAS subjects). Compared to the control group, JND-ITD for 125 Hz was on the same level of performance. No statistically significant correlation was found between MLE and JND-ITD in the EAS cohort. Conclusions Near to normal ITD sensitivity in the lower frequency acoustic hearing was demonstrated in a cohort of EAS users. However, in an acoustic localization task, the majority of the subjects did not reached the level of accuracy of normal hearing. Presumably, signal processing time delay differences between devices used on both sides are deteriorating the transfer of precise binaural timing cues."

Most, if not all, anti-biotics in clinical use have been optimized against planktonic phenotypes. In this study, an in vitro assessment was performed to determine the potential efficacy of a first-in-class series of antibiofilm antibiotics and compare outcomes to current clinical standards of care. The agent, CZ-01179, was formulated into a hydrogel and tested against mature biofilms of a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 using two separate methods. In the first method, biofilms were grown on cellulose discs on an agar surface. Topical agents were spread on gauze and placed over the biofilms for 24 h. Biofilms were quantified and imaged with confocal and scanning electron microscopy. In the second method, biofilms were grown on bioabsorbable collagen coupons in a modified CDC biofilm reactor. Coupons were immersed in treatment for 24 h. The first method was limited in its ability to assess efficacy. Efficacy profiles against biofilms grown on collagen were more definitive, with CZ-01179 gel eradicating well-established biofilms to a greater degree compared to clinical standards. In conclusion, CZ-01179 may be a promising topical agent that targets the biofilm phenotype. Pre-clinical work is currently being performed to determine the translatable potential of CZ-01179 gel."
https://openalex.org/W3092975443,"When we reach for an object during a passive whole body rotation, a tangential Coriolis force is generated on the arm. Yet, within a few trials, the brain adapts to this force so it does not disrupt the reach. Is this adaptation governed by a single-rate or dual-rate learning process? Here, guided by state-space modeling, we studied human reach adaptation in a fully-enclosed rotating room. After 90 pre-rotation reaches (baseline), participants were trained to make 240 to-and-fro reaches while the room rotated at 10 rpm (block A), then performed 6 reaches under opposite room rotation (block B), and subsequently made 100 post-rotation reaches (washout). A control group performed the same paradigm, but without the reaches during rotation block B. Single-rate and dual-rate models can be best dissociated if there would be full un-learning of compensation A during block B, but minimal learning of B. From the perspective of a dual-rate model, the un-learning observed in block B would mainly be caused by the faster state, such that the washout reaches would show retention effects of the slower state, called spontaneous recovery. Alternatively, following a single-rate model, the same state would govern the learning in block A and un-learning in block B, such that the washout reaches mimic the baseline reaches. Our results do not provide clear signs of spontaneous recovery in the washout reaches. Model fits further show that a single-rate process outperformed a dual-rate process. We suggest that a single-rate process underlies Coriolis force reach adaptation, perhaps because these forces relate to familiar body dynamics and are assigned to an internal cause."
https://openalex.org/W3094431466,"Robust empirical evidence supports the idea that embryonic and, more generally, intrauterine disruptions induced by the 1918-flu pandemic had long-term consequences on adult health status and other conditions. In this paper we assess the 1918-flu long-term effects not just of in utero exposure but also during infancy and early childhood. A unique set of events that took place in Puerto Rico during 1918-1919 generated conditions of a ""double quasi-natural experiment"". We exploit these conditions to empirically identify effects of exposure to the 1918 flu pandemic and those of the devastation left by an earthquake-tsunami that struck the island in 1918. Because the earthquake-tsunami affected mostly the Western coast of the island whereas early (in utero and postnatal) exposure to the flu was restricted to those born in the interval 1917-1920, we use geographic variation to identify the effects of the quake and timing of birth variation to identify those of the flu. We benefit from availability of information on markers of nutritional status in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 75 and older in 2002. We make two contributions. First, unlike most fetal-origins research that singles out early nutritional status as a determinant of adult health, we hypothesize that the 1918 flu damaged the nutritional status of adult survivors who, at the time of the flu, were in utero or infants. Second, we target markers of nutritional status largely set when the adult survivors were infants and young children. Estimates of effects of the pandemic are quite large mostly among females and those who were exposed to the earthquake-tsunami. Impacts of the flu in areas less affected by the earthquake are smaller but do vary by area flu severity. These findings constitute empirical evidence supporting the conjecture that effects of the 1918 flu and/or the earthquake are associated not just with disruption experienced during the fetal period but also postnatally."
https://openalex.org/W3093018220,"Objective Observational tuberculosis cohort studies are often limited by a lack of long-term data characterizing survival beyond the initial treatment outcome. Though Cox proportional hazards models are often applied to these data, differential risk of long-term survival, dependent on the initial treatment outcome, can lead to violations of model assumptions. We evaluate the performance of two alternate censoring approaches on reducing bias in treatment effect estimates. Design We simulate a typical multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cohort study and use Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relationship of an aggressive treatment regimen with hazard of death. We compare three assumptions regarding censored observations to determine which produces least biased treatment effect estimates: conventional non-informative censoring, an extension of short-term survival informed by literature, and incorporation of predicted long-term vital status. Results The treatment regimen’s protective effect on death is consistently underestimated by the conventional censoring method, up to 7.6%. Models using the two alternative censoring techniques produce treatment effect estimates consistently stronger and less biased than the conventional method, underestimating the treatment effect by less than 2.4% across all scenarios. Conclusions When model assumptions are violated, alternative censoring techniques can more accurately estimate associations between treatment and long-term survival. In multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cohort analyses, this bias reduction may yield more accurate and, larger effect estimates. This bias reduction can be achieved through use of standard statistical procedures with a simple re-coding of the censoring indicator."

https://openalex.org/W3094020135,"Replication is an important tool to promote high quality research and ensure policy makers can rely on studies in making guidelines or funding programs. By ensuring influential studies are replicable we provide assurance that the policies based on these studies are well-founded and the conclusions and recommendations are robust-to different estimation models or different choices. In this paper, we argue that replication is not only useful but necessary to ensure that an author's choice in how to analyse data is not the only factor that determines whether an intervention is effective or not. We also show that while most research is done well and provides robust results, small differences can lead to different interpretations and these differences need to be acknowledged. This special issue highlights 5 such replication studies, which are replications of influential studies on biomedical, social, behavioural and structural interventions for HIV prevention and treatment. We reflect on their findings. Four out of five studies, which conduct push button replication and pure replication, were able to reproduce the results of the original studies with minor differences, mainly due to minor typographical errors or rounding differences. The analysis of the measurement and estimation analyses conducted in these five studies reveals that the original results are not very robust to alternative analytical approaches, especially when these results rely on a small number of observations. In these cases, the original results are weakened. Furthermore, in contrast to the original papers, two of the five included replication studies conducted a theory of change analysis-to explore how or why the interventions work (or do not) not just whether the intervention works or not. These two analyses indicate that the estimated impacts of the interventions are drawn from few mediators. In addition, they demonstrate that, in some cases, a lack of effect may be related to lack of adequate exposure to the intervention rather than inefficacy of the intervention per se. However, overall, the included replication studies show that the results presented in the original papers are trustworthy and robust, especially when based on larger sample sizes. Replication studies can not only verify the results of a study, they can also provide additional insights on the published results, such as how and why an intervention was effective or less effective than expected. They can thus be a tool to inform the research community and/ or policymakers about whether and how interventions could be adopted, which need to be tested further, and which should be discontinued because of their ineffectiveness. Thus, publishing these replication studies in peer-reviewed journals makes the work public and publicized. The work advances knowledge, and publication should be encouraged, as it is for other types of research."
https://openalex.org/W3093067416,"Background While lung cancer patient outcomes are well-recognized to vary as a function of patient sex, there has been insufficient research regarding the relationship between patient sex and EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) response efficacy. The present study therefore sought to identify novel sex-related biomarkers of bevacizumab/erlotinib (BE) responses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods The exon array data in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset were analyzed in order to identify patterns of mRNA and lncRNA expression associated with BE resistance in NSCLC. These differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified via DE Analysis Filtering. These DE mRNAs were then assessed for their potential functional roles via pathway enrichment analyses, with overlapping functions possibly associated with the BE resistance. The mRNAs in these overlapping groups were then assessed for their correlations with patient survival, and lncRNA-mRNA co-expression networks were generated for each patient subset. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was also generated based upon these DE mRNAs. Results In females we identified 172 DE lncRNAs and 1766 DE mRNAs associated with BE responses, while in males we identified 78 DE lncRNAs and 485 DE mRNAs associated with such responses. Based on the overlap between these two datasets, we identified a total of 37 GO functions and 18 pathways associated with BE responses. Co-expression and PPI networks suggested that the key lncRNAs and mRNAs associated with these BE response mechanisms weredifferent in the male and female patients. Conclusions This work is the first to conduct a global profiling of the relationship between lncRNA and mRNA expression patterns, patient sex, and BE responses in individuals suffering from NSCLC. Together these results suggest that the integrative lncRNA-mRNA expression analyses may offer invaluable new therapeutic insights that can guide the tailored treatment of lung cancer in order to ensure optimal BE responses."
