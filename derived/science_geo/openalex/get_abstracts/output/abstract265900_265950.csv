an important event in the life cycle of
a plant. After germination of the seed,
the apical meristem initially produces
only leaves. And then, abruptly, the
bud produces, instead of more leaves,
a new organ, a flower or an inflorescence.
Although flowers, from a morphological
point of view, are considered
shoots with metamorphosized leaves,
their structure and function are quite
different from those of normal shoots
and leaves. The function of the flowers
is, of course, sexual reproduction and
thus maintenance of the species."

The various radiogeochronologic methods described are: total Pb, Pb- alpha , Pb isotopes, K- Ar, Rb-Sr, C/sup 14/, T, He, and the pleochroic halo method. These methods give the ages of rocks and the ages of the rocks give the age of the earth's crust. The age of element formation is also calculated. (T.R.H.)"
