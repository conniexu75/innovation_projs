https://openalex.org/W3099545970,"The viscoplastic deformation (creep) of crystalline materials under constant stress involves the motion of a large number of interacting dislocations. Analytical methods and sophisticated 'dislocation dynamics' simulations have proved very effective in the study of dislocation patterning, and have led to macroscopic constitutive laws of plastic deformation. Yet, a statistical analysis of the dynamics of an assembly of interacting dislocations has not hitherto been performed. Here we report acoustic emission measurements on stressed ice single crystals, the results of which indicate that dislocations move in a scale-free intermittent fashion. This result is confirmed by numerical simulations of a model of interacting dislocations that successfully reproduces the main features of the experiment. We find that dislocations generate a slowly evolving configuration landscape which coexists with rapid collective rearrangements. These rearrangements involve a comparatively small fraction of the dislocations and lead to an intermittent behaviour of the net plastic response. This basic dynamical picture appears to be a generic feature in the deformation of many other materials. Moreover, it should provide a framework for discussing fundamental aspects of plasticity that goes beyond standard mean-field approaches that see plastic deformation as a smooth laminar flow."

For many cell surface receptors, cross-linking by multivalent ligands or antibodies induces their lateral segregation within the plasma membrane and co-localization into “caps” on one pole of the cell. In this study, we show that capping of Fas is essential for optimal function and that capping is ceramide-dependent. In Jurkat T lymphocytes and in primary cultures of hepatocytes, ceramide elevation was detected as early as 15–30 s and peaked at 1 min after CH-11 and Jo2 anti-Fas antibody treatment, respectively. Capping was detected 30 s after Fas ligation, peaked at 2 min, and was maintained at a lower level for as long as 30 min in both cell types. Ceramide generation appeared essential for capping. Acid sphingomyelinase− /− hepatocytes were defective in Jo2-induced ceramide generation, capping, and apoptosis, and nanomolar concentrations of C16-ceramide restored these events. To further explore the role of ceramide in capping of Fas, we employed FLAG-tagged soluble Fas ligand (sFasL), which binds trimerized Fas but is unable to induce capping or apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Cross-linking of sFasL with M2 anti-FLAG antibody induced both events. Pretreatment of cells with natural C16-ceramide bypassed the necessity for forced antibody cross-linking and enabled sFasL to cap and kill. The presence of intact sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains may be essential for Fas capping since their disruption with cholesterol-depleting agents abrogated capping and prevented apoptosis. These data suggest that capping is a ceramide-dependent event required for optimal Fas signaling in some cells.

Fas-associated death domain protein terminal dUTP nick-end labeling soluble Fas ligand glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomain acid sphingomyelinase fluorescein isothiocyanate Hepes-buffered saline The current model of Fas (CD95 or APO-1) signaling suggests that engagement of Fas by its ligand or anti-Fas antibody leads to receptor trimerization and recruitment of the cytoplasmic adapter protein FADD1 (MORT-1) and pro-caspase 8 (Flice/MACH-1), (1Krammer P.H. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 102–103: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar), thus forming a death-inducing signaling complex. Assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex results in release of active caspase 8, initiating the apoptotic process (1Krammer P.H. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 102–103: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). Peter and co-workers (2Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar) provide evidence that after caspase 8 activation, Fas signals apoptosis via two different mechanisms. In Type I cells, caspase 8 directly activates a hierarchical cascade of effector caspases, involving among others caspases 3 and 7. Apoptosis in Type II cells occurs after minimal caspase 8 activation and proceeds through an amplification cascade involving mitochondrial dysfunction, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and activation of Apaf-1 and caspase 9. Commitment to apoptosis ensues subsequently via effector caspase activation.Whereas this model is widely accepted, recent data are incompatible with portions of this paradigm. Siegel et al. (3Siegel R.M. Frederiksen J.K. Zacharias D.A. Chan F.K. Johnson M. Lynch D. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2354-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) reported recently that Fas may already exist in a trimerized state before ligand interaction and that preassembly may be required for binding Fas ligand and triggering cell death. Homotrimer generation in the absence of ligand is mediated by the pre-ligand assembly domain located within the extracellular amino-terminal region of the receptor. It was further suggested that Fas ligand may orchestrate the multimerization of trimerized receptors, generating aggregates of activated receptors, thus producing high local concentration of Fas death domain complexes (4Golstein P. Science. 2000; 288: 2328-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with this paradigm, FLAG-tagged soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) that retained the capacity to interact with Fas failed to induce apoptosis unless it was cross-linked with anti-FLAG antibody, apparently forming a super-aggregated state required for Fas signaling (5Schneider P.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 1643-1651PubMed Google Scholar). In several of these systems, patches of aggregated receptors were found to migrate toward one pole of the cell and coalesce to form a cap via an energy-dependent process involving cytoskeleton reorganization (7Bourguignon L.Y. Bourguignon G.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1984; 87: 195-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Graziadei L. Riabowol K. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1990; 347: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Such ligand-induced capping appears to facilitate transduction of extracellular signals by local assembly of the various signaling elements. For example, Huang et al.(12Huang J. Sugie K. La Face D.M. Altman A. Grey H.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) show activation of the T-cell receptor-induced co-capping of numerous proteins required for efficient signal transmission (CD4, Rac-1, F-actin, LFA-1 CD28, PKCθ), whereas T-cell receptor antagonists generated caps deficient in CD28 and PKCθ. These and other studies support the notion that the assembly of molecules in caps is specific for ligand/receptor combinations and appears critical for delivery of their signals. There is emerging evidence for a role of capping in Fas signaling of apoptosis. Belka et al. (13Belka C. Marini P. Budach W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lang F. Gulbins E. Bamberg M. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) report that Fas ligand induced Fas capping and apoptosis in IL-2-treated and irradiated peripheral blood lymphocytes, whereas von Reyher et al. (14von Reyher U. Strater J. Kittstein W. Gschwendt M. Krammer P.H. Moller P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 526-534PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate defective Fas capping and apoptosis in colon carcinoma cell lines.Indirect evidence suggests that membrane structures known as glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs), or membrane rafts, may be associated with cap assembly. Rafts are organized membrane formations composed of glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and specific membrane proteins (15Simons K. Ikonen E.

When caveolin-1 is integrated into rafts, they form plasma membrane invaginations known as caveolae that are implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including membrane sorting in polarized cells (17Brown D.A.

It has been suggested that these specialized lipid microdomains provide a milieu for spatial segregation of specific sets of proteins and enhance the efficacy and specificity of interactions between enzymes involved in signal transduction. Disruption of GEMs resulting from cholesterol depletion abrogated signaling through this compartment in a variety of distinct cell types (28Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion also abrogated capping of immunoglobulins and the Fcγ receptor on the surface of lymphocytes (29Hoover R.L. Dawidowicz E.A. Robinson J.M. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Drzewiecka A. Kwiatkowska K. Sobota A. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One study reports that cholesterol depletion of U937 cells abrogated TNF- but not Fas-induced apoptosis (31Ko Y.G. Lee J.S. Kang Y.S. Ahn J.H. Seo J.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7217-7223PubMed Google Scholar). Other Fas-stimulated cell systems have, however, not been explored as yet.Another unresolved issue that challenges the classical model of Fas signaling relates to the role of the sphingolipid ceramide in the apoptotic response. There are numerous reports of ceramide elevation upon Fas activation (32Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Grassmé H. Weller M. Koppenhoefer U. Dichgans J. Sandhoff K. Lang F. Gulbins E.

Recent investigations provided evidence that Fas-induced ceramide generation is initiator caspase-dependent and occurs before commitment to the effector phase of the apoptotic process (38Grullich C. Sullards M.C. Fuks Z. Merrill Jr., A.H. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8650-8656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In these studies, the amount of FADD or pro-caspase 8 transfected into HeLa or 293T cells was titrated down to the point where they no longer induced apoptosis. Under these conditions, FADD and pro-caspase 8 still induced maximal ceramide generation that was blocked by the initiator caspase inhibitor crmA.Whether ceramide generated in response to Fas ligation is involved in the apoptotic process or whether it represents an epi-phenomenon has been a matter of ongoing debate. Testi and co-workers (39De Maria R. Rippo M.R. Schuchman E.H. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) claim that Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from Niemann-Pick disease patients, which have an inherited a deficiency of ASMase activity, displayed deficits in Fas-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis, whereas Borst and co-workers find no differences (40Cock J.G.

Recently, we provided definitive evidence for the role of ceramide in Fas-mediated apoptosis (35Paris F. Grassmé H. Cremesti A. Zager J. Fong Y. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8297-8305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 41Kirschnek S. Paris F. Weller M. Grassmé H. Ferlinz K. Riehle A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27316-27323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes fromasmase − /− mice failed to manifest rapid ceramide elevation in response to Jo2 anti-Fas antibody and were 1 log unit more resistant to Jo2-mediated apoptotic death than paired asmase +/+ hepatocytes. The addition of low nanomolar quantities of natural C16-ceramide toasmase − /− hepatocytes had no direct effect on apoptosis, yet completely restored Fas sensitivity. Other sphingolipids could not substitute for natural ceramide and restore Fas sensitivity. The ability of ceramide to reverse the Fas resistance phenotype of asmase − /−cells without affecting the genotype provides evidence that ceramide is obligate for at least one form of Fas-induced apoptosis. The mechanism of ceramide regulation of Fas-induced apoptosis remains, however, unknown.In the present studies, we show that ceramide, generated in response to Fas engagement, mediates apoptosis via facilitating Fas clustering and cap formation. Jurkat T lymphocytes and primary cultures of hepatocytes responded to CH-11 or Jo2 anti-Fas antibody, respectively, with ceramide elevation, capping, and apoptosis.asmase −/− hepatocytes were defective in these responses, but nanomolar concentrations of natural C16-ceramide restored capping and apoptosis. sFasL failed to induce capping or apoptosis in Jurkat cells, but cross-linking of sFasL with M2 anti-FLAG antibody restored both responses. Pretreatment with C16-ceramide bypassed the necessity for forced M2 antibody cross-linking and enabled sFasL to cap and induce apoptosis. Integrity of sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains may be necessary for the Fas response, since their disruption with cholesterol-depleting agents abrogated capping and prevented apoptosis. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the involvement of ceramide in one form of Fas-induced apoptosis.DISCUSSIONThe present studies provide mechanistic information regarding the role of ceramide in Fas signaling. Ceramide is generated via ASMase within seconds of Fas ligation, preceding Fas patching and capping in Jurkat cells and primary cultures of hepatocytes. The ED50values for ceramide generation, capping, and apoptosis correlated closely within each cell population. Genetic evidence supports a role for ceramide in the clustering process, asasmase −/− hepatocytes manifest a log defect in capping. That ceramide is obligate for capping inasmase −/− hepatocytes is evidenced by the restoration of Fas capping by nanomolar amounts of natural ceramide. Further evidence that ceramide-mediated capping may be necessary for optimal Fas-induced apoptosis is derived from studies using cholesterol-depleting agents, which reduce cholesterol availability, disrupt sphingolipid microdomains (28Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and in the present studies, prevent capping and apoptosis.

For somein vivo events, however, ASMase appears indispensible for Fas-FasL-mediated apoptosis. In particular, for PHA-induced hepatitis (41Kirschnek S. Paris F. Weller M. Grassmé H. Ferlinz K.

Kolesnick, unpublished observation. events which model pathophysiology, increasing the inductive signal does not restore Fas responsiveness in asmase −/− mice. Furthermore, it is unknown whether cells that signal Fas-mediated apoptosis independent of ASMase-generated ceramide, such as thymocytes or the B cell clone responsible for the lpr phenotype, still cap Fas. In this regard, there are other mechanisms for ceramide generation such as stimulation of neutral sphingomyelinase or de novosynthesis which might be available for capping.Recent biophysical studies of ceramide in model membranes provide insight into the properties that may enable ceramide to confer capping. In resting cells, the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which contains most cellular sphingomyelin, displays low fluidity. This is an intrinsic property of sphingomyelin and may be enhanced by sphingomyelin-mediated trapping and packing of cholesterol within the bilayer (54Patra S.K. Alonso A. Alonso J.L.R. Goni F.M. J. Liposome Res. 1999; 9: 263-270Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, sphingomyelin hydrolysis, which releases cholesterol from the membrane (55Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31621-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 56Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 879-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would serve to increase membrane fluidity, increasing lateral mobility of membrane constituents. Perhaps more critical to the capacity to elicit capping is the generation of ceramide. A number of groups have now identified specific properties of ceramide in model membrane systems devoid of protein (57Kolesnick R.N. Goni F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In particular, ceramide has the propensity to spontaneously self-associate into microdomains, as detected by a variety of physical techniques including 2H NMR (58Huang H. Goldberg E.M. Zidovetski R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 27: 361-366Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the combination of differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy (59Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L. Goni F.M. Alonso A.

If these properties are also operative in biologic membranes, locally generated ceramide might re-organize into lipid patches capable of fusing into larger platforms (29Hoover R.L. Dawidowicz E.A. Robinson J.M. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The interaction of Fas with these structures might generate a high local concentration of Fas and its intracellular effectors. Consistent with this paradigm, a recently developed anti-ceramide antibody detected high ceramide levels within Fas caps by confocal microscopy. 4E. Gulbins, submitted for publication. An unanswered question is, How does this system initiate? Previous studies demonstrated that Fas-mediated ASMase activation is initiator caspase-dependent (38Grullich C. Sullards M.C. Fuks Z. Merrill Jr., A.H. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8650-8656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although ASMase does not appear to be a direct caspase target. Whether trimerized Fas or minimally oligomerized Fas initiates ASMase activation and ceramide generation is presently unknown. However, the studies by Grullichet al. (38Grullich C. Sullards M.C. Fuks Z. Merrill Jr., A.H. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8650-8656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggest that weak Fas signals, which may not be sufficient to induce apoptosis, may nonetheless be sufficient to initiate ceramide generation. Although unliganded receptor does not cap upon C16-ceramide addition, capping occurred with a combination of exogenous ceramide and sFasL, indicating that receptor ligation confers interaction with GEMs but not death-inducing signaling complex formation. Similar results have been obtained with ceramide and the unactive DX2 anti-Fas antibody in Jurkat cells.4Regarding the mechanism of Fas capping, our recent studies show that cysteine 149 within the membrane proximal third CRD of Fas is necessary for Fas to concentrate in ceramide caps.2 Perhaps a conformational change that likely occurs when Fas, as with TRAIL (61Hymowitz S.G.

Cell. 1999; 4: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), binds its ligand, might approximate CRD3 to the membrane such that it can more effectively interact with ceramide-enriched rafts at the outer membrane. Once liganded receptor concentrates within a cap, it is fully capable of activating the death-inducing signaling complex.4 Thus receptor capping may provide the milieu for oligomerization of FADD and caspase 8, which appears sufficient, independent of the Fas altogether (62Martin D.A.

Although additional studies are necessary to more completely understand these events, it appears that this may be a general phenomenon for tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members as capping of and signaling through DR3 and CD40 are also attenuated by ASMase deletion or disruption of sphingolipid microdomains. 5E. Gulbins, unpublished observation. The current model of Fas (CD95 or APO-1) signaling suggests that engagement of Fas by its ligand or anti-Fas antibody leads to receptor trimerization and recruitment of the cytoplasmic adapter protein FADD1 (MORT-1) and pro-caspase 8 (Flice/MACH-1), (1Krammer P.H.

We cloned a KChIP2 splice variant (KChIP2.2) from human ventricle. In comparison with KChIP2.1, coexpression of KChIP2.2 with human Kv4 channels in mammalian cells slowed the onset of Kv4 current inactivation (2–3-fold), accelerated the recovery from inactivation (5–7-fold), and shifted Kv4 steady-state inactivation curves by 8–29 mV to more positive potentials. The features of Kv4.2/KChIP2.2 currents closely resemble those of cardiac rapidly inactivating transient outward currents. KChIP2.2 stimulated the Kv4 current density in Chinese hamster ovary cells by ∼55-fold. This correlated with a redistribution of immunoreactivity from perinuclear areas to the plasma membrane. Increased Kv4 cell-surface expression and current density were also obtained in the absence of KChIP2.2 when the highly conserved proximal Kv4 N terminus was deleted. The same domain is required for association of KChIP2.2 with Kv4 α-subunits. We propose that an efficient transport of Kv4 channels to the cell surface depends on KChIP binding to the Kv4 N-terminal domain. Our data suggest that the binding is necessary, but not sufficient, for the functional activity of KChIPs.

Kv4 channel subunits have been localized immunocytochemically to somatodendritic areas in rat brain neurons (7Sheng M. Tsaur M.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1992; 9: 271-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The high abundance of neuronal Kv4 channels in neuronal soma and dendrites suggests that Kv4 channels play an important role in postsynaptic signal integration. In fact, Kv4 channel activity may prevent action potential back-propagation into dendrites, thereby controlling potentiation of dendritic excitability (8Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and acting as “dendritic shock-absorbers” (9Yuste R. Nature. 1997; 387: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Conversely, inactivation of Kv4 channels below the action potential firing threshold leads to increased postsynaptic neuronal excitability (10Schoppa N.E. Westbrook G.L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Magee J.C. Johnston D. Science. 1997; 275: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Recently, small Ca2+-binding and Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs)1 were discovered (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). They are encoded in three different genes (KChIP1, KChIP2, and KChIP3) (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) and are members of the recoverin superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins (12Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem.

KChIPs are associated with Kv4 channels as shown by immunocytochemical colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation studies (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Since KChIPs are prominently expressed in brain, neuronal Kv4 channels most likely contain KChIPs as an integral subunit component. Kv4 channels are also expressed in cardiac tissue, where they mediateIto. This current contributes to the early phase of cardiac action potential repolarization (14Barry D.M. Xu H. Schuessler R.B. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that, like neuronal Kv4 channels, cardiac Kv4 channels might be associated with KChIPs. Accordingly, we searched human cardiac mRNA for KChIP mRNA. In this work, we report the cloning of a human cardiac KChIP cDNA, KChIP2.2, which represents a splice variant of KChIP2.1. 2We have adopted for KChIP2 splice variants the nomenclature used for other Kv channel subunits. Accordingly, we refer to the published KChIP2 (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) as KChIP2.1 and to the new splice variant as KChIP2.2. 2We have adopted for KChIP2 splice variants the nomenclature used for other Kv channel subunits. Accordingly, we refer to the published KChIP2 (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) as KChIP2.1 and to the new splice variant as KChIP2.2.Like KChIP2.1 (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), the coexpression of KChIP2.2 with Kv4 channels in transiently transfected tissue culture cells alters their voltage gating and inactivation properties and leads to an up to 100-fold increase in Kv4 channel cell-surface expression. The modulatory effects of KChIP2.2 are due to a direct interaction of KChIP2.2 with a distinct N-terminal domain of Kv4 α-subunits, which was identified by a combination of biochemical experiments and electrophysiological examinations of Kv4α mutants coexpressed with KChIP2.2. The KChIP-binding domain is highly conserved among Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 subunit sequences (15Isbrandt D. Leicher T. Waldschütz R. Zhu X.-R. Luhmann U. Michel U. Sauter K. Pongs O. Genomics. 2000; 64: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Deletion of the KChIP-binding domain in Kv4 channels led to an increase in Kv4 current density comparable to that seen after coexpression of Kv4 with KChIP2.2. Our results are consistent with the observation that the Kv4 N-terminal domain and its interaction with KChIP2.2 are critical determinants of Kv4 channel trafficking to the cellular plasma membrane. A DNA fragment encoding an N-terminal splice variant of human KChIP2 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF199598) was amplified by standard reverse transcription- PCR protocols from total RNA of human ventricle (see below) using primers CGCGGATCCACCATGCGGGGCCAGGGCCGCAAG (sense) and ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAGATGACATTGTCAAAGAGC (antisense), which contained BamHI and NotI restriction sites, respectively, at their 5′-ends. In addition, the sense primer contained a Kozak site (16Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar) preceding the start codon. A single PCR product was obtained. After digestion with BamHI and NotI, it was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Sequencing revealed that the subcloned PCR fragment differed from the published KChIP2 sequence and represents a splice variant, which we named KChIP2.2 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF347114). A neuronal splice variant of KChIP2, KChIP2.1, which corresponds to the published KChIP2 sequence (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), was cloned from the total RNA of human cerebral cortex as described above. In this study, we used the human Kv4.1 and Kv4.2 α-subunits and the shorter splice variant of the human Kv4.3 α-subunit (15Isbrandt D. Leicher T. Waldschütz R. Zhu X.-R. Luhmann U. Michel U. Sauter K. Pongs O. Genomics. 2000; 64: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition to their wild-type forms, mutant channel constructs with 39-amino acid (Kv4.3Δ2–39) and 40-amino acid (Kv4.1Δ2–40) N-terminal deletions were created for functional expression studies, similar to Kv4.2Δ2–40 (17Zhu X.-R. Wulf A. Schwarz M. Isbrandt D. Pongs O. Recept. Channels. 1999; 6: 387-400PubMed Google Scholar). Further truncation (Kv4.2Δ2–52) (17Zhu X.-R. Wulf A. Schwarz M. Isbrandt D. Pongs O. Recept. Channels. 1999; 6: 387-400PubMed Google Scholar) yielded no functional expression. Kv4.2 mutants with shorter N-terminal deletions (Kv4.2Δ2–32, Kv4.2Δ2–20, and Kv4.2Δ2–10) were constructed using standard PCR techniques. Amino-terminal primers carried a Kozak site followed by a translation initiation codon carboxyl-terminal primers carried a termination codon. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cDNAs encoding the amino terminus of Kv4.2 (amino acids 1–180) and the deletion constructs of this Kv4.2 amino-terminal peptide, Kv4.2-NTΔ2–10 (amino acids 11–180) and Kv4.2-NTΔ2–20 (amino acids 21–180), were constructed similarly. The C termini of Kv4.2 and Kv4.2Δ2–40 subunits were tagged with a HA tag, and that of KChIP2.2 was tagged with a Myc tag using PCR-based standard procedures. All constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. 35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized from the respective cDNAs (tagged KChIP2.2 and amino termini of Kv4.2 were cotranslated) by in vitro translation in the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Aliquots of the translation reaction were diluted 20-fold into immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% bovine hemoglobin) in precoated reaction tubes (immunoprecipitation buffer with 1% bovine hemoglobin). Polypeptides were immunoprecipitated by addition of anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min at room temperature. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in immunoprecipitation buffer, followed by wash buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9) and 150 mm NaCl). To test the Ca2+ dependence of KChIP2.2 binding to the Kv4.2 N terminus, the buffers contained either 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer for analysis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. CHO dihydrofolate reductase-negative cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were seeded on coverslips in a 24-multiwell plate 1 day before transfection, which was performed using 3.5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and 2 μg of pcDNA3-Kv4.2 or pcDNA3-Kv4.2Δ2–40 plasmid DNA. For cotransfection experiments, 0.2 μg of Kv4.2 and 1 μg of KChIP2.2 plasmid DNA were used. The day following transfection, cells were fixed on coverslips with 2% paraformaldehyde. After a blocking incubation (1 h at 37 °C with 3% goat serum and 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline), immunostaining was done with the affinity-purified anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (1:100 dilution) and the polyclonal anti-HA tag antibody (1:250 dilution; Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Secondary reagents for immunofluorescence staining were a Cy2-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution; AP Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) and a Cy3-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution; Mo Bi Tec, Göttingen, Germany). Confocal images were obtained in sequential scan mode using a Leica TCS NT laser scanning microscope. Recombinant Kv4α cDNA, either alone or in combination with KChIP2.2 cDNA, was transiently expressed after LipofectAMINE transfection of CHO or human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells plated on poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml)-coated 35-mm plastic dishes at densities between 1 and 1.5 × 104 cells/dish. For CHO cells, we used 0.1 μg of Kv4α and 1 μg of KChIP2.2 cDNA per dish. Since the expression of Kv4 channels was very low in CHO cells, this expression system was suitable only for studying the stimulatory effect of KChIP2.2 on Kv4 current densities. However, for a reliable analysis of the KChIP2.2 effect on Kv4 gating parameters, reasonably sized Kv4 current amplitudes (I ≥ 1 nA at +60 mV) are essential. These were obtained in HEK 293 cells when we used either 1 μg of Kv4α cDNA alone or 0.1 μg of Kv4α in combination with 1 μg of KChIP2.2 cDNA. In all cases, 0.5 μg of enhanced green fluorescent protein cDNA (CLONTECH) was used to identify cells for electrophysiological recordings 12 h after transfection. During experiments, the cells were constantly superfused with an extracellular solution containing 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 , 5 mm HEPES , 10 mm sucrose, and 0.01 mg/ml phenol red (pH 7.4) (NaOH). All recordings were performed in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique at room temperature. Recording pipettes, pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries using a DMZ puller (Zeitz, Augsburg, Germany), had bath resistances of between 2.5 and 3 megaohm when filled with an intracellular solution containing 125 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmK2ATP, and 2 mm glutathione (pH 7.2) (KOH). Currents were recorded with an EPC9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), and the program package PULSE + PULSEFIT (HEKA) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Series resistance compensation was maximal (usually between 80 and 90%). Whole-cell configurations with series resistance values above 6 were not used for recordings. Activation and inactivation kinetics of Kv4-mediated currents were fitted simultaneously with Hodgkin-Huxley-related formalism (PULSE-FIT) as described previously (18Roeper J. Lorra C. Pongs O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3379-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With this fitting procedure, the Kv4 current inactivation time course was approximated by two time constants, τ1 and τ2. The voltage dependences of steady-state activation and inactivation were fitted with a Boltzmann function of the form G/Gmax=1/1+expVm−V3/2/k where V1/2 is the potential for half-maximal activation (V1/2,act) or inactivation V1/2 is the potential for half-maximal activation (V1/2,inact), and the steepness of the voltage dependence is defined by the slope factor k. The kinetics of the recovery from inactivation were fitted with a single exponential function. Pooled data are given as means ± S.E., and statistic analysis was done with GraphPAD InStat using unpairedt tests with Welch correction for unequal S.D. values when necessary. We used total RNA from human ventricle as a template to amplify cardiac KChIP cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR with primers deduced from the published KChIP2.1 sequence (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We obtained an alternative human cardiac KChIP2 cDNA sequence (KChIP2.2). Alignment of the KChIP2.1 cDNA sequences with the GenBankTM/EBI htgs Data Bank identified a contig harboring the KChIP2 gene (accession numberAC010789) and revealed that KChIP2.2 is a KChIP2 splice variant lacking the second exon in the KChIP2.1 open reading frame (data not shown). As a consequence, the KChIP2.2 open reading frame was shorter, and a stretch of 32 amino acid residues in the N terminus was absent (Fig.1). The derived KChIP2.2 protein sequence was shorter, lacking KChIP2.1 amino acid residues 25–67. For functional characterization, KChIP2.2 cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Currents mediated by Kv4.2 channels in transiently transfected CHO cells were activated with standard voltage-jump protocols. In agreement with previous data (2Baldwin T.J. Tsaur M.L. Lopez G.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1991; 7: 471-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Pak M.D. Baker K.

Channels. 1999; 6: 387-400PubMed Google Scholar), Kv4.2 channels mediated typical A-type potassium currents (Fig.2, A and B). Current densities (pA/pF) were estimated from the peak amplitudes of Kv4.2 currents that were recorded from each cell. The average Kv4.2 current density was very low (38 ± 9 pA/pF, n = 6) (Fig. 2 C). In the presence of KChIP2.2, however, the Kv4.2 current densities were dramatically increased (2045 ± 207 pA/pF, n = 10) (Fig. 2, B and C). This represents a 55-fold stimulation, in comparison with a 9-fold increase in current density previously reported for coexpression of rat Kv4.2 with KChIP2.1 in CHO cells (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The effects of KChIP2.2 on biophysical Kv4.2 channel properties were investigated in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. Coexpression of KChIP2.2 with Kv4.2 channels mainly affected the inactivation characteristics of Kv4.2 currents (Fig. 3, A–D; and Table I). The activation time constants at +40 mV showed only a small difference (Kv4.2 alone: τact = 0.72 ± 0.06, n = 7; Kv4.2 + KChIP2.2: τact = 1.08 ± 0.06, n = 10). By contrast, the inactivation time course was markedly slowed (Fig. 3 A). The value for τ1, the predominant component of Kv4.2 channel inactivation with a weighted amplitude of 91.1 ± 0.6% (n = 12), was increased ∼3-fold (Kv4.2 alone: τ1 = 17.5 ± 1.4, n = 22; Kv4.2 + KChIP2.2: τ1 = 53.5 ± 3.5,n = 10). τ2, which represents a minor component in Kv4.2 channel inactivation, was not significantly affected by KChIP2.2 (Table I). Like KChIP2.1 (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), KChIP2.2 accelerated at −80 mV the recovery of Kv4.2 channels from inactivation (Fig.3 B). The recovery time constants were τrec = 285 ± 21 ms (n = 4) for Kv4.2 alone and τrec = 46 ± 7 ms (n = 9) for Kv4.2 + KChIP2.2. Furthermore, the presence of KChIP2.2 shifted to more depolarized potentials both the midpoint for Kv4.2 of voltage activation (Kv4.2 alone: V1/2,act=−1.2±2.2mV,n=8;Kv4.2+KChIP2.2:V1/2,act=+7.7±2.7mV,n=4) (Fig. 3, C and D; and Table I) and the midpoint for the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation (Kv4.2 alone: Kv4.2alone:V1/2,inact=−57.4±1.4mV,n=6;Kv4.2+KChIP2.2:V1/2,inact=−41.5±2.1mV,n=4 (Fig. 3, C and D; and Table I). The overlap between the voltage activation and the steady-state inactivation curves defines a “conductance window,”i.e. the narrow region of negative potentials in which Kv4.2 channels conduct in the steady state (Fig. 3 D). In the presence of KChIP2.2, the Kv4.2 conductance window was enlarged, and the point of maximal Kv4.2 channel availability was shifted by ∼15 mV to more positive membrane potentials (Fig. 3 D). In summary, the coexpression of KChIP2.2 with Kv4.2 increased Kv4.2 current density, slowed the inactivation time course of Kv4.2 currents, accelerated the recovery of Kv4.2 channels from inactivation, and increased the voltage range where Kv4.2 channels can be activated under steady-state conditions.Table IGating parameters for wild-type Kv4.2 and N-terminal deletion mutant Kv4.2Δ2–40 alone and coexpressed with KChIP2.2 in HEK 293 cellsWT-Kv4.2WT-Kv4.2 + KChIP2.2Kv4.2Δ2–40Kv4.2Δ2–40 + KChIP2.2τact (+40) (ms)0.72 ± 0.06 (n = 7)1.08 ± 0.06 (n = 10)0.77 ± 0.09 (n = 6)0.94 ± 0.06 (n = 18)τ1,inact (+40) (ms)17.5 ± 1.4 (n = 22)53.3 ± 3.5 (n = 10)1-aSignificantly different from control with p < 0.0001.62.3 ± 3.4 (n = 18)75.8 ± 4.1 (n = 18)τ2,inact (+40) (ms)232 ± 17 (n = 22)238 ± 24 (n = 10)211 ± 11 (n = 18)232 ± 13 (n = 18)% τ1,inact91.1 ± 0.6 (n = 22)89.3 ± 0.6 (n = 10)67.6 ± 2.8 (n = 18)67.4 ± 2.9 (n = 18)τrec (ms)285 ± 21 (n = 4)46 ± 7 (n = 9)1-bSignificantly different from control with p < 0.04.260 ± 80 (n = 3)234 ± 19 (n = 10)V1/2,inact (mV)−57.4 ± 1.4 (n = 6)−41.5 ± 2.1 (n = 7)1-aSignificantly different from control with p < 0.0001.−54.5 ± 2.2 (n = 5)−61.9 ± 2.1 (n = 5)kinact (mV)5.0 ± 0.3 (n = 6)4.5 ± 0.3 (n = 7)5.3 ± 0.7 (n = 5)5.3 ± 0.3 (n = 5)V1/2,act (mV)−1.2 ± 2.2 (n = 8)+7.7 ± 2.7 (n = 4)1-bSignificantly different from control with p < 0.04.−3.3 ± 3.0 (n = 6)−2.9 ± 2.0 (n = 7)kact (mV)16.2 ± 0.9 (n = 8)16.3 ± 0.8 (n = 4)16.3 ± 0.8 (n = 6)17.9 ± 0.6 (n = 7)Kv4.2 wt, wild-type Kv4.2.1-a Significantly different from control with p < 0.0001.1-b Significantly different from control with p < 0.04. Open table in a new tab Kv4.2 wt, wild-type Kv4.2. We investigated the possibility that the observed effects of KChIP2.2 on Kv4.2 currents might depend on distinct Kv4.2 domain(s). In a first approach, the Kv4.2 N-terminal deletion mutant Kv4.2Δ2–40 (17Zhu X.-R. Wulf A. Schwarz M. Isbrandt D. Pongs O. Recept. Channels. 1999; 6: 387-400PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Compared with the wild type, transient transfection of CHO cells with the truncated Kv4.2 construct Kv4.2Δ2–40 yielded significantly increased current densities (Kv4.2: 38 ± 9 pA/pF, n = 6; Kv4.2Δ2–40: 1129 ± 60 pA/pF, n = 10) (Fig.4 A). Coexpression of Kv4.2Δ2–40 with KChIP2.2 did not produce an additional increase in current density (Kv4.2Δ2–40 + KChIP2.2: 1093 ± 118 pA/pF,n = 9) (Fig. 4 A). Smaller truncations of the Kv4.2 N terminus, e.g. Kv4.2Δ2–32 and Kv4.2Δ2–20, had effects similar to those observed with Kv4.2Δ2–40 (Fig. 4,A and B), i.e. the current densities in transiently transfected CHO cells had increased, albeit to a lesser degree. At the same time, the stimulatory effect of KChIP2.2 was attenuated. However, expression of the Kv4.2Δ2–10 construct yielded current densities similar to those of the wild-type (85 ± 17 pA/pF, n = 9), and the presence of KChIP2.2 increased Kv4.2Δ2–10 current density ∼6-fold (497 ± 107 pA/pF,n = 10) (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, we investigated activation and inactivation properties of Kv4.2Δ2–40 channels (Fig. 4, C and D; and Table I). The activation time course at +40 mV was not affected by the truncation (Kv4.2: τact = 0.72 ± 0.06,n = 7; Kv4.2Δ2–40: τact = 0.77 ± 0.09, n = 6). By contrast, the inactivation time course was slowed in comparison with wild-type Kv4.2, resulting in an ∼3-fold increase in the inactivation time constant τ1(Kv4.2: τ1 = 17.5 ± 1.4, n = 22; Kv4.2Δ2–40: τ1 = 62.3 ± 3.4, n = 18). The inactivation time constant τ2 remained unchanged (Table I), but the weighted amplitude of τ2 had increased to 32.4 ± 2.8% (n = 18) for Kv4.2Δ2–40 in comparison with 8.9 ± 3.5% (n = 12) for Kv4.2. Recovery kinetics of Kv4.2Δ2–40 channels from inactivation at −80 mV (τrec = 260 ± 80 ms, n = 3) were indistinguishable from those of Kv4.2 (Fig. 4 D and Table I). Also, the midpoints of voltage activation (V1/2,act) and of steady-state inactivation (V1/2,inact) did not differ significantly between Kv4.2 and Kv4.2Δ2–40 channels (Table I). Coexpression with KChIP2.2 affected neither kinetic nor steady-state parameters of Kv4.2Δ2–40 currents (Table I). These results suggest that KChIP2.2 does not interact with Kv4.2Δ2–40 channels. To investigate the physical association of KChIP2.2 with the Kv4.2 N terminus, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The Kv4.2 N terminus (amino acid residues 1–180; designated as Kv4.2-NT) and C-terminally Myc-tagged KChIP2.2 (KChIP2.2-Myc) were cotranslatedin vitro and 35S-labeled. As shown in Fig.5, anti-Myc antibodies co-immunoprecipitated Kv4.2-NT with KChIP2.2-Myc. Similar co-immunoprecipitation results were obtained with cotranslated KChIP2.2-Myc and Kv4.2-NTΔ2–10, a Kv4.2-NT construct truncated by the first 10 amino acid residues. Incubation of the cotranslated KChIP2.2/Kv4.2-NT polypeptide mixture with 1 mmCaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA did not influence the co-immunoprecipitation results, in agreement with a previous report that the association of KChIP1 with Kv4.2 is calcium-insensitive (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc antibodies did not co-immunoprecipitate to a significant extent KChIP2.2-Myc with Kv4.2-NTΔ2–20, which corresponds to a Kv4.2-NT construct truncated by 20 amino acid residues (Fig. 5). To further support our notion that the Kv4.2 N terminus is critical for association of KChIP2.2 with full-length Kv4.2 α-subunits, Kv4.2 and KChIP2.2-Myc were transiently expressed alone or together in CHO cells. We tagged Kv4.2 with a HA epitope to monitor the expression of Kv4.2 by immunofluorescent staining with anti-HA antibodies. KChIP2.2-Myc was stained with an anti-Myc antibody. When expressed alone, Kv4.2 was concentrated within the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments, with some immunoreactivity apparent in the outer margins of the cell (Fig.6 A) as previously reported (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Kv4.2Δ2–40-HA was markedly less concentrated in the perinuclear compartments than Kv4.2, and more immunoreactivity was apparent in the outer margins of the cell (Fig. 6 B). KChIP2.2, on the other hand, was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm of CHO cells (Fig. 6 C), consistent with the diffuse distribution of KChIP1 in COS-1 cells (1An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). When KChIP2.2-Myc was coexpressed with Kv4.2-HA, the diffuse pattern of KChIP2.2-Myc immunofluorescence changed to such a degree that Kv4.2-HA and KChIP2.2-Myc immunofluorescence markedly overlapped, with a relatively high concentration of immunostain in the outer margins of the cell (Fig. 6,D–F). In contrast, when KChIP2.2-Myc was coexpressed with Kv4.2Δ2–40-HA, the patterns of both KChIP2.2-Myc and Kv4.2Δ2–40-HA immunofluorescence remained unchanged and did not overlap. No significant anti-KChIP2.2-Myc immunostain was detectable together with Kv4.2Δ2–40-HA in the outer margins of the cell (Fig.6, G–I). The combined results show that the first 20–40 N-te"

Up to 70% of birch pollen allergic patients who suffer from clinical syndromes like hay fever and asthma also show hypersensitivity to fresh fruit or vegetables (1Vieths S. D'Mello J.P.F. Handbook of Plant and Fungal Toxicants. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 157-174Google Scholar). The allergic reactions after ingestion of foodstuff are predominantly oropharyngeal, for example itching and swelling of the lips, tongue, and throat, but in rare cases even severe anaphylactic reactions are possible. The symptoms of these type I allergies are caused by an immune response that is triggered when two receptor-bound IgE antibodies on the surface of a mast cell or basophil are cross-linked by simultaneous binding of an otherwise harmless antigen, the so-called allergen (2Kuby J. Immunology. Freeman, New York1992: 359-372Google Scholar). Pollen-associated food allergies are a consequence of the cross-reaction of pollen allergen-specific IgE antibodies with highly homologous proteins contained in foodstuff. The 17.4-kDa major birch (Betula verrucosa) pollen allergen, Bet v 1, is responsible for IgE binding in more than 95% of birch pollen allergic patients (3Breiteneder H. Pettenburger K. Bito A.

https://openalex.org/W2023397648,"CYR61, an angiogenic factor and a member of the CCN protein family, is an extracellular matrix-associated, heparin-binding protein that mediates cell adhesion, promotes cell migration, and enhances growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation. CYR61 induces angiogenesis and promotes tumor growth in vivo and is expressed in dermal fibroblasts during cutaneous wound healing. It has been demonstrated recently that adhesion of primary skin fibroblasts to CYR61 is mediated through integrin α6β1 and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, resulting in adhesive signaling and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3. CYR61 is composed of four discrete structural domains that bear sequence similarities to the insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain that resembles cysteine knots found in some growth factors. In this study, we show that a CYR61 mutant (CYR61ΔCT) that has the CT domain deleted is unable to support adhesion of primary human skin fibroblasts but is still able to stimulate chemotaxis and enhance basic fibroblast growth factor-induced mitogenesis similar to wild type. In addition, fibroblast migration to CYR61 is mediated through integrin αvβ5 but not integrins α6β1 or αvβ3. Furthermore, we show that CYR61 binds directly to purified integrin αvβ5 in vitro. By contrast, CYR61 enhancement of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis is mediated through integrin αvβ3, a known receptor for CYR61 that mediates CYR61-dependent cell adhesion and chemotaxis in vascular endothelial cells. Thus, CYR61 promotes primary human fibroblast adhesion, migration, and mitogenesis through integrins α6β1, αvβ5, and αvβ3, respectively. Together, these findings establish CYR61 as a novel ligand for integrin αvβ5 and show that CYR61 interacts with distinct integrins to mediate disparate activities in a cell type-specific manner.

Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 2Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). A striking feature of the CCN protein family is their organization into four conserved modular domains that share sequence similarities with insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and growth factor cysteine knots (Fig. 1) (3Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). CCN family members contain all four conserved domains with the exception of WISP-2, which lacks precisely the carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain (4Zhang R. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Zhang H. Jo H. Dempsey P.J.

Since each domain is encoded by a separate exon, the CCN gene family probably arose through exon shuffling, and the overall functions of CCN proteins may be programmed by the combinatorial actions of each domain acting independently as well as interdependently.The activities of CYR61 are both cell type- and context-specific. In fibroblasts and endothelial cells, CYR61 mediates cell adhesion, stimulates cell migration, and potentiates growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (6Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol.

In micromass cultures of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells, CYR61 accelerates and promotes chondrogenic differentiation (8Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CYR61 induces angiogenesis in vivo and enhances the tumorigenicity of human tumor cells in immunodeficient mice by increasing tumor size and vascularization (9Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). CYR61 also up-regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 (10Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), enzymes that can promote matrix remodeling in processes such as angiogenesis and wound healing. These demonstrated activities of CYR61 are consistent with its expression in chondrogenic and angiogenic cell types during development (11O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar, 12Latinkic, B. V., Mo, F.-E., Greenspan, J. A., Copeland, N. G., Gilbert, D. J., Jenkins, N. A., and Lau, L. F.

Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Integrin receptors mediate at least some of the activities of CYR61 in various cell types. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that are functionally versatile and capable of regulating cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival (13Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar,14Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Recombinant CYR61 protein is a ligand of, and binds directly to, integrins αvβ3 and αIIbβ3. Interaction between these integrins and CYR61 mediates endothelial cell adhesion and migration (integrin αvβ3) or blood platelet adhesion (integrin αIIbβ3) (9Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V.

CYR61 also supports the adhesion of primary human fibroblasts through integrin α6β1 and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (17Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), resulting in adhesive signaling manifested by persistent formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, formation of integrin subunits α6- and β1-containing focal complexes, activation of focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 (10Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).The organization of CYR61 and CCN proteins into four discrete structural domains that are homologous to disparate families of proteins suggests that these domains might function both independently and in concert. The domains of CCN proteins are separated by protease-sensitive residues, raising the possibility that distinct forms of the proteins can be generated by proteolysis. It has been reported that another family member, CTGF, is proteolytically processed such that a mitogenically active fragment corresponding to the CT domain alone can be isolated from porcine uterine fluids (18Brigstock D.R.

To investigate the structure-function relationship of CCN proteins, we have constructed a mutant form of CYR61 (CYR61ΔCT) that specifically lacks the CT domain, and we examined the functional consequences of such a deletion. Furthermore, we sought to identify the cell surface receptors that mediate the chemotactic and mitogenesis enhancing activities of CYR61 in primary human fibroblasts.In the present study, we show that removal of the CT domain abrogates the ability of CYR61 to support cell adhesion in primary human fibroblasts but has no effect on stimulation of cell migration or enhancement of bFGF-induced DNA synthesis. Furthermore, whereas fibroblast adhesion to CYR61 is mediated through integrin α6β1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, CYR61-dependent chemotaxis and enhancement of DNA synthesis are mediated through integrins αvβ5 and αvβ3, respectively. We also show that CYR61 binds directly to purified integrin αvβ5 in vitro. These findings establish CYR61 as a novel ligand for integrin αvβ5, identify a functional division within the modular structure of the protein, and demonstrate that different integrin receptors mediate distinct activities of CYR61.RESULTSThe CYR61 CT domain is indispensable for supporting human skin fibroblast adhesion. To dissect the structural requirements for the various activities of CYR61, we have created CYR61 mutants that either has deleted precisely the CT domain (CYR61ΔCT) or harbors amino acid substitutions (Cyr61DM) in this domain destroying the heparin-binding sites (Fig. 1). Since the CT domain contains the heparin-binding sites, we anticipated that deleting this domain would render the protein unable to bind heparin or Sepharose S columns. Therefore, CYR61ΔCT has been histidine-tagged for the purpose of purification. A similarly tagged version of the human wild type CYR61 protein was produced and found to be functionally equivalent to the previously characterized, non-tagged CYR61 protein (data not shown). Both recombinant CYR61 and CYR61ΔCT proteins were produced in the baculovirus system and purified using the histidine tag via nickel-agarose column chromatography (22Dhanabal M. Fryxell D.K. Ramakrishnan S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 182: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The histidine-tagged CYR61ΔCT bound well to the nickel column, allowing its purification to near homogeneity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A) and immunoblotting with affinity-purified anti-CYR61 antibodies (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2CYR61Δ CT protein purification. A, 30 μl of nickel-agarose-purified CYR61ΔCT eluate was loaded per lane and electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. 1–12, fraction number; MW, molecular weight marker. B, 1 μl of nickel-agarose-purified CYR61ΔCT protein eluate was loaded per lane and electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by immunoblotting with anti-CYR61 antibodies. 1–12, fraction number; CM, conditioned medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze the functional capabilities of CYR61ΔCT, we first addressed its ability to support the adhesion of 1064SK primary human skin fibroblasts. Test proteins were coated onto microtiter wells, and cells were allowed to attach under serum-free conditions. Wild type CYR61 supported fibroblast adhesion in a dose-dependent manner, reaching maximal adhesion when the coating concentration was 2 μg/ml (Fig. 3 A), consistent with previous studies (17Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). CYR61ΔCT was completely unable to mediate cell adhesion, even at a coating concentration as high as 100 μg/ml. This adhesion defect was not due to the inability of CYR61ΔCT to coat the plastic microtiter wells. When wells were coated with either wild type CYR61 or CYR61ΔCT, both bound proteins could be readily detected to similar levels with anti-CYR61 polyclonal antibodies by ELISA (Fig.3 B). These results indicate that the CT domain is indispensable for fibroblast adhesion. This observation is consistent with the finding that Cyr61DM, with the heparin-binding sites present in the CT domain mutated, is unable to support fibroblast adhesion (17Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Integrin αvβ5 Mediates Human Skin Fibroblast Migration to CYR61 and CYR61ΔCTWe have previously found that CYR61 promotes migration of both fibroblasts and endothelial cells and that endothelial cell chemotaxis to CYR61 is mediated through integrin αvβ3 (6Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). By using a modified Boyden chamber assay, we investigated whether the CT domain was required for fibroblast migration. As shown in Fig.4 A, 1064SK fibroblasts migrated to soluble wild type CYR61 in a dose-dependent manner with maximal migration occurring at 2 μg/ml. Likewise, fibroblasts migrated to CYR61ΔCT and Cyr61DM with similar dose responses (Fig. 4, B and C). To investigate the possible role of the heparin binding activity of CYR61, we co-incubated fibroblasts with soluble heparin, a condition under which fibroblast adhesion to CYR61 could be abolished due to saturation of available heparin-binding sites on CYR61 (17Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Since the CYR61ΔCT lacking the heparin-binding motifs still induced migration, it was not surprising that heparin had no effect on fibroblast migration to either the wild type or mutant protein (Fig.5 A). Therefore, the CT domain of CYR61 and its heparin-binding capability are not required for CYR61-stimulated fibroblast migration.Figure 4The CT domain is dispensable for fibroblast migration. A modified Boyden chamber was used to measure fibroblast migration. 1064SK fibroblasts were detached with trypsin and resuspended in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, and 5 × 104 cells were loaded per well. Cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C before being fixed and stained. Cells placed in the upper chamber that migrated to the lower chamber were counted in 10 random high power fields (HPF). Serially diluted proteins at indicated concentrations were used as the chemoattractant. A, migration to CYR61. B, migration to CYR61ΔCT. C, migration to CYR61DM.

Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we investigated whether integrin α6β1 was responsible for CYR61-stimulated fibroblast migration. Cells were preincubated with either a mAb against integrin α6 (GoH3) or integrin β1 (JB1A) for 1 h prior to cell migration assay. Neither mAb had any effect on cell migration to either CYR61 or CYR61ΔCT (Fig. 5). Additionally, fibroblast migration to CYR61 was not blocked even when cells were treated with both heparin and GoH3 simultaneously (data not shown). By contrast, cell migration to fibronectin (which binds integrin α5β1), but not vitronectin (which binds integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5), was completely blocked by mAb JB1A directed against the integrin β1 subunit. These results indicate that unlike fibroblast adhesion, fibroblast migration to CYR61 is not mediated through integrin α6β1.To elucidate the mechanism responsible for CYR61-stimulated fibroblast migration, we next focused on the αv integrins since CYR61 has been demonstrated to be a ligand of integrin αvβ3 (15Kireeva M.L. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3090-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). By using a mAb (NKI-M9) against the integrin αv subunit, we were able to inhibit CYR61- and CYR61ΔCT-stimulated migration (Fig.6 A), thus confirming the involvement of an αv integrin. As expected, NKI-M9 inhibited cell migration to vitronectin but not to fibronectin. LM609, a mAb with specificity for the integrin αvβ3 heterodimer (23Cheresh D.A. Spiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on cell migration to CYR61 but blocked migration to vitronectin as expected (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, in contrast to migration in endothelial cells (9Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), CYR61-stimulated fibroblast migration is not mediated through integrin αvβ3. Since integrin αvβ5 is expressed in fibroblasts and has been shown to mediate activation-dependent cell migration (24Cavani A. Zambruno G. Marconi A. Manca V. Marchetti M. Giannetti A. J.

When fibroblasts were treated with P1F6, a mAb against integrin αvβ5, migration to both CYR61 and CYR61ΔCT protein was blocked completely (Fig. 6 C). As expected, P1F6 had no effect on migration to fibronectin. Together, these results show that fibroblast migration to CYR61 is mediated through integrin αvβ5.Figure 6Integrin αvβ5mediates migration to CYR61 and CYR61Δ CT protein.

That CYR61-stimulated fibroblast migration is mediated through integrin αvβ5 prompted us to investigate whether CYR61 can bind directly to this integrin. In a solid phase binding assay, purified integrin αvβ5 receptor was immobilized on microtiter wells onto which CYR61 was allowed to bind. The reaction was detected by ELISA using anti-CYR61 antibodies. Fig.7 A shows that CYR61 bound to immobilized integrin αvβ5 in a dose-dependent and saturable manner, with half-saturation occurring at ∼6 nm (0.25 μg/ml) CYR61. As expected, there was no significant interaction between CYR61 and the BSA control.Figure 7CYR61 binds directly to immobilized integrin αvβ5.Microtiter wells were coated with purified αvβ5 receptor or BSA (1 μg/ml each) as indicated. A, after gelatin blocking, varying concentrations of CYR61 were added and binding proceeded at room temperature for 3 h. Bound CYR61 was detected using ELISA.

Since integrin αvβ5 recognizes protein ligands with the RGD sequence motif and is inhibited by soluble RGD peptides (30Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

The peptide GRGDSP at 0.2 mm, but not the control peptide GRGESP, completely abrogated CYR61 binding to integrin αvβ5. A function-blocking mAb against integrin αvβ5(P1F6) inhibited CYR61 binding completely, whereas the anti-αvβ3 mAb (LM609) exhibited only a partial inhibitory effect. Taken together, these results show that CYR61 can bind directly to purified integrin αVβ5 in vitro, consistent with functional studies showing that CYR61 stimulates fibroblast migration through this integrin (Fig. 7).CYR61 and CYR61ΔCT Enhance bFGF-induced DNA Synthesis in Fibroblasts through Integrin αvβ3Although CYR61 is not mitogenic alone, its ability to enhance growth factor-induced DNA synthesis has been established for fibroblasts and endothelial cells (6Kireeva M.L.

Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in elucidating what activity CYR61ΔCT may have on 1064SK fibroblast proliferation. When added as a soluble factor to fibroblasts under serum-free conditions, CYR61ΔCT alone did not elicit a mitogenic response (Fig.8 A) as described previously for wild type CYR61 (6Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, when added in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of bFGF (10 ng/ml), CYR61ΔCT elicited a 2-fold increase over bFGF treatment in thymidine incorporation similar to wild type CYR61 (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, the mitogenesis-enhancing effect of CYR61ΔCT is dose-dependent and saturable, with maximal potentiation occurring at 3 μg/ml under serum-free conditions (Fig.8 B). These studies show that the CT domain is not required for CYR61 to enhance growth factor-induced DNA synthesis.Figure 8CYR61Δ CT enhances bFGF-induced DNA synthesis in 1064SK fibroblasts. The effect of soluble CYR61ΔCT on bFGF-induced mitogenesis under serum-free conditions was assessed on fibroblasts attached to 24-well plates.A, serum-starved cells were treated with BSA (0.5%), CYR61ΔCT (3 μg/ml), bFGF (10 ng/ml), or CYR61 (3 μg/ml) and [3H]thymidine for 21 h before incorporation was measured. B, serum-starved cells were treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF, the indicated concentration of CYR61ΔCT, and [3H]thymidine for 21 h before incorporation was measured. Data shown for all panels are mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations and are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since integrin receptors have been shown to mediate many of the activities of CYR61, we hypothesized that they may also be involved in this proliferation-enhancing effect. To investigate this possibility, we first treated cells with GRGDSP or GRGESP peptide for 1 h before the addition of CYR61 and bFGF. Interestingly, the peptide GRGDSP at 0.2 mm, but not the control peptide GRGESP, completely neutralized the CYR61 enhancement of bFGF-induced 1064SK fibroblast mitogenesis (Fig.9 A). By contrast, DNA synthesis induced by bFGF alone was unaffected. This result indicated that an RGD-sensitive integrin may be responsible for mediating the proliferation-enhancing effect of CYR61. Furthermore, when cells were treated with echistatin, a disintegrin with binding preference for β3 integrins (31Gan Z.R. Gould R.J. Jacobs J.W. Friedman P.A. Polokoff M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19827-19832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CYR61 enhancement of bFGF-induced proliferation was similarly abrogated completely. These results, together with the fact that CYR61 is a known ligand of integrin αvβ3 (15Kireeva M.L. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3090-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), suggested to us that integrin αvβ3 might mediate the mitogenesis-enhancing effects of CYR61. To investigate this possibility further, function-blocking mAbs against relevant integrins were used in mitogenesis assays. Consistent with the blocking effect of echistatin, mAbs against integrin αv (AV1) or β3 (B3A) completely abolished CYR61-e"

[Jaenisch and Wilmut][1] oppose cloning humans, primarily because of the high failure rate and because the technology for detecting genetic abnormalities used in routine prenatal diagnosis cannot detect problems in epigenetic programming. Faulty epigenetic reprogramming can cause abnormal expression of any gene, which is consistent with the wide spectrum of developmental and physiological defects seen in cloned animals. Research into cloning specific cells for repair and regeneration of tissues would likely suffer from public reaction to human cloning failures.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). While NF-κB was well known to participate in the control of immune (2Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar) and inflammatory responses (3Barnes P. Karin M. N. Engl. J.

NF-κB is maintained inactive by inhibitory subunits of the IκB family such as IκB-α. IκB-α interacts with NF-κB via its ankyrin motifs, masking nuclear localization signals on NF-κB subunits. The release of transcriptionally competent NF-κB dimers is achieved after phosphorylation-induced degradation or dissociation of IκB-α molecules. At least two kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) that are specific for the conserved tandem serines in IκB-α molecules have been identified. They show an extensive homology and form homo- as well as heterodimers within the cell. IKKs are localized in the signalsome, a multiprotein complex (700–900 kDa). This complex also contains NEMO/IKKγ, (6Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H. Kay R. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) a structural component that is crucial for the correct assembly and functionality of the signalsome (for a review, see Refs. 7Mercurio F.

An alternative mechanism that links tyrosine kinases to NF-κB activation has been described that uses phosphorylation of tyrosine 42 of IκB-α to dissociate IκB-α·NF-κB complexes (9Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner B.M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P. Peyron J.F.

Phosphorylation of IκB-α on serines 32 and 36 allows its specific recognition by the E3RS ubiquitin protein ligase, which then transfers ubiquitin to lysines 20 and 21. The polyubiquitinated IκB-α molecule is thereafter recognized and degraded in situ by the proteasome 26 S complex (7Mercurio F. Manning A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of IκB-α thus appears to integrate NF-κB activation signals. We used this regulatory domain as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a Jurkat cDNA library to search for protein interactors and therefore potential regulators of NF-κB activation. In this report, we describe and characterize the interaction between IκB-α and ANT, the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator (10Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G. Vignais P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). ANT is a central component of the mitochondria permeability transition pore (11Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The opening of this pore, during induction of apoptosis allows the release of molecules, such as caspases or apoptosis-inducing factor, which are important to amplify the cell suicide response. The possible functional importance of the IκB-α/ANT interaction in the context of regulation of apoptosis is discussed. Anti-IκB-α antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antiserum anti-IκB-α, anti-Myc epitope, and anti-F1β ATPase monoclonal antibody were kindly provided by Jean Imbert (U119, Marseille, France), Jean-François Tanti (INSERM, EPI E99–11, Nice, France), and Joël Lunardi (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Grenoble, France), respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mmpyruvate, and 10‥ fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as previously described (12Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D., Seidman, J. G., Smith,J. A., and Struhl, K.

HTLV-I1-infected MT4 cells (13Larder, B., Darby, G., Richman, D., Science, 243, 1989, 1731, 1734.Google Scholar) and cells of the human leukemic T-cell line Jurkat were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm pyruvate, and 5‥ fetal calf serum. IκB-α cDNA encoding amino acids 2–72 was subcloned into the GAL4 DNA-binding vector pAS2.1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting plasmid, pAS-IκB2–72, was used as the bait in a two-hybrid screening of a human Jurkat T cell cDNA library (CLONTECH) in the S. cerevisiae HF7c strain according to the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System II Protocol (CLONTECH). Positive yeast clones were selected for prototrophy for histidine and expression of β-galactosidase. Yeast DNA was recovered. Sequencing of positive clones have been performed using the T7 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech sequencing kit. Full-length ANT cDNA was amplified by PCR from the human Jurkat T cell cDNA library. cDNAs encoding full-length ANT or its C-terminal domain were subcloned downstream and in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) open reading frame in the pGex-4T-2 plasmid. Full-length ANT cDNA was also subcloned in pcDNA-Myc plasmid (gift of Dr. J-F. Tanti, INSERM E99–11). Plasmids coding for the GST fused proteins were transformed in E. coli strain DH5α and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C. GST-fused proteins were purified by incubating precleared bacterial lysates (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-1‥ Nonidet P-40 sonication) with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The absorbed proteins were incubated with recombinant hexahistidine-IκB-α purified for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5‥ Nonidet P-40, 1‥ bovine serum albumin) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). After extensive washes in the same buffer without bovine serum albumin, IκB-α was detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-IκB-α antibodies. Transfected 293 cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5‥ Nonidet P40, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were cleared at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with antisera against IκB-α or Myc epitope that were preabsorbed on Protein A-Sepharose and Protein G-Sepharose, respectively. The immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by standard procedures. Immunoblot analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies. Bound antibodies were revealed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled immunoglobulins (Dako, Trappes, France) using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcellular fractionation was performed according to Ref. 14Li F. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R. Tomaselli K. Fritz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30299-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar. 108 Jurkat cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in buffer A (250 mmsucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were Dounce homogenized (2-cm diameter, 100 strokes, 4 °C). Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant supernatants and pellets were designated as cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. Mitochondria were highly purified according to Ref. 15Storrie B. Madden E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar. Briefly, after Dounce homogenization, cell extracts were laid over the top of a Percoll/metrizamide discontinuous gradient. After centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 15 min, mitochondria were collected at the 17/35‥ interface. They were then diluted in buffer A, centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, and recovered in the pellet. Cross-contamination with cytosol was assessed using a specific enzyme marker: lactate dehydrogenase. The level of cross-contamination was calculated as the percentage of the total cellular enzyme activity in the different fractions. Mitochondria or whole cell extracts were incubated in buffer A without protease inhibitors in the presence of 5–15 ng/ml proteinase K (Sigma) for 10 min on ice. Protease inhibitors were added to stop the reaction, and proteins were analyzed by Western blotting, as described below. For immunoelectron microscopy, cell pellets from control or Fas-stimulated cells (6 h, 100 ng/ml) were fixed in 3.7‥ paraformaldehyde and embedded at low temperature into LR White resin (Hard LR White, London, UK). Ultrathin sections were laid to 300-mesh nickel grids, washed with PBS, and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with IκB-α antibody (1:200) or with anti-p65 antibody (1:500). After washing with PBS, the grids were incubated for 60 min with 10-nm colloidal gold-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (British BioCell International, Cardiff, UK). The grids were washed with PBS and then with distilled water and stained with uranyl acetate. Sections were examined with a JEOL 1200 EXII electron microscope. The cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from indicated cells were prepared as described above. Mitochondria were lysed in totex buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 20‥ glycerol, 1‥ Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). 30 μg of protein from total mitochondria extract or 50 μg of protein from digitonin supernatant were subjected to an electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis. IκB-α and NF-κB complexes were dissociated with a 0.6‥ deoxycholate treatment during 10 min at room temperature. The NF-κB probe used was a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB binding site of the interleukin-2 gene promoter (5′-GATCCAAGGGACTTTCCATG-3′). The end-labeled probe was incubated with extract samples for 20 min at 37 °C. Complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 5‥ nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. The dried gels were subjected to autoradiography (X-Omat; Eastman Kodak Co.). Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is regulated by phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of the inhibitory subunit IκB-α. We used this N-terminal regulatory domain (IκB-α amino acids 2–72) as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid-based approach to identify new IκB-α interactors and therefore potential NF-κB regulators. By the screening of a commercial human Jurkat cell library, ∼6 × 105 double yeast transformants were obtained, among which 232 grew on selective medium and only 88 turned blue when tested in a filter lift β-galactosidase assay. Fifty-six clones were further characterized by sequencing. Primary nucleotide sequencing revealed one cDNA clone encoding a protein not previously described in GenBankTM and two clones corresponding to two isoforms of the adenine nucleotide translocator: ANT1-(171–297) and ANT2-(152–298). The interaction between ANT and IκB-α was further characterized in the yeast two-hybrid system. Full-length IκB-α could not be used in the two-hybrid system because of a constitutive activity of reporter genes (not shown; see Ref. 16Morin P. Subramanian G. Gilmore T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, the DB-IκB-α-(2–72) fused protein cannot act as activator of transcription when coexpressed in yeast with GAL4 AD nor in combination with AD-T Ag (large T antigen) fusion protein (lanes 1 and 2). The AD-ANT fused protein cannot act as activator of transcription when coexpressed in yeast with GAL4 DB nor in combination with the DB-p53 fusion protein (lanes 7 and 8). On the contrary, co-expression of IκB-α-(2–72) with the portion of ANT1 or ANT2 isolated during the screening (lanes 4 and5) or with the full-length ANT1 cDNA (lane 6) induced expression of the two reporter genes, thus demonstrating a direct and specific interaction between the two partners. We performed in vitro binding assay to confirm, in an independent experimental setting, the physical interaction between ANT and IκB-α proteins. The C-terminal part of ANT isolated during the screening as well as the full-length ANT protein sequences were fused to GST and used in pull-down experiments with recombinant IκB-α. The size of the recombinant proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig.1 A, upper panel). The GST protein or a nonrelevant fusion protein could not interact with IκB-α (Fig. 1 A,lower panel, lanes 2–5). By contrast, the C-terminal domain of ANT1 (lanes 6 and 7) as well as the full-length protein (lanes 8 and 9) interact specifically and in a dose-dependent manner with IκB-α.Table ISpecific testing of ANT/IκB-α interactions in the yeast two-hybrid systemYeast two-hybrids (DB/AD)Growth on selective mediumβ-Galactosidase assayIκB-α-(2–72)/vector−−IκB-α-(2–72)/T-antigen−−p53/T-antigen++IκB-α-(2–72)/ANT1-(171–297)++IκB-α-(2–72)/ANT2-(152–298)++IκB-α-(2–72)/ANT1-(2–297)++Vector/ANT1-(171–297)−−p53/ANT1-(171–297)−−Yeast HF7c cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding the indicated GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DB)-fused and GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD)-fused proteins.

Open table in a new tab Yeast HF7c cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding the indicated GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DB)-fused and GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD)-fused proteins. Colonies were tested for their ability to grow on medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, and β-galactosidase activity was monitored by a standard filter assay. Growth on selective medium and β-galactosidase activity are scored as a range from no growth and no β-galactosidase activity (−) to activity generated by the positive control (+). These in vitro results confirm the specificity of the ANT and IκB-α interaction. 293 cells were transiently transfected with two expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged ANT and IκB-α. Cellular levels of IκB-α and ANT were visualized by direct Western blot analysis of total lysates with antibodies to IκB-α (Fig. 1 B,lane 2 versus lane 1) or to Myc epitope (lane 10 versus lane 9). Cell soluble extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IκB-α (lanes 3, 4, 11, and12) or anti-Myc (lanes 5,6, 13, and 14) rabbit polyclonal antibodies or with a nonimmune serum (lanes 7,8, 15, and 16). The precipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with polyclonal IκB-α (lanes 1–8) or anti-Myc (lanes 9–16) monoclonal antibodies. Anti-IκB-α precipitates contained an anti-Myc reactive band (lane 12) that comigrates with MycANT (lane 10). Quantification of the bands lead to an estimate of 14‥ of total ANT associated with IκB-α. On the contrary, IκB-α could not be revealed after anti-Myc immunoprecipitation (lane 4). No anti-Myc or anti-IκB-α reactive proteins were precipitated by a nonimmune serum (lanes 8 and16). These results demonstrate that a specific interaction between ANT and IκB-α could occur in intact cells. Since ANT is a mitochondrial protein, we looked for the presence of IκB-α in this organelle. Mitochondria preparation after subcellular fractionation exhibited minor contamination by cytosol, as revealed by assays for specific mitochondrial enzymes: lactate dehydrogenase (2.6‥; data not shown). IκB-α was analyzed in total cell extracts (Fig.2 A, upper panel, lane 1) or in cytosolic (lane 2) or mitochondrial (lane 3) extracts. Equal amounts (250 μg) of proteins from cytosol or mitochondria were loaded. Although the majority of IκB-α was localized in the cytosolic fraction (lane 2), the protein could also be observed in the mitochondria (lane 3). The localization of p65 NF-κB was investigated. As shown in the lower panel, p65 was also present in the cytoplasm (lane 2) as well as in the mitochondria (lane 3). In order to exclude a possible contamination of the mitochondrial fraction by cytosolic proteins or other cellular compartments such as the Golgi apparatus or the ER, mitochondria were further enriched and purified on a Percoll/metrizamide gradient. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was below 1‥ in the highly purified mitochondrial fraction (not shown). Western blot analysis with specific antibodies confirmed the presence of IκB-α and p65 in mitochondria (lane 5, upper and middle panels). Using densitometry scanning of the autoradiography, we calculated that approximately 7‥ of cellular total IκB-α is located in mitochondria. Cytochrome c was mainly detected in the mitochondrial fraction (lane 5,lower panel) and only faintly in the cytosol (lane 4, lower panel). Immunoelectron microscopy analysis using anti-IκB-α antibodies as primary antibodies was then performed on purified mitochondria (Fig.2 B). No signal could be detected when gold-conjugated secondary antibody was used alone or in combination with a nonrelevant primary antibody (see controls on Fig. 4, A andB). IκB-α staining was associated with the membrane or the internal crests, but not with the matrix. We next assessed the sensitivity of IκB-α, p65, and Bcl2 in mitochondrial fractions to proteinase K (Fig. 2 D,lanes 1–3, left panels). While Bcl2, which is associated with the external mitochondrial membrane, was completely degraded (lower panel,lanes 2 and 3), IκB-α and p65 remained unaffected (upper and middle panels, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that IκB-α and p65 are inaccessible to proteinase K. The two proteins are not intrinsically resistant to proteinase K, since in whole cell extracts (right panels), IκB-α and p65 were degraded by proteinase K to the same extent as Bcl2 (lanes 5 and 6). This suggests that IκB-α and p65 are located inside the mitochondria. To determine the sublocalization of IκB-α and p65 in the organelle, gradient-purified mitochondria were treated with increasing concentrations of digitonin in order to solubilize the outer membrane (17Ragan, C., Wilson, M., Darley-Usmar, V., and Lowe, P. (1987)Mitochondria: A Practical Approach (Darley-Usmar, V. M., Rickwood, D., and Wilson, M. T., eds) pp. 79–112.Google Scholar). After centrifugation, pellets and supernatants were subjected to a Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2D, increasing concentrations of digitonin (0.1–0.4‥) induced a disappearance of IκB-α and p65 from the mitochondria (lanes 3,5, and 7 versus lane 1) concomitant to their appearance in the supernatant fractions (lanes 4, 6, and8 compared with lane 2). As a control, digitonin was shown to extract intermembranal cytochrome c. By contrast, the release of the internal membrane-located F1 ATPase appeared to require a higher digitonin concentration (0.4‥; lane 8).Therefore, IκB-α and p65 NF-κB appeared to be located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, since they can be released after lysis of the outer membrane. Surprisingly, we observed several times that IκB-α·NF-κB complexes were more easily and more rapidly solubilized by digitonin than cytochrome c. This unexpected result could suggest that cytochrome c may stick to some mitochondrial proteins or membrane lipids while IκB-α·NF-κB are more soluble proteins. Indeed, when F1β ATPase was extracted by 0.4‥ digitonin, a significant amount of cytochromec still remained associated with mitochondria. Nevertheless, this difference in behavior toward digitonin treatment does not necessarily mean that under physiological apoptotic conditions IκB-α·NF-κB would be more easily released from mitochondria than cytochrome c. Considering the respective size of these proteins, it is likely that they use different ways to leave the mitochondrial intermembrane space. IκB-α immunocomplexes from cytosolic or mitochondrial fractions were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of p65. As shown in Fig.3 A, no p65 was found in control precipitates (lanes 1 and 2), while p65 associated with IκB-α in cytosolic (lane 3) as well as mitochondrial extracts (lane 4). These data indicate the presence of specific IκB-α·p65 NF-κB complexes in the mitochondria. To further demonstrate the IκB-α·NF-κB association, cytosolic or digitonin-treated mitochondrial extracts were treated or not with deoxycholate in order to dissociate NF-κB from IκB-α. Free NF-κB was then visualized by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3 B). Deoxycholate (Doc) treatment of cytosol (lane 2) or mitochondria preparation (lane 5) released NF-κB that was competent for specifically binding a 32P-labeled κB probe, as verified by competition assays with unlabeled probe (lanes 3 and 6). Taken together, these results confirm the existence of IκB-α·NF-κB complexes in the mitochondria. Immunoelectron microscopy analysis was then performed on intact Jurkat cells, using anti-IκB-α or anti-p65 antibodies as primary antibodies. No signal could be detected when gold-conjugated secondary antibody was used in combination with a nonrelevant anti-cytokeratin antibody (Fig.4 A) or alone (Fig.4 B). Analysis of anti-IκB-α antibody-labeled cells revealed numerous beads distributed mainly in the cytosol with few in the nucleus (Fig.4 C). Beads were also found associated with mitochondria. No labeling could be detected within the endoplasmic reticulum or the plasma membrane, ruling out a nonspecific binding of the antibody to lipid membranes. A greater magnification of mitochondria showed that IκB-α staining was localized mainly at the membrane level or in the internal crests (Fig. 4 D). Analysis of anti-p65 antibody labeled cells revealed a similar distribution of the molecule both in intact cells (Fig. 4 E) and mitochondria (Fig. 4 F). Taken together, these results further confirm a mitochondrial localization of IκB-α as well as of p65 NF-κB. The release of pro- or antiapoptotic molecules from the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis in several cellular systems is well documented (11Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). We analyzed the fate of IκB-α, p65 NF-κB, and cytochrome c after induction of apoptosis upon engagement of the Fas surface molecule with the CH11 antibody. After cell treatment with increasing doses of CH11 antibody, mitochondria were isolated and analyzed for the presence of IκB-α. As shown in Fig.5 A, engagement of the Fas receptor resulted in a dose-dependent release of IκB-α (lanes 4–6, upper panel) as well as of p65 (lanes 4–6, middle panel). The specificity of these observations was confirmed by the parallel release of cytochrome c (lanes 4–6, lower panel) from mitochondria. In contrast, little to no degradation of these molecules could be visualized in the cytosol after CH11 treatment (lanes 1–3). Electron microscopy analysis of CH11-treated Jurkat cells revealed cell shrinkage, perinuclear chromatin condensation, and alterations of the mitochondrial structures, including swelling, disappearance ofcristae membranes, and destructuralizing of the surrounding membranes (data not shown). In these cells, IκB-α staining was highly reduced in the mitochondria (Fig. 5 B, comparea with b). Similarly, CH11 treatment resulted in the disappearance of p65 reactivity (compare c withd). These data suggest that IκB-α and p65 complexes located in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria can be released in the cytosol following stimulation of Jurkat cells with apoptotic signals. We then performed experiments in order to determine if the mitochondrial IκB-α·NF-κB complexes were sensitive to activation signals. We used HTLV-I-infected MT4 cells that display a constitutive activation of NF-κB. The HTLV-I Tax protein is known to activate NF-κB by binding to the NEMO/IKKγ component of the signalsome, resulting in a constitutive activation of the IκB-α kinases (18Harhaj, E., Sun, S., J. Biol. Chem., 274, 1999, 22911, 22914.Google Scholar). MT4 cells express low amounts of IκB-α (Fig. 6,lane 1) as visualized by Western blot analysis. Cell treatment (1 h, 50 μm) with the proteasome inhibitor ALLN, shown to prevent degradation of IκB-α, resulted in an increase in the cellular levels of IκB-α (lane 2). By contrast, the amount of IκB-α in the mitochondria was not affected by the ALLN treatment (compare lane 4 with lane 3). The nitrocellulose filter was then hybridized with a phosphospecific IκB-α antibody. Despite constitutive stimulation of IKK kinases, no phosphorylated IκB-α could be detected in cytosolic extracts (lane 6), suggesting that phosphorylated IκB-α is immediately degraded. Indeed, ALLN treatment allowed the visualization of phospho-IκB-α (lane 7). By contrast, no signal could be detected in the mitochondrial fraction (lane 8), even in the presence of ALLN (lane 9), suggesting that despite continuous firing of IκB kinases, mitochondrial IκB-α is protected from phosphorylation. In this report, we show that IκB-α·NF-κB complexes are present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space via interaction of the N-terminal domain of IκB-α with the internal membrane protein ANT (adenine nucleotidetranslocator). The interaction was originally detected in a yeast two-hybrid screening and checked by in vitro pull-down experiments with GST-ANT and recombinant IκB-α. A coprecipitation of the two molecules was observed in transfected 293 cells, demonstrating that the two proteins could interact in intact cells. Finally, immunoelectron microscopy allowed the unambiguous demonstration of IκB-α·NF-κB complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. NF-κB and IκB-α were unaffected by a proteinase K treatment of intact mitochondria and could be extracted by digitonin lysis of the outer membrane. The ANT protein is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and exchanges cytosolic ADP for mitochondrial ATP (10Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G. Vignais P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). ANT interacts with several proteins of the outer membrane (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, porin/VDAC, Bax) as well as the matrix (cyclophilin) to form the permeability transition pore (PTP) or megachannel (19Zoratti, M., Szabo, I., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1241, 1995, 139, 176.Google Scholar). The PTP appears as an important regulator of the apoptotic process. Opening of the pore leads to loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, Δψm, that can ultimately culminate in matrix swelling and outer membrane rupture, allowing the release of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and procaspases (11Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 20Marchetti P. Castedo M. Susin S. Zamzani N. Hirsch T. Macho A.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Green D. Reed J. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exit of cytochrome c is controlled by proteins of the Bcl-2 family that are anchored on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Antiapoptotic members of the family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl) prevent cytochrome c release in contrast to the proapoptotic members Bax and Bak (23Adams J. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Bax has been shown to interact with ANT to induce PTP opening and cytochrome crelease (24Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jürgensmeier J. Susin S. Beutner G. Vieira H. Prévost M. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Several pharmacological compounds interfere with PTP. For instance, bongkrekic acid and atractyloside are, respectively, blocker and inducer of apoptosis by binding two different conformational stages of ANT (20Marchetti P. Castedo M. Susin S. Zamzani N. Hirsch T. Macho A. Haeffner A. Hirsch F. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 25Zamzami N. Susin S. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A also blocks mitochondrial apoptotic signals by interacting with cyclophilin (26Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), while engagement of the benzodiazepine receptor facilitates apoptosis (27Hirsch T. Decaudin D. Susin S. Marchetti P. Larochette N. Resche-Rigon M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 241: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The observed interaction of IκB-α with ANT suggests that mitochondrial IκB-α·NF-κB complexes could be involved in the regulation of the apoptotic cascade. Apart from its well known functions in coordination of immune and inflammatory responses, NF-κB appears to promote cell survival (4Foo S. Nolan G. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Barkett M. Gilmore T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). For instance, inactivation of the p65 NF-κB (relA) gene resulted in embryonic death due to massive liver apoptosis (28Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). This property could be demonstrated in various cell lines by expression of a dominant negative form of the inhibitory subunit IκB-α. Replacement of serines 32 and 36 by alanines prevents phosphorylation/degradation of IκB-α and thus activation of NF-κB. Cells expressing the IκB-α superrepressor clearly become more susceptible to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor, chemotherapeutic drugs, or γ-rays (29Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 30Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 31Wang C.-Y. Cusack Jr., J. Liu R. Baldwin Jr., A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In order to determine if the mitochondrial pool of IκB-α·NF-κB complexes could be reached by activation signals, we used HTLV-1-infected MT4 cells that display a constitutive activation of NF-κB, due to an interaction of the viral Tax protein with IKKγ to activate the IKK complex. Inhibition of the degradation pathway by ALLN increased cytosolic IκB-α levels and allowed detection of the serine phosphorylated form. In sharp contrast, mitochondrial IκB-α was not affected by ALLN treatment. These results show that mitochondrial IκB-α·NF-κB complexes are sequestered from NF-κB-activating signals. Induction of apoptosis after engagement of the Fas death receptor leads to the exit of IκB-α·NF-κB from mitochondria. While cytochromec can leave mitochondria through open VDAC (diameter 2.4–3 nm) (32Martinou J. Nature. 1999; 399: 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the liberation of procaspases and IκB-α·NF-κB complexes requires rupture of the outer membrane. We believe that this release in the cytosol could increase the number of NF-κB complexes susceptible for activation. Apoptosis should be considered as a multistep and integrative process. Before producing an appropriate outcome response, cells have to integrate pro- and anti-apoptotic influences. Moreover, cross-talks between apoptotic and survival pathways have already been demonstrated. NF-κB could be one of the important players at this cross-road. NF-κB is activated by the Akt kinase survival pathway (33Ozes O. Mayo L. Gustin J. Pfeffer S. Pfeffer L. Donner D. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar, 34Romashkova J. Makarov S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The second face of the cross-talks is represented by the caspase-mediated inactivation of survival pathways. Transcription factors appear as key targets. SRF, which regulates growth factor-induced survival genes, is cleaved and inactivated during apoptosis (35Bertolotto C. Ricci J. Luciano F. Mari B. Chambard J. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37246-37250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). So is p65 NF-κB, whose cleavage produces a protein lacking its transactivation domain that has a dominant negative effect on NF-κB-induced survival genes (36Levkau B. Scatena M. Giachelli C. Ross R. Raines E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). IκB-α could also be cleaved by caspase 3, to an N-terminal truncated and stable inhibitor of NF-κB activation (37Reuther J. Baldwin Jr., A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20664-20670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Apoptotic pathways have characteristics of a self-amplifying process. Procaspases are released from the mitochondria (38Susin S. Lorenzo H. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prévost M. Alzari P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), and activated caspases are able to induce the exit of cytochrome c to exacerbate the response (39Marzo I. Susin S. Petit P. Ravagnan L. Brenner C. Larochette N. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, NF-κB promotes, in many cells, survival effects via transcription of genes such as those for cIAP1 and cIAP2 that code for caspases inhibitors (40Roy N. Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 41Wang C. Mayo M. Korneluk R. Goeddel D. Baldwin Jr., A. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the release of IκB-α·NF-κB from the mitochondria is an additional control level. Reception of a survival signal at this point would limit or delay apoptosis, whereas continuous caspase activation will lead to NF-κB inactivation. Alternatively, IκB-α·NF-κB could exert a transcriptionally independent regulatory function on apoptosis. This has been demonstrated for p53, which translocates to mitochondria during p53-mediated apoptosis. Translocation precedes mitochondrial dysfunctional changes and appears independent of p53 transcriptional activity (42Marchenko N. Zaika A. Moll U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that IκB-α·NF-κB could regulate opening of the PTP through its association with ANT. The results presented here suggest that a reservoir of IκB-α·NF-κB complexes in the intermembrane mitochondrial space could be involved in modulating apoptosis responses. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2138190971,"Link modules are hyaluronan-binding domains found in extracellular proteins involved in matrix assembly, development, and immune cell migration. Previously we have expressed the Link module from the inflammation-associated protein tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) and determined its tertiary structure in solution. Here we generated 21 Link module mutants, and these were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a hyaluronan-binding assay. The individual mutation of five amino acids, which form a cluster on one face of the Link module, caused large reductions in functional activity but did not affect the Link module fold. This ligand-binding site in TSG-6 is similar to that determined previously for the hyaluronan receptor, CD44, suggesting that the location of the interaction surfaces may also be conserved in other Link module-containing proteins. Analysis of the sequences of TSG-6 and CD44 indicates that the molecular details of their association with hyaluronan are likely to be significantly different. This comparison identifies key sequence positions that may be important in mediating hyaluronan binding, across the Link module superfamily. The use of multiple sequence alignment and molecular modeling allowed the prediction of functional residues in link protein, and this approach can be extended to all members of the superfamily."

However, ERK7 has several distinguishing characteristics. Unlike other ERKs, ERK7 has been shown to have significant constitutive activity in serum-starved cells, which is not increased further by extracellular stimuli that typically activate other members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. On the other hand, ERK7's activation state and kinase activity appear to be regulated by its ability to utilize ATP and the presence of its extended C-terminal region. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of ERK7 activation. The results suggest that 1) MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors do not suppress ERK7 kinase activity; 2) intramolecular autophosphorylation is sufficient for activation of ERK7 in the absence of an upstream MEK; and 3) multiple regions of the C-terminal domain of ERK7 regulate its kinase activity.

Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

A wide variety of stimuli have been found to activate MAPKs through specific signaling cascades. The basic core of these pathways consists of a three-kinase module that is evolutionarily conserved (4Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). The first component of this signaling module is a MAPK kinase kinase. This serine/threonine kinase, once activated, phosphorylates and activates the second component in the module, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK). Subsequently, the dual specificity MAPKK phosphorylates the threonine and tyrosine residues of a Thr-X-Tyr (TXY) motif within the activation loop of the MAPK. Phosphorylation of both residues within the activation loop is required and sufficient for full activation of MAPKs (5Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). One subfamily of MAPKs, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), is identified by the TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) sequence within the activation loop. ERK1 and ERK2 were the first ERKs identified. They are the most widely studied and perhaps best understood members of the ERK family. ERK3 was cloned in the same cDNA library screen as ERK1 and ERK2 and shares about 43‥ overall sequence identity with ERK1 and ERK2 (6Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). However, ERK3 has a SEG activation motif. ERK4 was identified in immunoblots as a protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to NGF and EGF in a Ras-dependent fashion (7Peng X. Angelastro J.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Little else, however, is known about ERK4, including its sequence. ERK5 was initially identified as a redox-sensitive kinase (8Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been implicated in growth factor signaling, as evidenced by mediating early immediate gene expression through phosphorylation of MEF2C (9Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and EGF-induced cell proliferation (10Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). ERK6 is highly expressed in human skeletal muscle and promotes differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes (11Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Its TGY activation motif makes it a member of the p38 family. ERK7 is the most recently cloned ERK with a TEY activation motif (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the ERK family, it has constitutive activity in serum-starved cells, and typical activators of other MAPKs fail to further increase ERK7's activity. Interestingly, exogenous expression of ERK7 can lead to growth inhibition, which is also regulated by the C-terminal domain of ERK7 (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, only four of the seven MAPKs designated ERK have the signature TEY activation motif. Three of these ERKs, ERK1, ERK2, and ERK5, participate in signal transduction pathways that originate from the cell surface receptors. The signaling pathways leading to ERK1 and ERK2 activation have been characterized most extensively. The MAPK kinases that activate ERK1 and ERK2 have been identified and cloned (13Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8205-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 921-929PubMed Google Scholar). Termed MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK1 and MEK2), these dual specificity kinases are the immediate upstream activating kinases for ERK1 and ERK2. The MAPK kinase kinase for this module, Raf, has been shown to activate MEK1 and/or MEK2 (16Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1992; 257: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 17Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J.

Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Recently, MEKK3 has been identified as the upstream activator of MEK5 (19Chao T.-H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36035-36038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which is a potent activator of ERK5 (20Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Upstream activators of the ERK7 signaling cascade have not been identified. Instead, there is evidence to suggest that autophosphorylation plays a significant role in its activation (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Under conditions where the wild-type ERK7 is TEY-phosphorylated, the kinase-inactive mutant, K43R, remains unphosphorylated. In contrast, the equivalent catalytically inactive ERK2 mutant can be TEY-phosphorylated by MEK1 (21Her J.H. Lakhani S. Zu K. Vila J. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that autophosphorylation is required for the activation of ERK7. However, it is not clear whether autophosphorylation is sufficient or whether other upstream activators are also required. In addition, removing the C-terminal domain of ERK7 significantly reduces its TEY phosphorylation and kinase activity, suggesting that the C-terminal region regulates ERK7 activity (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One possible model is that the C-terminal domain interacts with the kinase domain to induce activation; alternatively, interaction of the C-terminal region with other proteins might be required. To further examine the nature of ERK7's constitutive activity and the role of autophosphorylation, we expressed ERK7 in bacteria. Not only were bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ERK7 and polyhistidine-tagged ERK7 found to be TEY-phosphorylated, they also had significantly higher in vitro kinase activity compared with similarly expressed GST-ERK1. Furthermore, deletion analysis of the C-terminal region indicated that multiple regions within the C-terminal domain are important in regulating ERK7 activity. Our results indicate that autophosphorylation is not only required but is sufficient for activation of ERK7 in the absence of a putative MEK in vitro. In addition, regulation of ERK7's activity by the C-terminal domain is complex and may involve multiple interactions. Bovine serum albumin, imidazole, myelin basic protein, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma.

Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged mouse ERK2 and the HA-tagged rat ERK7 were constructed as previously described (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unique site elimination mutagenesis (23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) was performed to generate ERK7 mutants (K43R, T175R, Y177F, T175A/Y177F, 379, 410, 435, 464, 525, and 535). The mutated sequences were verified by sequencing. Plasmid DNAs were prepared by CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation or by purification through columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). COS cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10‥ fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a 95‥ air, 5‥ CO2 atmosphere. Quiescent cells were obtained by incubating cells in serum-free medium for at least 24 h. COS cells were transfected as previously described (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), except 1 × 106 cells were seeded on 100-mm plates 24 h prior to transfection with a total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μl of TransIt LT-1 (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI). For all transfections, 10‥ of the total plasmid DNA consisted of either the pRSV-β-gal or pCMV-β-gal expression vector. For the YopJ experiments, pSFFV or pSFFV-FLAG-YopJ and either pcDNA3, pcDNA3 HA-ERK7, or pcDNA3 HA-ERK2 at a 2:1 to 5:1 ratio were used. β-Galactosidase activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiency between groups as previously described (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, cells were quiesced in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to harvesting. Cell lysates from transfected cells were prepared as previously described (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cell extracts (10–60 μg of protein/lane) were resolved on an 8 or 10‥ acrylamide separating gel by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane blocking, washing, antibody incubation, and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence were performed as previously described (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Immune kinase assays were performed using ectopically expressed epitope-tagged ERK2 and ERK7 from COS cells as previously described (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Proteins were isolated by SDS-PAGE on an 8 or 15‥ acrylamide separating gel. The gels were either stained with GelCode Blue (Pierce) and dried or transferred to nitrocellulose and then subjected to autoradiography. Quantification of substrate phosphorylation was determined either by scintillation counter or by the STORM 850 system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The presence of HA-tagged or TEY-phosphorylated proteins in the immunoprecipitates was verified by Western analysis with 3F10 monoclonal and anti-phospho-ERK polyclonal antibodies, respectively. Quantification of HA-tagged and TEY-phosphorylated proteins was performed using densitometric scanning (SigmaScan Pro, Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA). Multiple exposures were utilized to verify linearity of the samples analyzed. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed in a similar fashion; however, the immune complexes were eluted prior to the kinase reaction and subjected to Western analysis. Plasmids encoding GST-c-Fos (positions 210–313) and GST-human ERK1 (GST-hERK1) were generously provided by T. Deng and M. Cobb, respectively. GST-HA-ERK7, GST-HA-ERK7 K43R, GST-HA-ERK7 T175A, and GST-HA-ERK7 Y177F were constructed using PCR to insert aBglII restriction site upstream of the HA tag. The PCR product was verified by sequencing and subsequently cloned into pGEX-2T using the BglII/BamHI and EcoRI sites. GST fusion proteins were prepared using a GST purification system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the following modifications. Briefly, 10 ml of overnight culture was diluted 1:100 to a final volume of 1000 ml and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until anA 600 value between 0.4 and 0.9 was reached. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C with shaking. The bacteria were centrifuged at 2600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was frozen at −80 °C and suspended and lysed in 100 ml of STE (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing 500 μg/ml lysozyme, 0.05‥ Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 10 min on ice, MgCl2 and DNase A were added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm and 50 μg/ml, respectively, and the lysate was incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of 50‥ (v/v) GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were washed four times with STE containing 0.05‥ Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and twice with STE. The fusion proteins were eluted with 500 μl of 10 mm reduced GSH and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Free GSH was removed by dialysis against STE for 1 h at 4 °C. Thrombin cleavage was performed to remove the GST as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 50‥ ethylene glycol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl. Both eluted and thrombin-cleaved proteins were quantified using a BCA protein assay as specified by the manufacturer (Pierce) or separated on 10‥ or 15‥ SDS-PAGE and quantified by densitometric scanning using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A polyhistidine His6tag was added to the C-terminal end of HA-ERK7 and HA-ERK7 K43R using PCR. The PCR products were inserted into pETBlue-2 as specified by the manufacturer (Novagen, Madison, WI). The PCR products were verified by sequencing. The His6-tagged proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain Tuner (DE3)pLysI (Novagen) and purified using TALON resin (CLONTECH) as previously described (24Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced at an A 600 of 0.4–0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were lysed in buffer A (0.05‥ Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 500 μg/ml lysozyme, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). MgCl and DNase A were used, and the lysate was cleared as described above for the GST fusion proteins. The supernatants were diluted 1:1 in buffer A, and imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The lysate was incubated with TALON resin equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mmimidazole. After washing with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, the proteins were eluted with 2 volumes of 200 mm imidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl. The elutions were concentrated using Centricon-50 concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Proteins were quantified using the Bradford protein assay or separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified by densitometric scanning using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the first dimension, GST-HA-ERK7, GST-HA-ERK7 T175A, or GST-HA-ERK7 Y177F (5 μg) was applied to Immobiline Dry Strips (pH 3–10 L or 6–11 L) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2‥ CHAPS, 18 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5‥ IPG buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), bromphenol blue) and subjected to flatbed electrophoresis for 12 h at 30 V, 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, and 10–20 h at 8000 V. For the second dimension, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on an 8 or 10‥ acrylamide separating gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Purified GST fusion proteins or His6-tagged proteins were incubated in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mmd-nitrophenylphosphate, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) with each substrate at 30 °C for varying lengths of time. Reactions were terminated by adding 4× Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were subsequently processed as described above for the immune complex kinase assay. When applicable, statistical significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance. Differences identified by analysis of variance were quantitated by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. ERK1, ERK2, and ERK5 participate in signal transduction pathways originating from receptor tyrosine kinases, and their immediate activating kinases have been identified as MEK1 and -2 for ERK1 and -2 (13Crews C.M.

To determine whether activation of ERK7 is regulated by a MEK with a similar inhibitory profile, we tested the effect of U0126 on the activation of ERK7. We pretreated cells with U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor that blocked nearly 100‥ of ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation following PMA treatment (25Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J.

Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). We found that pretreatment with 30 μm of U0126 completely inhibited TEY phosphorylation of ERK2 with serum stimulation but failed to inhibit TEY phosphorylation of ERK7 (Fig.1). Similar results were obtained with PD98059 (data not shown), a less potent inhibitor that also suppresses ERK activation by MEK1, -2, and -5 (26Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 27Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the putative MEK for ERK7 is not MEK1, MEK2, MEK5 or a novel MEK with a similar inhibitory profile. The virulence factor from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, YopJ, inhibits the ERK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK pathways as well as the nuclear factor κB pathway (22Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.B. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 28Palmer L.E. Pancetti A.R. Greenberg S. Bliska J.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 708-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 33-kDa protein was recently shown to function by binding members of the MAPK kinase family, blocking their phosphorylation and activation (22Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.B. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of YopJ on ERK7 to determine if a related member of the MAPK kinase family activates ERK7. As expected, co-transfection of YopJ inhibited the TEY phosphorylation of HA-tagged ERK2 following stimulation with EGF in COS7 cells (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, YopJ failed to inhibit TEY phosphorylation of HA-tagged ERK7 in similarly transfected, serum-starved COS7 cells (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that, if there is an upstream activator for ERK7, it is distinct from other known members of the MAPK kinase family, and they raise the possibility that ERK7 can be constitutively TEY-phosphorylated in the absence of an upstream activator. The findings that both U0126 and YopJ do not inhibit TEY phosphorylation of ERK7 and our previous finding that the K43R mutant of ERK7 is not TEY-phosphorylated suggest that autophosphorylation is sufficient for ERK7 activation. To address this possibility, we determined whether ERK7 was phosphorylated in the TEY activation domain when expressed in bacteria in the absence of an upstream activator. Thus, both HA-tagged ERK7 and the K43R mutant were fused in frame at the C-terminal end of GST. Following expression in E. coli and purification by glutathione-Sepharose, Western analysis with anti-GST and anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3 A) indicated that both proteins were partially degraded despite the extensive use of protease inhibitors. Nevertheless, identification of the full-length fusion proteins was possible using an anti-ERK7 antiserum that recognizes the terminal 14 amino acids of ERK7 (Fig. 3 A,anti-ERK7 panel). Western analysis using the anti-phospho-ERK antibody, which specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated TEY motif, indicated that bacterially expressed GST-HA-ERK7 was significantly more TEY-phosphorylated than the similarly processed GST fusion protein of human ERK1 (GST-hERK1) (Fig.3 A, Anti-PhosphoERK panel). As observed for ERK7 deletion mutants in mammalian cells, the lower molecular weight GST-HA-ERK7 degradation products (Fig. 3 A,Anti-GST and Anti-HA panels), which correspond to truncated proteins lacking the C terminus, are not recognized by the anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Fig. 3 A, Anti-PhosphoERK panel). In addition, the GST-HA-ERK7 K43R mutant was not recognized by the anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Fig. 3 A,Anti-PhosphoERK panel), which is also consistent with previous studies in mammalian cells (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The fidelity of the anti-phospho-ERK antibody for the dually phosphorylated TEY motif was verified using comparable amounts of the TEY activation domain mutants T175A, Y177F, and T175A/Y177F as previously described (data not shown) (12Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine the extent of TEY phosphorylation of bacterially expressed ERK7, two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed. Western analysis using the anti-HA antibody revealed a complex pattern of GST-HA-ERK7, GST-HA-ERK7 T175A, and GST-HA-ERK7 Y177F species across a wide molecular weight range and within a pI range much lower than the theoretical pI value of 9.10 for GST-HA-ERK7 (data not shown). These species presumably represent multiply phosphorylated full-length and C-terminally degraded GST-HA-ERK7. Closer examination of the higher molecular weight species corresponding to full-length or nearly full-length GST-HA-ERK7 indicates that only a few species are not recognized by the anti-phospho ERK antibody (Fig. 3 B,first and second panels). As expected, species with dual phosphorylation of the TEY activation site are more acidic. On the other hand, the higher molecular weight species of the GST-HA-ERK7 TEY mutants are more basic, consistent with only partial TEY phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, third andfourth panels). Together, these results indicate that the majority of full-length or nearly full-length ERK7 expressed in bacteria is dually TEY-phosphorylated in the absence of any upstream activator. Since the activation domain was phosphorylated, we tested whether the bacterially expressed GST-HA-ERK7 fusion protein has kinase activity. GST, GST"

The nuclear export receptor Crm1 is essential in this process by recognizing the NES motif. Here, we show that the oncogenic hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) contains a functional NES motif. We found that the predominant cytoplasmic localization of HBx is sensitive to the drug leptomycin B (LMB), which specifically inactivates Crm1. Mutations at the two conserved leucine residues to alanine at the NES motif (L98A,L100A) resulted in a nuclear redistribution of HBx. A recombinant HBx protein binds to Crm1 in vitro. In addition, ectopic expression of HBx sequesters Crm1 in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, HBx activates NFκB by inducing its nuclear translocation in a NES-dependent manner. Abnormal cytoplasmic sequestration of Crm1, accompanied by a nuclear localization of NFκB, was also observed in hepatocytes from HBV-positive liver samples with chronic active hepatitis.

Therefore, the precise mechanism related to its effector remains unknown and none of these studies satisfactorily explain the pleiotropic effects associated with HBx. Close inspection of the HBx sequence revealed a short, hydrophobic, leucine-rich nuclear export signal motif (NES) (Fig. 1 A). An NES is located in the center region of HBx (residues 89–100). The center region of HBx is retained in HCC frequently and is essential for its transactivation (22Kumar V. Jayasuryan N. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5647-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Ritter S.E. Whitten T.M. Quets A.T. Schloemer R.H.

This region also is conserved among HBx from different subtypes (Fig. 1 A). Several viral proteins including HIV-1 Rev, HTLV-1 Rex, and adenovirus E4 34-kDa proteins contain functional NESs (Fig. 1 A). Similar to HBx, Rev and Rex also are potent viral and cellular transactivators with no apparent DNA binding property (25Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 26Dobbelstein M. Roth J. Kimberly W.T. Levine A.J. Shenk T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4276-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, NESs also have been identified in cellular proteins, many of which are involved in transcription, cell signaling cascade, oncogenic transformation, and cell cycle regulators. Examples include protein kinase inhibitor, MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), TFIIIA, Mdm2, p53, IκBα, NF-AT, cyclin B1, c-Abl, and 14-3-3 (reviewed in Ref.27Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The activities of these proteins are tightly regulated by their NESs. The nuclear export receptor Crm1 and its cofactor Ran GTPase are essential in this process by recognizing NESs and mediating nuclear protein export (27Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). In addition, previous results indicate that Crm1 may be involved in maintaining chromosomal integrity (29Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and Ran may play a key role in regulating mitosis initiation by stimulating spindle formation (30Wilde A. Zheng Y.

Mutation of the hydrophobic leucine residues to alanines have been shown to disrupt NES function in a number of proteins, including HIV-rev, E4 34-kDa, p53, Mdm2, and cyclin B1 (25Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 26Dobbelstein M. Roth J. Kimberly W.T. Levine A.J. Shenk T.

In this study, we have investigated the hypothesis that the pleiotropic effects associated with HBx may be contributed by the presence of a NES motif, and HBx may activate cellular gene expression and induce oncogenicity through the modulation of Crm1-mediated functions. We have identified a functional NES motif in HBx. This motif is necessary for HBx-induced cytoplasmic sequestration of Crm1, and subsequently, the nuclear translocation and activation of NFκB. Cytoplasmic retention of Crm1 also is found in liver samples with chronic active hepatitis infected with HBV, a condition that is predisposing individuals to the development of HCC. We suggest that the inactivation of the Crm1-mediated pathway may be an early step during viral hepatitis-mediated liver carcinogenesis. The plasmid pcDNA3-HBxadr-Hatag was constructed by the insertion of a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged full-length HBx into the BamHI andHindIII sites of a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). GFP-HBx and GFP-HBx-NESM were constructed as follows: a 529-base pair fragment released from the digestion of pcDNA3-HBxadr-Hatag withHindIII/ApaI and inserted into pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) at theHindIII/ApaI sites. The resulting GFP-HBx is an N-terminal fusion of HBx with GFP and a C-terminal fusion with HA tag. GFP-HBx-NESM was made by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis protocol using GFP-HBx as a template. To generate the HBx-NES mutant (L98A,G99A,L100A), 2 HBx fragments were amplified by PCR using primer pairs (5′-GCTGCTGCATCAGCAATGTCAACAACCGAC-3′/5′-ATGCTCTAGAGGCAGAGGTGAAAAAGTTGCATGG-3′ and 5′-TGCAGCAGCAGTCCTCTTATGTAAGAGCTT-3′/5′-TATAAAGCTTGGTACCGAGCTCGGATCTGATGGC-3′). The 2 PCR DNA fragments were denatured and reannealed. Then the HBx-NES mutant was generated by PCR with primers (5′-TATAAAGCTTGGTACCGAGCTCGGATCTGATGGC-3′ and 5′-ATGCTCTAGAGGCAGAGGTGAAAAAGTTGCATGG-3′) and was subcloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The GFP-NLS-NES and GFP-NLS-NESM constructs were made by the strategy described previously (34Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SV40 NLS motif (residues 125–133) was fused to GFP by the cloning of oligos TNLS1 (5′-TCGAGATCCCCCCAAGAAGAAGCGCAAGGTGGAGCA-3′/TNLS2 5′-AGCTTGCTCCACCTTGCGCTTCTTCTTGGGGGGATC-3′) into plasmid pGFPF-C1 (CLONTECH) to generate GFP-NLS. GFP-NES and GFP-NESM were constructed by cloning oligos XNESW1 (5′-AATTCTCAGGTCTTGCCCAAGCTCTTACATAAGAGGACTCTTGGACTCTCAGCAATG-3′)/XNESW2 (5′-GATCCATTGCTGAGAGTCCAAGAGTCCTCTTATGTAAGAGCTTGGGCAAGACCTGAG-3′) or XNESM3 (5′-AATTCTCAGGTCTTGCCCAAGCTCTTACATAAGAGGACTGCTGGAGCCTCAGCAATG-3′)- /XNESM4 (5′-GATCCATTGCTGAGGCTCCAGCAGTCCTCTTATGTAAGAGCTTGGGCAAGACCTGAG-3′), respectively, into GFP-NLS, resulting in a GFP-NLS-NES or GFP-NLS-NESM fusion protein. The NES motif corresponds to the HBx residues 87–103, while NESM is the HBx-NES motif with mutations at the conserved leucine residues (L98A and L100A). pSVCM contains a GFP-CRM1 fusion gene under the control of a CMV promoter (28Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). pNFκB-Luc, provided by John Brady (NCI), contains a luciferase gene under the promoter containing 4 NFκB responsive elements. Normal primary human fibroblasts were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ). These cells were grown in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and were used before passage 12. A telomerase-immortalized human fibroblast line (NHF-hTERT), a gift of Dr. Judy Campisi, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Normal primary human hepatocytes were purchased from Clonetics (BioWittaker), grown in LCM (BioWittaker), and used only at passage 1. Hep3B cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Microinjection of NHF cells was done essentially as described previously (35Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Transfection of NHF-hTERT and Hep3B cells was carried out by the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent based on the recommended protocol described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). For the luciferase reporter assay, cells were seeded into 6-well dishes (Costar) at 50% confluence, co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pNFkB-Luc or pNFAT-Luc, along with 2 μg of each of various HBx constructs, in the presence or absence of TNFα (10 ng/ml). A total of 0.5 μg of pRL-null or 0.003 μg of pRL-CMV was added into each transfection as an internal control. pEGFPC1 was used to keep the total amount of plasmid DNA constant. Cells were then incubated for 24 h prior to harvesting. The luciferase activity was carried out by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were measured in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The luciferase activity was expressed as fold activation against the untreated reporter by itself, which was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity for the transfection efficiency. The reported results represent at least three independent transfections. For immunocytochemistry analysis, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, followed by methanol for 20 min at 24 h postmicroinjection, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline-plus (0.15% glycine, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline). The GFP fusion proteins can be visualized directly in a fluorescence microscope equipped with an fluorescein isothiocyanate filter with or without fixation. The HBx expression also was verified by an anti-HBx monoclonal antibody (data not shown). NFκB was detected using an anti-NFκB polyclonal antibody (1:100) (Santa Cruz) and Crm1 was detected using an anti-Crm1 polyclonal antibody (1:100). Both antibodies were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein or Texas Red (Vector Laboratories) was used (1:300) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The following criteria were used to define the subcellular localization, preferentially cytoplasmic localization: protein signals mostly intense in the cytoplasm; preferentially nuclear localization: protein signals mostly intense in the nucleus. Some of the slides were analyzed with a blind fashion to avoid any bias. For GFP-NLS reporter expression, cells on the same coverslip were microinjected with GFP-NLS, GFP-NLS-XNES, or GFP-NLS-XNESM construct and incubated for 6 h. Cells were monitored under a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope and representative images were taken using a high-performance CCD imaging system (IP Lab Spectrum) with the same exposure time. For co-localization of Crm1 and HBx analysis, cells were co-stained with anti-HBx and anti-Crm1 antibodies with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Texas Red or fluorescein, and analyzed by a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal system. Sequential excitation at 488 and 568 nm was provided by a krypton-argon gas laser. Emission filters of 598/40 and 522/32 were used for sequentially collecting red and green fluorescence in channels 1 and 2, respectively. Z-sections were collected at 0.5-μm intervals for each cell using LaserSharp software. Images were analyzed by Confocal Assistant software. In vitro binding between HBx and hCrm1 was determined with the in vitrotranslated HBx and hCrm1 (16Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged HBx and the hCrm1 proteins were made by the one-step TnT in vitro transcription and translation system (Promega), as described previously (16Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), from pcDNA-HA-HBx and hCrm1Blue744 vectors (gift of Dr. Gerard Grosveld), respectively. Aliquots of HBx (25 μl) and hCrm1 (45 μl) were mixed together in CBBL buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of 0.2 mm GTPγS and 80 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation, beads were washed four times with CBBL buffer. The bound proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Crm1 was detected by Western blotting using anti-Crm1 antibody and followed by the Amersham ECL system. A 10% of in vitrotranslated hCrm1 was loaded in parallel as the input. A total of 12 samples were included in this part of the study. Histopathologically, they included 5 normal liver samples, 7 viral hepatitis cases showing grades 1 to 2 activity according to the criteria of Scheuer (36Scheuer P.J. J. Hepatol. 1991; 13: 372-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). In addition to H & E light microscopy, tissue sections were cut from frozen samples with a thickness of 4 μm and mounted on electrically charged glass slides. The sections were fixed in absolute alcohol and then washed with 2 changes of phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min each. They were then quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide to block the endogenous peroxidase activity for 30 min. Following incubation with 10% horse serum to block the nonspecific binding, the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CRM1 antibodies. The sections were prepared in duplicate and two anti-CRM1 antibodies were used, including a goat anti-Crm1 antibody from Santa Cruz at a 1:10 dilution (Santa Cruz) and a rabbit anti-Crm1 polyclonal antibody (Gift from Gerard Grosveld) at a 1:100 dilution. A rabbit anti-NFκB antibody (anti-p65) (Santa Cruz) was used at a 1:100 dilution for staining NFκB. Biotinylated secondary antibodies and streptavidin peroxidase complex (LSAB) were used. Chromogenic development was obtained by the immersion of sections in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution (0.25 mg/ml with 3% hydrogen peroxide). The slides were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin and re-hydrated with alcohol and xylene. Slides were evaluated in a blind fashion. To test if HBx-NES functions in nuclear protein export, we first investigated whether the subcellular localization of HBx is sensitive to LMB, an antitumor agent that selectively binds to and blocks Crm1-mediated nuclear export (37Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 38Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7491-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings (18Elmore L.W. Hancock A.R. Chang S.F. Wang X.W. Chang S. Callahan C.P. Geller D.A. Will H. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), HBx was localized in the cytoplasm predominately with a punctate staining pattern in appearance when expressed transiently in normal human fibroblasts (NHF) (Fig. 1) and in a HCC-derived cell line (Hep3B) (data not shown). However, LMB treatment causes an increase in nuclear accumulation of HBx (Fig. 1,B and C). Next, we used a GFP protein export reporter assay described previously (34Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) to further test if the HBx-NES oligopeptide functions in nuclear protein export (34Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). This reporter uses a nuclear localization signal (NLS) fused to a GFP, thereby inducing nuclear localization of the fusion protein. Consistently, the GFP-NLS reporter was localized in the nucleus of NHF exclusively. However, when an HBx-NES was fused to this reporter, the resulting GFP-NLS-XNES fusion protein can be found in the cytoplasm with a diffused staining pattern in appearance, although no nuclear exclusion of this reporter protein could be observed (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, GFP-NLS-XNESM that contains a mutated HBx-NES oligopeptide (L98A,L100A) does not localize in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 D). To further examine if cytoplasmic localization of a full-length HBx is dependent on the presence of an NES, a GFP-HBx fusion gene (HBx) or an NES-mutated GFP-HBx fusion gene (HBxNESM) was constructed. Again, GFP-HBx was localized in the cytoplasm predominantly with a punctate pattern in appearance, while HBxNESM was found mainly in the nucleus with a diffused pattern (Fig. 1 E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that HBx-NES is functional in Crm1-mediated nuclear protein export. Nuclear export receptor Crm1 is known to interact with proteins containing NESs and to mediate nuclear protein export. The majority of Crm1 protein is found in the nucleus of normal cells (39Kudo N. Khochbin S. Nishi K. Kitano K. Yanagida M. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29742-29751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Consistently, every NHF cell displays an endogenous nuclear-diffused Crm1 distribution (Fig.2). When HBx was expressed transiently in NHF, Crm1 was often found in the cytoplasm with a punctate staining pattern. Approximately 39% ± 2 of the HBx-expressing NHF cells displayed co-localization of Crm1, and over 99% of cytoplasmic punctate Crm1 signals were co-localized with HBx (Fig. 2 A). The punctate staining patterns containing both Crm1 and HBx signals were not always the same in appearance (Fig. 2 A, panels c-l). These results suggest that the cytoplasmic HBx and Crm1 are not necessarily associated with a single subcellular component. In contrast, no cytoplasmic co-localization was found in NHF cells expressing HBxNESM. These data indicate that HBx was able to partially retain Crm1 in the cytoplasm and suggest that HBx binds to Crm1in vivo. Consistently, in vitro translated HBx can physically interact with in vitro translated Crm1 (Fig.2 B). HBx can activate NFκB and other cellular transcription factors including NF-AT and MAP kinase cascade, although the mechanism of activation is unknown (14Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 40Meyer M. Caselmann W.H. Schluter V. Schreck R. Hofschneider P.H. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 41Cross J.C. Wen P. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8078-8082Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because NFκB is inactivated normally through its binding to IκBα which is sequestrated in the cytoplasm by Crm1-mediated nuclear export (42Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we examined whether HBx-NES is responsible for the activation of NFκB. Over 97% of normal dividing NHF cells display a predominant localization of NFκB in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, ∼55 ± 7% of HBx-expressing NHF cells show a preferentially nuclear distribution of NFκB, while an NES mutated HBx (HBxNESM) has lost this activity (Fig. 3, A andB). Next, we used a luciferase reporter that contains NFκB responsive elements (pNFkB-Luc) to investigate if the HBx-induced nuclear localization of NFκB correlates with its activity. pNFκB-Luc was co-transfected with HBx or HBxNESM into an hTERT-immortalized NHF (NHF-hTERT) or a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hep3B) in the absence or presence of TNFα, an agent known to sensitize HBx-mediated transactivation (9Andrisani O.M. Barnabas S. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 373-379PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, HBx alone induced the luciferase activity weakly which could be further enhanced by the treatment of TNFα in both NHF-hTERT and Hep3B cells. In contrast, HBxNESM is devoid of its ability to increase luciferase activity even in the presence of TNFα (Fig. 3 C). To investigate if Crm1 is sequestrated cytoplasmically in liver samples from chronic active hepatitis patients with HBV infection, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis of Crm1 in frozen tissue sections or in paraffin-embedded sections by anti-Crm1 polyclonal antibody. A total of 12 liver samples with samples from 5 normal individuals were included in this study. The presence of HBV DNA including Core, preS, and HBx genes in these samples was verified by PCR (data not shown). Among 7 HBV positive cases, liver samples show chronic active hepatitis with grades 1 to 2 activity (TableI). While 5/5 normal samples revealed nuclear Crm1 staining exclusively, 6/7 HBV samples showed cytoplasmic Crm1 staining (Fig. 4 and Table I) in hepatocytes. An anti-NFκB antibody was also used to determine the status of NFκB in these liver samples. Again, normal liver samples revealed mainly a cytoplasmic localization of NFκB while HBV positive liver samples showed a nuclear distribution of NFκB. The above findings provide an in vivo physiological significance for the presence of a cytoplasmic sequestration of Crm1 accompanied by an activation of NFκB associated with HBV infection.Table ICytoplasmic sequestration of Crm1 and nuclear localization of NFκB associated with HBV-infected liver samplesCase numberHistologyGrade 1-aHistology was determined according to the criteria of Scheuer.

Open table in a new tab We have demonstrated that the oncogenic HBx contains a functional NES, and that this NES is required for the HBx-mediated activation of the NFκB signaling cascade. We also have shown that HBx is able to bind to and sequester Crm1 in the cytoplasm, which correlates with the nuclear localization and activation of NFκB. Furthermore, liver samples from HBV-infected patients with chronic active hepatitis, a condition predisposing individuals for the development of liver cancer, also display cytoplasmic sequestration of Crm1 and nuclear localization of NFκB. It is possible that HBx may use a Crm1-dependent mechanism to modulate cellular gene transcription. Our data provide a plausible model whereby HBx may induce oncogenicity through the modulation of the Crm1-mediated pathway. The studies described in this report may offer a common mechanism to explain the pleiotropic effects of HBx. First, Crm1 transports and controls many cellular proteins including NFκB, NF-AT, MAPKK, and p53, whose activities are known to be regulated by HBx (14Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 17Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W. Yeh H. Forrester K. Sturzbecher H.W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7066-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Second, Crm1 also regulates cytoplasmic mRNA transport. Inactivation of Crm1 by HBx, in principle, would alter the stability of mRNA thereby influencing gene expression. Consistent with this hypothesis is our findings that HBx is able to sequester Crm1 in the cytoplasm. The HBx-NES is essential for sequestering Crm1 in the cytoplasm and for the activation of NFκB. Inactivation of Crm1-mediated nuclear protein export is known to activate this target (44Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9108-9115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Therefore, the promiscuous transactivation-mediated by HBx may be a secondary effect resulting from alteration of Crm1 function. An alternative mechanism for HBx to activate NFκB is through the degradation of IκBα in the cytoplasm by inducing its phosphorylation and ubiquitination. However, we did not observe any detectable degradation of IκBα in cells expressing HBx by Western blot analysis with anti-IκBα antibody (data not shown). This also correlates with our results that HBx alone only displays a weak activation of NFκB that can be enhanced significantly by TNFα (Fig.3 C). It is possible that a small degree of dissociation of the NFκB-IκBα complex, followed by the degradation of IκBα induced by HBx in the cytoplasm, may contribute to the nuclear localization of NFκB. A recent study by Weil and colleagues (45Weil R. Sirma H. Giannini C. Kremsdorf D. Bessia C. Dargemont C. Brechot C. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6345-6354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that HBx may induce the nuclear import of NFκB/IκBα by binding to IκBα. Interestingly, the region of IκBα that is critical for HBx-induced nuclear import of IκBα contains a functional NES (45Weil R. Sirma H. Giannini C. Kremsdorf D. Bessia C. Dargemont C. Brechot C. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6345-6354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with our data that HBx-induced nuclear localization of NFκB/IκBα is dependent on the IκBα-NES. HBx is thought to be small enough to diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complex. The fact that this oncogenic viral protein has acquired NES activity, is preferentially localized in the cytoplasm, and modified nuclear export implies that nuclear export may be an important target for viral-mediated oncogenesis. Interestingly, cellular oncoproteins such as c-Abl and Mdm2 are known to be involved in a Crm1-dependent nuclear export. Analogous to viral hepatitis oncoprotein, the cellular oncoproteins, in principle, may induce neoplastic transformation also through the disruption of the Crm1-mediated mechanism. It is known that TPR and CAN are nuclear pore complex-associated proteins that act as the docking sites and are essential for Crm1-mediated nuclear export (27Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Earlier findings demonstrated that the TPR and CAN genes are mutated through translocation in thyroid carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (46von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J.

In addition, Crm1 and Ran may play a role in mitosis initiation (29Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 30Wilde A. Zheng Y.

It is possible that the inactivation of Crm1 and Ran may induce genomic instability, a predisposing factor for cancer development.

Aggretin belongs to the heterodimeric snake C-type lectin family and is thought to activate platelets by binding to platelet glycoprotein α2β1. We now show that binding to glycoprotein (GP) Ib is also required. Aggretin-induced platelet activation was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to GPIb as well as by antibodies to α2β1. Binding of both of these platelet receptors to aggretin was confirmed by affinity chromatography. No binding of other major platelet membrane glycoproteins, in particular GPVI, to aggretin was detected. Aggretin also activates platelets from Fc receptor γ chain (Fcγ)-deficient mice to a greater extent than those from normal control mice, showing that it does not use the GPVI/Fcγ pathway. Platelets from Fcγ-deficient mice expressed fibrinogen receptors normally in response to collagen, although they did not aggregate, indicating that these platelets may partly compensate via other receptors including α2β1 or GPIb for the lack of the Fcγ pathway. Signaling by aggretin involves a dose-dependent lag phase followed by rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins. Among these are p72SYK, p125FAK, and PLCγ2, whereas, in comparison with collagen and convulxin, the Fcγ subunit neither is phosphorylated nor coprecipitates with p72SYK. This supports an independent, GPIb- and integrin-based pathway for activation of p72SYK not involving the Fcγ receptor.

Resting platelets using several receptors adhering to subendothelium of damaged blood vessels are activated and spread to provide finally a new nonthrombogenic surface until vasculature regeneration occurs. Reversible binding between GPIb-V-IX1 and von Willebrand factor, associated with collagen, is crucial to slow down the platelet (especially under high shear) so that it can bind more firmly via other receptors (3Lankhof H. van Hoeij M. Schiphorst M.E. Bracke M. Wu Y.P. Ijsseldijk M.J. Vink T. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Moroi M. Jung S.M. Nomura S. Sekiguchi S. Ordinas A. Diaz-Ricart M. Blood. 1997; 90: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism strongly parallels that of the selectins in leukocyte adhesion (5McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11025-11028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Another important receptor is the α2β1 integrin, which is essential for anchoring the platelet to collagen in the subendothelium (6Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and for linking to the platelet cytoskeleton to prevent the receptor being torn from the membrane by the forces that it has to withstand. Activation induces the release of storage granules and the expression of new receptors on the platelet surface (7White J.G. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 497-498PubMed Google Scholar) as well as changes in other receptors such as the fibrinogen receptor, αIIbβ3, which is critical for spreading. Although GPIb-V-IX and α2β1 also participate in signaling to the platelet interior (8Asazuma N. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Yatomi Y. Handa M. Fujimura Y. Miura S. Kume S. Blood. 1997; 90: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Polanowska-Grabowska R. Geanacopoulos M. Gear A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), recent studies, particularly in patients with platelet receptor deficiencies, have implicated GPVI/Fcγ as a major collagen receptor for platelet activation (10Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 11Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 63-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Patients with platelets lacking any one of these receptors (GPIb-V-IX, α2β1, or GPVI/Fcγ) have increased bleeding times, and platelet adhesion to subendothelium or collagen is defective under flow conditions (13Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W. Houdijk W.P. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Because adhesion is rapid, the function of the individual receptor classes is difficult to assess. Inhibition of any of them can prevent platelet activation but does not indicate which synergies provide the final activating signal. In analyzing the mechanisms of each of these steps, reagents that bind to and activate platelets via individual receptor types are important tools. Convulxin, a C-type lectin from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus, the tropical rattlesnake, activates platelets by binding to and clustering the GPVI/Fcγ receptor (15Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Several other snake venom proteins are potent platelet activators and may act via collagen-like mechanisms. Some of these, including trimucytin from Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus(16Teng C.M. Ko F.N. Tsai I.H. Hung M.L. Huang T.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and aggretin from Calloselasma rhodostoma (17Huang T.F. Liu C.Z. Yang S.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), have been reported to involve α2β1 on platelets as receptor. We isolated a protein from C. rhodostoma venom that is a powerful platelet activator. This is most likely aggretin as described by Huang et al. (17Huang T.F. Liu C.Z. Yang S.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), based on the molecular mass, sequence of subunits (18Chung C.H. Au L.C. Huang T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and properties in activating platelets. Like aggretin it also belongs to the snake C-type lectin family. A C-type lectin from the same species, termed rhodocytin, was described later (19Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with N-terminal sequences identical to those of aggretin, but it was reported to have some different properties. The mechanism of rhodocytin action on platelets was recently investigated (20Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1643-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showing that rhodocytin interacts with the α2-subunit of α2β1 on the platelet surface. On the other hand, Eble et al. (22Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have reported that rhodocytin does not bind to a recombinant α2β1 complex. We now show that aggretin activates platelets via interaction with GPIb as well as α2β1; however, GPVI/Fcγ is not required. This mechanism via GPIb and α2β1may also be relevant to activation of platelets via collagen.DISCUSSIONSeveral earlier studies reported proteins from the venom ofC. rhodostoma that activate platelets, and it was suggested that one of these, called aggregoserpentin or aggretin, acts via α2β1 (17Huang T.F. Liu C.Z. Yang S.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Aggretin was recently cloned, and the full amino acid sequence was established (18Chung C.H. Au L.C. Huang T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We isolated a protein from C. rhodostoma venom that has N-terminal sequences of α- and β-subunits identical to aggretin. This protein has a molecular mass of 28 kDa with subunits of 12 and 14 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Under nondenaturing conditions by gel filtration this protein has a molecular mass around 60 kDa. This implies that two subunits of the protein are linked together by disulfide bridges and that two heterodimers interact noncovalently to form tetramers. Aggretin aggregated platelets in a dose-dependent manner with a long lag phase as previously described (17Huang T.F. Liu C.Z. Yang S.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).In all previous reports (17Huang T.F. Liu C.Z. Yang S.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Chung C.H. Au L.C. Huang T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) the authors showed that aggretin acts via the α2β1 receptor. We confirmed that aggretin binds to α2β1 but showed that it binds to GPIb as well. GPIb involvement in activation of platelets via aggretin was shown by affinity chromatography and inhibition of aggretin-induced platelet aggregation using an anti-GPIb monoclonal antibody. The monoclonal antibody VM16d completely inhibited aggretin-induced platelet aggregation as well as changes in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. Other monoclonal antibodies against GPIb (lb-23, SZ-2, and AP-1) did not inhibit aggretin-induced platelet activation. This indicates that the aggretin-binding site on GPIbα is limited to the same region as the epitope for VM16d, on the complex double-loop domain (27Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both GPIb and α2β1were detected in eluted material specifically bound to biotinylated aggretin-avidin-Sepharose. These receptors bound to aggretin only when the platelet lysate was prepared in the absence of EDTA or EGTA. When the platelet lysate was prepared with EDTA, proteins were not specifically bound to aggretin, showing that divalent cations are important for aggretin interactions with platelet receptors. It is not yet clear whether divalent cations are necessary for the active structure of aggretin or whether they are necessary for receptors to maintain a structure that is recognized by aggretin.Shin and Morita (19Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) isolated a C-type lectin that activates platelets from venom of C. rhodostoma that they called rhodocytin. They did not establish an activation mechanism but showed that it was not via GPIb. The N-terminal sequences that they determined are identical with the first 22 and 19 amino acids, respectively, of aggretin. Recently, the same group reported that the α2subunit of α2β1 is involved in the platelet interaction with rhodocytin and investigated some aspects of signal transduction occurring in platelets after activation with rhodocytin (20Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1643-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The situation has been complicated by a recent report that rhodocytin does not bind to a recombinant α2β1 complex, whereas another C. rhodostoma venom C-type lectin, rhodocetin, composed of noncovalently associated α- and β-subunits with different sequences than those of aggretin or rhodocytin, bound strongly to the recombinant complex and blocked its binding to collagen (22Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).In earlier studies, lack of involvement of GPIb as a receptor for aggretin or rhodocytin was based on the failure of monoclonal antibodies or echicetin to affect platelet activation. In fact, Shin and Morita (19Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) do show an increase in the lag phase response to rhodocytin in the presence of echicetin, and the slope of aggregation was also slightly inhibited. We also found that echicetin had a minor inhibitory effect on platelet responses to low concentrations of aggretin (data not shown). The monoclonal antibodies that had no effect on aggretin were AP-1 and 6D1 (17Huang T.F. Liu C.Z. Yang S.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding site for aggretin on GPIb must partly overlap with the echicetin-binding site but not with the epitopes of AP-1, 6D1, SZ-2, or Ib-23. On the other hand, VM16d shares the same binding site as aggretin. VM16d is a well characterized monoclonal antibody to GPIb with its epitope in the double-loop region (27Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that inhibits thrombin-binding but not von Willebrand factor binding (28Mazurov A.V. Vinogradov D.V. Vlasik T.N. Repin V.S. Booth W.J. Berndt M.C. Thromb. Res. 1991; 62: 673-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and must therefore bind to one face of the GPIbα molecule. These results suggest that the previous studies did not detect aggretin (rhodocytin) binding to GPIb because the anti-GPIb reagents used did not bind to the same region (or face) of GPIb.Considerable evidence has accumulated that among the potential candidates for collagen receptors, at least α2β1 and GPVI/Fcγ are critical. It was suggested earlier that α2β1 is essentially an adhesion receptor, whereas GPVI/Fcγ is the main activation receptor for collagen, although this is controversial (11Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 29Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Zijenah L.S. Goodall A.H. Humphries M.J. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

Collagen-related peptides based on a repetitive GP*P sequence (where *P is hydroxyproline) signal via Fcγ to activate p72SYK and PLCγ2 (31Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M.

Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To establish whether or not aggretin requires the GPVI/Fcγ receptor, the effects of aggretin on platelets from Fcγ-negative mice were compared with those on normal mouse platelets (Fig. 5). Platelet binding of fluorescein-labeled fibrinogen was used to monitor the activation of GPIIb-IIIa as a marker of platelet stimulation. Control experiments with convulxin, showed a clear difference between the two types of mouse platelets with a strong activation of GPIIb-IIIa on the control mouse platelets, whereas the Fcγ-negative platelets were not activated (Fig. 5 A). Our results with convulxin on the Fcγ-deficient mouse platelets support those obtained by Gibbins et al. (34Gibbins J.M. Briddon S. Shutes A. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34437-34443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as well as earlier studies with collagen-related peptides and GPVI-deficient human platelets (31Kehrel B.

Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confirm our earlier conclusions that convulxin acts via GPVI (15Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In the case of aggretin, platelets from both types of mice responded.Surprisingly, although the normal mouse platelets reacted strongly, the Fcγ-deficient platelets responded even more powerfully (Fig.5 B), suggesting either that more GPIb/α2β1 is expressed or that signaling via these receptors is up-regulated by the loss of the Fcγ pathway. Both types of platelet also aggregated in response to aggretin. The GPIIb-IIIa responses of both the Fcγ-deficient platelets and the normal platelets to collagen were almost identical (Fig. 5 C) (note that total GPIIb-IIIa activation after 2 min was measured here; therefore differences in rates were not studied). However, neither Fcγ-deficient mouse nor GPVI-deficient human platelets (31Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Okuma M. Barnes M.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) aggregate to collagen. Therefore, a signal from GPVI/Fcγ is essential for the aggregation response to collagen. The clear results obtained with convulxin as well as Western blot studies with anti-Fcγ antibodies (data not shown) confirmed the Fcγ-deficient status of these platelets. Keely and Parise (35Keely P.J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26668-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that FcγRIIA played an essential role in activation of platelets via cross-linking with antibodies to α2β1. Because mouse platelets do not express FcγRIIA (36Kato Y. Hori S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that this receptor is involved in platelet activation by aggretin.Earlier studies on Fcγ-deficient mouse platelets reported that they show only low responses to collagen (37Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P.

Although the exposure of the fibrinogen-binding sites is not identical to aggregation, a close correlation might be expected between these two parameters. However, Poole et al. (37Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) did not study aggregation to collagen with the Fcγ-deficient mouse platelets. In the case of human platelets from a patient with GPVI deficiency, also lacking Fcγ (38Tsuji M. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Takayama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23528-23531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the platelets also still responded to collagen but much more slowly than normal human platelets (31Kehrel B.

It was suggested that the remnant response of GPVI-deficient human platelets to collagen could be due to its interactions with α2β1alone.Suzuki-Inoue et al. (21Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M.

Rhodocytin binding to liposomes containing recombinant α2β1 was not inhibited by EDTA (21Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol.

The question of whether aggretin and rhodocytin are identical or variants with the same N-terminal sequences is not yet clear.In platelets stimulated by aggretin, p125FAK was strongly activated. In contrast to platelets treated with convulxin, where the activation of p125FAK is a consequence of the secondary involvement of GPIIb-IIIa (15Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) in aggretin-treated platelets, the activation of p125FAK was only slightly blocked by GPIIb-IIIa inhibitors and is thus a primary consequence of the interaction between aggretin and α2β1 and GPIb.It is still controversial whether α2β1 is constitutively active or needs to be activated by inside-out signaling to bind collagen. This is difficult to test with collagen because of its numerous recognition sequences that can interact with different receptors. In the two-step, two-receptor model (39Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which is the simplest version proposed for collagen-platelet interactions in primary hemostasis, it was suggested that the platelet binds through α2β1 first and then is activated via interactions with GPVI/Fcγ. However, platelet activation via GPVI/Fcγ may be necessary to modulate α2β1 to allow it to bind to collagen. In adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium, the situation may be further complicated because under high shear stress conditions it may be the GPIb-V-IX receptor that causes platelet activation via von Willebrand factor bound to collagen to bring α2β1 into action. Another piece of evidence supporting at least a basal level of constitutive activation comes from the results with the GPVI-deficient platelets from the Japanese patients where collagen is still able to induce a weak response; however, other collagen receptors, including GPIb/von Willebrand factor, may participate in this process.The main platelet activation pathway by both collagen and convulxin was shown to involve phosphorylation of Fcγ, leading to activation of p72SYK and hence of PLCγ2. A role for α2β1 in activation of p72SYKand of PLCγ2 by pathways requiring FcγRIIA was also suggested by studies using specific antibodies and inhibitors (35Keely P.J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26668-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and Polanowska-Grabowska et al. (40Polanowska-Grabowska R. Simon Jr., C.G. Falchetto R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Gear A.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that α2β1 signals via dephosphorylation of a heat shock protein complex. However, these investigations are limited by the use of collagen as agonist where interactions with more than one receptor cannot be excluded or by the use of activating antibodies where a role of FcγRIIA was critical. It has been suggested that aggretin or rhodocytin may provide a good tool for investigating signaling via α2β1. However, because aggretin binds to both α2β1 and GPIb the question about the role of other receptors in preactivation of α2β1 before it can bind agonists such as collagen is still open. Because aggretin is again an agonist with more than one binding site for platelet receptors, this suggests that binding and clustering of α2β1 may not be enough to activate platelets, and therefore GPIb or GPVI (in the case of collagen) is necessary to give adequate stimulation of signaling pathways. Platelet activation with aggretin-induced activation of p72SYK and of PLCγ2 but not Fcγ co-immunoprecipitated with p72SYK. The absence of a direct, early, signaling role for Fcγ in the platelet response to aggretin supports the results obtained using platelets from Fcγ-deficient mice where the GPIIb-IIIa activation response to aggretin was stronger than that obtained with platelets from normal, control mice. Aggretin, by activating and clustering α2β1 and GPIb, gives a powerful signaling response in platelets. This strongly supports a major signaling role for α2β1 integrin in collagen-induced platelet activation as well. Results measuring “soluble collagen” binding to resting and activated platelets (41Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14827-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) suggest that, although there is a residual binding to resting platelets, this is considerably enhanced in activated platelets. Because the structure of soluble collagen is poorly defined, a role for GPVI/Fcγ in resting platelets in binding this collagen can still not be excluded. In the platelet response to collagen, α2β1 acts synergistically with GPVI/Fcγ and modulates and controls the response to this receptor. This is clearly seen in the strength of the platelet response to convulxin compared with collagen. In this, α2β1 shows a number of parallels to GPIIb-IIIa. Normally, GPIIb-IIIa needs to be activated by signaling from other receptors to change conformation and allow fibrinogen binding. However, platelets can adhere to and be activated by a fibrinogen-coated surface (42Kieffer N. Fitzgerald L.A. Wolf D. Cheresh D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), so there must be a recognition potential even in the “nonactivated” conformation. Clustering of GPIIb-IIIa leads to activation of p72SYKwithout obvious Fcγ involvement; however, the mechanism for this is not yet known (43Gao J. Zoller K.E. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Aggretin clustering of α2β1 and GPIb appears to induce a similar signaling pathway that may be common to several integrins. The availability of aggretin as a specific reagent, activating platelets via α2β1 and GPIb independently of GPVI/Fcγ, should allow further analysis of the signaling pathways from these receptors. Together with reagents specific for GPVI/Fcγ, such as convulxin (15Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol.

Lcn-1 is an unusual member of the lipocalin superfamily, because it is able to bind a broad array of various lipophilic ligands in vitro and in vivo(15Redl B. Holzfeind P. Lottspeich F. J. Biol.

Although the biological relevance of its multiple activities has still to be established, its main function seems to be scavenging of lipophilic, potentially harmful molecules, thus acting as a protection factor for cells and tissues (25Redl B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of clearance or detoxification of the putative harmful ligands is unknown.In the present study we have used a phage display-based technique for interaction screening of a complex cDNA expression library with Lcn-1 as bait to isolate proteins that may be involved in the reception or degradation of Lcn-1-specific ligands. Here we describe the identification, molecular cloning, expression, and subcellular localization of a novel Lcn-1 interacting membrane protein. Our findings set the stage for exploring the molecular mechanism of the lipocalin-receptor interaction in more detail. Moreover, this is the first successful attempt of identifying a lipocalin receptor using phage-display techniques.DISCUSSIONLcn-1 is of considerable interest, because it was supposed to be a member of the immunocalin subfamily of lipocalins, which are involved in modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, and is one of the lipocalins used as a biochemical marker of disease in man (33Lögdberg L. Wester L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Xu S. Venge P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 289-307Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Functionally, it seems to act as a physiological scavenger of lipophilic, potentially harmful compounds. In search for identification of Lcn-1 interacting proteins involved in the reception or detoxification of Lcn-1 ligands we have applied a phage-display technology using a complex cDNA library and expression screening against Lcn-1 as a bait. Using this method we have identified and characterized a novel human cell membrane protein, LIMR, which is likely to be a receptor for lipophilic ligands physiologically bound to Lcn-1. The predicted topology of LIMR, consisting of 487 amino acids, is complex. It contains nine putative transmembrane domains, with the N terminus orientated outside of the cell. The outside orientation of the N terminus is supported by the result from phage display and the fact that an antiserum raised against this part of the protein reacted with NT2 cells. From phage display it is also evident that the N terminus of LIMR represents the Lcn-1 interacting domain. A notable feature of LIMR is a large central cytoplasmatic loop consisting of 82 amino acids, whereas all of the other loops are rather small (between 18 and 27 amino acids). Both immunocytochemical analysis and cell fractionation experiments gave clear evidence of LIMR being located within the cell plasma membrane. Therefore, it has to be characterized as the first human cell surface membrane-located lipocalin receptor.Although there is clear experimental evidence that many lipocalins bind to specific cell surface receptors, isolation of these proteins or cloning of the encoding genes has failed so far. Because of its important role in retinol transport and retinol supply of cells, a large number of investigations have dealt with the receptor for the classical lipocalin RBP. Thereby, the gene encoding a 63-kDa protein, suspected to be a receptor of bovine plasma retinol-binding protein, was cloned (35Bavik C.O. Levy F. Hellmann U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20540-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several consecutive reports demonstrated that it is not an integral membrane receptor but rather a membrane-associated protein involved in enzymatic processing of retinol (36Nicoletti A. Wong D.J. Kawase K. Gibson L.H. Yang-feng T.L. Richards J.E. Thompson D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 37Redmond T.M., Yu, S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Because no other specific RBP receptor has been identified so far, there is still no consensus whether retinol transfer into the cell is receptor-driven or proceeds via passive diffusion (7Sundaram M. Sivaprasadarao A. DeSousa M.M. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3336-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Noy N. Xu Z.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3613-3619Google Scholar). There is also convincing evidence that in some cells RBP undergoes internalization by a receptor-mediated endocytotic process (39Senoo H. Smeland S. Malaba L. Bjerknes T. Stang E. Roos N. Berg T. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Another well characterized protein that is supposed to interact with lipocalins is megalin. This protein, also called gp330, is an epithelial endocytic receptor with a single transmembrane region and shares some characteristic features with the low density lipoprotein receptor family (40Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 41Korenberg J.R. Argraves K.M. Chen X.N. Tran H. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. Genomics. 1994; 22: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). From studies on a megalin knockout mouse it was concluded to interact with different lipocalins, including RBP, major urinary protein, olfactory-binding protein, and α1-microglobulin (42Leheste J.R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen C. Aucouturier P. Moskaug J.O. Otto A. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, because it also binds a variety of other macromolecular ligands, such as thyroglobulin, apolipoprotein A, clusterin, albumin, and insulin, its specific role in lipocalin binding remains unclear.With exception of these two defined molecules the interaction of other lipocalins with putative receptors is only marginally characterized, and a number of interactions described are likely to be of no physiological relevance. However, those receptors that have been characterized in some detail show no consensus in biochemical or biophysical properties, suggesting a great diversity of receptor structure (14Flower D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).There is also no consensus in the mechanism of interaction between lipocalins and their receptors. In principle, lipocalin receptors have been found in both groups, carbohydrate-binding receptors and receptors binding via protein-protein interaction. An example for the first group seems to be the receptor for α1-acid glycoprotein, a highly sialylated serum lipocalin. Inhibition of α1-acid glycoprotein binding to several cells could be inhibited by simple sugars, like mannose and GlcNAc, suggesting that this interaction is mediated by carbohydrates and that the receptor is of a lectin-type (43Andersen U.O. Kirkeby S. Bog-Hansen T.C. J. Mol. Recognit. 1996; 9: 364-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our investigations clearly show that LIMR is an example for a receptor-type binding via direct protein interaction, because it was isolated by means of prokaryotic expression, and a recombinant LIMR produced inE. coli interacts in vitro with Lcn-1.Apart from its interaction with Lcn-1 the precise physiological function of LIMR is unknown to date. Supposing that it is involved in detoxification of ligands bound to Lcn-1, LIMR could be directly involved in the transfer of ligands to the cell, where they undergo detoxification. Alternatively, it could act as a detoxification proteinper se, probably by displaying an enzymatic activity. Indeed, membrane-associated enzymes involved in modification of lipid molecules have been described, e.g. human enzymes involved in sterol or cholesterol modification (44Robinson G.W. Tsay Y.H. Kienzle B.K. Smith-Monroy C.A. Bishop R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 45Silve S. Dupuy P.H. Labit-Lebouteiller C. Kaghad M. Chalon P. Rahier A. Taton M. Lupker J. Shire D. Loison G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22434-22440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recently identified human Δ7-sterol reductase, involved in reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, shows a similar overall topography to LIMR, including nine transmembrane regions and a molecular mass of 55 kDa (46Moebius F.F. Fitzky B.U. Lee J.N. Paik Y.K. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Although many aspects concerning the precise function of LIMR are speculative at the moment, our investigations might have important consequences for the isolation and characterization of lipocalin receptors, in general. First, we could demonstrate that the phage-display strategy applied is a reliable method for isolating such receptors. Second, our findings constitute the first report of identifying a lipocalin receptor that is, in contrast to the RBP-associated p63, clearly a plasma membrane-located protein. Furthermore, the availability of a cloned gene is a vital first step for elucidating the structural requirements necessary for lipocalin-receptor interaction. Finally, the identification of an Lcn-1-specific plasma membrane receptor will add new hints to the precise physiological function of Lcn-1 and may help to dissect putative detoxification pathways for the ligands bound. The protein superfamily of lipocalins consists of small, mainly secretory proteins defined on the basis of conserved amino acid sequence motifs and their common structure. Functionally they share several properties including the ability to bind/transport a remarkable array of small hydrophobic molecules, the formation of macromolecular complexes, and the binding to specific cell surface receptors (1Flower D.R.

Whereas a large number of various lipophilic ligands able to bind to lipocalins are known, only limited data are available concerning the identity of lipocalin receptors.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but with the exception of megalin, which seems to be an endocytic receptor for a variety of soluble macromolecules including several lipocalins, no specific lipocalin receptor has been fully characterized so far (14Flower D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This lack of knowledge is a major disadvantage in understanding the biological function of many lipocalin members. We have identified Lcn-1 (identical with tear lipocalin or von Ebner's gland protein) as a human member of the lipocalin superfamily (15Redl B. Holzfeind P. Lottspeich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20282-20287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is produced by a number of secretory glands and tissues, including lacrimal and lingual salivary glands, prostate, and mucosal glands of the tracheobronchial tree, nasal mucosa, and sweat glands and by some neuroendocrine tissues (15Redl B.

Lcn-1 is an unusual member of the lipocalin superfamily, because it is able to bind a broad array of various lipophilic ligands in vitro and in vivo(15Redl B. Holzfeind P. Lottspeich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20282-20287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Glasgow B.J. Abduragimov A.R. Farahakhsh Z.T. Faull K.F. Hubbell W.L. Curr.

Gasymov O.K. Glasgow B.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the biological relevance of its multiple activities has still to be established, its main function seems to be scavenging of lipophilic, potentially harmful molecules, thus acting as a protection factor for cells and tissues (25Redl B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of clearance or detoxification of the putative harmful ligands is unknown. In the present study we have used a phage display-based technique for interaction screening of a complex cDNA expression library with Lcn-1 as bait to isolate proteins that may be involved in the reception or degradation of Lcn-1-specific ligands. Here we describe the identification, molecular cloning, expression, and subcellular localization of a novel Lcn-1 interacting membrane protein. Our findings set the stage for exploring the molecular mechanism of the lipocalin-receptor interaction in more detail. Moreover, this is the first successful attempt of identifying a lipocalin receptor using phage-display techniques. DISCUSSIONLcn-1 is of considerable interest, because it was supposed to be a member of the immunocalin subfamily of lipocalins, which are involved in modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, and is one of the lipocalins used as a biochemical marker of disease in man (33Lögdberg L. Wester L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Xu S. Venge P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 289-307Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Functionally, it seems to act as a physiological scavenger of lipophilic, potentially harmful compounds. In search for identification of Lcn-1 interacting proteins involved in the reception or detoxification of Lcn-1 ligands we have applied a phage-display technology using a complex cDNA library and expression screening against Lcn-1 as a bait. Using this method we have identified and characterized a novel human cell membrane protein, LIMR, which is likely to be a receptor for lipophilic ligands physiologically bound to Lcn-1. The predicted topology of LIMR, consisting of 487 amino acids, is complex. It contains nine putative transmembrane domains, with the N terminus orientated outside of the cell. The outside orientation of the N terminus is supported by the result from phage display and the fact that an antiserum raised against this part of the protein reacted with NT2 cells. From phage display it is also evident that the N terminus of LIMR represents the Lcn-1 interacting domain. A notable feature of LIMR is a large central cytoplasmatic loop consisting of 82 amino acids, whereas all of the other loops are rather small (between 18 and 27 amino acids). Both immunocytochemical analysis and cell fractionation experiments gave clear evidence of LIMR being located within the cell plasma membrane. Therefore, it has to be characterized as the first human cell surface membrane-located lipocalin receptor.Although there is clear experimental evidence that many lipocalins bind to specific cell surface receptors, isolation of these proteins or cloning of the encoding genes has failed so far. Because of its important role in retinol transport and retinol supply of cells, a large number of investigations have dealt with the receptor for the classical lipocalin RBP. Thereby, the gene encoding a 63-kDa protein, suspected to be a receptor of bovine plasma retinol-binding protein, was cloned (35Bavik C.O. Levy F. Hellmann U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20540-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several consecutive reports demonstrated that it is not an integral membrane receptor but rather a membrane-associated protein involved in enzymatic processing of retinol (36Nicoletti A. Wong D.J. Kawase K. Gibson L.H. Yang-feng T.L. Richards J.E. Thompson D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 37Redmond T.M., Yu, S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Because no other specific RBP receptor has been identified so far, there is still no consensus whether retinol transfer into the cell is receptor-driven or proceeds via passive diffusion (7Sundaram M. Sivaprasadarao A. DeSousa M.M. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3336-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Noy N. Xu Z.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3613-3619Google Scholar). There is also convincing evidence that in some cells RBP undergoes internalization by a receptor-mediated endocytotic process (39Senoo H. Smeland S. Malaba L. Bjerknes T. Stang E. Roos N. Berg T. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Another well characterized protein that is supposed to interact with lipocalins is megalin. This protein, also called gp330, is an epithelial endocytic receptor with a single transmembrane region and shares some characteristic features with the low density lipoprotein receptor family (40Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 41Korenberg J.R. Argraves K.M. Chen X.N. Tran H. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. Genomics. 1994; 22: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). From studies on a megalin knockout mouse it was concluded to interact with different lipocalins, including RBP, major urinary protein, olfactory-binding protein, and α1-microglobulin (42Leheste J.R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen C. Aucouturier P. Moskaug J.O. Otto A. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, because it also binds a variety of other macromolecular ligands, such as thyroglobulin, apolipoprotein A, clusterin, albumin, and insulin, its specific role in lipocalin binding remains unclear.With exception of these two defined molecules the interaction of other lipocalins with putative receptors is only marginally characterized, and a number of interactions described are likely to be of no physiological relevance. However, those receptors that have been characterized in some detail show no consensus in biochemical or biophysical properties, suggesting a great diversity of receptor structure (14Flower D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).There is also no consensus in the mechanism of interaction between lipocalins and their receptors. In principle, lipocalin receptors have been found in both groups, carbohydrate-binding receptors and receptors binding via protein-protein interaction. An example for the first group seems to be the receptor for α1-acid glycoprotein, a highly sialylated serum lipocalin. Inhibition of α1-acid glycoprotein binding to several cells could be inhibited by simple sugars, like mannose and GlcNAc, suggesting that this interaction is mediated by carbohydrates and that the receptor is of a lectin-type (43Andersen U.O. Kirkeby S. Bog-Hansen T.C. J. Mol. Recognit. 1996; 9: 364-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our investigations clearly show that LIMR is an example for a receptor-type binding via direct protein interaction, because it was isolated by means of prokaryotic expression, and a recombinant LIMR produced inE. coli interacts in vitro with Lcn-1.Apart from its interaction with Lcn-1 the precise physiological function of LIMR is unknown to date. Supposing that it is involved in detoxification of ligands bound to Lcn-1, LIMR could be directly involved in the transfer of ligands to the cell, where they undergo detoxification. Alternatively, it could act as a detoxification proteinper se, probably by displaying an enzymatic activity. Indeed, membrane-associated enzymes involved in modification of lipid molecules have been described, e.g. human enzymes involved in sterol or cholesterol modification (44Robinson G.W. Tsay Y.H. Kienzle B.K. Smith-Monroy C.A. Bishop R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 45Silve S. Dupuy P.H. Labit-Lebouteiller C. Kaghad M. Chalon P. Rahier A. Taton M. Lupker J. Shire D. Loison G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22434-22440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recently identified human Δ7-sterol reductase, involved in reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, shows a similar overall topography to LIMR, including nine transmembrane regions and a molecular mass of 55 kDa (46Moebius F.F. Fitzky B.U. Lee J.N. Paik Y.K. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Although many aspects concerning the precise function of LIMR are speculative at the moment, our investigations might have important consequences for the isolation and characterization of lipocalin receptors, in general. First, we could demonstrate that the phage-display strategy applied is a reliable method for isolating such receptors. Second, our findings constitute the first report of identifying a lipocalin receptor that is, in contrast to the RBP-associated p63, clearly a plasma membrane-located protein. Furthermore, the availability of a cloned gene is a vital first step for elucidating the structural requirements necessary for lipocalin-receptor interaction. Finally, the identification of an Lcn-1-specific plasma membrane receptor will add new hints to the precise physiological function of Lcn-1 and may help to dissect putative detoxification pathways for the ligands bound. Lcn-1 is of considerable interest, because it was supposed to be a member of the immunocalin subfamily of lipocalins, which are involved in modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, and is one of the lipocalins used as a biochemical marker of disease in man (33Lögdberg L.

For effective CD8+ T cell responses, class I MHC molecules must bind many peptides of diverse sequence in sufficient abundance for long periods of time. Typical half-lives of immunodominant peptides are greater than 20 h at 37 °C (9Stuber G. Leder G.H. Storkus W.T. Lotze M.T. Modrow S. Szekely L. Wolf H. Klein E. Karre K. Klein G. Eur. J.

In addition, the polymorphic residues within the peptide binding groove create specificity pockets that select specific amino acids in the peptide (14Guo H.C. Madden D.R. Silver M.L. Jardetzky T.S.

The specificity pockets for HLA-A2.1 (A2) are found close to the peptidic termini and are complementary in shape and charge to residues 2 (P2) and the last residue of the peptide (PΩ). The specificity pockets play a large role in binding affinity to A2 (16Ruppert J. Sidney J. Celis E. Kubo R.T. Grey H.M. Sette A.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 331-337PubMed Google Scholar). The result of this set of interactions in A2 is the binding of the ends of the peptide, leaving the center relatively free of interactions. The center of the peptide bulges out of the peptide binding cleft, and the main chain rarely traverses the same path in two different peptides (19Batalia M.A. Collins E.J. Biopoly. 1997; 43: 281-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-crystal structures of class I MHC and TCR show that the means of engagement between pMHC and TCR are conserved (20Garboczi D.N.

The TCR binds in a diagonal manner with the TCR α chain interacting with the carboxyl end of the MHC α2 helix and the TCR β chain interacting with the carboxyl end of the MHC α1 helix. The CDR3 regions of the TCR α and β chains interact with the center of the peptide (P5–P7 depending on the peptide) (25Garboczi D.N. Biddison W.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Garcia K.C. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 369-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Two aspects about peptide binding to class I MHC are explored by the experiments presented here. The first aspect is an assumption that each amino acid in the peptide binds independently of one another to enhance or detract from the overall binding affinity. Using this assumption, a popular algorithm was designed to predict peptide epitopes that bind well. This algorithm is predicated on the assumption that each residue binds independently (27Parker K.C. Bednarek M.A. Coligan J.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 163-175PubMed Google Scholar). Although this algorithm predicts many good binding peptides from proteins of interest (28Harada M. Li Y.F. El-Gamil M.

The second aspect of peptide binding explored here is that residues at the anchor positions do not affect the conformation of residues elsewhere in the peptide. If one assumes that each residue binds independently, homologous substitutions would be the best choice to amplify and activate T cells specific for the parental antigen (33Micheletti F. Guerrini R. Formentin A. Canella A. Marastoni M. Bazzaro M. Tomatis R. Traniello S. Gavioli R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2579-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Slansky E.J. Rattis M.F. Boyd F.L.

Immunol. 1996; 14: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The clear choice for modification is the anchor residues because they point into the binding cleft and are restricted in space by the specificity pockets. Thus, the conformation flexibility of the peptide backbone should be limited, and any alterations in the structure caused by the anchor substitution would be expected to be local and small. This idea has been used to design peptides with increased affinity for class I MHC to enhance CTL stimulation. This approach has been successful in some cases (36Overwijk W.W. Tsung A. Irvine K.R. Parkhurst M.R. Goletz T.J. Tsung K. Carroll M.W. Liu C. Moss B. Rosenberg S.A. Restifo N.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 37Fong L. Ruegg C.L.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 2539-2548PubMed Google Scholar). T cells stimulated using altered-peptide ligands (APL) are not necessarily the same population of T cells (40El-Shami K.M. Tirosh B. Popovic D. Carmon L. Tzehoval E. Vadai E. Feldman M. Eisenbach L. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This change in reactivity may be a result of interactions between the single amino acid changes and the MHC or between the substitutions and the other amino acids within the peptide. Our studies provide an explanation for the instances in which alteration reduces or eliminates reactivity. These data show that substitutions at the anchor positions can directly alter the conformation of the residues at the center of the peptide and conversely that substitutions in the center can cause large changes at the termini. We examined binding of a selection of known immunologically recognized peptide ligands from the tyrosine kinase family member HER-2/neu to the class I MHC molecule A2. HER-2/neu is overexpressed in ∼30% of patients with breast cancer and similarly in all adenocarcinomas examined. Despite the presence of CTL that recognize these peptides bound to A2, the tumors are not eliminated. These HER-2/neu-derived peptides contain appropriate anchor residues but still bind poorly to A2 molecules (41Kuhns J.J. Batalia M.A. Yan S. Collins E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36422-36427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One proposed explanation for inefficient tumor killing is that the peptide antigens bind poorly to A2, and these complexes are not stable enough to be recognized well by HER-2/neupeptide-specific CTL. Our long term goal is to design high affinity APL for cancer immunotherapy. We have examined binding of one of these poor-binding peptides, GP2 (IISAVVGIL), to design a ligand for immunotherapy. The crystallographic structure of GP2 co-crystallized with A2 (A2GP2) shows that the center of the peptide is disordered and apparently does not make stabilizing contacts with the peptide binding cleft (41Kuhns J.J. Batalia M.A. Yan S. Collins E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36422-36427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GP2 has anchor residues that are present in high affinity peptides (isoleucine at position 2 and leucine at position 9) (42Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanoviic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). Substitution of these anchor residues with amino acids most preferred by A2 increased the binding affinity, but not significantly (41Kuhns J.J. Batalia M.A. Yan S. Collins E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36422-36427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on the crystallographic structure of GP2 bound to A2, we designed a new APL in which we substituted the position 5 (P5) valine with leucine (V5L). We hypothesized that the larger leucine would fit into a hydrophobic pocket in the peptide binding cleft under the α2 α helix where the smaller valine could not reach. We synthesized a series of peptides that included the V5L substitution in combination with our anchor substitutions to maximize binding affinity. Measurements of binding affinity and peptide off-rates showed that the enhancement in binding of double-substitution peptides was not the sum of the increases from the single-substitution peptides. We interpreted this to mean that there are interactions between residues in the peptide or changes in the peptide structure. To understand these interactions, the crystallographic structures of A2 bound to the GP2 variants I2L/V5L (A2I2L/V5L) and I2L/V5L/L9V (A2I2L/V5L/L9V) were determined. These structures show that the peptide residues interact and that the TCR contact residues alter their positions depending on the identity of the anchor residue. Therefore, homologous substitutions anywhere in the peptide may have large unintended consequences in T cell recognition. The peptides used in this study are listed in Table I. All peptides were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The peptides were purified to greater than 95% purity as confirmed by reversed phased chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptides were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 mg/ml by weight. Final concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory in the Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.Table IBinding data of GP2 variant peptides to A2PeptideSequenceT m 1-aDNF, did not fold in vitro so a T m could not be derived.K r 1-b>50 means that the concentration to yield 50% of ML fluorescence is greater than 50 μm.K r is defined as concentration of peptide in μm which yields 50% mean channel fluorescence (MCF) compared with the maximum fluorescence of the control peptide (ML) at 50 μm.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Briefly, residues 1–275 of A2 and residues 1–99 of β2-microglobulin were produced in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Peptide, solubilized β2-microglobulin, and A2 heavy chain, solubilized in 8 m urea, were rapidly diluted into folding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mml-Arg, 10 mm GSH, 1 mm GSSG, and protease inhibitors) at molar ratios of 10:2:1, respectively. The solution was incubated at 10 °C for 36–48 h, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon), and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration (Phenomenex, BioSep-SEC-S2000). The thermal denaturation properties of A2-peptide complexes were determined as described previously (12Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Purified A2-peptide complexes were exchanged into a 10 mm KH2/K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5, and adjusted to final concentration of 4–12 μm. Thermal denaturation curves (melting curve) of MHC-peptide complexes were recorded by monitoring the change in circular dichroic (CD) signal at 218 nm as a function of temperature from 4 °C to 95 °C on an AVIV 62-DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). The final melting curves were the average of at least three measurements for each complex. Tm values were calculated as the temperature at which 50% of the complexes are unfolded. The ability of peptide to stabilize A2 on the surface of T2 (ATCC CRL-1992) cells was determined as described previously (10Pogue R.R. Eron J. Frelinger J. Matsui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8166-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, T2 cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated overnight in AIM V medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with varying concentrations of peptide. The following morning, cells were stained with the A2-specific monoclonal antibody BB7.2. After two washes with wash buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% sodium azide), the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Southern Biotechnologies). Fluorescence was detected on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). The data were then normalized to the mean channel fluorescence for the index peptide ML at 50 μm. The ML peptide (MLLSVPLLL) is derived from the signal sequence of calreticulin and has a hydrophobicity similar to that of the peptides used in this study. The half-life of A2-peptide complexes on the surface of T2 cells was determined as described previously (10Pogue R.R. Eron J. Frelinger J. Matsui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8166-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, T2 cells (8 × 105cells/well) were incubated overnight in AIM V medium with 50 μm peptide. Cells were incubated in RPMI-1650, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml brefeldin A for 1 h. Because this concentration of brefeldin A is toxic to the cells if they are exposed for long periods of time, the cells were transferred and maintained at 0.5 μg/ml through FACScan analysis. Cells were then stained with BB7.2 at various time points and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. The mean fluorescence for the peptide at each time point minus the mean fluorescence of T2 cells incubated without exogenous peptide was calculated and normalized to the maximum level of fluorescence for each APL (at t = 0). Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were grown from 14–20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, for both A2I2L/V5L/L9Vand A2I2L/V5L over the course of 2 days by microseeding. Crystallographic data for both structures were collected at 100 K in house (University of North Carolina Macromolecular Crystallography Facility) on a RIGAKU RU200 equipped with RAXIS IIC imaging plate detector and Oxford Cryostream. Data were collected from a single crystal of A2I2L/V5L/L9V and from two crystals of A2I2L/V5L. Data for both structures were integrated with DENZO and intensities scaled with SCALEPACK (44Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2170303590,"The spatial differences between the images seen by the two eyes, called binocular disparities, can be used to recover the volumetric (three-dimensional) aspects of a scene. The computation of disparity depends upon the correct identification of corresponding features in the two images. Understanding what image features are used by the brain to solve this matching problem is one of the main issues in stereoscopic vision1. Many cortical neurons in visual areas V1 (ref. 2), MT (refs 3, 4) and MST (refs 5, 6) that are tuned to binocular disparity are also tuned to orientation, motion direction and speed. Although psychophysical work has shown that motion direction7 can facilitate binocular matching, the psychophysical literature on the role of orientation is mixed8,9, and it has been argued that speed differences are ineffective in aiding correspondence7. Here we use a different psychophysical paradigm to show that the visual system uses similarities in orientation, motion direction and speed to achieve binocular correspondence. These results indicate that cells that multiplex orientation, motion direction, speed and binocular disparity may help to solve the binocular matching problem."
https://openalex.org/W2031510428,"We have previously shown that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) selectively increases the expression of integrin α2 in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In this study, we have further investigated the signal transduction pathways responsible for the event and its role in HGF-induced cell scattering. We found that the level of integrin α2β1 expression induced by HGF correlated with the extent of cell scattering and that a functional blocking antibody against integrin α2 at the concentration of 25 μg/ml partially (40‥) inhibited the HGF-induced cell scattering. However, in the presence of the specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or the selective Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, although cells retained their response to HGF for increasing integrin α2 expression, they failed to scatter, indicating that increased expression of integrin α2 alone is not sufficient for cell scattering. Moreover, epidermal growth factor, which induced a transient (1 h) activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in MDCK cells, only slightly increased integrin α2 expression and failed to trigger cell scattering. Conversely, HGF induced a sustained (at least 12 h) activation of ERK in the cells. Expression of constitutively active ERK kinase (MEK) in MDCK cells led to increased expression of integrin α2 even in the absence of HGF stimulation. In contrast, expression of ERK phosphatase or dominant negative MEK inhibited HGF-induced integrin α2 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that the increased expression of integrin α2β1 by HGF is at least partially required for cell scattering and that the duration of MEK/ERK activation is likely to be a crucial determinant for cells to activate integrin α2 expression and cell scattering.

The diverse biological effects of HGF are transmitted through activation of its transmembrane receptor encoded by the c-metproto-oncogene (2Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M.-L.

Although a number of growth factors are known to modulate cell motility, HGF is unique because of the intensity with which it stimulates motility and induces the epithelial-mesenchymal (E-M) transition. The scatter response of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to HGF stimulation has been used extensively as a model to study the E-M transition, characterized by the loss of epithelial polarity, the disruption of E-cadherine-mediated cell-cell adhesions, and the acquisition of a migratory mesenchymal cell phenotype (4Ridley A.J.

Upon HGF stimulation, the scatter of MDCK cells can be visualized first as centrifugal spreading of cell colonies (after 2–4 h) followed by cell-cell dissociation (after 4–6 h) and subsequent cell migration (from 6 h) (4Ridley A.J.

Several intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated to act downstream of the HGF receptor to mediate scatter response. For example, both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and small GTPase Ras have been shown to be essential for cell dissociation and migration following stimulation of MDCK cells with HGF (4Ridley A.J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PI3K acts upstream of Tiam1, an activator of the small GTPase Rac, to modulate both E-cadherine-mediated cell adhesion and cell migration (6Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

In addition, inhibition of HGF-induced cell scattering by dominant negative Ras or the specific inhibitor for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) has implicated an essential role for the Ras/ERK cascade in cell scattering (13Terauchi R.

The polyclonal anti-ERK (sc-94) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal anti-phosphoERK was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The cDNA of human integrin α2 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The plasmids encoding constitutively active MEK1 (S218E/S222E), dominant negative MEK1 (S218A/S222A), and ERK phosphatase HVH2 were kindly provided by Dr. Kun-Liang Guan (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and described previously (18Sugimoto T.

MDCK II 3B5 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10‥ fetal bovine serum and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5‥ CO2 and 95‥ air atmosphere. To induce cell scattering and analyze the expression of integrin α2, MDCK cells were seeded at 105/60-mm dish and allowed to grow as discrete colonies for 2 days. For HGF stimulation, the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 5‥ serum and 25 ng/ml HGF. In some experiments, HGF was substituted by EGF (100 ng/ml) or PMA (100 nm). After various times, the morphology of cell colonies were photographed under a phase contrast microscope before cell lysis in 1‥ Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors as described previously (20Chen H.-C. Chan P.-C. Tang M.-J. Cheng C.-H. Chang T.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To measure the phosphorylation of ERK, 105 MDCK cells were plated on 60-mm dish in medium with 10‥ serum for 24 h and followed by a 24-h serum starvation. These cells were treated with 25 ng/ml HGF or 100 ng/ml EGF in serum-free medium for various times before cell lysis in 1‥ Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. To express constitutively active MEK1, dominant negative MEK1, or HVH2, MDCK cells were grown on 60-mm dishes and co-transfected with pSV2neo and a plasmid encoding constitutively active MEK1, dominant negative MEK1, or HVH2 in 1:20 ratio using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h later, the medium was replaced with the fresh medium with 10‥ serum supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml neomycin G418. 7 days later, the neomycin-resistant cells were serum-staved and treated with or without 25 ng/ml HGF. 12 h later, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting analysis for MEK expression, ERK phosphorylation, and integrin α2expression. For cell surface biotinylation, MDCK cells were grown for 2 days to allow cell colony formation. After washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were incubated in PBS containing 500 μg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin at room temperature for 30 min, washed once with cold PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 0.1 m glycine (pH 7.4) on ice for 15 min. After several washes in PBS, the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Aliquots (500 μg) of lysates were incubated with avidin-immobilized agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After being washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-integrin α2. For immunoblotting, whole cell lysates or avidin-precipitated complexes were boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoblotting was performed with anti-integrin α2 (1:1500), anti-integrin β1 (1:1500), anti-ERK (1:1500), or anti-phosphoERK (1:1500) using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences chemiluminescence system for detection. MDCK cells were allowed to grow as discrete colonies on 60-mm dishes and then treated with 25 ng/ml HGF in the presence or the absence of 25 μg/ml monoclonal anti-integrin α2 (clone P1E6). 12 h later, cells were washed in PBS, fixed in methanol for 10 min, and stained by modified Giemsa stain (Sigma) for 1 h. The percentage of scattered cells was measured in the total number of counted (∼1000) cells from 50 colonies under a light microscope. A cell was judged as a scattered cell when it has lost contact with its neighbors and exhibited a fibroblast-like phenotype. For the cell migration assay, the MDCK cells were treated with 25 ng/ml HGF for 12 h, collected by trypsinization, and suspended in serum-free medium at 5 × 105 cells/ml with or without 25 μg/ml monoclonal anti-integrin α2 (P1E6) antibody. The cells were incubated with the antibody at 37 °C for 30 min before loading them to a Neuro Probe 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Cabin John, MD). Cells in the upper chamber were allowed to migrate through a porous (8-μm pore size) membrane toward the lower chamber containing 10 μg/ml collagen as an attractant for 5 h. The migrated cells were fixed, stained, and enumerated as described previously (21Reiske H.R. Kao S.-C. Cary L.A. Guan J.-L. Lai J.-F. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The total cellular RNA from MDCK cells that had been treated with or without 25 ng/ml HGF for 12 h was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. To analyze the mRNA level of integrin α2 in MDCK cells, an equal amount (25 μg) of total cellular RNA was fractionated through 1‥ agarose gels containing 2.2m formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). A fluorescein-labeled DNA probe from human integrin α2 was prepared using Renaissance random primer fluorescein labeling kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The hybridization was carried out at 55 °C. After several washes, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-fluorescein (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, and the PerkinElmer Life Sciences chemiluminescence system was used for detection. MDCK cells (104) were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates for 2 days to allow cell colony formation. After an 18-h serum starvation, the cells were treated with HGF or EGF in serum-free medium for 15 min or 6 h, fixed with 4‥ paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, and permeabilized for 1 h by several changes of PBS containing 0.5‥ Triton X-100. For ERK staining, the cells were incubated with polyclonal anti-ERK (1:200 dilution in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After washed in PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. For nuclear staining, the cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Preparations were then washed in PBS, mounted in anti-fading solution (20 mm n-propyl gallate in 80‥ glycerol), and analyzed by an immunofluorescent microscopy (Leica). To characterize the induction of integrin α2expression by HGF, MDCK cells were allowed to grow as discrete colonies and then exposed to 25 ng/ml HGF for various times before harvest. Coincident with the scatter of cell colonies (Fig.1 B), the levels of integrins α2 and β1 were gradually increased and reached 3.9- and 3.3-fold, respectively, 24 h after HGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the level of focal adhesion kinase, a key intracellular mediator in integrin signaling, was not affected by HGF stimulation. To measure the level of integrin α2 on cell surface, cell surface proteins were biotinylated, precipitated by avidin-immobilized agarose beads, and immunoblotted with anti-integrin α2 (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with its increase in whole cell lysates, integrin α2 on cell surface was also increased by HGF stimulation (25 ng/ml) and remained constant for 48 h. However, HGF at a low concentration (5 ng/ml) appeared to fail to promote the expression of integrin α2 on the cell surface. To examine whether the HGF induction of integrin α2 expression is regulated at transcriptional level, total RNA extracted from MDCK cells was analyzed by Northern hybridization using human integrin α2cDNA as a probe (Fig. 1 D). The result showed that a 12-h treatment of HGF apparently (∼3-fold) increased the level of integrin α2 transcripts, indicating that the promoter activation of the integrin α2 gene is involved in its increased expression induced by HGF. To examine the role of de novo synthesized integrin α2β1 in HGF-induced cell scattering, a functional blocking antibody against integrin α2 was applied in cell scatter assays (Fig.2 A). We quantified the extent of cell scattering by counting the number of cells that have lost contact with their neighbors in a total of 50 colonies containing ∼1000 cells. Our results indicated that the HGF-induced cell scattering was partially (∼40‥) inhibited by the integrin α2 blocking antibody at the concentration of 25 μg/ml. However, at the same concentration, this antibody was able to efficiently inhibit HGF-induced cell migration toward collagen in a chemotaxis chamber (Fig. 2 B), indicating a successful inhibition of integrin α2 function by this antibody. Thus, these results indicated that increased expression of integrin α2 induced by HGF contributes only partially to cell scattering. PMA, a strong activator for conventional and novel subgroups of protein kinase C (PKC), has previously been shown to induce integrin α2 expression in osteosarcoma cells (22Nissinen L. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kahari V.-M. Heino J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and breast cancer cells (23Rosfjord E.C. Maemura M. Johnson M.D. Torri J.A. Akiyama S.K. Woods V.L. Dickson R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To examine whether PKC mediates the effect of HGF on integrin α2 induction and cell scattering, MDCK cells were treated with HGF or PMA in the presence of a broad range PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide. As shown in Fig.3 A, the effect of PMA on promoting both integrin α2 expression and cell scattering was significantly inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide, supporting an essential role for PKC in PMA-induced cellular effects. In contrast, bisindolylmaleimide did not appear to inhibit HGF-induced cell scattering and only modestly (∼25‥) decreased the level of integrin α2 induced by HGF, indicating that the effect of HGF on promoting integrin α2 expression and cell scattering is mainly PKC-independent. To identify signal transduction pathways required for HGF to induce integrin α2 expression, inhibitors including genistein (a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor), PP1 (a selective Src family kinase inhibitor), PD98059 (a specific MEK inhibitor), LY294002 (a specific PI3K inhibitor), and cycloheximide (a translation inhibitor) were applied to the experiments (Fig. 3 B). Of these inhibitors, genistein, PD98059, and cycloheximide were found to efficiently inhibit the effect of HGF on integrin α2 induction. In contrast, PP1 and LY294002 had no such effect. These results indicate that MEK, but not Src or PI3K, is required for HGF to induce integrin α2 expression. It should be noted that in the presence of PP1 or LY294002, although cells retained their response to HGF for increasing integrin α2 expression, they failed to scatter, indicating that the elevated expression of integrin α2 alone is not sufficient for cell scattering. As suggested in Fig. 3, the HGF induction of integrin α2expression is mainly dependent on the MEK pathway. However, in addition to HGF, many other growth factors such as EGF are known to potently activate MEK and its downstream targets, ERK 1 and 2. To examine whether EGF induces integrin α2 expression and/or cell scattering, MDCK cells were incubated with EGF or HGF for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4 A, although EGF induced a slight increase in integrin α2 expression and lamellipodium formation around cell colony, it failed to trigger cell scattering. Next, we measured the phosphorylation of ERK upon HGF or EGF stimulation, which serves as an indicator for ERK activation (Fig.4 B). The phosphorylation of ERK induced by EGF was transient; it declined by 30 min and returned to the basal level by 1 h post-stimulation. In contrast, HGF induced a sustained phosphorylation of ERK, which lasted for at least 12 h post-stimulation. Furthermore, the sustained phosphorylation of ERK induced by HGF coincided with its persistent nuclear accumulation (Fig.4 C). To further examine whether sustained activation of ERK leads to integrin α2 expression, constitutively active MEK was expressed in MDCK cells (Fig.5 A). As expected, the expression of constitutively active MEK resulted in ERK activation, and importantly, even in the absence of HGF stimulation, it enhanced the expression of integrin α2. Conversely, the expression of an ERK phosphatase HVH2 or a dominant negative MEK suppressed both HGF-induced ERK activation and integrin α2 expression (Fig. 5 B). These results together suggest that sustained activation of the MEK/ERK signal cascade may be required and sufficient for induction of integrin α2 expression. In this study, we have used MDCK cells as a model to investigate the role of up-regulation of integrin α2β1in HGF-induced cell scattering and the signal transduction pathways responsible for this up-regulation. We showed that the level of integrin α2β1 expression increased by HGF stimulation correlated with the extent of cell scattering (Fig. 1) and that block of HGF-induced integrin α2 expression by inhibitors including genistein, PD98059, and cycloheximide all accompanied an inhibition in cell scattering (Fig. 3 B). However, only 40‥ of HGF-induced cell scattering could be inhibited by the functional blocking antibody against integrin α2(Fig. 2 A), suggesting that increased integrin α2β1 may contribute only partially to cell scattering likely through promoting the third phase of cell scattering (i.e. cell migration). In addition, our results presented here also suggest that increased expression of integrin α2 alone may not be sufficient for MDCK cells to scatter. We showed in Fig. 3 B that in the presence of PP1 or LY294002, although cells retained their response to HGF for increasing integrin α2 expression, they failed to scatter. Although the ERK signaling pathway has been implicated to be essential for HGF-induced cell scattering (13Terauchi R. Kitamura N. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B.M. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Herrera R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), here we propose for the first time that the duration of MEK/ERK activation is likely to be the major determinant for cells to activate integrin α2 expression and cell scattering upon HGF stimulation. Treatment of MDCK cells with HGF led to prolonged activation of ERK as judged by the phosphorylation of ERK and its accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 4). In contrast, EGF, which does not cause MDCK cells to scatter, led to transient activation of ERK. Moreover, the expression of constitutively active MEK, which led to sustained activation of ERK, increased the expression of integrin α2 even in the absence of HGF stimulation (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the expression of ERK phosphatase or dominant negative MEK blocked HGF-induced integrin α2expression (Fig. 5 B). Together, these data support a model in which the different consequences of transient versussustained activation of ERK are because sustained activation leads to persistent nuclear accumulation of ERK, resulting in phosphorylation of transcription factors and changes in gene expression. We showed in Fig. 1 that the increased expression of integrin α2 by HGF in MDCK cells was a consequence of increased α2 mRNA likely because of transcriptional activation of the integrin α2 gene. The mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the canine integrin α2 gene by HGF is currently unknown. However, characterization of the 5′-flanking region of the human integrin α2 gene revealed that the promoter region contains consensus binding sites for several transcription factors, including Sp1, AP1, and AP2 (24Zutter M.M.

The binding of phosphorylated Sp1 proteins to two Sp1-binding sites in the core promoter region of the human integrin α2 gene has been shown to be required for full promoter activity (25Zutter M.M. Ryan E.E. Painter A.D. Blood. 1997; 90: 678-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that ERK activation increases AP1 activity via c-Jun activation and increased c-Fos synthesis, leading to an increase in c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimerization and DNA binding (26Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 27Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study showed that ERK was able to phosphorylate Sp1 and induced its DNA binding activity (28Merchant J.L. Du M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that persistent nuclear accumulation of ERK induced by HGF stimulation may target Sp1 and AP1, leading to activation of the integrin α2 gene. Furthermore, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibits the up-regulation of integrin α2 expression induced by PMA in MDCK cells (data not shown) or by phorbol dibutyrate in human leukemia K562 cells (29Zutter M.M. Painter A.D. Yang X. Blood. 1999; 93: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the MEK/ERK cascade may be generally required for extracellular stimuli to activate the integrin α2gene. Although the role of the ERK singling pathway in cell proliferation has been well established (30Pages G. Lenormand P. Allemain G.L. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 31Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar), increasing evidence has suggested that the duration of ERK activation may be a crucial determinant for cells to proceed certain cellular functions other than proliferation. For example, sustained ERK activity has been shown to be required for nerve growth factor-induced neuronal differentiation of the phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells (32York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis of the endothelial cells on chick chorioallantoic membrane (33Eliceiri B. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and PMA-induced macrophage-like differentiation of the myeloid leukemia TF-1a cells (34Hu X. Moscinski L.C. Valkov N.I. Fisher A.B. Hill B.J. Zuckerman K.S. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 191-200PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that HGF-mediated sustained activation of ERK is required for MDCK cell scattering, associated with morphological transformation to a mesenchymal cell phenotype. The mechanism by which MDCK cells maintain ERK in an active status for a long period upon HGF stimulation is currently unclear. York et al. (32York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) showed that in PC12 cells, the early phase of nerve growth factor-stimulated ERK activation is mediated by the small GTPase Ras, but the sustained phase of the ERK activation is due to the activation of another small GTPase, Rap1. Thus, it will be of interest to examine whether Rap1 is involved in HGF-induced sustained activation of ERK. Alternatively, the de novo expression of integrin α2β1 stimulated by HGF may contribute to the sustained phase of ERK activation. It is known that integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins activates the ERK cascade and often potentiates the effect of growth factors on activating the cascade (35Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27268-27274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Eliceiri et al. (33Eliceiri B. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) showed that the sustained phase but not the initial phase of ERK activation by the fibroblast growth factor depends on integrin αvβ3 in endothelial cells. The potential role of de novo synthesized integrin α2β1 in HGF-induced sustained activation of ERK cascade is currently under investigation. It is known that in cells transformed by oncogenic Ras or Raf, the relative ability of external stimuli to activate ERK is usually diminished. However, we showed in this study that the expression of constitutively active MEK in MDCK cells weakly activated ERK compared with HGF and did not negatively impact on subsequent activation of ERK by HGF (Fig. 5 A). The explanation for this discrepancy could be simply the low expression of constitutively active MEK in our selected MDCK cells, in which a fraction of ERK remains inactive and susceptible to HGF stimulation. This assumption was based on our observation that consecutive culture of active MEK-expressed MDCK cells, especially those with higher expression level of it, resulted in apoptosis. 2C.-C. Liang and H.-C. Chen, unpublished data. These results suggest that severely aberrant activation of ERK by constitutively active MEK may be cytotoxic to MDCK cells and that only those with a lower expression level of active MEK can survive. Alternatively, it is possible that in addition to the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway, other signal transduction pathways may collaborate to activate ERK upon HGF stimulation. For example, ERK has been shown to be activated by protein kinase C δ and ζ via Ras-independent pathways (36Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 37Takeda H. Matozaki T. Takada T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Ochi F. Fukunaga K. Inagaki K. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and inactivated by protein phosphatases such as PP2A (38Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and ERK phosphatases (39Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.-C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) in other systems. Therefore, it is plausible that activation of protein kinase C and/or inactivation of ERK/MEK phosphatases by HGF may further activate ERK in MDCK cells expressing constitutively active MEK. Recently, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 was shown to be required for HGF-induced activation of ERK in MDCK cells (40Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), although the detailed mechanism is currently unclear. In this study, we have found that PMA was able to induce the E-M transition similar to that induced by HGF (Fig. 3). However, unlike HGF, the effect of PMA on induction of the E-M transition is mainly PKC-dependent (Fig. 3). In addition, stable expression of constitutively active MEK in MDCK cells has been shown to lead to the E-M transition (41Schramek H. Feifel E. Healy E. Pollack V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11426-11433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that sustained activation of ERK signaling cascade may be sufficient for triggering this process. Zondaget al. (12Zondag G.C.M. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) reported recently that expression of oncogenic Ras leads to the E-M transition of MDCK cells through regulating the balance between the activation state of two GTPase Rho family proteins, Rac and Rho. They showed that oncogenic Ras-mediated sustained ERK signaling decreases Rac activity through transcriptional down-regulation of the Rac-specific exchange factor Tiam1 and, by contrast, increases Rho activity through an unknown mechanism. It remains to be tested whether HGF, PMA, and constitutive active MEK act in the same fashion as oncogenic Ras to induce the E-M transition. We thank Dr. K.-L. Guan for the plasmid encoding constitutively active MEK, dominant negative MEK, and phosphatase HVH2."

It has been shown recently that much of the specificity seen in intracellular phosphorylation events comes from the targeting of protein kinases and phosphatases to specific subcellular structures and organelles through association with anchoring or adaptor proteins (1Faux M.C.

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A or PKA),1for example, is targeted to discrete subcellular locations through interaction with Akinase-anchoringproteins or AKAPs (3Rubin C.S.

Each anchoring protein contains at least two functional motifs: an amphipathic helix that binds the regulatory (RII) subunits of the PKA holoenzyme (5Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C.

The modulation of ion channel activity through protein phosphorylation is an important physiological control mechanism, and ion channels represent a diverse group of kinase substrates. It has been shown that membrane targeting of PKA through association with AKAPs facilitates PKA-mediated phosphorylation and regulation of AMPA-kainate and NMDA glutamate ion channels, skeletal and cardiac calcium channels, and calcium-activated potassium channels (8Rosenmund C.

Interestingly, AKAP15/18, the anchoring protein that targets PKA to L-type calcium channels does so not only by membrane association through a lipid anchor but also by a possible direct interaction with Ca2+channel α subunits (12Gray P.C.

Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are another group of ion channels whose modulation is influenced by the presence of AKAPs (14Ali S. Chen X. Lu M. Xu J.Z. Lerea K.M. Hebert S.C. Wang W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10274-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Intrinsic gating and block of the Kir channel pore by intracellular magnesium and polyamines ensures that Kir channels permit K+ entry under hyperpolarization more readily that they permit K+ exit under depolarization (15Matsuda H. Saigusa A. Irisawa H. Nature. 1987; 325: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 16Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). This asymmetry in the current-voltage relation of the channel allows modification of the electrical properties of cells without excessive K+ loss. Consequently, Kir channels are involved in setting and maintaining the resting membrane potential, buffering extracellular K+, and the generation of prolonged action potentials in the heart and in fertilized egg cells (17Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992: 127-130Google Scholar). Kir channels are also regulated by protein phosphorylation and direct G-protein activation and thus play a role in the fine-tuning of cellular excitability (18Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A.

The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal HA-probe (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.); mouse monoclonal anti-AKAP79 (clone 22; BD Transduction Laboratories). Horseradish peroxidase-, fluorescein (FITC)- and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide-Tris gels and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution containing 1% skim milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with the membranes for 2–3 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for a further hour at room temperature. Labeled bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), COS-7, and HEK-293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium (without nucleosides), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids, respectively. Medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. All medium and reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. No antibiotics were used. Cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE6™ transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections were performed in six-well culture plates with cells at 50–80% confluence. The Kir2.1 expression construct in pcDNA3 has been previously described (29Dart C. Leyland M.L. Barrett-Jolley R. Shelton P.A. Spencer P.J. Conley E.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol ( Lond. ). 1998; 511.1: 15-24Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The AKAP79 expression construct in pcDNA3 was a generous gift from Dr. John Scott, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR. The enhanced green fluorescent protein-Kir2.1 fusion (EGFP·Kir2.1) was produced as described previously (30Leyland M.L. Dart C. Spencer P.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. Pflug. Arch. 1999; 438: 778-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The expression vector encoding EGFP (pEGFP-N1) was purchased fromCLONTECH. To confirm the presence of AKAP79 within cells during electrophysiological recordings, AKAP79 was subcloned as aSacI-BamHI fragment into the bicistronic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (CLONTECH). This permits AKAP79 and EGFP to be translated simultaneously from the same mRNA transcript and allows visual selection of cells expressing both proteins. For insertion of the HA epitope into the extracellular M1-H5 loop of Kir2.1, complimentary oligonucleotides encoding the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) were annealed to form a SphI adapter and ligated into a unique SphI site in Kir2.1 cDNA. The amino acid sequence of the HA-tagged Kir2.1 reads117KVSKACYPYDVPDYAACV123 at the site of the epitope insertion. The HA·Kir2.1 construct was subcloned from the plasmid vector pBluescript into pcDNA3 as anEcoRI-XhoI fragment for transfection into COS-7 and HEK-293 cell lines. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein constructs encoding the N-terminal (1–71) and C-terminal (302) regions were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction with the following sets of primers: N-(1–71), 5′-GGATCCATGGGCAGTGTGAGAACCAACCGCTA-3′ and 5′-GAATTCGTCTGCCAGGTACCTCTGTCCCTTCTC-3′; C-(302–428), 5′-GGATCCGAGGCGACTGCCATGACAACTCAATG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTCATATCTCCGATTCTCGCCTTAAGGG-3′. Products of the reaction were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and subcloned into the pGEX-2T bacterial expression plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion protein construct C-(421–428) was constructed by annealing complimentary oligonucleotides encoding the C-terminal eight amino acids of Kir2.1 to form a BamHI-EcoRI adapter and ligating this into pGEX-2T. To identify possible interactions between Kir2.1 and AKAP79, GST fusion proteins of the intracellular N (residues 1–71) and C (residues 302–428 and residues 421–428) domains of Kir2.1 were incubated with lysates of COS-7 cells expressing AKAP79. The expression plasmid pGEX-2T containing the GST fusion protein cDNA was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1 Blue competent cells (Stratagene). 15-ml overnight cultures were grown in Luria Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LBA). 200 μl of the overnight culture were then used to inoculate 4 × 12 ml of LBA. Cells were grown by shaking at 37 °C until theA600 was between 0.5 and 0.8. Expression of the GST fusion proteins was subsequently induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubation was continued for a further 4–5 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Resuspended cells were lysed by mild sonication with a sonicator probe for 2 × 5 s on ice. 50 μl of 10% Triton X-100 was then added to the 500 μl of sonicated suspension and incubated on ice for 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were discarded. The supernatant was added to 100 μl of washed glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with inversion. Extracts from transfected COS-7 cells were prepared from a six-well plate 24–48 h post-transfection. Cells were briefly washed in PBS and then 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.6) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1:100 dilution, Sigma protease inhibitor mixture containing AEBSF, aprotinin, bestatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A) was added to each well and incubated on ice for 30 min. The resulting extract was cleared of insoluble debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of Sepharose beads containing the GST fusion proteins were added to 500 μl of the soluble fraction of the lysate and incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C with gentle inversion. The protein-coupled beads were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed five times in PBS. The beads were resuspended in 2× loading buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 10% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. COS-7 cells were plated onto six-well plates and transiently transfected with cDNA encoding AKAP79 and HA-tagged Kir2.1. Cell lysates were prepared and cleared as described for GST pull-down assays. 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal HA-probe (Y-11) or 5 μg of rabbit non-immune control serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was added to 500 μl of cleared lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. 30 μl of prewashed protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were added to the antibody/lysate mix and incubated with gentle inversion for 90 min at 4 °C. The protein-coupled agarose beads were then pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed five times in PBS. Immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered in 2× loading buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Whole-cell currents were recorded from either CHO or COS-7 cells typically 24–48 h post-transfection using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments). Currents recorded in response to voltage steps were filtered at 5 kHz (−3dB, 8-pole Bessel), digitized at 10 kHz using a DigiData 1200 interface (Axon Instruments), and analyzed using software written in AxoBasic (Axon Instruments) by Dr. N. W. Davies (University of Leicester, UK). Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass (outer diameter 1.5 mm; Clarke Electromedical, Pangbourne, UK) and fire polished to give a final resistance of 5 megohm when filled. The pipette-filling solution contained (mM): KCl, 140; MgCl2, 1; EGTA, 10; HEPES, 10; Na2ATP, 3; pH 7.2. The external solution contained (mM): KCl, 35; NaCl, 105; MgCl2, 2, CaCl2, 2; HEPES; 10; pH 7.25. 100 μm cAMP (CalBiochem) was added to the pipette-filling solution in some experiments. The phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and cypermethrin were purchased from Tocris Cookson, Inc. Didecanoyl-rac-glycerol, a cell permeant activator of PKC was purchased from CalBiochem. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was from Sigma-Aldrich. The junction potential between pipette and external solutions was sufficiently small (<1.5 mV) to be neglected. As far as possible, analogue means were used to correct capacity transients. Up to 90% compensation was routinely used to correct for series resistance. All experiments were performed at room temperature (18–22 °C), and the results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's unpaired t test. HEK-293 or COS-7 cells were plated onto polylysine-coated coverslips and transiently transfected with HA-tagged Kir2.1 and AKAP79. Cells were fixed and permeabilized 48 h post-transfection in a solution containing 80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA and mouse monoclonal anti-AKAP79. Both primary antibodies were diluted 250-fold in PBS with 10% (v/v) goat serum. The following morning, the coverslips were washed 5× 10 min in PBS, then incubated in goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (cross-adsorbed against mouse) conjugated with Texas Red and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (cross-adsorbed against rabbit) conjugated with FITC in PBS + 10% goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed in PBS for 3× 10 min and mounted onto microscope slides using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Ltd) before viewing. Confocal images were obtained using a PerkinElmer UltraView™ imaging system. Membrane currents were recorded from CHO or COS-7 cells using the conventional whole-cell clamp technique typically 24–48 h after transfection with the cDNAs encoding Kir2.1 and AKAP79, or with Kir2.1 alone. To confirm the presence of AKAP79 within cells during electrophysiological recordings, AKAP79 was subcloned into the bicistronic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (CLONTECH). This permits AKAP79 and EGFP to be translated simultaneously from the same mRNA transcript and allows visual selection of successfully transfected cells expressing AKAP79. The presence of Kir2.1 was confirmed by recording whole-cell Kir currents. For cells expressing Kir2.1 alone, we cotransfected the cDNA encoding Kir2.1 with the empty (no AKAP79) pIRES2-EGFP expression vector. Fig. 1 Ashows whole-cell currents recorded from a CHO cell transfected with both Kir2.1 and AKAP79. Currents were recorded in response to voltage steps from a holding potential of −35mV (the K+equilibrium potential, EK) to test potentials ranging from +55 mV and −105 mV in 10 mV increments. Voltage steps positive to EK elicited only small outward currents, whereas steps negative to EK produced substantial inward currents. No significant whole-cell currents were detected in non-transfected cells. The presence of the kinase-anchoring protein, AKAP79 within the cells had no significant effect upon whole-cell Kir2.1 current amplitudes (Fig. 1 B) or voltage-dependent properties of Kir channel currents, such as the relationship between whole-cell conductance and voltage (Fig. 1 C), or the time constant of Kir2.1 channel gating (Fig. 1 D). This suggests that basal Kir2.1 channel activity is unaffected by coexpression with AKAP79. Preliminary results indicated that elevation of intracellular cAMP had little effect upon whole-cell Kir2.1 currents either in the presence or the absence of AKAP79 (Fig.2, A and B). In these experiments, whole-cell currents recorded at −80 mV from cells expressing AKAP79 and Kir2.1 increased by only 13.4 ± 1.9% (mean ± S.E.; n = 6) during a 5-min exposure to 100 μm intracellular cAMP. Cells expressing the channel alone showed a similar 11.1 ± 2.8% (n = 6) increase in whole-cell current over the same time interval. It has previously been reported that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of L-type Ca2+ channel subunits in HEK-293 can only be detected in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (10Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A) and cypermethrin (a potent inhibitor of calcineurin, phosphatase 2B) augmented the effect of cAMP on Kir2.1 currents. Following a 30–40-min pretreatment of the cells in 200 nm okadaic acid and 200 nm cypermethrin, CHO cells expressing both AKAP79 and Kir2.1 showed a 25.6 ± 3.6% (n = 5) increase in whole-cell Kir2.1 current over a 5-min period when exposed to 100 μm intracellular cAMP (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, cells transfected with Kir2.1 alone showed an 8.1 ± 2.5% (n = 5) increase in Kir2.1 current when exposed to 100 μm cAMP over the same period. In the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and AKAP79, the increase in whole-cell Kir current in response to elevated intracellular cAMP was reflected in a 10 mV rightward shift in the relationship between chord conductance and voltage (Fig.3). The voltage at which the chord conductance was half-maximal (V0.5) shifted from V0.5 = −35.1 ± 1.0 mV in control to V0.5= −25.0 ± 0.8 mV in cAMP-exposed cells expressing AKAP79 and Kir2.1 (Fig. 3 D). The conductance-voltage relation of cells expressing Kir2.1 alone shifted from V0.5 = −34.3 ± 1.0 mV in control to V0.5 = −29.0 ± 1.2 mV in cAMP-exposed cells (Fig. 3 B). AKAP79 is a multivalent-anchoring protein that also binds protein kinase C (27Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 28Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of activators of PKC on Kir2.1 currents in the presence and absence of AKAP79. The extracellular application of 1 μmdidecanoyl-rac-glycerol, a cell permeant activator of PKC, or 1 μm phorbol myristate acetate had no effect upon Kir2.1 current in either the presence or absence of AKAP79 or phosphatase inhibitors (not shown). The results of the functional studies outlined above indicate that AKAP79 facilitates cAMP-induced modulation of Kir2.1, presumably by anchoring PKA in close proximity to the ion channel. To establish whether any physical interaction between Kir2.1 and AKAP79 occurs within intact cells, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding AKAP79 and HA-tagged Kir2.1. HA-tagged Kir2.1 channels were found to be functionally indistinguishable from untagged wild-type Kir2.1 channels (data not shown). Antibodies directed against the HA epitope tag on Kir2.1 were able to immunoprecipitate AKAP79 (Fig.4), suggesting that Kir2.1 and AKAP79 exist in a complex within cells. Kir channels have a relatively simple structure compared with Na+ and Ca2+ channels and members of the voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel family. Each subunit in the Kir tetramer consists of an intracellular N and C terminus and two membrane-spanning domains (M1 and M2) separated by a short stretch of amino acids (the H5 or P-region) that dips back into the membrane from the extracellular side to form the selectivity filter and channel pore (21Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 22Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The only intracellular portions of the channel subunit are found at the N terminus (residues 1–71) before the channel protein disappears into the membrane to form M1, and at the C terminus when the protein emerges from M2 (182). It is therefore relatively straightforward to create GST fusion proteins of the intracellular portions of the Kir channel and test for direct interaction with AKAP79 in pull-down assays. To identify possible interactions, GST fusion proteins of the intracellular N (residues 1–71) and C (302) terminal domains of Kir2.1 were screened for their ability to bind AKAP79 from lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with cDNA encoding AKAP79. GST fusion proteins of both the N- and the C-domains of Kir2.1 were able to isolate AKAP79 from COS-7 lysates, whereas GST alone failed to interact with AKAP79 (Fig. 5 A). It has recently been reported that AKAP79 binds to the Src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase-like (GK) domains of the PDZ protein, PSD-95/SAP90 (31Colledge M. Dean R.A Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Kir2.1 contains the conserved PDZ-domain recognition motif (X(S/T)X(V/I)) that mediates binding to members of the PSD-95/SAP90 protein family. Whereas PSD-95 is not present in either COS-7 cells or Escherichia coli, where the GST fusion proteins were originally expressed (see “Experimental Procedures”), we felt it important to test whether AKAP79 binds to Kir2.1 via interaction with an unidentified, endogenous PDZ protein from these cells. For this purpose we constructed a shortened C-terminal GST fusion protein encoding just the last eight C-terminal amino acids of Kir2.1 (421). This shortened GST·C fusion protein, GST·C-(421–428), which includes the Kir2.1 PDZ binding motif, failed to isolate AKAP79, suggesting that AKAP79 binds directly to the intracellular C-domain of Kir2.1 at some point(s) between residues 302 and 421 and not via a C-terminal PDZ protein (Fig.5 B). Fig. 6 (Aand B) shows confocal images of HEK-293 cells that have been transfected with HA·Kir2.1 and AKAP79, stained with antibodies against the HA epitope tag and AKAP79, and visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated with the non-overlapping fluoroprobes, FITC (Fig.6 A) and Texas Red (Fig. 6 B), respectively. The images show both proteins to be localized to the plasma membrane, demonstrating proximity between Kir2.1 and AKAP79 within intact cells. Interestingly, we were unable to use EGFP-tagged Kir2.1 channels to monitor Kir2.1 distribution, as the presence of AKAP79 seemed to quench the EGFP·Kir2.1 fluorescence. Fig. 6 (C and D) show typical confocal images of a HEK-293 cell transfected with EGFP-tagged Kir2.1 (EGFP attached to the N terminus of Kir2.1) and AKAP79. The cell has been permeabilized and stained with anti-AKAP79. EGFP fluorescence is almost undetectable (Fig. 6 C). AKAP79 distribution within the same cell is shown in Fig. 6 D. The reduction in EGFP fluorescence is not a result of cell permeabilization because permeabilized HEK-293 cells expressing EGFP·Kir2.1 alone retain their brightness (Fig. 6 E). Nor is the fluorescence reduction simply because of the coexpression of AKAP79 and EGFP, because cells transfected with EGFP and AKAP79 were indistinguishable from cells transfected with EGFP alone (data not shown). Rather, the effect of reduced fluorescence seems to be a side effect of the association of Kir2.1 and AKAP79. EGFP fluorescence is known to be sensitive to a number of factors, particularly pH, and it seems possible that the anchoring of AKAP79 and its associated proteins may change some factor in the very local environment of the ion channel that affects the fluorescence of the attached EGFP molecule. Our findings suggest that the protein kinase A-anchoring protein, AKAP79, associates directly with intracellular regions of the strong inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir2.1 to anchor PKA close to channel phosphorylation sites. The primary sequence of Kir2.1 suggests the presence of one putative PKA phosphorylation site at position Ser-426 on the C terminus and four putative PKC phosphorylation sites, two on the N terminus (Ser-3, Thr-6) and two on the C terminus (Ser-357, Thr-383). AKAP79, in common with many adaptor proteins, binds several different enzymes, in this case PKA, PKC and the Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase-2B, calcineurin (27Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 28Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Whereas activators of PKC had no discernable effect upon Kir2.1 currents either in the presence or in the absence of AKAP79, elevation of intracellular cAMP caused a marked increase in whole-cell Kir2.1 current in the presence but not in the absence of AKAP79. Interestingly, the effects of elevated cAMP were only observed in cells pretreated with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and cypermethrin. Phosphatase anchoring via association with AKAP79 could potentially increase phosphatase activity close to the channel, although cypermethrin, which specifically inhibits calcineurin with an IC50 in the subnanomolar range, was found to be largely ineffective on its own (data not shown). Alternatively, the reliance on phosphatase inhibitors may simply reflect a relatively high endogenous phosphatase activity within these cell systems and suggests that channel phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may be a fast, dynamic process. There has been a report of similar findings for cloned L-type Ca2+ channels expressed in HEK-293 cells where phosphorylation of the α 1C channel subunit was only observed in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and FK506, both being ineffective on their own (10Gao T.

This and other studies highlight one of the features of heterologous expression systems, which while offering the advantage of a controlled experimental environment, often do not mimic the native conditions needed for ion channel modulation. For example, the weak inward rectifying K+ channel Kir1.1 (ROMK1) is predominantly expressed in the kidney where it plays an important role in K+ homeostasis (22Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The anti-diuretic hormone, vasopressin is known to enhance the activity of native Kir1.1 channels in the kidney via a cAMP-dependent pathway (32Cassola A.C. Giebisch G. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F502-F509PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F599-F605PubMed Google Scholar). When cloned Kir1.1 channels are expressed in intact Xenopusoocytes, however, the channels appear insensitive to elevation of intracellular cAMP, unless coexpressed with the kinase-anchoring protein, AKAP79 (14Ali S. Chen X. Lu M. Xu J.Z. Lerea K.M. Hebert S.C. Wang W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10274-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overlay assays using the AKAP-binding RII subunit of PKA as a probe show the presence of a 100–120 kDa RII-binding protein in kidney membranes, which is absent in oocytes. This suggests that cAMP-induced modulation of Kir1.1 relies upon an anchored pool of PKA, which is not naturally present within oocyte membranes. The functional effects on channel activity of coexpressing AKAP79 and Kir2.1 suggest that AKAP79 also facilitates the phosphorylation of Kir2.1 by anchoring PKA close to the ion channel. The low molecular weight anchoring protein AKAP15/18 has been shown to target PKA to L-type Ca2+ channels by membrane association through myristoylation and palmitoylation of residues at its N terminus and, possibly, by direct interaction with Ca2+ channel subunits (12Gray P.C.

AKAPs contain at least two functional domains: an amphipathic helix that binds the regulatory (RII) subunits of the PKA holoenzyme (5Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S.

Scott J.D Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Early studies suggested that AKAP79 targeting was mediated through interactions with cytoskeletal proteins (34Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although more recent studies suggest that AKAP79 is anchored to the plasma membrane through direct binding of basic domains on the protein to acidic phospholipids, including the phosphoinositide PtdIns(4,5)P2 (36Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). While the primary target of AKAP79 is the plasma membrane, there may be a subsidiary interaction with intracellular regions of channel proteins to create a channel/AKAP complex that could enhance the speed and specificity of PKA-induced phosphorylation. Coimmunoprecipitation of AKAP79 with HA-tagged Kir2.1 certainly suggests that these two proteins exist in a complex within intact cells. Kir channels have a relatively simple structure when compared with Na+/Ca2+ channels, and Kv channels, and this makes it possible to create GST fusion proteins of the entire intracellular portion of the Kir channel and test for direct interaction with AKAP79. GST pull-down assays demonstrate that AKAP79 binds to both the N and C intracellular domains of Kir2.1. Interaction between AKAPs and their target proteins at multiple sites is not unprecedented because AKAP79 has recently been shown to bind to the β2-adrenergic receptor through sites on both the third intracellular loop and at the C-terminal tail (37Fraser I.D.C. Cong M. Kim J. Rollins E.N. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 409-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). AKAP79 also binds to the Src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase-like (GK) domains of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins, PSD-95 and SAP97. This recruits PKA to ionotropic glutamate receptors because PSD-95 interacts with NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and SAP97 binds to GluR1 subunits of AMPA receptors (31Colledge M. Dean R.A Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Kir2.1 contains the PDZ-domain recognition motif (X(S/T)X(V/I)) that mediates binding to the PSD-95/SAP90 protein family, and Kir2.1 has been shown to interact with PSD-95 in yeast two-hybrid screens and heterologous expression systems (38Nehring R.B. Wischmeyer E. Döring F. Veh R.W. Sheng M. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 156-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal AKAP binding we detect for Kir2.1 is unlikely to be via interaction with a PDZ protein because GST·C-(421–428), a shortened C-terminal fusion protein harboring the PDZ motif, failed to isolate AKAP79 in pull-down assays. Nevertheless, the ability of AKAP79 to bind to PSD-95 and directly to intracellular regions of Kir2.1 may offer additional stability to potential protein complexes containing the ion channel, PDZ protein and AKAP. It is also notable that NMDA receptors retain the option of recruiting PKA through the simultaneous association of two separate anchoring proteins: AKAP79, which binds to the receptor via PSD-95 (31Colledge M. Dean R.A Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and yotiao, which binds directly to the C-terminal C1 exon cassette of the NMDA receptor (9Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D.C. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Because the native AKAP partner of Kir2.1 has yet to be identified, it is tempting to speculate that a similar situation may exist for K+channels. In conclusion, we present evidence for the direct association of a protein kinase A-anchoring protein with a K+ channel. This is potentially important given the unique role of K+channels in shaping the electrical properties and firing patterns of cells, and the profound effects that K+ channel modulation has upon cellular excitability. It seems increasingly likely thatin vivo K+ channels, like Ca2+channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors, exist in highly organized complexes made up of AKAPs and associated signaling proteins that ensure rapid and efficient phosphorylation of the channel protein in response to localized cell signals."

Nature. 1993; 364: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and transgenic rescue of dystrophin expression has been used to identify structure-function relationships within the DGC. In these studies, expression or overexpression of dystrophin from the tissue-specific muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter was not associated with toxicity (11Cox G.A. Cole N.M. Matsumura K. Phelps S.F. Hauschka S.D. Campbell K.P. Faulkner J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, less is known about sarcoglycan replacement, and unlike dystrophin, the sarcoglycans are transmembrane proteins that assemble within the secretory pathway. Restoration of proper targeting and assembly of the sarcoglycans may involve additional regulatory aspects than those required for expression of cytoplasmic proteins. Adeno- and adeno-associated viruses carrying normal genes have been successfully used to rescue skeletal muscle defects in mice lacking dystrophin or sarcoglycans (12Cordier L. Hack A.A. Scott M.O.

These studies describe the efficiency of protein expression as well as the immune response generated by the introduction of the transfer viruses and the vectors carrying the gene. The dose response of treatment, including studies of the minimally effective dose and the potential for toxicity related to overexpression, has not yet been explored fully. With the initiation of phase I clinical trials using gene therapy for limb girdle muscular dystrophies (1Stedman H. Wilson J.M. Finke R. Kleckner A.L. Mendell J. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is extremely important to determine the risks and benefits of this potentially very powerful approach. In this study, we generated transgenic mice expressing different levels of γ-sarcoglycan under the control of the MCK promoter. We found that mice carrying a high copy number of the γ-sarcoglycan gene, concomitant with marked overexpression of γ-sarcoglycan protein, showed profound muscular dystrophy as revealed by extreme muscle wasting and premature death. Histopathology showed muscular dystrophy with variable fiber size, centrally placed nuclei, and increased fibrosis. In addition, fast fibers seem to be preferentially affected. In muscle overexpressing γ-sarcoglycan, we found that γ-sarcoglycan failed to reach the cell membrane and was associated with intracellular aggregates. The remaining sarcoglycan subunits were targeted to the sarcolemma; however, α- and β-sarcoglycans were significantly up-regulated at the muscle membrane. These findings suggest that overexpression of γ-sarcoglycan and misregulation of α- and β-sarcoglycan can cause muscular dystrophy. Full-length mouse γ-sarcoglycan (nucleotides 152–1027 of GenBankTMaccession number AF282901) was obtained using mouse skeletal muscle cDNA as template and amplified with the following primer pairs: gsgF, 5′-AGAAGCTTGCCATGGTTCGAGAGCAGTAC-3′; gsgR, 5′-TAGGATCCTCAAAGACAGACGTGGCTG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with HindIII and BamHI. The digested polymerase chain reaction product was then ligated to the pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that was treated withHindIII and BamHI. Polyadenylation and termination signals of bovine growth hormone from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added at the XbaI site. Muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter was amplified with the following primer pairs: MCK-F, 5′-ATCTCGAGCAGCTGAGGTGCAAAAGGCT-3′ and MCK-R, 5′-ATAAGCTTGGGGGCAGCCCCTGTGCCCC-3′ (16Larochelle N. Lochmuller H. Zhao J. Jani A. Hallauer P. Hastings K.E. Massie B. Prescott S. Petrof B.J. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The resultant 1.35-kb fragment was inserted into the XhoI andHindIII sites. Sequences were verified using cycle sequencing. After digestion with BssHII, the prokaryotic vector was separated from the transgene by sucrose gradient (17Kim S. Lin H. Barr E. Chu L. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of transgene DNA into the pronucleus of fertilized single-cell BL6/DBA embryos as previously described (18Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994: 115-126Google Scholar, 19Zhu X. Hadhazy M. Wehling M. Tidball J.G. McNally E.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The MCKgsg transgene was detected in transgenic mice by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA with α-32P-labeled DNA probe containing the full-length γ-sarcoglycan coding region (nucleotides 152–1027 of GenBankTM accession number AF282901). Genomic DNA was predigested with BamHI and HindIII. Signal strength was quantified using ImageQuant software and a STORM 860 phosphorimager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transgene copy number was determined by comparing the γ-sarcoglycan transgene and endogenous γ-sarcoglycan gene. MCKgsg mRNA expression was detected with the same full-length γ-sarcoglycan probe as described above. The following probes to murine sarcoglycan sequences were also used: α-sarcoglycan cDNA coding region (nucleotides 254–1417, GenBankTM accession number AB024920); β-sarcoglycan partial cDNA coding region (nucleotides 325–834, GenBankTM accession number AB024921). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Fifteen μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane. For protein analysis, 50 μg of total protein was resolved on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Invitrogen BV/NOVEX, Groningen, Netherlands). Immunoblotting was performed using the following primary antibodies: monoclonal anti-α- and -β-sarcoglycan antibodies (NovoCastro Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), polyclonal anti-γ- and -δ-sarcoglycans (6Hack A.A. Lam M.Y. Cordier L. Shoturma D.I. Ly C.T. Hadhazy M.A. Hadhazy M.R. Sweeney H.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2535-2544PubMed Google Scholar), polyclonal anti-dystrophin antibody (7Hack A.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and monoclonal anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, IA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used. Muscles (gastrocnemius together with soleus and quadriceps) and hearts from 6-week-old mice were isolated and weighed. 10-μm sections were fixed in methanol for immunostaining or in 10% formalin for hematoxylin/eosin or Masson trichrome staining. Primary antibodies were the same for immunoblotting analysis except polyclonal anti-β-sarcoglycan antibody (7Hack A.A. Ly C.T. Jiang F. Clendenin C.J. Sigrist K.S. Wollmann R.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was used. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used. Counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was included in the mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired on AxioCam and analyzed with AxioVision 2.0 (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Fiber types (fast and slow fibers) were distinguished using the procedure as described previously (20Punkt K. Krug H. Bohme R. Acta Histochem. 1987; 82: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). An alkaline preincubation at pH 9.4 was used. The MCKgsg transgene was engineered by placing the full-length mouse γ-sarcoglycan cDNA sequence under the control of the 1.35-kb MCK promoter (16Larochelle N. Lochmuller H. Zhao J. Jani A. Hallauer P. Hastings K.E. Massie B. Prescott S. Petrof B.J. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) followed by bovine growth hormone termination and polyadenylation signals (Fig.1 A). To assess the potential toxicity of high level γ-sarcoglycan expression, four lines of transgenic mice were selected for this study. Two lines carried low copy numbers of the transgene, and two lines carried high copy numbers of the transgene. Using a full-length γ-sarcoglycan cDNA sequence as a probe, MCKgsg lines 1 and 3 carried approximately three and four copies, respectively, when compared with the endogenous γ-sarcoglycan gene (Fig. 1 B) and are considered low copy transgenic mice. MCKgsg lines 2 and 4, considered as high copy transgenic mice, carried ∼57 and 36 copies of the γ-sarcoglycan gene, respectively, relative to the endogenous gene (Fig.1 B, asterisk). Northern blot analysis showed the transgenic γ-sarcoglycan mRNA at the predicted size of 1.3 kb (Fig. 1 C, arrow). MCKgsg line 2 (high copy) exhibited more mRNA expression than MCKgsg line 1 (low copy), and both showed considerably more mRNA than the endogenous 1.6-kb γ-sarcoglycan mRNA (Fig. 1 C, asterisk). The MCK promoter expressed γ-sarcoglycan mRNA in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, although lower levels of mRNA expression were seen in cardiac muscle (Fig. 1 C). Immunoblot analysis showed that γ-sarcoglycan protein expression correlated with gene copy number in that high copy number transgenic lines expressed substantially greater amounts of γ-sarcoglycan protein (Fig. 1 D, lanes 6 and 9 for MCKgsg lines 2 and 4, respectively). A serial dilution of protein extract from transgenic muscle showed that MCKgsg lines 2 and 4 expressed a 150- and 200-fold increase in the amount of γ-sarcoglycan protein, respectively, when compared with wild type, whereas lines 1 and 3 expressed ∼3- and 5-fold more, respectively (Fig. 1 D). Of the four independent founder lines and their wild type littermate controls, the two high copy MCKgsg transgenic mice were found to be significantly smaller than their wild type littermates and the low copy number MCKgsg transgenic lines. A representative comparison of a high copy transgenic (MCKgsg line 4) and a normal littermate control mouse is shown in Fig.2, top panel. Mice from MCKgsg lines 2 and 4 (high copy) were less active and displayed an abnormal gait that was characterized by widened hind limb spacing. We examined skeletal muscles from MCKgsg high copy mice, MCKgsg low copy mice, and wild type littermate controls. Hind limb from MCKgsg line 4 was visibly dystrophic with marked muscle wasting and gross fibrofatty replacement when compared with wild type mice (Fig. 2, top panel,right side). Muscle mass of individual quadriceps in MCKgsg lines 2 and 4 (0.07 and 0.05 g, respectively) was significantly lower when compared with two control littermates (0.16 and 0.14 g). Similar findings were observed in fore limbs of high copy MCKgsg lines 2 and 4 (data not shown). The marked muscle wasting was associated with premature death. Two independent high copy founders from MCKgsg line 2 and MCKgsg line 4 died at day 45 and day 110, respectively. Given the limited survival of the male founder for MCKgsg line 2, we attempted to propagate this line through in vitro fertilization but were unsuccessful. The female founder for MCKgsg line 4 reproduced once. The progeny from MCKgsg line 4 died prematurely and did not reproduce. Thus, neither high copy line was successfully maintained because of the lethal nature of the overexpression of γ-sarcoglycan. We generated an intermediate high copy number line, MCKgsg line 5, with a copy number of ∼29. These mice also displayed small size and abnormal gait similar to the MCKgsg lines 2 and 4. Propagation of MCKgsg line 5 was similarly limited. Histologic analysis of muscles from high copy transgenic mice (MCKgsg line 4) using hematoxylin/eosin and Masson trichrome staining showed severe dystrophic changes, including wide variation in fiber size, an inflammatory infiltrate, increased connective tissue, and adipocyte replacement of myofibers (Fig. 2, A and B). Abundant central nuclei were also evident in the dystrophic muscle (Fig. 2 A). Muscle from MCKgsg line 3, a low copy number line, appeared normal (Fig. 2, C and D) when compared with wild type control muscle (Fig. 2, E andF). The dystrophic phenotype of muscles from high copy transgenic mice was very similar to that seen in a γ-sarcoglycan-null mutant (7Hack A.A. Ly C.T. Jiang F. Clendenin C.J. Sigrist K.S. Wollmann R.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, G and H). γ-Sarcoglycan is an integral part of the membrane-associated sarcoglycan complex. Because of the similar histologic appearance of high copy MCKgsg transgenic muscle and γ-sarcoglycan-null mutant muscle (7Hack A.A. Ly C.T. Jiang F. Clendenin C.J. Sigrist K.S. Wollmann R.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we examined γ-sarcoglycan localization in gastrocnemius muscle from normal mice and MCKgsg line 2. Despite a high level of γ-sarcoglycan protein expression, γ-sarcoglycan protein failed to target appropriately to the cell membrane (Fig. 3 A). The majority of immunoreactive γ-sarcoglycan protein was detected as punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm of the myofibers and was excluded from nuclei (arrowhead). Similar findings were observed in gastrocnemius muscle from MCKgsg line 4 (data not shown). Muscles from low copy MCKgsg transgenic mice were similar to wild type control muscle with normal γ-sarcoglycan localization at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, B and C). Although a small amount of cytoplasmic γ-sarcoglycan protein was seen, this was not toxic to muscle given the normal histology (Figs. 2 C and3 B). Lack of γ-sarcoglycan expression at the cell membrane and increased intracellular γ-sarcoglycan altered the expression of the remaining sarcoglycans in a manner different from loss of function mutations. The genetic loss of γ-sarcoglycan is accompanied by reduced protein expression at the plasma membrane of the residual sarcoglycans despite their normal mRNA levels (4Noguchi S. McNally E.M. Ben Othmane K. Hagiwara Y. Mizuno Y. Yoshida M. Yamamoto H. Bonnemann C.G. Gussoni E. Denton P.H. Kyriakides T. Middleton L. Hentati F. Ben Hamida M. Nonaka I. Vance J.M. Kunkel L.M. Ozawa E. Science. 1995; 270: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 7Hack A.A. Ly C.T. Jiang F. Clendenin C.J. Sigrist K.S. Wollmann R.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because high level γ-sarcoglycan expression similarly results in loss of γ-sarcoglycan at the cell membrane, we expected that reduced levels of the other sarcoglycan proteins may be present. Instead, the increased cytoplasmic expression of γ-sarcoglycan from MCKgsg line 2 (high copy) resulted in up-regulation of α- and β-sarcoglycans (Fig.4, A and C) when compared with wild type (Fig. 4, B and D). Of note, some β-sarcoglycan was found in a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 C) suggesting that it may be aggregated with γ-sarcoglycan. Normal levels of δ-sarcoglycan and dystrophin were present in MCKgsg line 2 mice (Fig. 4, E andG). These data suggest that increased cytoplasmic γ-sarcoglycan may be toxic to myofibers and sufficient to cause muscular dystrophy. Mislocalization of the remaining sarcoglycans is not required for the development of muscular dystrophy, but abnormal assembly of the sarcoglycans may contribute to the development of muscle degeneration. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of α- and β-sarcoglycan. α- and β-Sarcoglycans were significantly up-regulated in muscle from the MCKgsg high copy lines (lines 2 and 4) compared with MCKgsg line 1, a low copy number line and wild type littermate muscle (Fig. 4 I). δ-Sarcoglycan and dystrophin levels were not significantly changed by overexpression of γ-sarcoglycan at any level. Surprisingly, myosin expression appeared reduced in the high copy MCKgsg transgenic muscles suggesting that cytoplasmic γ-sarcoglycan expression may disrupt sarcomeric function. At the light microscopic level, sarcomeres did not appear disrupted in MCKgsg line 2 (data not shown). To determine whether up-regulation of α- and β-sarcoglycans is accompanied by an increase in α- or β-sarcoglycan mRNA, we compared the mRNA expression in muscle from MCKgsg high copy transgenic and wild type mice. α-Sarcoglycan mRNA in MCKgsg line 4 was similar to that in wild type (Fig. 4 J, top panel), suggesting that up-regulation of α-sarcoglycan is related to an inability of myocytes to regulate stoichiometric ratios at the sarcolemma. β-Sarcoglycan mRNA exists as three isoforms (4.4, 3.0, and 1.4 kb) that are thought to encode the same protein. We found that the 3.0- and 1.4-kb fragments were increased, whereas the 4.4-kb fragment was decreased (Fig. 4 J, middle panel). It is possible that these alternative splicing forms may regulate the overall mRNA and consequently β-sarcoglycan protein expression. Thus, multiple factors might be involved in the mechanism underlying the up-regulation of β-sarcoglycan protein. Muscle fibers respond to damage differently depending on their fiber types. It was shown that fast muscle fibers are preferentially affected in DMD (21Webster C. Silberstein L. Hays A.P. Blau H.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 503-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We examined how fiber types respond differently in muscular dystrophy mediated by γ-sarcoglycan overexpression under the control of the MCK promoter. We examined limb muscles from MCKgsg high copy mice and compared soleus (predominantly slow) to gastrocnemius (predominantly fast) muscle for ATPase activity. Fig. 5 shows both soleus (lower right portion of each muscle section) and gastrocnemius (upper left portion). Compared with normal muscles (Fig. 5 A), muscles from MCKgsg line 2 (Fig.5 B) showed pervasive degeneration in areas, such as the gastrocnemius, where fast fibers are concentrated. Only the fast fibers in the soleus of MCKgsg line 2 showed overt degeneration. In MCKgsg line 2, slow fibers, seen abundantly in the soleus, showed less damage. Soleus also showed an increased percentage of slow fibers, consistent with their decreased susceptibility to muscular dystrophy and decreased level of the MCK promoter-directed γ-sarcoglycan overexpression. It was previously shown that the MCK promoter directed dystrophin protein expression at a level 3–4 times higher in fast fibers than in slow fibers (22Lee C.C. Pons F. Jones P.G. Bies R.D. Schlang A.M. Leger J.J. Caskey C.T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1993; 4: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that reduced expression of MCKgsg may occur, accounting for some of the protection of slow skeletal fibers. Disruption of the DGC is responsible for a number of genetically distinct forms of muscular dystrophy. This includes mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause DMD and mutations in the sarcoglycan genes that cause the limb girdle muscular dystrophies (2Zatz M. Vainzof M. Passos-Bueno M.R. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2000; 13: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Hoffman E.P. Brown Jr., R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3689) Google Scholar). Many of these mutations are thought to produce disruption of the DGC by loss of function or loss of protein expression. Because mice null for sarcoglycan genes have been generated (6Hack A.A. Lam M.Y. Cordier L. Shoturma D.I. Ly C.T. Hadhazy M.A. Hadhazy M.R. Sweeney H.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2535-2544PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hack A.A. Ly C.T. Jiang F. Clendenin C.J. Sigrist K.S. Wollmann R.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and these mice fully recapitulate the membrane instability and other features of human muscular dystrophy, we generated mice expressing γ-sarcoglycan to study replacement approaches for the sarcoglycan gene products. For these transgenic studies, we used the MCK promoter to drive high level, striated muscle-specific expression. We selected the MCK promoter because it has been used extensively in transgenic gene replacement studies of dystrophin (11Cox G.A. Cole N.M. Matsumura K. Phelps S.F. Hauschka S.D. Campbell K.P. Faulkner J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We found a profound, lethal muscle wasting disorder developed in transgenic mice that had high level overexpression of murine γ-sarcoglycan. These mice typically died within 2–3 months of age, were markedly reduced in size, and displayed limited mobility. In the high level γ-sarcoglycan-overexpressing mice, we noted that fast fibers were preferentially affected. This may be consistent with fiber type specificity of the MCK promoter (22Lee C.C. Pons F. Jones P.G. Bies R.D. Schlang A.M. Leger J.J. Caskey C.T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1993; 4: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or may be related to observations made in DMD muscle where fast fibers are more sensitive to damage (21Webster C. Silberstein L. Hays A.P. Blau H.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 503-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Lower levels of γ-sarcoglycan expression from the same MCK promoter were not associated with muscle damage. The lower levels of expression seen in the hearts of these transgenic animals resulted in near normal γ-sarcoglycan expression and no evidence of toxicity or damage (data not shown) and suggests that lethality associated with γ-sarcoglycan overexpression is related to skeletal muscle toxicity. Because cardiomyopathy typically develops later in mice with sarcoglycan gene mutations (6Hack A.A. Lam M.Y. Cordier L. Shoturma D.I. Ly C.T. Hadhazy M.A. Hadhazy M.R. Sweeney H.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2535-2544PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hack A.A. Ly C.T. Jiang F. Clendenin C.J. Sigrist K.S. Wollmann R.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the premature death in MCKgsg high copy transgenic mice may have limited our ability to detect cardiomyopathy. The high level of γ-sarcoglycan expression resulting from the MCKgsg transgenes produced several molecular consequences. Overexpression of γ-sarcoglycan resulted in reduced γ-sarcoglycan at the plasma membrane of myofibers. Loss of γ-sarcoglycan expression at the membrane is found in DMD and sarcoglycan-mediated muscular dystrophies. Indeed, a human muscular dystrophy patient carrying the common Δ521-T founder mutation was described who maintained expression of α-, β-, and δ-sarcoglycan and preferentially displayed reduced γ-sarcoglycan (24Crosbie R.H. Lim L.E. Moore S.A. Hirano M. Hays A.P. Maybaum S.W. Collin H. Dovico S.A. Stolle C.A. Fardeau M. Tome F.M. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of γ-sarcoglycan at the plasma membrane of myofibers is likely a contributor to the pathogenesis seen in this overexpression model. A second consequence of γ-sarcoglycan overexpression was the accumulation of γ-sarcoglycan immunoreactive aggregates in the cytoplasm of myofibers. Because the sarcoglycan complex is associated with both mechanical and signaling functions (25Hack A.A. Cordier L. Shoturma D.I. Lam M.Y. Sweeney H.L. McNally E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), mislocalization of γ-sarcoglycan in the cytoplasm could lead to abnormal signaling or alteration of cytoskeletal elements that interact with the γ-sarcoglycan. In its cytoplasmic domain, γ-sarcoglycan interacts with a muscle-specific form of filamin (γ-filamin or filamin 2), and loss of γ-sarcoglycan produces an increased plasma membrane γ-filamin level (26Thompson T.G. Chan Y.M. Hack A.A. Brosius M. Rajala M. Lidov H.G. McNally E.M. Watkins S. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Once antibodies that recognize murine γ-filamin are available, it will be interesting to determine whether filamin localization is altered in γ-sarcoglycan-overexpressing mice. A third consequence of marked γ-sarcoglycan expression is the increased expression of α- and β-sarcoglycan. Up-regulation of α-sarcoglycan is possibly due to an inability to regulate protein assembly at the sarcolemma. However, regulation at both transcription level as well as protein level may be responsible for the up-regulation of β-sarcoglycan. The increase in these proteins likely produces abnormal sarcoglycan complexes that, in turn, may produce muscular dystrophy. The aberrant ratio of sarcoglycans may cause abnormal mechanical and signaling functions that may be pathologic to the muscle. Despite the similar histology between γ-sarcoglycan overexpression-mediated muscular dystrophy and muscular dystrophy caused by dystrophin- or γ-sarcoglycan-null mutation, disparities exist. In muscle degeneration where sarcoglycan is absent, instability of the muscle membrane is demonstrated by increased permeability. Normal muscle is impermeable to Evans blue dye, a small molecular weight vital tracer. Mutations in dystrophin or sarcoglycan lead to abnormal membrane permeability, and Evans blue dye uptake is a significant feature of the membrane defect in mdx and γ-sarcoglycan mutants (7Hack A.A. Ly C.T. Jiang F. Clendenin C.J. Sigrist K.S. Wollmann R.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 27Matsuda R. Nishikawa A. Tanaka H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28Straub V. Rafael J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We were able to assess Evans blue dye uptake in MCKgsg line 5 (copy number 29) and found no evidence for Evans blue dye uptake (data not shown). The expression and membrane localization of the remaining sarcoglycan subunits in γ-sarcoglycan-overexpressing muscle likely has a protective effect on membrane permeability that is absent in γ-sarcoglycan-null muscle (7Hack A.A. Ly C.T. Jiang F. Clendenin C.J. Sigrist K.S. Wollmann R.L. McNally E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, although overexpression of γ-sarcoglycan leads to muscular dystrophy, the mechanism by which this muscular dystrophy develops likely differs from γ-sarcoglycan deficiency. Transgenic rescue of dystrophin deficiency in the mdx mouse has been used to demonstrate that dystrophin replacement is effective (11Cox G.A. Cole N.M. Matsumura K. Phelps S.F. Hauschka S.D. Campbell K.P. Faulkner J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 22Lee C.C. Pons F. Jones P.G. Bies R.D. Schlang A.M. Leger J.J. Caskey C.T. Hum.

This approach has been highly illustrative to delineate structure-function relationships within dystrophin and its interaction with the remainder of the DGC (11Cox G.A. Cole N.M. Matsumura K.

Furthermore, overexpression of utrophin, the highly related dystrophin homolog, also can fully rescue the dystrophic phenotype in the mdx mouse (29Tinsley J. Deconinck N. Fisher R. Kahn D. Phelps S. Gillis J.M. Davies K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In these studies, the same MCK promoter was used but did not result in myofiber toxicity as seen here for γ-sarcoglycan overexpression. This suggests that the skeletal myocyte has different mechanisms for the maintenance of stoichiometric ratios of the different components of the DGC. These studies highlight the complexity of simple gene replacement strategies and underscore the importance of animal models for the treatment of human disease. Because viral replacement strategies typically lead to high level and often variable levels of expression throughout the transduced tissue, it is likely that some toxicity is occurring in those myofibers that have been transduced at high levels. Moreover, previous viral replacement studies, although critically important in demonstrating that replacement can be effective, have not explored fully the dose response of treatment that includes studies of the minimally effective dose and the potential for toxicity related to overexpression. Because viral replacement gene therapy trials are being initiated in humans (1Stedman H. Wilson J.M. Finke R. Kleckner A.L. Mendell J. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), thorough testing in animal models is required to document the full range of benefits and the potential risks and toxicity.

Unlike their chicken egg white counterparts, PEW glycoproteins contain terminal Galα1–4Gal, as evidenced by GS-I lectin (specific for terminal α-Gal), anti-P1(Galα1–4Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer) monoclonal antibody, and P fimbriae on uropathogenic Escherichia coli(specific for Galα1–4Gal). Galα1–4Gal on PEW glycoproteins were found in N-glycans releasable by treatment with glycoamidase F. The respective contents of N-glycans in each glycoprotein were 3.5%, POT; 17%, POA(hi); and 31–37%, POM. POA(hi) has four N-glycosylation sites, in contrast to chicken ovalbumin, which has only one. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that N-glycans on POA(hi) were highly heterogeneous. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the major N-glycans were monosialylated tri-, tetra-, and penta-antennary oligosaccharides containing terminal Galα1–4Gal with or without bisecting N-acetylglucosamine. Oligosaccharide chains terminating in Galα1–4Gal are rare amongN-glycans from the mammals and avians that have been studied, and our finding is the first predominant presence of (Galα1–4Gal)-terminated N-glycans.

Although the presence of Galα1–4Gal on ovomucoids of turtle dove and pigeon has been evidenced and these glycoproteins can be utilized for the study of microbiology, complete carbohydrate structures of these ovomucoids are not yet known. Only a tentative structure had been proposed for the main oligosaccharide structure of turtle dove ovomucoid, which includes Galα1–4Gal sequence at the non-reducing terminus of the N-glycan (28François-Gérard C.

Whole chicken egg white (CEW) failed to inhibit hemagglutination of P1 erythrocytes by P-fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli, whereas PEW inhibited it successfully (24Johnson J.R. Swanson J.L. Neill M.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 578-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence and absence of Galα1–4Gal in various avian egg whites exemplifies the evolutionary diversity of glycoconjugates among birds. Investigating the relationships between phylogeny of birds and distribution of oligosaccharides with Galα1–4Gal should help us understand how and why this unique structural feature in the N-glycans has appeared during evolution. In this study, we examined the major pigeon egg white glycoproteins for the presence of Galα1–4Gal, and discovered that not only ovomucoid, but also major glycoproteins including two ovalbumins and ovotransferrin, possess N-glycan with terminal Galα1–4Gal. Structures of major oligosaccharides from POA(hi) were determined by mass spectrometric analysis as novel typeN-glycans containing Galα1–4Gal. Pigeon eggs were collected from local racing pigeon breeders in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN metropolitan areas, and egg white and egg yolk were separated manually. Egg white was lyophilized and kept at 4 °C until use. α-Galactosidase from green coffee beans, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM, and mouse laminin from basement membranes were purchased from Sigma. Glycoamidase F 2Glycoamidase F is also known as PNGase F, glycopeptide N-glycosidase F, orN-glycanase.

Neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens was a generous gift from Dr. Tsukada and Dr. Ohta of Marukin Shoyu Co. (Uji, Japan). Extracti-Gel®D detergent removing gel were from Pierce. TBS contains 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl. TBST contains 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. Lectin Buffer 1 was TBS containing 1 mm CaCl2and 1 mm MgSO4, and Lectin Buffer 2 was 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 9.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2. Lyophilized pigeon egg white (200 mg) was dissolved with 1.5 ml of distilled water and centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. Supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and injected onto a C4 column for HPLC (2 mg for C4 column of 4.6 × 250 mm, 20 mg for C4 column of 21.2 × 250 mm). The mobile phase was A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and B (90% CH3CN in H2O containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). The elution (1 ml/min for 4.6-mm C4 column, 8 ml/min for 21.2-mm C4 column) was by a linear gradient of 10–70% of B in A developed over 30 min, followed by isocratic elution for 10 min. Proteins eluted were detected byA280 nm. Individual peaks were collected, dialyzed against water in the cold, and then lyophilized. Glycoproteins from pigeon egg white were heated at 100 °C for 10 min with 3% SDS and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), then transferred to PVDF membrane in 25 mm Tris-glycine (pH 8.3) in 15% methanol. After blocking with 3% BSA with 0.1% NaN3 overnight, the membranes were washed three times with TBST and once with Lectin Buffer 1, then incubated with 1 ml of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated GS-I lectin (1 μg/ml) for 1.5 h. After washing three times with TBST, 5 ml of Lectin Buffer 2 containing 100 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 200 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate was applied to the membranes to visualize the bound GS-I, then washed three times with H2O. For immunoblotting with anti-P1 mAb or anti-(Galα1–3Gal) mAb (mouse IgM), the transferred membranes were blocked with 3% BSA containing 0.1% NaN3 overnight, washed three times with TBST, and incubated with the first antibody for 1.5 h. The membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with the second antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM, for 1.5 h. After washing with TBST, the bound antibody was visualized as described above. For bacterial or lectin agglutination assays, 3 μl of a suspension of P-fimbriated E. coli strain J96 (∼1 × 1011 colony-forming units/ml in 5% methyl α-d-mannopyranoside in PBS) or 3 μl of GS-I lectin (1 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), 3 μl of inhibitors of various concentrations or 30 mg/ml BSA in PBS, and then 1 μl of a 5% (v/v) suspension of human P1-phenotype RBCs in PBS were mixed on microscope slides. The slides were rocked for 60 s, and agglutination of RBCs was observed microscopically. Inhibitors were tested at serial 2-fold dilutions to determine the dilution beyond which inhibition first dropped to below 100% (“last full inhibition”) and where it was first completely absent (“first full agglutination”). For the anti-P1 assays, 20 μl of the anti-P1 mAb and 20 μl of inhibitors or 30 mg/ml BSA in PBS were mixed in test tubes and incubated for 15 min on ice. Then, 20 μl of a 5% (v/v) suspension of human P1-phenotype RBCs were added and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were spun down to a pellet and gently resuspended by rocking the tube, then scored for presence or absence and degree of RBC agglutination. Serial 10-fold dilutions of each inhibitor were tested in the anti-P1assays to determine the last dilution still showing inhibition of hemagglutination. PEW glycoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and followed by low voltage electroblotting to PVDF membrane in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, in 10% methanol, and subjected to sequencing. N-terminal sequence analysis was carried out by Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems model 494 Procise® protein sequencer. Sequence identity search was performed using SWISS-PROT data base (updated July 25, 1999) interfaced with the Wisconsin Package of the Genetics Computer Group. Primary accession numbers for the data base are as follows: chicken ovomucoid, P01005; chicken ovotransferrin, P02789; chicken ovalbumin, P01012. Since the N termini of both forms of POA (53 and 49 kDa by SDS-PAGE) are blocked, these proteins were submitted to chemical cleavage by BrCN in 70% formic acid at 37 °C for 4 h. Following the cleavage, the mixture was diluted 10-fold with distilled water and the solution was freeze-dried. A single fragment from each POA was isolated either by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (from 8% to 48% developed over 16 min, 0.5 ml/min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 40 °C, and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Glycoproteins (20 μg of POM, 100 μg each of POT, POA(hi), and POA(lo)) were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid to release neutral sugars or with 4 m HCl to release amino sugars (37Fan J.-Q. Namiki Y. Matsuoka K. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The released monosaccharides were analyzed with HPAEC-PAD using a CarboPac PA-1 column and isocratic elution with 18 mm NaOH. To release terminal α-linked galactose specifically, glycoproteins were incubated at 25 °C overnight with coffee bean α-galactosidase (15 milliunits) in 100 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), and the released galactose was measured with HPAEC-PAD under the same conditions as above. Sialic acids were released from glycoproteins with sialidase from A. ureafaciens (1 milliunit) by incubating in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.6) at 37 °C for 2 h, and analyzed with HPAEC-PAD using a CarboPac PA-1 column and isocratic condition with 100 mm sodium acetate and 100 mmNaOH. Glycoproteins (100 μg) were dissolved with 25 μl of 0.5% SDS and heated at 90 °C for 3 min to denature. After the solutions were cooled to room temperature, 80 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.6), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1 unit of GAF were added to the heat-denatured glycoproteins. The reaction mixtures (100 μl each) were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h to complete de-N-glycosylation, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min to inactivate GAF. For partial de-N-glycosylation on POA(hi), glycoproteins were incubated with 0.4 units of GAF for 5 min, 40 min, and 3 h, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. To release N-glycans from POM completely, POM was heat-denatured with 0.5% SDS and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 90 °C for 3 min, to which 1% (w/v) CHAPS was added instead of Nonidet P-40, and incubated with GAF at 37 °C overnight. This reaction mixture was heat-denatured again at 90 °C for 3 min, and incubated at 37 °C overnight after adding CHAPS to 1% (w/v) and 1 unit of GAF again. This step had to be repeated three times to achieve complete deglycosylation of POM, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Detergents in the reaction mixture were removed by gel filtration with Extracti-Gel®D detergent removing gel. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed using a PerSeptive Biosystems STR Biospectrometry™ research station coupled with a Delayed Extraction™ laser-desorption mass spectrometer. An aliquot of each sample was diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed using matrix of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid). In some cases in which signals were weak, a portion of the sample was further purified using a C8 cartridge (1 × 10 mm). After washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, protein was eluted with 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed in the same matrix. Procedures for isolation of N-linked oligosaccharides, pyridylamine (PA)-derivatization, and HPLC analysis were based on the methods established by Tomiya et al. (38Tomiya N. Awaya J. Kurono M. Endo S. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,39Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and modified as follows. POA(hi) (100 mg) was digested with 1 mg each of trypsin and chymotrypsin in 1.5 ml of TBS (pH 7.3) containing 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 16 h, and then heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The same amounts of trypsin and chymotrypsin were added, and the digestion and heat denaturation was repeated once more. Oligosaccharides were released from the resultant glycopeptides with 20 units of GAF in the same buffer at 37 °C for 16 h. The residual peptides were digested to amino acids or very short peptides by incubating with 1 mg of Pronase in the same buffer at 55 °C for 16 h, and the oligosaccharide fractions were separated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 98 cm) in water. For the PA derivatization by reductive amination, lyophilized oligosaccharide fractions were dissolved in 80 μl of 2-aminopyridine solution (1 g/580 μl in concentrated HCl, pH 6.8), and heated at 90 °C for 15 min with heating block. Freshly prepared NaCNBH3 solution (14 mg/8 μl) was added into the reaction mixture, then heated at 90 °C for 1 h. PA-oligosaccharides were fractionated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-15 column (1.0 × 40 cm, in 10 mm NH4HCO3) and lyophilized. The PA-oligosaccharides were purified by HPLC with three different columns. In the first step, the PA-oligosaccharide mixture was separated on a TSKgel DEAE-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm) as described previously (39Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the neutral, monosialyl, disialyl, trisialyl, and tetrasialyl fractions were collected separately and lyophilized. In the second step, monosialylated oligosaccharides were separated on a YMC-Pak HRC-ODS-A column (6.0 × 150 mm). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 55 °C using Eluent A (0.005% trifluoroacetic acid) and Eluent B (0.5% 1-butanol in Eluent A). The column was equilibrated with a mixture of Eluents A and B (80:20, v/v), and after injection of a sample, the ratio of the eluents was increased linearly to A:B = 50:50 in 60 min. Each peak was collected and lyophilized. In the third step, major peaks from ODS column were further separated on a TSKgel Amido-80 column (4.6 × 250 mm) as described previously (38Tomiya N. Awaya J. Kurono M. Endo S. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In all the HPLC systems, PA-oligosaccharides were monitored by fluorescence using excitation and emission wavelengths of 310 and 400 nm, respectively. PA-oligosaccharides were permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method as described by Dell et al. (40Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). FAB- and ESI-MS analyses were performed on an Autospec orthogonal acceleration-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass), fitted with a magnet bypass flight tube, and interchangeable FAB and ESI source assemblies. For FAB-MS experiments, the fitted cesium ion gun was operated at 26 kV and the source accelerating voltage at 8 kV. Operation in the magnet bypass mode allowed an acquisition of up to a mass range of m/z 7000 with the fitted TOF detector. Cesium iodide was used as external calibrant for both the magnet and TOF mass analyzers. The permethyl derivatives of the N-glycans were redissolved in CH3OH for loading onto the probe tip coated with glycerol:m-nitrobenzyl alcohol:trifluoroacetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v) as matrix. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) FAB-MS/MS was performed by introducing argon gas to the collision cell to a reading of ∼1.2 × 10−6 millibars on the TOF ion gauge, at a lab frame collision energy of 800 eV and a push-out frequency of 56 kHz for orthogonal sampling. A 1-s integration time per spectrum was chosen for the TOF analyzer with a 0.1-s interscan delay. Individual spectra were summed for data processing. For ESI-MS, the accelerating voltage was maintained at 4 kV, which allowed magnet scanning above the mass range of m/z 5000. Hall probe calibration was used. The permethyl derivatives were dissolved in CH3OH, and 10-μl aliquots were injected through a Rheodyne loop into the mobile phase (methanol:water:acetic acid, 50:50:1, v/v/v), delivered at a flow rate of 5 μl/min into the ESI source by a syringe pump. For gas chromatography (GC)-electron impact (EI)-MS linkage analysis, partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from the permethyl derivatives by hydrolysis (2m trifluoroacetic acid, 121 °C, 2 h), reduction (10 mg/ml NaBH4, 25 °C, 2 h), and acetylation (acetic anhydride, 100 °C, 1 h). GC-EI-MS was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph 6890 connected to a Hewlett-Packard Mass Selective Detector 5973. Sample was dissolved in hexane prior to splitless injection into a HP-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, Hewlett-Packard). The column head pressure was maintained at around 8.2 p.s.i. to give a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min using helium as carrier gas. Initial oven temperature was held at 60 °C for 1 min, increased to 90 °C in 1 min, and then to 290 °C in 25 min. PA-oligosaccharides were first digested with 50 milliunits of sialidase (from A. ureafaciens, Roche) in 25 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, samples were redissolved in 25 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, and 5 μl of β-galactosidase (20 milliunits, from bovine testes; Roche) was added. After 24 h at 37 °C, 500 milliunits of N-acetyl-β-d-hexosaminidase (from jack bean, Calbiochem) in 20 μl of the same buffer, pH 5, was added and the incubation was left for another 24 h. The digestion products were desalted by passing through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters), washed with water, and the PA-oligosaccharides were then eluted with 50% methanol in water. The SDS-PAGE profile of PEW revealed four major bands, and overall was considerably different from the profile of chicken egg white (Fig.1 A). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of PEW proteins separated by SDS-PAGE indicated that the highest (APQKASVRWXTISSAEEKKXNNLRE) and the lowest (VEVDXSRYHXTTNVEGREGL) molecular size proteins of these four were homologous to chicken ovotransferrin (COT) and ovomucoid (COM), respectively. The N termini of the middle two proteins were fractal to sequencing by Edman degradation. This may be attributable to N-terminal blockage as in the case of chicken ovalbumin (COA), which is acetylated at the N terminus. Internal peptide sequences of the higher (MERKRVKVYLPRM and MPFRVTEQESKPVQM) and lower (MLYLGARGNTKAQIDKVVHFD and MGLGITDLFSSXADLSGISSV) molecular size proteins indicated high homologies to those of COA. Accordingly, these four major proteins were designated POT, POA(hi), POA(lo), and POM, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 A. POM, like its chicken counterpart, appeared as broad bands, apparently caused by glycan heterogeneity (Fig. 1 A). A gross size heterogeneity has been reported in ovomucoids from chicken (41Beeley J.G. Biochem. J. 1971; 123: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), quail (32Hase S. Okawa K. Ikenaka T.

The bands of PEW proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto PVDF membrane and stained with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated GS-I lectin, which binds terminal α-Gal residues specifically. All four major glycoproteins were stained with GS-I lectin, as shown in Fig.1 B. POM showed especially intense bands by GS-I, whereas it showed only weak bands by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). None of the glycoproteins from chicken egg white were stained with GS-I lectin (data not shown). These pigeon glycoproteins were also stained positively with anti-P1 mAb, specific for P1 blood type (Fig.1 B). Mouse laminin, which contains Galα1–3Gal (42Arumugham R.G. Hsieh T.C. Tanz"

Recently, the nature of the photoreceptors in fungi and plants has been investigated. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the photoreceptors (4Whitelam G.C. Devlin P.F. Plant Physiol.

Leymarie J. Olney M.A. Liscum E. Christie J.M. Vavasseur A. Briggs W.R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa shows several biological responses to blue light, such as a mobilization of ions in the mycelia within minutes after illumination (11Potapova T.V. Levina N.N.

Plant Physiol. 1967; 42: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N. crassamutants white collar-1 (wc-1)1 and white collar-2 (wc-2) lack all of these blue light responses (19Perkins D.D. Radford A. Newmeyer D. Bjorkman M. Microbiol. Rev. 1982; 46: 426-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Nelson M.A. Morelli G. Carattoli A. Romano N. Macino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Isolation and characterization of wc-1 andwc-2 genes revealed that both of them have a zinc finger DNA-binding motif, a PAS PERIOD, ARNT, and SIM dimerization domain, and a glutamine-rich transcriptional activation domain (21Ballario P. Vittorioso P. Margrelli A. Talora C. Cabibbo A. Macino G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1650-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 22Linden H. Macino G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). WC proteins are proposed to form heterodimers through their PAS domain (23Ballario P. Talora C. Galli D. Linden H. Macino G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, WC-1 has the LOV (light, oxygen, or voltage) domain found in blue light receptor phototropin (7Briggs W.R. Huala E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 33-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These results suggest that WC proteins perceive blue light and regulate the transcription of the blue light-responsive genes. However, it is difficult to explain ion mobilization by WC proteins (12Belozerskaya T.A. Potapova T.V. Exp. Mycol. 1993; 17: 157-169Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of WC-1 is increased after blue light irradiation (24Talora C. Franchi L. Linden H. Ballario P. Macino G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which appears to be an important part of this pathway. However, except for protein kinase C, no candidate for a protein kinase mediating theNeurospora blue light signaling has been suggested (25Arpaia G. Cerri F. Baima S. Macino G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We developed a system to analyze the light-responsive phosphorylation of proteins in vitro utilizing the mycelial membrane fraction. The phosphorylation of a 15-kDa protein increased specifically after blue light irradiation in the wild type, but not in either wc-1 or wc-2. However, mixing the membrane fractions from wc-1 and wc-2 restored the increase in the phosphorylation. These results suggested that the 15-kDa protein was involved in blue light signal transduction downstream of WC proteins (26Oda K. Hasunuma K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This protein was purified and identified as nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) (27Ogura Y. Yoshida Y. Ichimura K. Aoyagi C. Yabe N. Hasunuma K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The characteristics of an N. crassa mutant known aspsp suggested that it is a mutant allele ofndk-1. Phosphorylation of NDK-1 is undetectable inpsp (see Fig. 1 A), and the psp mutant is known to be defective in light-responsive regulation of perithecial polarity (17Oda K. Hasunuma K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of NDK-1 is critical for the photoresponse. NDK is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group of nucleoside 5′-triphosphate to nucleoside 5′-diphosphate to form nucleoside 5′-triphosphate (28Parks, R. E., Jr., Agarwal, R. P., The Enzymes, Boyer, P. D., 1973, 307, 333, Academic Press, NY.Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that NDK is involved in various signal transduction pathways such as suppression of tumor metastasis (29Steeg, P. S., Bevilacqua, G., Pozzatti, R., Liotta, L. A., Sobel, M. E., Cancer Res., 48, 1988, 6550, 6554.Google Scholar), modulation of muscarinic K+ channels (30Otero A.S. Doyle M.B. Hartsough M.T. Steeg P.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27859-27864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In plants, the phosphorylation of NDK in pea, PNDK1, was stimulated by red light, and the stimulation was reversed by subsequent irradiation with far-red light (34Tanaka N. Ogura T. Noguchi T. Hirano H. Yabe N. Hasunuma K. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 45: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PNDK1 also showed protein-phosphorylation activity (35Ogura T. Tanaka N. Yabe N. Komatsu S. Hasunuma K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 69: 397-403Crossref Google Scholar). InA. thaliana, NDPK2 is hypothesized to be a photo-signaling component because of the partial defect in photo-dependent cotyledon opening and greening in the T-DNA insertional disruptant of NDPK2 (36Choi G.

Several roles for NDK in signal transduction have been proposed: transcriptional activation (31Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A.

Ichimura K. Aoyagi C. Yabe N. Hasunuma K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on its protein-phosphorylation activity, NDK-1 may be involved in phosphorelay signaling. In the present study, we have investigated the roles of NDK-1 in the light signal transduction pathway through the γ-phosphotransferring activity from nucleoside 5′-triphosphate to nucleoside 5′-diphosphate and the phosphotransfer activity to other proteins. The N. crassa wild type strains 74OR23–1A (FGSC987) and 74OR8–1a (FGSC988) were obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (Kansas City, KS). The mutants psp A andpsp a (renamed ndk-1P72H in this paper) were isolated previously (17Oda K. Hasunuma K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Culture was carried out in Vogel's minimal medium with 2‥ sucrose at 25 °C. Protoperithecia of 74OR8–1a, ndk-1P72H a, and the transformants were developed in darkness at 25 °C on synthetic crossing medium for 5 days and fertilized with the 74OR23–1A conidia. After 3 days in darkness, they were placed in a box with a slit 4-cm wide and illuminated from the side under a 12-h light/12-h dark regime for 2 weeks. Perithecia were observed and photographed through dissecting microscopy. N. crassa wild type 74OR23–1A and ndk-1P72H were grown for 2 days. The mycelia were harvested by filtration and powdered with a pestle and mortar in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared by the small scale method of RNA extraction (41Sokolovsky V. Kaldenhoff R. Ricci M. Russo V.E.A. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1990; 37: 41-43Google Scholar). 5 μg of total RNA was separated by glyoxal gel electrophoresis and transferred to a piece of Gene Screen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Science). Hybridization with 32P-labeled ndk-1 probe was carried out overnight at 42 °C in hybridization buffer containing 50‥ formamide, 10‥ dextran sulfate, 1‥ SDS, and 1 mNaCl. Radioisotopic signals were visualized by autoradiography using X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Mycelia grown for 36 h in 1 ml of Vogel's minimal medium were dried on filter paper and ground by KONTES pellet pestle in microcentrifuge tubes containing 120 μl of protein extraction buffer (25 mm Na-Pipes, pH 6.3, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.01 mmleupeptine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Crude extract was obtained as supernatant after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. An appropriate amount of the crude extract containing 300 μg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide (12.5‥) gel electrophoresis and electrically transferred onto a piece of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-NDK-1 antiserum raised in rabbit using purified NDK-1. Antibodies were detected with a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). For the protein phosphorylation experiment, the crude extract was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 15 s at 4 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Na-Pipes, pH 6.3, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1‥ Triton X-100 before SDS-PAGE (17Oda K. Hasunuma K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The sequences of oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers, designed from the DNA sequence of the untranslated regions of the 5′ and 3′ termini of the ndk-1 transcript, were as follows: Ndk-1F, 5′-AACCTATACTCCCTCACC-3′; and Ndk-1R, 5′-CGGAACAGACATGATACC-3′. Total RNA prepared from wild type 74OR23–1A, as well aspsp (ndk-1P72H) A anda, was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 1 μg of total RNA and 50 pmol of Ndk-1R primer were denatured in a 10-μl reaction buffer (75 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 3 mmMgCl2) for 2 min at 95 °C. They were annealed for 1 h at 55 °C. The RNA solution was mixed with a 4-ml reaction mixture (10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm each of dNTP, 28 units of RNase inhibitor, and 100 units of MoMuLV reverse transcriptase) and incubated for 1 h at 55 °C to extend single-stranded cDNA. Double-stranded cDNA of ndk-1was specifically amplified by PCR with 0.1 μm each of Ndk-1F and Ndk-1R primers using a 1-μl RT reaction mixture in a 10-μl working solution (50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each of dNTP and 0.2 units of Taq polymerase). PCR was performed at 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min) for 30 cycles with a final 7 min of extension at 72 °C. Amplified products were subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescriptIISK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. An N. crassa ndk-1P72H a strain was transformed with a plasmid containing ndk-1 genomic DNA (pBARNDK-1) or a plasmid for ectopic expression of ndk-1 cDNA (pTBNDK-1) according to Vollmer and Yanofsky (42Vollmer S.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4869-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBARNDK-1 was constructed by insertion of a 4.3-kilobase pair genomic DNA fragment containing ndk-1 into pBARKS1, which carried the glufosinate (BASTA; Hoechst) resistance gene (bar) as a selection marker (43Pall M.L. Brunelli J.P. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1993; 40: 59-62Google Scholar). For ectopic expression of cDNA in N. crassa, we constructed a plasmid pTREB, which carriedbar for selection and the promoter and terminator regions ofAspergillus nidulans trpC for ectopic expression (44Mullaney E.J. Hamer J.E. Roberti K.A. Yelton M.M. Timberlake W.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 199: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This plasmid has a multicloning site between the trpC promoter and terminator for SmaI, EcoRI, EcoRV, and ClaI. The ndk-1 fragment digested withEcoRI and ClaI, ∼600 bp, was ligated into pTREB to construct pTBNDK-1. The transformants were selected on sorbose-BASTA medium (Vogel's salt mixture without NH4NO3, 0.5‥ proline, 2‥ sucrose, 2‥ sorbose, 1.5‥ agar, 0.005‥ BASTA (for basal medium) and 1 m sorbitol (for top medium)). Two oligo-DNA primers, ESTndk1–5t (5′-AGGATCCAACCAAGGAGCA-3′), which was designed to have a BamHI site at the 5′ terminus and to delete the start codon (ATG) and Ndk-1ER (5′-GCGAAGCTTACTCGAAG-3′), were used for PCR amplification of ndk-1 andndk-1P72H. PCR products were subcloned into theEcoRV site of pBluescriptIISK+. ndk-1and ndk-1P72HcDNA were cut out byBamHI and SmaI double digestion and were ligated into pEST-1 (Stratagene), which contained a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) gene in the 5′-region of a multicloning site (pESTNDK-1 and pESTP72H). S. pombe SP-Q01 (Stratagene) was transformed with pESTNDK-1 or pESTP72H. Transformants were cultured in Edinburgh minimal medium (45Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) for 48 h at 30 °C. Cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl). An equal volume of glass beads was added, and the cells were crashed by 20 cycles of a set of 1 min of vortexing and 1 min of chilling on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with GST-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stood for 30 min at room temperature. The resin was washed 10 times with PBS. GST fusion protein was eluted with an equal volume of elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.6, and 10 mm reduced glutathione. The protein concentration was calculated from the strength of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining after electrophoresis by the NIH image program. The kinetic constants for NDK activity were determined by a coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase assay essentially according to Agarwal et al.(46Agarwal R.P. Robinson B.R.E. Parks J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) at 25 °C. In this assay, 10 ng of purified recombinant protein was used. The concentrations of dTDP used were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mm. The kinetic constants were calculated from the double reciprocal plots. The activity of GST-NDK-1 and GST-NDK-1P72H to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP; lot number HDIBO1; Life Technologies, Inc.) was analyzed essentially according to a previous study (27Ogura Y. Yoshida Y. Ichimura K. Aoyagi C. Yabe N. Hasunuma K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mixture, containing 10 ng of GST-NDK-1 or GST-NDK-1P72H, MBP (1.35, 2.7, 5.4, 8.1, or 10.8 μm), 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2, was incubated for 1 min at 25 °C after addition of 0.2 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP (110 MBq/pmol) at a final concentration of 0.04 mm. After the electrophoresis, a part of the gel containing MBP was cut out. The radioisotopic activity of this piece of gel was measured by the Cerenkov ray method with a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka). The autophosphorylation activity of GST-NDK-1 or GST-NDK-1P72H was assayed by use of 10 ng of the protein in the above reaction mixture. The reaction (20 μl) was started by adding 0.1 nm [γ-32P]ATP on ice, and after 10 s the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. The following procedure was the same as described above. No phosphorylation of NDK-1 was detected in the crude extracts from the mutant psp (ndk-1P72H) (see Fig.1 A and Ref. 17Oda K. Hasunuma K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the sequence of ndk-1 was changed to reduce the accumulation of transcript or to reduce the protein activity. We first examined the levels of ndk-1 mRNA and NDK-1 protein in psp (ndk-1P72H). Northern blot analysis showed no significant difference in the accumulation ofndk-1 mRNA between psp(ndk-1P72H) and wild type (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, Western blot analysis using anti-NDK-1 antiserum indicated that about 25‥ of NDK-1 protein was accumulated in psp(ndk-1P72H) compared with that in wild type (Fig. 1 C) from three independent experiments. The amounts of NDK-1 proteins from wild type and mutant were estimated by the densitometric assay of the Western blot. From these results, we speculated that an amino acid substitution in NDK-1 itself affected its stability or activity. To examine this hypothesis, the nucleotide sequence of ndk-1 cDNA, which was amplified frompsp (ndk-1P72H) by RT-PCR, was determined. Nucleotide sequences in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of ndk-1 cDNA were used as primers for RT-PCR. A fragment whose length corresponded to the predicted ndk-1cDNA, ∼580 bp, was amplified (Fig. 1 D). Ten clones were isolated from each strain, wild type and psp(ndk-1P72H) A and a. In the psp (ndk-1P72H), there were three nucleotide replacements in ndk-1. The first was in the 3′-untranslated region, the second was silent, and the third was a replacement of cytosine with adenosine, causing the replacement of proline 72 with histidine, whereas the sequence of cDNA from wild type was identical to that of ndk-1. A 360-bp fragment was also amplified by RT-PCR (Fig.1 D). The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was identical to that of ndk-1 except that the fragment lacked 219 nucleotides, from the 28th to 246th base from the putative translation start site (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of this fragment was identical to that of ndk-1 except that it lacked 73 amino acids in the N-terminal region. This transcript was designated as Tnk-1 (Truncatedn dk-1). The fact that Tnk-1 of the psp (ndk-1P72H) mutant contains two nucleotide replacements (data not shown) suggested that Tnk-1 was the alternative transcript of ndk-1. The physiological role of this transcript, however, remains unclear, because the amount ofTnk-1 transcript was quite low compared with that ofndk-1 (Fig. 1 D), and no translation product was detectable by Western blot analysis. To examine whether the point mutation inndk-1 (ndk-1cDNA was fused with the promotor oftrpC) caused the phenotype of psp(ndk-1P72H), a genomic DNA fragment containing wild type ndk-1 or thetrpC-promoter::ndk-1 chimeric gene for cDNA ectopic expression was introduced into psp(ndk-1P72H). Homokaryotic transformants were isolated by more than seven rounds of colony selection on a medium containing BASTA. The integration of fragments into the transformants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Two independent lines containing the extra genomic DNA fragment ofndk-1 (PGN-1 and 2) and three independent lines containing the trpC::ndk-1 chimeric construct (PCN-1, 2, and 3) were isolated. The abundance of NDK-1 in the transformants was examined by Western blot analysis. The transformants were able to accumulate as much NDK-1 as the wild type did (Fig. 2 A). Phosphorylation of NDK-1 was also examined. The ability to phosphorylate NDK-1 itself was recovered in all of the transformants (Fig. 2 B). In PGN-2, more NDK-1 was recovered than in psp(ndk-1P72H) but less than in other transformants and the wild type (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). These results and the results in Fig. 1, A and C, showed that the point mutation in ndk-1 caused less NDK-1 accumulation of about 25‥ and almost no activity of NDK-1 phosphorylation in psp (ndk-1P72H) compared with those in wild type (Fig. 2, lane 2). The perithecial polarities of the ndk-1 transformants were observed. The probabilities that the beaks would form at the top or at some other position on the perithecia are shown in Fig.3. In darkness, the positioning of the perithecial beak was nondirectional when any of the strains were used as a protoperithecial parent. When white light was illuminated from one direction parallel to the surface of the solid medium, the beaks were formed preferentially at the top of the perithecia in the wild type. Inpsp (ndk-1P72H), the positioning of the beaks was nondirectional even when white light was illuminated from one direction, as in darkness. In psp(ndk-1P72H) transformants carrying wild typendk-1, beaks formed at the top of the perithecia under unidirectional light. Fig. 4 shows typical perithecia of wild type, psp(ndk-1P72H), and PGN-2 strains grown in darkness or under unidirectional light. These results indicate that the phenotype of the psp mutant is caused by thendk-1P72H mutation and that NDK-1 plays a role in the light-responsive regulation of perithecial polarity. Here thepsp mutation was determined to bendk-1P72H.Figure 4Perithecial polarity of wild type,ndk-1 P72H , and the ndk-1transformants. White light was provided parallel to the surface of the solid medium (from left in the photographs). Perithecia were observed and photographed through a dissecting microscope. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic constants for NDK activity and protein-phosphorylation activity of NDK-1 or NDK-1P72H were determined using purified recombinant proteins. HisNDK-1 and HisNDK-1P72H showed comparable γ-phosphotransferring activity for CDP, GDP, UDP, dCDP, dGDP, and dTDP in the thin-layer chromatography assay (data not shown). Therefore dTDP was used as a typical phosphate acceptor of γ-phosphotransferring activity to determine the kinetic constants for the production of dTTP. As shown in TableI, neither the Michaelis constant (K m ) that referred to dTDP as a substrate norV max differed significantly between HisNDK-1 and HisNDK-1P72H; the K m andV max values were 0.28 ± 0.04 mm (dTDP) and 0.10 ± 0.09 nmol dTTP/min/mg of protein with HisNDK-1 and 0.29 ± 0.12 mm (dTDP) and 0.12 ± 0.10 nmol dTTP/min/mg of protein with HisNDK-1P72H, respectively. Similar results were also obtained by use of GST-NDK-1 and GST-NDK-1P72H. These findings indicated that the nucleotide-phosphorylation activity of NDK-1 was not affected by the P72H substitution. In contrast, the autophosphorylation and protein kinase activities of HisNDK-1P72H were greatly reduced compared with those of HisNDK-1 (data not shown). However, it is difficult to examine this in detail, because the electrophoretic mobility of HisNDK-1 (18 kDa) and MBP (18.5 kDa) is very similar. For this reason, we constructed GST-NDK-1 (NDK-1P72H) fusion protein (44 kDa), whose electrophoretic mobility is quite different from that of MBP.Table IK m and V max values of fusion proteins of NDK-1 and NDK-1P72H for γ-phosphotransferring activity for dTDPFusion proteinK mV maxmmnmol/min/mg proteinHisNDK-10.28 ± 0.040.10 ± 0.09HisNDK-1P72H0.29 ± 0.120.12 ± 0.10GST-NDK-10.31 ± 0.020.23 ± 0.04GST-NDK-1P72H0.45 ± 0.060.36 ± 0.02The values were averages of three independent experiments with standard errors.

V max is the maximum velocity of the enzyme at 25°C. Autophosphorylation of GST fusion proteins was examined by autoradiography (Fig. 5 A). Although equal amounts of proteins were used (determined by Western blotting), there was about 5‥ of 32P-phosphorylated GST-NDK-1P72H compared with that in GST-NDK-1. This indicates that the ability of NDK-1P72H to phosphorylate itself was greatly reduced. Next, the activity to phosphorylate MBP was examined. GST fusion proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and various concentrations of MBP (1.35, 2.7, 5.4, 8.1, or 10.8 μm) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography shows that less [32P]phospho-MBP is produced when incubated with GST-NDK-1P72H (Fig.5 B). The kinetic constants were determined by the double-reciprocal plot of the concentration of MBP and the radioisotopic activity of [32P]phospho-MBP (TableII). K m andV max values were 7.3 ± 2.6 μm (MBP) and 0.48 ± 0.18 nmol/min/mg of protein ([32P]phospho-MBP) with GST-NDK-1 and 4.9 ± 0.1 μm (MBP) and 0.01 ± 0.00 nmol/min/mg of protein ([32P]phospho-MBP) with GST-NDK-1P72H, respectively. The V max value with GST-NDK-1P72H was about 2‥ of that with GST-NDK-1. These results revealed that the P72H mutation affected the activities of NDK-1 to phosphorylate both itself and MBP.Table IIK m and V max values of fusion proteins of NDK-1 and NDK-1P72H for phosphotransfer activity for MBPGST fusion proteinK mV maxμmnmol/min/mg proteinGST-NDK-17.3 ± 2.60.48 ± 0.18GST-NDK-1P72H4.9 ± 0.10.01 ± 0.00The values were averages of three independent experiments with standard errors. Open table in a new tab The values were averages of three independent experiments with standard errors. We report here that the P72H substitution in NDK-1 causes partial reduction in accumulation of NDK-1 and significant loss of the activity to phosphorylate itself and MBP. This proline residue is highly conserved among the NDK genes reported to date (27Ogura Y. Yoshida Y. Ichimura K. Aoyagi C. Yabe N. Hasunuma K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and is thought to be located between the α2-helix and the β3-sheet from x-ray structural analyses of NDK in Dictyostelium discoideum(47Dumas C. Lascu I. Moréra S. Glaser P. Fourme R. Wallet V. Lacombe M.-L. Véron M. Janin J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3203-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 48Moréra S. LeBras G. Lascu I. Lacombe M.L. Véron M. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 873-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These effects result in light insensitivity for perithecial polarity. In transformants of either construct containing wild typendk-1 genomic DNA or cDNA, NDK-1 was adequately accumulated and phosphorylated as in the wild type, although in the PGN-2 strain, NDK-1 was accumulated less than in the wild type or other transformants (Fig. 2). However, the amount of NDK-1 in PGN-2 was sufficient, because there was no significant difference in the phosphorylation of NDK-1 compared with the wild type and other transformants (Fig. 2). This difference may be caused by the position of the integrated transgene in the N. crassa chromosome. The recovery of NDK-1 accumulation and phosphorylation in the transformants, even in PGN-2, results in the normal light response of perithecial polarity that is defective in psp(ndk-1P72H). This shows that the pspmutation was an allele of the ndk-1 locus and indicated that NDK-1 played a role in the regulation of perithecial polarity in response to light. WC-1 and WC-2 are the key components in the blue light signaling pathway in N. crassa (21Ballario P. Vittorioso P. Margrelli A. Talora C. Cabibbo A. Macino G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1650-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 22Linden H. Macino G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). They are putative transcription factors and form a heterocomplex that was suggested to function as a signal transducer (23Ballario P. Talora C. Galli D. Linden H. Macino G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The WC complex is also proposed to be a photoreceptor based on its sequence similarity in the LOV domain with Arabidopsis blue light receptor phototropin (NPH1) (7Briggs W.R. Huala E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 33-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). WC-1 is phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation increases in response to light treatment (24Talora C. Franchi L. Linden H. Ballario P. Macino G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This fact suggests the involvement of a protein phosphorylation in the blue light signaling pathway. However, the protein kinases that mediate the light signaling have not been identified in N. crassa, though protein kinase C is suspected to play a role (25Arpaia G. Cerri F. Baima S. Macino G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because the increase in the level of NDK-1 phosphorylation after blue light irradiation is very rapid, but not detected in wc mutants, the protein-phosphorylation activity of NDK-1 would contribute to the early steps of the light signaling downstream of WC proteins. Light response of perithecial polarity was also defective in wc-1 and wc-2, whereas other light-insensitive phenotypes observed in wcmutants, such as phototropism of perithecial beak, were not observed inndk-1P72H. This fact suggests that various light-response phenomena were regulated by different pathways downstream of WC proteins and that NDK-1 was involved in one such pathway regulating perithecial polarity. There was no significant difference in the level of ndk-1mRNA accumulation between wild type andndk-1P72H mutant, but Western analysis revealed that about 25‥ of NDK-1P72H protein was accumulated in the crude extract when compared with that of wild type. This result suggests that some post-translational regulation could play an essential role for NDK-1 accumulation. In a fish hepatocyte cell line, PLHC-1, NDK was co-purified with molecular chaperone HSC70 as an accessory protein (39Leung S.-M. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2607-2614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It could be possible that the region around the proline 72 was responsible for the contact with proteins such as molecular chaperons regulating the stability or folding of NDK-1. We are now underway on isolating proteins interacting with NDK-1 by affinity purification and by two-hybrid screening. The reduction in V max for the phosphorylation of MBP by GST-NDK-1P72H shows that the P72H substitution affects not only autophosphorylation but also protein kinase activities of NDK-1. This result indicates that autophosphorylation and protein kinase activities occur via different mechanisms from that of nucleotide-phosphorylating activity of NDK-1. Therefore, the region around the proline 72 is proposed to contribute to the proper access to the substrate protein. Thus, the total decrease in the NDK-1 protein kinase activity, caused synergistically by less protein accumulation (25‥) and less V max (2‥) in the activity, could lead Neurospora to the loss of response to light. We speculated that NDK-1 plays a crucial role in an unidentified pathway including autophosphorylation and protein kinase activities that regulate perithecial polarity in response to light. The biochemical activity of NDK-1P72H was reduced in terms of autophosphorylation and protein kinase activities but not nucleotide-phosphorylation activity. Therefore, the putative role of NDK-1 in signal transduction providing GTP to G-protein,e.g. regulating G-protein-coupled ion channels (30Otero A.S. Doyle M.B. Hartsough M.T. Steeg P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1449: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), may not be affected by the mutation,ndk-1P72H. However, we could consider that before providing GTP to G-protein, NDK-1 might also elicit signal through the autophosphorylation and protein kinase activities, indicating that there may be a hitherto unknown signal transduction pathway regulated by these two activities of NDK-1. Further understanding of the role of NDK-1 in the signaling pathway may require investigation of the proteins that interact with NDK-1, such as a protein recognizing the phosphorylated NDK-1 and a protein phosphorylated by NDK-1.

https://openalex.org/W2003576920,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump whose overexpression confers multidrug resistance to cancer cells. Pgp exhibits a robust drug substrate-stimulable ATPase activity, and vanadate (Vi) blocks this activity effectively by trapping Pgp nucleotide in a non-covalent stable transition state conformation. In this study we compare Vi-induced [α-32P]8-azido-ADP trapping into Pgp in the presence of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (with ATP hydrolysis) or [α-32P]8-azido-ADP (without ATP hydrolysis). Vi mimics Pi to trap the nucleotide tenaciously in the Pgp·[α-32P]8-azido-ADP·Vi conformation in either condition. Thus, by using [α-32P]8-azido-ADP we show that the Vi-induced transition state of Pgp can be generated even in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, half-maximal trapping of nucleotide into Pgp in the presence of Vi occurs at similar concentrations of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP or [α-32P]8-azido-ADP. The trapped [α-32P]8-azido-ADP is almost equally distributed between the N- and the C-terminal ATP sites of Pgp in both conditions. Additionally, point mutations in the Walker B domain of either the N- (D555N) or C (D1200N)-terminal ATP sites that arrest ATP hydrolysis and Vi-induced trapping also show abrogation of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP trapping into Pgp in the absence of hydrolysis. These data suggest that both ATP sites are dependent on each other for function and that each site exhibits similar affinity for 8-azido-ATP (ATP) or 8-azido-ADP (ADP). Similarly, Pgp in the transition state conformation generated with either ADP or ATP exhibits drastically reduced affinity for the binding of analogues of drug substrate ([125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin) as well as nucleotide (2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate). Analyses of Arrhenius plots show that trapping of Pgp with [α-32P]8-azido-ADP (in the absence of hydrolysis) displays an ∼2.5-fold higher energy of activation (152 kJ/mol) compared with that observed when the transition state intermediate is generated through hydrolysis of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (62 kJ/mol). In aggregate, these results demonstrate that the Pgp·[α-32P]8-azido-ADP (or ADP)·Vi transition state complexes generated either in the absence of or accompanying [α-32P]8-azido-ATP hydrolysis are functionally indistinguishable.

Vi inhibits Pgp ATPase activity by trapping nucleotide in the catalytic site to generate the transition state conformation, Pgp·ADP·Vi. It has been established that it is always a nucleoside diphosphate that is the trapped species (3Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 13Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6847-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus if ATP (or 8-azido-ATP) is used to initiate the reaction, at least one turnover of ATP hydrolysis, converting ATP to ADP, is essential for trapping to occur. This has allowed Vi-trapping experiments to be used to construct a catalytic scheme for ATP hydrolysis by Pgp. Our recent work (10Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) has considerably expanded the original model for the catalytic scheme of Pgp proposed by Senior and co-workers (14Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that ATP hydrolysis at one of the two ATP sites results in a dramatic conformational change where the affinities of both the substrate and the nucleotide for Pgp are drastically reduced. The fact that ATP binding to the second site is arrested while the first one is in a catalytic conformation appears to be the basis for alternate catalysis in Pgp (12Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, for Pgp to regain the conformation that binds substrate with high affinity, the hydrolysis of an additional molecule of nucleotide is obligatory. Finally, we showed that release of ADP from the Pgp·ADP·Pi transition state is the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Much of the work described above has benefited from the availability of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP allowing direct visualization and quantification of the nucleotide interaction with Pgp. However, as only the photoaffinity analogue of nucleoside triphosphate was available as a radioisotope, this has precluded directly addressing many questions that require the32P-labeled azido derivative of nucleoside diphosphate. In this study, we have characterized for the first time the binding and Vi-induced trapping of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP to Pgp. We demonstrate that [α-32P]8-azido-ADP binds specifically to Pgp with a K d comparable to that for [α-32P]8-azido-ATP. The kinetic scheme for the Vi-induced inhibition of Pgp ATP hydrolysis proposed by Senior's group (14Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 15Senior A.E. Bhagat S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggests that incorporation of ADP into the Pgp·ADP·Vi ternary complex may occur either following hydrolysis of ATP to ADP or directly by the addition of ADP in the absence of hydrolysis. We demonstrate in this study that it is possible to initiate Vi-induced trapping with either [α-32P]8-azido-ADP or [α-32P]8-azido-ATP, with similar kinetics, and that the trapped [α-32P]8-azido-ADP distributed equally between the N- and the C-terminal halves of Pgp under both hydrolysis and non-hydrolysis conditions. Vi-induced trapping under both hydrolysis and non-hydrolysis conditions exhibited the same requirement for divalent cations. Previous work has demonstrated that a point mutation in the Walker B region (D555N and D1200N, respectively) of either the N- or C-terminal ATP sites arrests ATP hydrolysis and Vi-induced trapping (6Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Germann U.A. Cheng P.W. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We find that these mutants also do not show Vi-induced [α-32P]8-azido-ADP trapping into Pgp in the absence of hydrolysis, suggesting that the functional interaction of both ATP sites is necessary for the formation of the transition state intermediate. Our previous work demonstrated a direct interaction between the substrate and ATP sites by showing that the Vi-trapped intermediate exhibits drastically reduced affinity for the Pgp substrate analogue, [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin (IAAP) (5Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 8Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M.

A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We show here that the Vi-trapped intermediate generated with 8-azido-ADP, 8-azido-ATP, ADP, and ATP results in drastically reduced binding of IAAP to Pgp. Most interesting, however, analyses of the Arrhenius plots at steady state demonstrate that the activation energy for generating the Pgp·[α-32P]8-azido-ADP·Vi transition state complex starting with [α-32P]8-azido-ADP is ∼2.5 times greater than if [α-32P]8-azido-ATP were used, and it is 1.5 times greater than that required for the basal or verapamil-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP or 8-azido-ATP. These data indicate that the Vi-trapped intermediate generated under hydrolysis or non-hydrolysis conditions do not show functional differences, and we suggest that the use of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP should prove useful to compare the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis by different ABC transporters. [125I]IAAP, 2,200 Ci/mmol, was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [α-32P]8-Azido-ATP (15–20 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]8-azido-ADP (15–20 Ci/mmol), 8-azido-ATP, and 8-azido-ADP were purchased from Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc. Pgp-specific monoclonal antibody C219 was a generous gift from Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. (Malvern, PA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. High Five insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus carrying the humanMDR1 cDNA with a His6 tag at the C-terminal end (BV-MDR1 (His6)) as described (5Ramachandra M.

Crude membranes were prepared as described previously (5Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I.

A 70–80‥ confluent monolayer of HeLa cells was infected with vTF7-3 and transfected with pTM1-MDR1 (wild type) or pTM1-MDR1 bearing the homologous mutations at positions 555 (D555N) and 1200 (D1200N) as described previously (9Hrycyna C.A.

The vaccinia virus expression vectors pTM1-MDR1 (wild type) and pTM1-MDR1(D555N) and pTM1-MDR1(D1200N) were provided by C. A. Hrycyna and M. M. Gottesman, Laboratory of Cell Biology, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. Crude membranes were prepared from the HeLa cells as described previously (17Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 456-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human Pgp from crude membranes of High Five insect cells was purified as described (5Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The crude membranes were solubilized with octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (1.25‥) in the presence of 20‥ glycerol and a lipid mixture (0.1‥). Solubilized proteins were subjected to metal affinity chromatography (Talon resin,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in the presence of 0.95‥ octyl β-d-glucopyranoside and 0.04‥ lipid; 80‥ purified Pgp was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. Pgp in the 100 mm imidazole fraction was then concentrated (Centriprep-50, Amicon, Beverly, MA) to ∼0.5 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C. Pgp was identified by immunoblot analysis using the monoclonal antibody C219 (5Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and quantified by Amido Black protein estimation method as described previously (18Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Purified Pgp was reconstituted into proteoliposomes by dialysis as described (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The crude membranes (10–50 μg) were incubated at room temperature in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, with IAAP (3–6 nm) for 5 min under subdued light. The samples were then illuminated with a UV lamp assembly (PGC Scientifics, Gaithersburg, MD) fitted with two Black light (self-filtering) UV-A long wave F15T8BLB tubes (365 nm) for 10 min at room temperature (21–23 °C). Following SDS-PAGE on a 8‥ Tris glycine gel at constant voltage, gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C for 12–24 h. The radioactivity incorporated into the Pgp band was quantified using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and the software ImageQuaNT. Crude membranes (1–2 mg/ml) were incubated in the ATPase assay buffer (40 mmMES-Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 10 μm[α-32P]8-azido-ATP or [α-32P]8-azido-ADP (8–10 μCi/nmol) in the dark on ice for 5 min. The samples were then cross-linked by UV illumination at 365 nm on ice as described above. Ice-cold ATP (12.5 mm) was added to displace excess non-covalently bound radionucleotide. Excess unbound nucleotides were removed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min by using a S120-AT2 rotor in a RC-M120EX micro-ultracentrifuge (Sorvall, Newtown, CT), and the pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on a 8‥ Tris glycine gel at constant voltage, gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max MR film at −70 °C for 12–24 h. The radioactivity incorporated into the Pgp band was quantified as described above. The Pgp·ADP·Vi or Pgp·8-azido-ADP·Vi transition state conformation was generated as described (10Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Crude membranes (1–2 mg/ml) were incubated in the ATPase assay buffer containing 50 μm [α-32P]8-azido-ATP or [α-32P]8-azido-ADP (2–4 μCi/nmol) and 250 μm Vi in the dark for 6–10 min as specified in the figure legends at 37 °C. In some experiments instead of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP or [α-32P]8-azido-ADP, 8-azido-ATP, 8-azido-ADP, ATP, or ADP were used at concentrations indicated in the legend to Fig. 7. The reaction was stopped by adding 12.5 mm ice-cold ATP and placing the sample immediately on ice. The samples were then cross-linked by UV illumination at 365 nm on ice for 10 min. ATPase activity of Pgp in crude membranes was measured by the end point, Pi assay as described previously (5Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Pgp-specific activity was recorded as the Vi-sensitive ATPase activity. The assay measured the amount of inorganic phosphate released over 20–30 min at different temperatures ranging from 22 to 39 °C in the ATPase assay buffer. The assay was carried out under basal conditions or in the presence of verapamil, 30 μm. The reaction was initiated with 5 mm ATP or 2 mm 8-azido-ATP and quenched with SDS (2.5‥ final concentration); the amount of Pi released was quantitated using a colorimetric method (5Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The assay with 8-azido-ATP was performed under subdued lighting. Binding of the fluorescent ATP analogue TNP-ATP was measured by determining the increase in fluorescence signal of TNP-ATP in the presence of purified Pgp incorporated into proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes (20–25 μg protein) were incubated with TNP-ATP, 100 μm, in ATPase assay buffer in a reaction volume of 200 μl for 10 min at room temperature (22–23 °C) under subdued light. The samples were then transferred to individual wells in a 96-well flat bottom, UV transparent, disposable microplate (Spectraplate, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and an emission scan (500–600 nm) was obtained using excitation at 408 nm on a Spectra MAX 250 Microplate Spectrofluorimeter (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The enhancement in fluorescence due to TNP-ATP binding was estimated by running emission scans of TNP-ATP in the assay buffer in the absence of Pgp. Additionally, to obtain signal specific to Pgp, an equivalent emission scan in the presence of 10 mm ATP (i.e. 100-fold excess) was generated and subtracted from the scan obtained in the absence of ATP. The radiolabeled, photoaffinity analogue of ATP, [α-32P]8-azido-ATP, has shown to be extremely useful in understanding the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis by Pgp (3Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B.

However, the unavailability of the radiolabeled nucleoside diphosphate, [α-32P]8-azido-ADP, until recently has precluded many direct experiments to address questions about the catalytic cycle of Pgp. In this study, we characterize the kinetics of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP binding to Pgp, and we demonstrate its usefulness as a reagent to study the mechanism of action of Pgp. Fig. 1 A shows that [α-32P]8-azido-ADP binds specifically to the ATP site of Pgp as the binding is completely competed by the nucleotides, ATP and ADP, as well as the nucleotide analogues, 8-azido-ATP and 8-azido-ADP. Additionally, Fig. 1 B demonstrates that the binding of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP is saturable with aK d of 10 ± 3 μm, which is very similar to the K d of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP binding to Pgp, which is in the range of 10–15 μm (12Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These results suggest that [α-32P]8-azido-ADP binds directly to Pgp in a manner similar to [α-32P]8-azido-ATP. It has been established that the ATPase activity of Pgp follows simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K m of ∼0.3 to 1 mm depending on the source of Pgp (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,23Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The technical difficulties that this low affinity for nucleotide entails have been enumerated in detail by Senior and colleagues (24Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the Vi-induced trapping of nucleotides into the ATP sites has proved to be an invaluable tool in elucidating the ATP hydrolysis cycle of Pgp. Vi is a potent inhibitor of the ATPase activity of Pgp, which acts by mimicking the pentacovalent phosphorus catalytic transition state, thereby trapping the nucleotide tenaciously. This transition state conformation of Pgp has been characterized in earlier studies (3Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), by incubation of Pgp with [α-32P]8-azido-ATP and Vi at 37 °C (i.e.allowing [α-32P]8-azido-ATP to be hydrolyzed to [α-32P]8-azido-ADP). Several lines of evidence have indicated that the trapped moiety is the nucleoside diphosphate (3Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 4Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6847-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Fig. 2 A (after Senioret al. (14Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar)) depicts the kinetic scheme for generating the Pgp·MgADP·Vi complex starting with Pgp, MgATP, and Vi. ATP binds to Pgp in the presence of Mg2+ (step 1). and this is followed by hydrolysis (step 2) during which ATP is converted to ADP and Pi. Subsequently Pi is released and ADP dissociates from Pgp. However, if Vi, an analogue of Pi is present, it “traps” the ADP to form a stable, ternary, non-covalent complex, Pgp·MgADP·Vi (step 3). This complex eventually dissociates to Pgp + MgADP + Vi (step 4). As step 4 is a reversible process, in principle if MgADP were directly provided to Pgp, it would be stabilized by Vi into the Pgp·MgADP·Vi transition state complex (step 4b inboxed figure). Fig. 2 B shows that if Pgp is incubated with 50 μm [α-32P]8-azido-ADP and 250 μm Vi for 10 min at 37 °C, the [α-32P]8-azido-ADP is occluded at the catalytic site (lane 3) and is not competed out by even 200-fold excess non-radioactive nucleotide (lane 4). This is in stark contrast to incubating Pgp in the presence of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP but in the absence of Vi, where there is significantly less incorporation of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP (lane 1) reflecting the binding of nucleotide to Pgp which is competed by excess ATP (lane 2). Note that for the panel showing incorporation of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP in the absence of Vi, the gel was exposed to the x-ray film for 4 times as much time as the panel showing incorporation of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP in the presence of Vi. The autoradiogram also demonstrates that while the [α-32P]8-azido-ADP incorporated in the absence of Vi can be competed out by excess ATP (lane 2), the [α-32P]8-azido-ADP incorporated in the presence of Vi is unaffected by excess ATP (lane 4). Thus, these experiments show that it is possible to trap directly [α-32P]8-azido-ADP into Pgp suggesting that hydrolysis is not a prerequisite for Vi-induced trapping per se but is obligatory when [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (or any other hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate) is used so as to generate the nucleoside diphosphate. To characterize further Pgp in the transition state conformation generated by using [α-32P]8-azido-ADP, we compared the distribution of the trapped [α-32P]8-azido-ADP in the N- and the C-terminal ATP sites of Pgp.

This resulted in the expression of the chimeric HIP1/PDGFβR protein, which oligomerizes, is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, and transforms the Ba/F3 murine hematopoietic cell line to interleukin-3-independent growth. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kDa protein (p130) correlates with transformation by HIP1/PDGFβR and related transforming mutants. We report here that the p130 band is immunologically related to the 125-kDa isoform of the Src homology 2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase, SHIP1. We have found that SHIP1 associates and colocalizes with the HIP1/PDGFβR fusion protein and related transforming mutants. These mutants include a mutant that has eight Src homology 2-binding phosphotyrosines mutated to phenylalanine. In contrast, SHIP1 does not associate with H/P(KI), the kinase-dead form of HIP1/PDGFβR. We also report that phosphorylation of SHIP1 by HIP1/PDGFβR does not change its 5-phosphatase-specific activity. This suggests that phosphorylation and possible PDGFβR-mediated sequestration of SHIP1 from its substrates (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) might alter the levels of these inositol-containing signal transduction molecules, resulting in activation of downstream effectors of cellular proliferation and/or survival.

Chromosomal translocations involving the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor gene (PDGFβR) are recurring cytogenetic abnormalities associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. These translocations result in cellular expression of fusion proteins such as TEL/PDGFβR (1Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Lovett M. Gilliland D.G.

The TEL/PDGFβR and HIP1/PDGFβR fusions both exhibit constitutive kinase activity due to dimerization mediated through the TEL and HIP1 domains. Expression of these fusion proteins transforms the IL-31 dependent murine hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3, to IL-3-independent growth and induces hematopoietic malignancies in murine models of leukemia (3Ross T.S.

Both the kinase activity of the PDGFβR portion and the oligomerization motifs of the TEL or HIP1 portions of the fusions are necessary for transformation. We have recently examined in more detail via mutational analysis the roles of both HIP1 and the PDGFβR in the fusion protein-mediated transformation (6Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22328-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the HIP1 portion, stepwise deletions were made to find the minimal oligomerization domain. For the PDGFβR portion, we tested the effect of several tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions that abrogate binding of signal transduction molecules, including PtdIns 3-kinase and PLCγ. These studies demonstrated that dimerization and autophosphorylation alone were insufficient for transformation. Furthermore, key mitogenic pathways mediated by PLCγ and PtdIns 3-kinase, that are normally activated by native PDGFβR, were not necessary for transformation by HIP1/PDGFβR. This raised the question of which signaling pathways, activated by HIP1/PDGFβR, are necessary for transformation. During this mutational analysis, we found that regardless of the transforming HIP1/PDGFβR mutant used, cells contained a hyperphosphorylated 130-kDa protein (p130) and constitutively active STAT5. Since STAT5 is known to promote DNA synthesis and cell division (7D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C.

In addition, there is strong evidence that constitutive STAT5 activation is not only correlated with transformation but is also necessary for leukemogenesis (10Wilbanks A.M. Mahajan S. Frank D.A.

To further clarify our understanding of the molecular events leading to cellular transformation by HIP1/PDGFβR, we have focused in this study on the identification and characterization of p130. During purification of p130 from transformed cells, p130 was found to comigrate on SDS-PAGE gels with one of the in vivo processed forms of the SH2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP1. SHIP1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, resulting in the formation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and Ins(1,3,4)P3 respectively. It is phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues in response to growth factor stimulation and activation of immune receptors (12Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J.

Algate P.A. Carlberg K. Flowers D. Friedman C. Trask B. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1997; 89: 1876-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu Q. Shalaby F. Jones J. Bouchard D. Dumont D.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During murine development, SHIP1 is first expressed at embryonic day 7.5, coincident with the onset of hematopoiesis. This is consistent with the phenotype of mice homozygous for a SHIP1deletion, which, although viable and fertile, overproduce granulocytes and macrophages and suffer from progressive splenomegaly, massive myeloid infiltration of the lungs, and a shortened lifespan (17Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A. Jirik F. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The granulocyte/macrophage progenitors from these mice are more sensitive to many cytokines compared with similar cells from their wild type littermates. Based on the phenotype of SHIP1 gene disruption and the hydrolysis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, SHIP1 is likely to be a negative regulator of cellular signaling involving PtdIns 3-kinase. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that SHIP1 protein levels were reduced in primary neoplastic cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, as might be expected with the myeloproliferative phenotype observed in SHIP −/− mice (18Sattler M. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Winkler T. Algate P.A. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7473-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of BCR/ABL in Ba/F3 cells led to a rapid reduction in the level of SHIP1 protein. The involvement of SHIP1 in the regulation of hematopoietic proliferation, along with the electrophoretic comigration of p130 with SHIP1 in our transforming HIP1/PDGFβR extracts led us to pursue the idea that p130 might be identical or related to SHIP1. We demonstrate here that the p130 phosphorylated protein observed in HIP1/PDGFβR-transformed Ba/F3 cells is indeed related to the 125-kDa isoform of SHIP1. Although SHIP1 protein levels were not consistently altered in these cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP1 and its physical association with the HIP1/PDGFβR fusion proteins might contribute to transformation, sequestering SHIP1 from its normal inositol-containing substrates and altering their cellular levels. Since SHIP1 is only expressed in hematopoietic tissue and developing spermatogonia, we predict it would be an excellent therapeutic target for hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Ba/F3, 32D, and FL5.12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 and 10‥ fetal calf serum with or without IL-3 (1 ng/ml). 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10‥ fetal calf serum. Protein extracts (500 μg of total protein) were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 4 μl of 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 16 μl of anti-SHIP antibody (Pharmingen), 5 μl of anti-tail PDGFβR antibody (Pharmingen), or 5 μl of anti-HIP1 immune serum (see below). Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to precipitate the immune complexes. The protein G beads were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1‥ Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). Extracts (100 μg of total protein) or immunoprecipitates were separated on 7‥ SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (APB; Hybond-ECL), and blocked with TBST, 5‥ bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies (1:1000–1:5000 dilutions depending on antibody) were incubated with the blocked membrane in 5‥ bovine serum albumin/TBST. The membranes were washed with TBST, and then anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 in TBST) were used to develop the blots with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Myc-tagged SHIP1a DNA insert in pVL1393 (kindly provided by Philip Majerus, Washington University, St. Louis) was digested with EcoRI. The released Myc-SHIP fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3. HIP1/PDGFβR, TEL/PDGFβR, and the various mutants have been previously described (6Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22328-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferase-HIP1 fusion construct that was used to generate anti-HIP1 rabbit serum contained glutathione S-transferase fused in frame to HIP1 amino acid sequences starting at the internalEcoRI site (nucleotide 1250) and ending at the native stop codon (nucleotide 3010). pcDNA3(HIP1) was digested withEcoRI, and the 3-kilobase pair HIP1 fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain a construct designated pGEX-3′HIP1. All PDGFβR fusion constructs were cloned into MSCVneo as described (6Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol.

Gilliland, Harvard Medical School, Boston) were transfected with Superfect transfection reagent as instructed by the supplier (Qiagen). A 48-h post-transfection supernatant (1 ml) was then added to 106 Ba/F3, 32D, or FL5.12 cells (1 ml) (all kindly provided by W. Pear, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) in the presence of polybrene as described previously (19Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Cells with stable expression were selected in the presence of G418 and IL-3 as described (4Carroll M. Tomasson M.H. Barker G.F. Golub T.R. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14845-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Murine 293T cells were passaged 1:2 onto 15-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10‥ fetal calf serum, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. When confluent, cells were passaged at a dilution of 1:4 onto 10-cm plates. Approximately 48 h after plating, cells were transfected with 15 μg of DNA in 450 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 90 μl of Superfect transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). When two plasmids were co-transfected, 7.5 μg of each plasmid were used. Protein extracts were prepared from cells harvested 48 h post-transfection. The pGEX-3′HIP1 construct was used to express and purify recombinant protein as described by the supplier of the pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified protein was dialyzed to remove glutathione and treated with thrombin to release glutathione S-transferase, and the free glutathioneS-transferase was removed by adding a second aliquot of glutathione-Sepharose and collecting the unbound fraction as antigen. For the initial immunization, 100 μg of purified antigen were dissolved in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into a rabbit at multiple sites. Purified antigen (50 μg) was mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant and used for the secondary immunizations. The phosphatase activity of immunoprecipitates derived from the Ba/F3 cell line and 293T cells was assessed using Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as a substrate. Protein extract (1 mg of total protein) used for the immunoprecipitations was prepared as described above. Prior to use in phosphatase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2) to remove phosphatase inhibitors. Phosphatase assays were carried out at 37 °C as described for SHIP2 (20Wisniewski D. Strife A. Swendeman S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Kavanaugh W.M. Tempst P. Clarkson B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2707-2720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a malachite green-based assay system (21Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For analysis of products formed after incubation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 with immunoprecipitates, the reactions were carried out using 3H-labeled substrate and separated by anion HPLC using a Partisphere 5-SAX column. Separations were achieved using an ammonium phosphate gradient consisting of buffer A (10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.8) and buffer B (1.0m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.8) as follows: 0–10 min, 0‥ B; 10–40 min, 0‥ B to 12.5‥ B; 40–80 min, 12.5‥ B to 100‥ B; 80–89 min, 100‥ B; 89–90 min, 100‥ B to 0‥ B; 90–115 min, 0‥ B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An online radioisotope detector was used with Beckman Ready Flow III scintillant. Crude homogenates of 293T cells were made by sonication at 4 °C in lysis buffer without the Triton detergent. The first centrifugation step precipitated cellular debris and nuclei for 5 min at 1,500 × g. The 1,500 ×g supernatant was subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 142,000 × g. This was designated the total membrane fraction. The remaining supernatant was defined as the cytosolic fraction. Aliquots of the total membrane fraction were suspended twice at 2 mg/ml in 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitors. The membrane suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 142,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant from this was designated the peripheral membrane fraction. The pellet was designated the integral membrane fraction. Peripheral and cytosolic fraction protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. The integral membrane fraction was solubilized in a minimal volume of 1‥ SDS, 3 m urea, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol and Tris-buffered saline and sonicated. Samples were diluted at least 1× with 5× sample buffer and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels after boiling. Western blotting was performed as described above. Recently, Sattler et al. (18Sattler M. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Winkler T. Algate P.A. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7473-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SHIP1 RNA and protein levels were down-regulated in BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F3 cells. Based on these results, we wished to determine whether SHIP1 protein levels were similarly altered in HIP1/PDGFβR-transformed Ba/F3, 32D, and FL5.12 cell lines. Levels of SHIP1 protein were measured in these cells by immunoblotting with various anti-SHIP1 antibodies. In contrast to the situation with BCR/ABL, we found that all four SHIP1 isoforms (designated as 110-, 125-, 135-, and 145-kDa isoforms) showed similar levels in control and HIP1/PDGFβR-transformed cells (Fig.1 A). However, one of the four SHIP1 protein bands migrated in a similar position to our previously unidentified p130 (6Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22328-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as shown in three independent pairs of HIP1/PDGFβR and vector-expressing Ba/F3 cell lines in Fig. 1. The same phosphorylation pattern was seen in HIP1/PDGFβR-expressing 32D and FL5.12 hematopoietic cell lines (data not shown). Following this observation, p130 immunoprecipitation by anti-SHIP1 antibodies was tested. As shown in Fig.2, anti-SHIP1 antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated p130 from Ba/F3 cells transformed with the HIP1/PDGFβR fusion protein. When the anti-phosphotyrosine blot of the anti-SHIP1 immunoprecipitates was stripped and reprobed with anti-SHIP1 antibodies, p130 co-migrated with the 125-kDa SHIP1 isoform. Fig. 2also shows that p130 was cleared from the supernatant with anti-SHIP1 antibodies after three serial immunoprecipitations of the supernatant. On average, ∼50‥ of p130 was cleared from the supernatant when most of the SHIP1 125-kDa isoform was cleared, suggesting that this band may contain another phosphoprotein. It also remains a possibility that SHIP1 associates with a currently unidentified co-migrating phosphoprotein. We have previously eliminated CBL, RAS-GAP, CAS, JAK1–3, TYK2, interleukin-3β receptor, PLCγ, PtdIns 3-kinase, and focal adhesion kinase as candidates for p130 (6Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22328-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and more recently tested to see if the SIRPα/β p130 protein was part of the phospho-p130 in our transformed extracts. A monoclonal antibody specific to SIRPα/β was used to immunoprecipitate p130, and while all of SIRPβ was precipitated from the supernatant, all of p130 remained unprecipitated (data not shown). Fig. 2 also demonstrates that anti-SHIP1 antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate p130 in the H/P(F8)-transformed cells but not in the H/P(KI)-expressing nontransformed cells grown in IL-3. H/P(F8) is a mutant of the HIP1/PDGFβR fusion protein that has eight of the SH2-binding site tyrosines mutated to phenylalanines. H/P(KI) is a construct that has a point mutation at arginine 634 of the PDGFβR, where the substituted lysine leads to a kinase-dead mutant (6Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22328-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown previously (6Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22328-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as well as in Fig. 1, p130 was not detectable in cells transfected with vector alone, suggesting that the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP1 can be attributed directly to expression of the fusion protein. Additionally, p130 co-migrated with SHIP1 and was recognized by SHIP1 antibodies in all of the previously described HIP1/PDGFβR- and TEL/PDGFβR-transformed lines (6Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22328-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This included the H/P(F8) mutant (Fig. 2). To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP1 is mediated by the HIP1/PDGFβR and TEL/PDGFβR fusion proteins, we initially analyzed protein extracts derived from cells heterologously co-expressing Myc-tagged SHIP1 with either HIP1/PDGFβR or TEL/PDGFβR. As shown in Fig.3 A, Myc-SHIP1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated when co-expressed with HIP1/PDGFβR or TEL/PDGFβR (lanes 5 and 6). SHIP1 phosphorylation was not detected when it was expressed alone (lane 2) or in cells transfected with empty vector (lane 1). It should be noted that endogenous SHIP1 phosphorylation was not detected in 293T cells transfected with fusion constructs alone (lanes 3and 4) because SHIP1 was expressed in these cells. Expression of the recombinant SHIP1 was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody as shown in Fig. 3 B (lanes 2, 5, and 6). These results strongly suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP1 was catalyzed directly by the PDGFβR kinase domain of the fusion proteins or a kinase activated by the fusion proteins. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A(lanes 3 and 4), both fusion proteins undergo autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues as expected. We next tested whether SHIP1 could physically associate with the HIP1/PDGFβR or TEL/PDGFβR fusion proteins when co-expressed in 293T cells. We surmised that association of SHIP1 with autophosphorylated HIP1/PDGFβR or TEL/PDGFβR, via its N-terminal SH2 domain, might play a role in regulating its phosphorylation by these proteins. To address this question, immunoprecipitations were performed from lysates of 293T cells expressing the various combinations of SHIP1 and the fusion proteins, as described above, using an antibody directed toward the C terminus of the PDGFβR. As seen in Fig.4 A, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHIP1 co-immunoprecipitates with either HIP1/PDGFβR or TEL/PDGFβR (lanes 5 and 6), and immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibodies showed that Myc-SHIP1 was only phosphorylated in HIP1/PDGFβR and TEL/PDGFβR co-expressing extracts (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and6). SHIP1 expression in extracts of all cells transfected with pcDNA3-MycSHIP1 was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibody as shown in Fig. 3 B (lanes 2,5, and 6). To address the specificity of the interaction between SHIP1 and the PDGFβR fusion proteins, we next tested the transforming H/P(F8) and nontransforming kinase-inactive R634K also known as H/P(KI) mutants of HIP1/PDGFβR for their ability to associate with and promote phosphorylation of SHIP1. The H/P(F8) mutant, which has eight known SH2 phosphotyrosine binding sites mutated to phenylalanine, still associated with and promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP1 (Fig. 2, right panel,lane 2; Fig. 5 A, lane 4; and Fig. 6 A,lane 4), consistent with its previously reported transforming properties (6Ross T.S.

The binding site for SHIP1 on the fusion protein may be an autophosphorylation site, since the H/P(KI) mutant of the HIP1/PDGFβR fusion neither promoted phosphorylation (Fig. 2,lanes 3, and Fig. 5 A, lane 6) nor associated with SHIP1 (Fig. 6 A,lane 6). Expression of SHIP1 and H/P(KI) was confirmed (Fig. 5 B, lane 6 for SHIP1; Fig. 5 C, lane 6 for H/P(KI)), and all of the HIP1/PDGFβR mutants were immunoprecipitated equally well by the anti-HIP1 antibody (Fig. 6 C, lanes 3–6). The data also indicate that the anti-HIP1 antibody is specific for the fusion protein or fusion protein complexes, since no SHIP1 was immunoprecipitated by the HIP1 antibody (Fig. 6 B,lanes 2 and 6). Although the levels of expression of the fusion protein and SHIP1 in 293T cells were nonphysiologic, the lack of association between the kinase-dead fusion protein, H/P(KI), and SHIP1 provides evidence that the interaction of SHIP1 with HIP1/PDGFβR was phosphorylation-dependent and specific and suggests that there was direct phosphorylation of SHIP1 by the transforming fusion protein. The exact phosphorylation sites of SHIP1 and interaction site(s) of both proteins remain to be determined, since the known SH2-binding domains of the PDGFβR do not appear to be involved.Figure 6Association of H/P(F8) but not H/P(KI) with SHIP1. Immunoprecipitations were performed on 293T cell extracts with anti-HIP1 serum. Samples were washed with lysis buffer, separated on 7‥ SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. A, immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 monoclonal antibody. B, immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody to confirm that SHIP1 is in the H/P(F8) coexpressed precipitate. C, immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-PDGFβR tail antibody to confirm that the anti-HIP1 antibody immunoprecipitated H/P(F8) as well as H/P(KI).

To address this issue, in vitro phosphatase assays were performed with SHIP1 immunoprecipitated from Ba/F3 transformed cells, using Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as a substrate. Unexpectedly, we found that SHIP1 activity was not significantly affected by tyrosine phosphorylation. The in vitro phosphatase activity of SHIP1 immunoprecipitated with anti-SHIP1 antibodies exhibited no significant changes in transformed cells when compared with cells transfected with vector alone, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation was not a principal mechanism of SHIP1 regulation (data not shown). Even when SHIP1 along with HIP1/PDGFβR or TEL/PDGFβR was overexpressed in 293T cells, tyrosine phosphorylation did not result in a dramatic change in SHIP1 phosphatase activity (Fig.7 A). In Fig. 7 A, ∼20‥ of the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 phosphatase activity was eliminated with the anti-SHIP1 antibody in all extracts (HIP1/PDGFβR, TELl/PDGFβR, or control extracts) and ∼5‥ with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in the HIP1/PDGFβR- and TEL/PDGFβR-expressing extracts as compared with 0.5‥ in the control extracts. These results suggest that the increase in 5-phosphatase activity found in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of the HIP1/PDGFβR- or TEL/PDGFβR-expressing cells was a result of increased immunoprecipitation of SHIP1 mass due to increased tyrosine phosphorylation rather than stimulation of enzyme-specific activity. The data from these activity studies further support the identification of p130 as SHIP1, since the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates from HIP1/PDGFβR-expressing cells contained m"

But so far, only a dozen or so teams have entered the field. The issue was initially one of a shortage of cells. But now the main problems are political — with fears that the new US administration will ban federal funding for ES-cell research looming large."
