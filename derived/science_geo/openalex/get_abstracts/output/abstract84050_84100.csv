https://openalex.org/W1562974039,"We have used an S1 mapping assay to demonstrate that the mRNA transcripts of the Escherichia coli galactose operon found in intact E. coli cells with a defect in adenylate cyclase or the cyclic AMP receptor protein contain at their 5' end about five nucleotides more than the gal mRNA molecules made in wild type cells. The same difference between gal RNA synthesized in vitro in the absence of cyclic AMP or cyclic AMP receptor protein and gal RNA made in the presence of these factors is detected by this assay. Our results strongly suggest that the same two overlapping promoters, which we previously identified by in vitro transcription of gal DNA fragments, also control the expression of the galactose operon in intact cells. The intracellular levels of cyclic AMP determine which promoter is utilized."

https://openalex.org/W1505544453,"The regulatory component (G/F) of adenylate cyclase, which has been purified previously, contains three putative subunits with molecular weights of 52,000, 45,000, and 35,000 (Northup, J. K., Sternweis, P. C., Smigel, M. D., Schleifer, L. S., Ross, E. M., and Gilman, A. G. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 6516-6520). The published procedure has been modified to reduce the time required for preparation and to increase the yield. Application of the improved procedure allows purification of .5 to 1.0 mg of purified G/F from 1.5 kg of frozen rabbit liver. Greater than 95% of the protein observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels is found in the three bands mentioned above. Purified G/F has the following properties: 1. Hydrodynamic measurements in cholate indicate that purified hepatic G/F has a molecular weight of about 70,000. If G/F is activated with either fluoride or GTP analogs, its apparent molecular weight is reduced to 50,000. 2. The measurement of G/F by reconstitution with the catalytic moiety of adenylate cyclase is dependent on the concentrations of both G/F and catalytic moiety. This interaction is consistent with a model derived from a simple bimolecular binding equilibrium. 3. Purified G/F can be activated by fluoride and guanine nucleotide analogs in a Mg2+-dependent reaction. The rate of activation by guanine nucleotides is markedly stimulated by high concentrations of Mg2+, indicating a site of action of divalent metallic cations on G/F. 4. The 52,000- and 45,000-dalton polypeptides can be partially resolved by heptylamine-Sepharose chromatography. G/F fractions that are enriched in the 52,000-dalton protein reconstitute hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity more efficiently and are activated by GTP analogs more rapidly than are fractions that are essentially free of this polypeptide. The 35,000-dalton protein is present in all cases."
https://openalex.org/W1546031868,"Monoclonal antibodies directed against the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor have been prepared by immunization of mice with a partially purified receptor from bovine adrenal cortex. Spleen cells from the mice were fused with the Sp2/0-Ag14 line of mouse myeloma cells. The most extensively studied monoclonal antibody, designated immunoglobulin-C7, reacts with the human and bovine LDL receptor, but not with receptors from the mouse, rat, Chinese hamster, rabbit, or dog. 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody binds to human fibroblasts in amounts that are equimolar to 125I-LDL. In fibroblasts from 6 of 8 patients with the receptor-negative form of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, which have less than 5% of normal LdL binding, the amount of monoclonal antibody binding was also less than 5% of normal. Fibroblasts from the other two receptor-negative homozygotes bound an amount of monoclonal antibody that was much greater than expected on the basis of LDL binding, suggesting that these two patients produce a structurally altered receptor that binds the antibody, but not LDL. In normal fibroblasts, the receptor-bound monoclonal antibody was taken up and degraded at 37 degrees C at rapid rate similar to that for LDL. Fibroblasts from a patient with the internalization defective form of familial hypercholesterolemia bound the monoclonal antibody, but did not internalize or degrade it. The current data demonstrate the usefulness of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the study of the cellular and genetic factors involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1558794683,"Two subpopulations of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were resolved functionally, based on their sensitivities to the drug ryanodine. These two subpopulations of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, termed ryanodine-sensitive and ryanodine-insensitive, were separated by preloading crude cardiac microsomes with Ca2+ oxalate in the presence of ATP, followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Ryanodine-insensitive vesicles accumulated most of the Ca2+ oxalate during the preload, and constituted the densest subfraction recovered from the sucrose gradient. These ryanodine-insensitive vesicles exhibited the highest density of Ca2+ pumps, and accounted for 10 to 15% of the total protein in crude cardiac microsomes. Ryanodine-insensitive vesicles continued to transport substantial amounts of Ca2+ after isolation. Ryanodine-sensitive vesicles accumulated negligible Ca2+ during the preload, and were recovered from the lower density regions of the sucrose gradient. On a milligrams of protein basis, these vesicles were present in 7-fold excess over ryanodine-insensitive vesicles. Ryanodine-sensitive vesicles transported low amounts of Ca2+ under normal incubation conditions, but 3 X 10(-4) M ryanodine strikingly increased their Ca2+ uptake 5- to 10-fold. Ca2+ uptake by ryanodine-sensitive vesicles was uniquely regulated by Ca2+ ion concentration. Elevation of the ionized Ca2+ concentration from 2 to 4 microM increased Ca2+ uptake by these vesicles greater than 5-fold, but had no effect on their Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. These ryanodine- and Ca2+ concentration-dependent effects were apparent for only ryanodine-sensitive vesicles. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed distinct differences in polypeptide staining between ryanodine-sensitive and ryanodine-insensitive vesicles, confirming by an independent method that the two populations of vesicles were different. These data provide the first biochemical evidence for functional and structural heterogeneity of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1575818884,"Treatment of A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) was shown to enhance the phosphorylation of a Mr = 34,000 protein. Because the phosphorylation of an analogous protein is enhanced in various cell lines transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (Erikson, E., and Erikson, R. L. (1980) Cell 21, 829-836), we characterized the phosphorylation of the A-431 Mr = 34,000 protein under these two conditions in order to determine whether there are common pathways between viral transformation and EGF stimulation. The results of tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the Mr = 34,000 protein was phosphorylated in an identical manner by the EGF-stimulated protein kinase activity and by the protein kinase activity of the RSV transformation-specific protein or of its normal cell homolog. Although the specific protein kinase that phosphorylates the Mr = 34,000 protein under conditions of EGF-stimulation is not yet identified, these studies demonstrate that at least one consequence of EGF stimulation is identical with one of the consequences of viral transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1946832254,"Using a combination of EPR and low temperature diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, a new species of semiquinone anion has been detected in QH2:cytochrome c oxidoreductase in submitochondrial particles under conditions of oxidant-induced extra reduction of cytochrome b. In contrast to the previously detected semiquinone anion, this new species is insensitive to antimycin but sensitive to treatment with 2,3-dimercaptopropanol and O2. The two species can easily be distinguished on the basis of their respective EPR properties since they differ in g-value, line width, and microwave power saturation behavior. It is concluded that the two species of semiquinone anion are bound to different domains on QH2:cytochrome c oxidoreductase. The existence of two different semiquinone anions in the enzyme strongly supports a mechanism of electron flow as proposed in the Q-cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2156411536,"mRNA extracted from rabbit synovial fibroblasts which had been induced to produce large amounts of collagenase (EC 3.4.23.7) by urate crystals was translated in a cell-free wheat germ system. Collagenase was identified by immunoprecipitation using mono-specific antibody to rabbit synovial collagenase. In the absence of microsomal membranes, a single precursor with Mr = 59,000 was synthesized. This polypeptide was susceptible to proteolytic degradation. In the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes, the nascent protein was processed to a polypeptide with Mr = 57,000 (identical in mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis to the major latent collagenase secreted from cells) and was protected from tryptic digestion unless a detergent was used to disrupt the membranes. In addition to Mr = 57,000 material, cells secreted immunologically reactive latent collagenase with Mr = 61,000. High molecular weight collagenase was separated from Mr = 57,000 species by binding to concanavalin a-Sepharose, suggesting that this enzyme was a product of post-translational glycosylation. Both latent enzymes were activated by trypsin and human plasma kallikrein to Mr = 45,000 and 49,000. The evidence indicates that rabbit synovial fibroblast collagenase is synthesized and secreted as a single polypeptide zymogen, not as an enzyme-inhibitor complex."

N/sup ..cap alpha../(/sup 125/I-desaminotyrosyl)CCK-8 was prepared by acylation of CCK-8 with /sup 125/I-labeled N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate in dimethylformamide and triethylamine. It was purified by cation exchange chromatography (sulfopropyl-Sephadex), followed by either gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 or high performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase C-18 column. Its nonradioactive analogue, N/sup ..cap alpha../(/sup 125/I-desaminotyrosyl)CCK-8 to pancreatic acini was rapid, reversible, temperature-dependent, saturable, and specific. This binding was inhibited by each molecular species of cholecystokinin, but not by structurally unrelated ligands. Good correlation existed between potencies of the species of cholecystokinin for inhibiting binding of this receptor probe and for stimulating pancreatic secretion. N/sup ..cap alpha../(/sup 125/I-desaminotyrosyl) CCK-8 binding was inhibited by its nonradioactive analogue, N/sup ..cap alpha../(/sup 127/I-desaminotyrosyl)CCK-8, in a manner identical with that by iodinated desaminotyrosyl moiety to the NH/sub 2/-terminal end of CCK-8 does not compromise the ability of this peptide to either bind to its pancreatic receptor or stimulate a biologic response."
https://openalex.org/W1867952642,"As a part of the process of agonist-induced desensitization, 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells lose up to 95% of their beta-adrenergic receptors, as detected by 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol (125IHYP) binding, after 12-24 h of exposure to isoproterenol. In preconfluent cultures the loss of beta-receptors is completely reversible upon removal of isoproterenol, with receptor levels reaching 100% of control levels within 48-72 h. Addition of cycloheximide (5 micrograms/ml) upon removal of agonist does not prevent the recovery of receptors. After an initial 4-h lag, receptors accumulate in the presence of cycloheximide until the same receptor level is reached that was present at the onset of desensitization. Confluent cultures, which have a reduced number of receptors per cell, recover beta-receptors to only 60 to 70% of control levels following removal of isoproterenol. In addition, cycloheximide blocks the recovery of receptors in these cultures. The effects of cycloheximide on the accumulation of receptors during cell growth suggest that receptors are stable in preconfluent cultures and that turnover only occurs later when cultures are confluent. The data also indicate that long term exposure of cells to catecholamine results in a form of the beta-adrenergic receptor that is undetectable by 125IHYP binding but, nonetheless, retains its primary amino acid structure. The undetectable receptors appear to be retained until agonist is removed, whereupon they become detectable by 125IHYP binding with a t1/2 of about 36 h in the presence of cycloheximide."
https://openalex.org/W1541370757,"The magnitude of activation of the type I and type II forms of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was investigated in estrous follicles and corpora lutea (CL) obtained from ovaries of control rabbits and rabbits injected acutely with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). To this end, a chromatographic technique which permitted quantitative evaluation of the in vivo activational state of the two forms of cAmP-dependent protein kinase was developed and verified. Results revealed that in follicles obtained from ovaries of untreated estrous rabbits, 15% of the soluble cAMP-dependent protein kinase, all of which exists as the type II isozyme, is activated. Intravenous administration of a single bolus of hCG promoted a concentration-dependent activation (in 10 min) of this protein kinase isozyme. In CL obtained from ovaries of control, 4-day pseudopregnant rabbits, 32% of the total soluble cAMP-dependent protein kinase exists as the type I form and 68% exists as the type II form. Both types of protein kinase are approximately 10% dissociated in CL from ovaries of untreated rabbits. Upon intravenous administration of hCG, only the type I form of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is further activated (in 10 min). Dissociation of this protein kinase is dependent upon the time and concentration of hCG. Preferential activation of the type I form of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in CL is also demonstrable in in vitro studies using exogenous cAMP. These data suggest that the physiological intracellular mediator of acute cAMP-regulated, hCG-triggered functions in rabbit ovarian follicles is the type II isozyme of cAMP-dependent protein kinase while in CL of 4-day pseudopregnant rabbits, it is the type I enzyme form."
https://openalex.org/W1545309548,"Refractile cytoplasmic vesicles are formed in less than 10 h when chick liver cell monolayers are incubated with serum-free medium containing 0.9 mM oleate. These vesicles are identical in microscopic appearance to those formed in monolayers by de novo fatty acid synthesis (Tarlow, D. M., Watkins, P. A., Reed, R. E., Miller, R. S., Zwergel, E. E., and Lane, M. D. (1977) J. Cell Biol. 73, 332-353), but require about one-seventh the incubation time to achieve comparable size. After release from the cells by lysis in hypotonic medium, the vesicles can be isolated by flotation at 27,000 X g. Electron microscopy reveals that the isolated vesicles are rimmed by a membrane. Analysis of vesicles isolated from cells labeled with [14C]oleate or [14C]acetate showed that greater than 95% of their 14C content was in the form of triglyceride and that most cellular [14C]triglyceride was contained in the triglyceride-rich vesicles. Exposure of cells to dibytyryl-cAMP after removal of oleate from the medium caused the disappearance of triglyceride-rich vesicles within 36 h. In the absence of cyclic nucleotide, the vesicles persist. Consistent with this morphological change, dibutyryl-cAMP caused a 5.5-fold activation of the apparent rate of mobilization of cellular [14C]triglyceride from cells previously labeled with [14C]oleate. L-(--)-Carnitine alone had no effect; however, when added with dibutyryl-cAMP, cellular triglyceride mobilization was activated 7.4-fold. Although [14C]triglyceride was the principal 14C-labeled product secreted in the absence of cyclic nucleotide and comprised 90% of the total, [14C]acetoacetate and [14C] beta-hydroxybutyrate became major products when cells were treated with dibutyryl-cAMP. Thus, dibytyryl-cAMP activated ketogenesis from cellular [14C]triglyceride by 200-fold and when added with L-(--)-carnitine, by 400-fold. Cells containing triglyceride-rich vesicles labeled with [2-glyceryl-3H]triglyceride were generated by incubation with medium containing [2-3H]glycerol. A comparison of the rates of loss of cellular [1-oleoyl-14C- and [2-glyceryl-3H]triglyceride revealed that substantial re-esterification, i.e. recycling, of 14C-fatty acid released by lipolysis occurred. Under conditions where recycling of 3H label ws minimal, it was determined that 15% of the cellular [2-glyceryl-3H]triglyceride was secreted en bloc, i.e. without prior lipolysis. En bloc secretion was not affected by dibutyryl-cAMP. The rate of lipolysis of vesicle-associated [2-glyceryl-3H]triglyceride was increased 2.2-fold in the presence of dibutyryl-cAmP. Chloroquine markedly inhibited the dibutyryl-cAMP-dependent lipolysis suggesting the participation of lysosomes in the mobilization of triglyceride-rich vesicles. Mechanisms are presented which could account for the effects of cAMP and carnitine on the turnover of vesicle triglyceride both at the level of lipolysis and the utilization of the released fatty acids by mitochondria..."
https://openalex.org/W1669279605,"We have cloned DNA complementary to mRNA coding for rat C6 glioma cell lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit. Double-stranded DNA complementary to a portion of lactate dehydrogenase mRNA was inserted into the Pst I site of plasmid pBR322 by the dC.dG tailing technique and amplified in Escherichia coli HB101. A recombinant plasmid containing lactate dehydrogenase cDNA was identified by colony hybridization to a cDNA prepared from partially purified lactate dehydrogenase mRNA and by hybridization-selected translation. The recombinant plasmid (pRLD42) contains a 680 nucleotide insert of lactate dehydrogenase mRNA. Hybridization of nick-translation pRLD42 to glioma cell poly(A)+RNA separated on agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose exhibited Mr = 5.9 X 10(5) for lactate dehydrogenase mRNA. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis of RNA from unstimulated and isoproterenol-stimulated glioma cells indicated a 2-fold increase of lactate dehydrogenase mRNA molecules in stimulated cells. The 2-fold increase of lactate dehydrogenase mRNA was confirmed by RNA-excess kinetic hybridization using pRLD42 DNA and poly(A)+RNA from unstimulated, isoproterenol-, and dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated glioma cells. These data demonstrate that isoproterenol and dibutyryl cAMP cause an increase of the number of lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit mRNA molecules in glioma cells which, in part, determines the extent of synthesis of the lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1517163332,The relationship between the binding and internalization of human choriogonadotropin and the stimulation of cAMP and steroid production was studied in cultured Leydig tumor cells. It was found that removal of the surface-bound hormone results in a rapid cessation of both cAMP and steroid production. We propose that the surface-bound hormone is responsible for the activation of steroidogenesis and that hormone internalization is involved in the deactivation of this process.

https://openalex.org/W1490077781,"This study concerned the fragmentation of beta-endorphin (beta-EP-(1-31) by synaptic membrane-bound peptidases. The peptides which accumulated during digestion of beta-endorphin by isolated synaptosomal plasma membrane preparations of rat brain were separated and isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis of the peptide fractions indicated the formation of beta-EP-(1-21), beta-EP-(2-21) (pH 7.4), beta-EP-(18-31), beta-EP-(1-14), and beta-EP-(1-13) (pH 5.0) in addition to previously identified gamma-endorphin (beta-EP-(1-17)), alpha-endorphin (beta-EP-(1-16), and their des-tyrosine fragments (Burbach, J. P. H., Loeber, J. G., Verhoef, J., Wiegant, V. M., De Kloet, E. R., and De Wied, D. (1980) Nature 283, 96-97). The beta-endorphin fragments obtained with crude or with purified synaptosomal plasma membranes differed only quantitatively. The peptidase which converted gamma-endorphin into beta-EP-(1-16), beta-EP-(1-15), beta-EP-(1-14), and beta-EP-(1-13), was considerably active at pH 5.0 and resembled carboxypeptidase A in degrading gamma-endorphin; the activity was reduced by the carboxypeptidase A inhibitor D-phenylalanine. The data supplement previous findings and allow routes to be delineated for the conversion of beta-endorphin by brain synaptic membranes. A pathway comprising the main events in the conversion processes is proposed and is discussed in relationship to the significance of beta-endorphin as a precursor for neuropeptides with distinct central activities."

https://openalex.org/W1593482576,"Competition of encephalomyocarditis virus, reovirus, and L-cell mRNAs for a message-discriminatory component was studied in vitro. The data were analyzed qualitatively to determine the relative initiation efficiencies among the various mRNAs. The effects of potassium chloride concentration, magnesium acetate concentration, and m7G methylation on mRNA competition in vitro were also studied. These results were correlated with translation rates in vivo for the same mRNAs, to determine if the sites of competition in vitro and in vivo are the same. It was found that under a particular set of magnesium acetate and potassium chloride concentrations, the order of mRNA initiation efficiencies was the same both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that the same limiting message-discriminatory factor is regulating initiation rates in both cases. This can only be accomplished in a competitive situation when RNA is in molar excess relative to the discriminatory component."
https://openalex.org/W1488591283,"Abstract Bovine thyroid membranes possess both ADP ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities with the same Km values for NAD and the same pH optima. In intact membranes, the ADP ribosyltransferase is limited in its extent by the amount of available membrane acceptor which can be ADP-ribosylated; in membranes solubilized with lithium diiodosalicylate, an artificial acceptor, L-arginine methyl ester, can be substituted to eliminate this limitation. The product of the ADP ribosyltransferase is a mono-ADP-ribosylated acceptor whether the intact or solubilized membrane provides the enzyme activity and whether membrane or exogenous acceptor, L-arginine methyl ester, is utilized. The intact membranes and the solubilized preparation also have an enzyme activity which can release AMP from the mono-ADP-ribosylated acceptor whether formed by the action of the membrane ADP ribosyltransferase or the A promoter of cholera toxin. The NAD glycohydrolase activity appears to represent the half-reaction of the ADP ribosyltransferase, i.e. an activity measurable substituting water for a membrane acceptor or L-arginine methyl ester. Membranes from functional rat thyroid cells in culture, i.e. cells chronically stimulated by thyrotropin and unresponsive to further additions of thyrotropin, have low ADP-ribosylation but high NAD glycohydrolase activities. In contrast, membranes from nonfunctional rat thyroid cells, i.e. cells unresponsive to thyrotropin, have high ADP-ribosylation and low NAD glycohydrolase activities. NAD hydrolysis by the NAD glycohydrolase activity cannot account for the low ADP-ribosylation activity in membranes from the functioning cells, and its low level of ADP-ribosylation can be eliminated by solubilizing the membranes and substituting an artificial acceptor, L-arginine methyl ester. The ADP ribosyltransferase activity of rat thyroid cell membrane preparations can be enhanced by thyrotropin in a dose-dependent manner but not by insulin, glucagon, hydrocortisone, adrenocorticotropin, or its glycoprotein hormone analog, human chorionic gonadotropin. It is thus suggested (i) that, in analogy to cholera toxin, thyrotropin-stimulated ADP-ribosylation may be important in the regulation of the adenylate cyclase response and (ii) that the level of membrane acceptor available for ADP-ribosylation may relate both to a stable 'activated state of the adenylate cyclase system in cells chronically stimulated with thyrotropin and/or to a desensitized state with regard to a failure of more thyrotropin to elicit additional functional responses."
https://openalex.org/W1496691536,"A new photoactive beta-adrenergic antagonist, p-azidobenzylcarazolol (pABC) has been synthesized by combining a carbazole moiety with a p-azido-benzyl substituent. The compound has been labeled with tritium to a specific activity of 26 Ci/mmol. In frog erythrocyte membranes, [3H]p-azido-benzylcarazolol binds to the beta-adrenergic receptor with the expected beta 2 specificity and with high affinity (KD congruent to 100 +/- 10 pM). Unlabeled p-azido-benzylcarazolol can irreversibly inactivate the [3H]dihydroalprenolol-binding activity of frog erythrocyte membranes in a photodependent manner which can be prevented by beta-adrenergic agents. Incubation of frog erythrocyte membranes or digitonin-solubilized preparations of these membranes or digitonin-solubilized preparations of these membranes which had been enriched in beta-adrenergic receptors by a Sepharose-alprenolol chromatography step led to covalent incorporation of radioactivity into a Mr = 58,000 peptide. Specific incorporation of [3H]pABC into the Mr = 58,000 peptide could be prevented by both beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. This peptide has previously been purified and shown to contain the beta-adrenergic receptor-binding site (Shorr, R. G. L., Lefkowitz, R. J., and Caron, M. G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5820-5826). Thus, photoaffinity labeling of the beta-adrenergic receptor protein directly identifies the same hormone-binding subunit as has been isolated by conventional purification techniques."

https://openalex.org/W1505207370,"Abstract Utilizing differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray diffraction, 1,2-dimyristoyl-L-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DMPS) was shown to form hydrated bilayer membrane structures exhibiting a gel leads to liquid crystalline transition at 39 degrees C (delta H = 7.2 kcal/mol). Addition of up to molar concentrations of the alkali halides NaCl, KCl, Rl Cl, and CsCl produced relatively minor changes in DMPS bilayer structure or stability. For example, in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, the transition temperature (Tc = 42 degrees C) and transition enthalpy (delta H = 7.0 kcal/mol) show only minor changes. In marked contrast, addition of LiCl results in 'crystallization of the DMPS bilayer membrane structure. At 0.5 M LiCl, the crystalline DMPS exhibits a bilayer gel leads to liquid crystal transition at 89 degrees C accompanied by a high enthalpy change, delta H = 16.0 kcal/mol. Thus, Li+ induces an isothermal crystallization of DMPS bilayers, the hydrocarbon chains adopting a more ordered packing mode than the hexagonal arrangement of the gel state. In view of the widespread use of lithium in the treatment of manic-depressive illness, we also raise the possibility that interaction of Li+ with anionic membrane phospholipids could play a role in its pharmacological action."

https://openalex.org/W1553690038,"The properties of Na+ channels at different stages of the in vitro development of embyronic chick skeletal muscle were analyzed using three different classes of toxins that act specifically on Na+ channels: alkaloids like veratridine and batrachotoxin, which stabilize an open form of the Na+ channel; polypeptide neurotoxins like sea anemone and scorpion neurotoxins that prolong the life time of the conducting form of the channel by slowing down the inactivation process; and tetrodotoxin, which inhibits the entry of Na+ through the channel. The rate of 22Na+ uptake, which is activated by a mixture of 10 p~ sea anemone toxin II and 100 pM veratridine and which is inhibited by 0.1 p~ tetrodotoxin, was used as an estimate of the amount of Na+ channels. Toxin-activated rates of “Na+ uptake were very low in unfused cultures; they increased in parallel with the extent of fusion to reach a maximum at 100 h of culture, and then stabilized. Dose-response curves for the action of the different neurotoxins on the initial rate of ‘*Na+ uptake were obtained at different ages of culture between 2 and 7 days. The apparent affinities of the different toxins for their receptors on the Na’ channel remained invariant, indicating that the same type of functional, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel is present at all stages of myotube development. Only the number of Na+ channels is increasing during myogenesis. Direct biochemical titration of Na+ channels was carried out with a highly radiolabeled derivative of tetrodotoxin.

https://openalex.org/W1661605701,"The adenine nucleotide translocase was purified from bovine heart mitochondria and incorporated into membranes of phospholipid liposomes. The rate of transport of the adenine nucleotides was competitively inhibited by oleoyl coenzyme A with an approximate Ki of 1.0 microM. Significant inhibition was limited to those fatty acyl coenzyme A esters which are carnitine dependent for their oxidation in isolated mitochondria. Octanoyl coenzyme A was almost completely inactive as was palmitic acid and palmitoyl carnitine. By comparing the inhibitory characteristics of carboxyatractylate and bongkrekic acid with those of oleoyl-CoA, it was determined that the fatty acyl-CoA esters could produce inhibition whether the carrier was inserted into the liposome in either the conventional (65%) or reverse (30%) orientation. The results demonstrate that the interaction of long chain fatty acyl-CoA esters with the ADP/ATP carrier in a purified reconstituted system mimics their effects with isolated mitochondria and inverted submitochondrial particles. In general, these findings are consistent with the role of acyl-CoA esters acting as natural ligands and biological effectors of the translocator."

https://openalex.org/W1587407534,"Abstract The voltage-sensitive sodium channel of rat brain synaptosomes was solubilized with sodium cholate. The solubilized sodium channel migrated on a sucrose density gradient with an apparent S20,w of approximately 12 S, retained [3H]saxitoxin ([3H]STX) binding activity that was labile at 36 degrees C but no longer bound 125I-labeled scorpion toxin (125I-ScTX). Following reconstitution into phosphatidylcholine vesicles, the channel regained 125I-ScTX binding and thermal stability of [3H]STX binding. Approximately 50% of the [3H]STX binding activity and 58% of 125I-ScTX binding activity were recovered after reconstitution. The reconstituted sodium channel bound STX and ScTX with KD values of 5 and 10 nM, respectively. Under depolarized conditions, veratridine enhanced the binding of 125I-ScTX with a K0.5 of 20 microM. These KD and K0.5 values are similar to those of the native synaptosome sodium channel. 125I-ScTX binding to the reconstituted sodium channel, as with the native channel, was voltage dependent. The KD for 125I-ScTX increased with depolarization. This voltage dependence was used to demonstrate that the reconstituted channel transports Na+. Activation of sodium channels by veratridine under conditions expected to cause hyperpolarization of the reconstituted vesicles increased 125I-ScTX binding 3-fold. This increased binding was blocked by STX with K0.5 = 5 nM. These data indicate that reconstituted sodium channels can transport Na+ and hyperpolarize the reconstituted vesicles. Thus, incorporation of solubilized synaptosomal sodium channels into phosphatidylcholine vesicles results in recovery of toxin binding and action at each of the three neurotoxin receptor sites and restoration of Na+ transport by the reconstituted channels."
https://openalex.org/W1514698543,"Substrate specificity of a prolyl hydroxylase from Vinca rosea suspension-cultured cells was studied using synthetic oligo(L-proline)s and their t-butyloxycarbonyl derivatives (Pron and Boc-Pron; n = 2-8) as peptidyl substrates. All peptides with a residual number of 5 or greater served as substrates in the enzyme reaction at 30 degrees C, after the preincubation of the enzyme and peptides at 0 degrees C prior to addition of cofactors and cosubstrate. Under the same conditions, the hydroxylation of Pro5 reached a plateau within 10 min, but that of Boc-Pro8 and poly(L-proline) increased linearly up to 40 min. If the preincubation temperature was raised to 30 degrees C, only Pro5 among the peptides was unable to serve as a substrate. The optimum temperature of the enzyme was 30 degrees C toward Boc-Pro8 and poly(L-proline) but it decreased to 15 degrees C using Pro5. These data suggest that the enzyme can bind Pro5 only at low temperature. Poly(L-proline) and Boc-Pron (n greater than or equal to 5) in aqueous solution are known to have a left-handed helical structure (poly(L-proline) II helix). Moreover, Pro5 was indicated as forming this helix below 10 degrees C. Accordingly, the enzyme recognizes the poly(L-proline) II helix, that is, the secondary structure of a substrate rather than the primary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1520855106,"A cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase associated with retinal rod outer segment (ROS) membranes is fully activated only in the presence of light and GTP. Activity can be easily depleted from the membranes by hypotonic washing, which in darkness removes two major soluble proteins. One of these has cGMP phosphodiesterase activity which is no longer activated by light or GTP. The other lacks phosphodiesterase activity but copurifies with the catalytic protein unless special measures are taken. In the present report, these 2 proteins removed from the ROS in darkness were resolved in a manner which was qualitatively and quantitatively dependent upon concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol and EDTA. We designated the catalytic protein as P and the other protein G, because it has been reported to exhibit GTP-related activities. The unresolved P and G proteins behaved as a single complex on native gels, analytical ultracentrifugation, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and gel filtration. The P:G complex had the same Mr as purified P and more stable phosphodiesterase activity. Removal of G from P destabilized the catalytic activity and allowed aggregation of P. With loss of activity by purified P, multiple slow migrating protein bands appeared upon native gel electrophoresis. Destabilization of P could be partially prevented by addition of Mg2+ before physical separation of P from G. If 2-mercaptoethanol was removed simultaneously, dissociation of the P:G complex and destabilization of P were prevented. These findings imply that the G protein is essential to the catalytic stability of P when both are removed in darkness from the ROS membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1561840836,"The synthesis of uteroglobin in the rabbit uterus is induced by progesterone and is repressed by estrogen which has an over-riding effect over the inducer. The dual hormonal control system offers an excellent model for studying hormonal regulation of mammalian gene expression. Using a full-length uteroglobin cDNA clone as a specific hybridization probe, recombinant lambda phages containing the entire chromosomal uteroglobin gene have been isolated from a rabbit genomic DNA library. Electronmicroscopic analysis of hybrid molecules formed between the chromosomal uteroglobin gene and uteroglobin mRNA indicated the presence of 2 intervening sequences within this gene. The mosaic structure of the uteroglobin gene has been substantiated by detailed restriction mapping and Southern hybridization. The gene is 3.0 kilobases in length to code for a mature mRNA of 465 nucleotides. Northern hybridization of poly(A)-containing RNA from 4-day-pregnant rabbit uterus with the full-length cDNA clone revealed the presence of uteroglobin mRNA precursors. The size of the largest precursor RNA species detected by the cDNA clone is the same as the entire chromosomal uteroglobin gene. The fidelity of the precursor RNAs was established by their ability to hybridize with specific intervening sequence probes. Thus the entire uteroglobin gene is expressed into primary RNA transcripts, which are subsequently processed into mature mRNA molecules by splicing."

This result is in agreement with those previously reported for the hydrolysis of chiral phosphorothioate substrates (Bryant, F. R., and Benkovic, S. J. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 2825-2828; Burgers, P. M. J., Eckstein, F., and Hunneman, D. H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7476-7478). The hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by this enzyme occurs via formation of a covalent nucleotidylated enzyme intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W2101447695,"Certain cellular responses to thyroid hormones appear to be mediated by non-histone chromatin protein receptors. Purification of these proteins is important for an investigation of the detailed mechanisms of their regulatory role. In the present studies, we report the development of an affinity chromatographic system that can be used to purify thyroid hormone receptors solubilized from nuclei. Amine-substituted hormone analogs were prepared with D and L isomers of T3; these bind to the receptor. This finding supports the hypothesis that thyroid hormones fit into the receptor with the amino groups accessible from outside the binding site. Although L-triiodothyronine (LT3) (the naturally occurring isomer) binds more tightly (relative Kd = 1.0 nM) to the nuclear receptor than D-triiodothyronine (DT3) (relative Kd = 2.0 nM), the amine-substituted analog of DT3 binds more tightly than the LT3 analog (DT3 analog, relative Kd = 40 nM; LT3 analog, relative Kd = 1500 nM). Agarose-based gels containing DT3 and LT3 covalently coupled by their amino groups were also prepared. Binding of receptor to these gels was biospecific in that it could be inhibited by prior incubation of the receptors with LT3. In addition, as predicted by the analog studies, the DT3 affinity gels were more effective than LT3 gels in adsorbing receptor. Elution of receptor from the LT3-derived gels was achieved in a predicted volume and concentration of counter-ligand in elution buffer. These results suggest that affinity chromatography can be applied to the purification of thyroid hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1659572554,"Photolysis of rat adrenocortical cells in the presence of the photoreactive derivative [(2-nitro-5-azidophenylsulfenyl)Trp9]-adrenocorticotropic hormone (2,5-NAPS-ACTH) at 24 degrees C resulted in persistent activation of corticosterone production. The basal rate of steroidogenesis became maximal when photolysis was performed at 24 degrees C but remained the same as that of control cells when irradiation was performed at 0 degrees C. No increase in basal rate was observed with dark controls or cells photolyzed with [(2,4-dinitrophenylsulfenyl)Trp9]ACTH, a photoresistant analog of the hormone. Prephotolyzed 2,5-NAPS-ACTH failed to induce persistent activation. Both ACTH and 2,4-(dinitrophenylsulfenyl)Trp9-ACTH blocked the photo-induced activation of steroidogenesis elicited by 2,5-NAPS-ACTH. Under photolysis conditions which caused the basal rate of steroidogenesis to become maximal, a 3-fold increase in the basal rate of cAMP formation was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1505886179,"The effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-P2-glycerate) on the phosphorylation of spectrin in solution by purified membrane cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase and in membrane preparations by the endogenous kinase was investigated. 2,3-P2-Glycerate inhibited spectrin phosphorylation both in solution and in the intact membrane. Kinetic analyses showed that 2,3-P2-glycerate had no effect on the Km for ATP but appeared to lower the Vmax of the reaction. When the effect of 2,3-P2-glycerate was examined in the presence of varying concentrations of spectrin, competitive inhibition kinetics were obtained. Interestingly, low concentrations of 2,3-P2-glycerate were found to effect the release of the membrane kinase from erythrocyte membranes. This release reaction may be related to the ability of 2,3-P2-glycerate to interfere with the interaction between the kinase and spectrin. The data suggest the possibility that the kinase may be bound to spectrin in the erythrocyte membrane. 2,3-P2-glycerate also caused the solubilization of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase, but not of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Taken together, our data indicate that 2,3-P2-glycerate may have a regulatory role in membrane protein phosphorylation and also may regulate the extent of association of the kinase with the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1487417130,"Abstract Native pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, in contrast to the rat liver enzyme, is not a substrate of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. However, the pig kidney enzyme becomes a substrate when phosphorylation is performed in 1.6 M urea, after prior unfolding in 8 M urea. A cyanogen bromide fragment containing the phosphorylation site has been isolated and the amino acid sequence of this 63-residue peptide has been determined. This peptide has the following sequence: Leu-Asp-Pro-Ala-Ile-Gly-Glu-Phe-Ile-Leu-Val-Asp-Arg-Asn-Val-Lys-le-Lys-Lys-Lys- Gly-Ser(P)-Ile-Tyr-Ser-Ile-Asn-Glu-Gly-Tyr-Ala-Lys-Glu-Phe-Asp-Pro-Ala-Ile-Thr- Glu-Tyr-Ile-Glu-Arg-Lys-Lys-Phe-Pro-Pro-Asp-Asn-Ser-Ala-Pro-Tyr-Gly-Ala-Arg-Tyr -Val-Gly-Ser-Met. The amino acid sequence around the phosphorylated serine residue resembles those of other protein substrates of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, but it is completely different from the phosphorylation site found in native rat liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1569195241,"Abstract The heme propionates of heme peptide 1-25 from horse heart cytochrome c were methylated in acidified methanol. The methylated heme peptide combines with apocytochrome c in a single second order kinetic phase whose rate constant is within a factor of four of that measured for the unmethylated heme peptide. The dissociation constants for the two complexes are also within a factor of four. The methylated and unmethylated complexes exhibit similar fluorescence quenching, far ultraviolet dichroic spectra, and catalytic activities. The methylated complex has a Tm about 10 degrees C lower than that of the unmethylated complex. The charge transfer band of the methylated complex occurs at 720 nm instead of 695 nm as observed for the unmethylated complex. It is proposed that methylation of the outer heme propionate causes a small steric effect which alters the geometry of the methionine 80 ligation with the heme iron."
https://openalex.org/W1633640294,"An enzyme activity that synthesizes cytidylyl (5'-3') guanosine 5'-triphosphate (pppGpC) in vitro has been identified in purified vesicular stomatitis virus. The activity is discernible after a lag period which is reduced in length with increasing virus concentration. The lag is eliminated by addition of pppGpC or ppGpC which are effective primers and stimulate dinucleotide synthesis linearly. The requirements of the reaction with respect to MgCl2, NaCl, and temperature are similar to those for viral mRNA synthesis in vitro. The activity, together with the viral L and NS proteins, is removed from virions by treatment with 0.8 M NaCl. The particulate fraction from infected cells that contains the transcribing subviral ribonucleoprotein particles also contains the enzyme activity. The corresponding fraction from uninfected cells does not, indicating that the activity is mediated by virus-specific proteins. Possible functions of the dinucleotide in the life cycle of the virus are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1590097565,"The effect of adenine ribonucleotides on the stability of Escherichia coli dnaB protein in cellular crude extracts was studied. Stabilization of dnaB protein by ATP or ADP, but not by AMP, was manifested in that (i) the activity and yield of wild type dnaB protein is enhanced in the presence of ATP, (ii) the dnaB protein of E. coli dnaB mutants, such as groPB and dnaB252/ColE1::dnaC+, which is inactive in a dnaB complementation assay, can be isolated in active form in the presence of ATP or aDP, (iii) ATP or ADP protect the dnaB protein of an E. coli dnaBts mutant from inactivation at 37 degrees C, and (iv) inactive groPB and dnaBts protein can be reactivated partially by ATP. Thus, the stabilizing effect of ATP and ADP can be exploited for the isolated of otherwise inactive or labile mutant dnaB proteins."
