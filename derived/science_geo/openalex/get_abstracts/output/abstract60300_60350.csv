There was significant association between the haplotype HL-A 2-12 and antigen E skin hypersensitivity (F = .22 to .26) in this family. The map order is first locus of HL-A, second locus of HL-A, and IrE. These determinants are considered to be part of the linkage group HL-1."

https://openalex.org/W1516359121,"Abstract Daunorubicin, a cancer chemotherapeutic antibiotic, is converted by rat liver extracts to daunorubicinol by daunorubicin reductase. This enzyme is purified from rat liver by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, and Bio-Gel P-200 column chromatography with an overall recovery of 46%. On the basis of polyacrylamide electrophoresis with and without sodium dodecyl sulfate, gel filtration chromatography, and high speed ultracentrifugation, the final preparation is judged homogeneous. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis give molecular weights of 38,796 ± 369 and 39,800, respectively, and suggest a single polypeptide chain. In agreement is the molecular weight of 39,541 calculated from the proposed amino acid composition. The enzyme has an isoelectric point of 6.3 and a strict requirement for NADPH. The daunorubicin-NADPH interaction occurs with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The apparent equilibrium constant at pH 8.5 for reduction is 2.91 (± 0.26) x 109 m-1, and the apparent Km for daunorubicin is 57 µm. Several common sulfhydryl reactants inhibited the enzyme. A closely related antibiotic, adriamycin, is reduced at about 5% the rate of daunorubicin reduction. In addition to the antibiotics, the enzyme reduces some aldo sugars, particularly, d-glucuronolactone, d-glyceraldehyde, and the isomers d-glucuronate and d-galacturonate. d-Glucuronolactone and daunorubicin were the preferred substrates. This reactivity with d-glucuronolactone suggests a normal role of daunorubicin reductase in ascorbic acid synthesis or in the glucuronic acid cycle, or both."

https://openalex.org/W186917966,"Abstract Bitis gabonica phospholipase A contains 118 amino acid residues in a single chain and is cross-linked by six disulfide bridges. Cyanogen bromide cleavage, and tryptic and chymotryptic digests provided the necessary overlapping peptides allowing the derivation of the complete amino acid sequence. In its primary structure the enzyme is more closely related to porcine pancreatic phospholipase A than to the enzyme from the honey bee Apis mellifica."

https://openalex.org/W2122938298,"Abstract The iron-sulfur protein putidaredoxin from Pseudomonas putida contains 106 amino acids arranged in a single peptide chain. The complete amino acid sequence has been determined. The molecular weight including 2 atoms each of iron and sulfur is 11,594. The molecule contains 6 cysteine residues. It is suggested that positions 39, 45, 48, and 85 (or 86) may be chelated to the iron in the iron sulfide reactive center."
https://openalex.org/W1524166106,"Abstract Hemoglobin of the prosimian primate Lemur fulvus fulvus is quite similar to human hemoglobin in its primary structure but is significantly different in its functional behaviour. Equilibrium and kinetic studies show that the sequence differences in Lemur hemoglobin do not affect cooperativity, but do produce a decreased oxygen affinity, a decreased Bohr effect, and a decreased response to organic phosphates. The decreased effect of organic phosphates on Lemur hemoglobin may be partially accounted for by the presence of leucine at the β2 position. This constitutes the first experimental verification of the involvement of β2 histidine in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding (proposed on the basis of a recent x-ray crystallographic study). The other functional differences cannot be readily accounted for in terms of the current stereochemical model. Tetramers of Lemur hemoglobin have an increased tendency to dissociate into dimers relative to human hemoglobin. In addition, there are greater functional differences between the α and the β chains within tetramers of Lemur hemoglobin than in human hemoglobin tetramers. Kinetic analysis shows that only one type of chain, tentatively identified as β, contributes to the pH dependence of deoxygenation of Lemur hemoglobin. This is the major kinetic expression of the pH dependence of oxygen binding observed in equilibrium studies. Comparative studies show that the exaggerated chain differences and low oxygen affinity of stripped Lemur hemoglobin are closely paralleled by the behavior of human hemoglobin in the presence of saturating amounts of inositol hexaphosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1517004583,"Abstract The acid deoxyribonucleases in homogenates of human gastric mucosa and cervix uteri were purified extensively by a procedure including DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatographies, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing. The enzymes in the two preparations had similar properties. The active protein was resolved into at least two forms with different isoelectric points, as judged by the formation of acid-soluble fragments. The major component of the activity had an isoelectric point at pH 7.02, and the minor component at pH 6.86. However, other properties of these two forms were similar. The final preparations of the gastric and uterine acid DNases were free of other types of DNase (DNases I, III, and IV), acid and alkaline phosphatases, acid and basic RNases, and nonspecific phosphodiesterase. Both enzymes had a molecular weight of approximately 38,000, as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and showed maximum activity at pH 5.2 to 5.5 in 33 mm acetate buffer. They did not require divalent cations for activity, and hydrolyzed native, double-stranded DNA about 10 to 20 times faster than heat-denatured DNA. They did not act on RNA or calcium bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate, indicating that they did not contain intrinsic phosphodiesterase activity. The products formed from native DNA were 3'-phosphoryl- and 5'-hydroxyl-terminated oligonucleotides. The average chain length of the limit digests with these enzymes was approximately 10 and the predominant species were longer than hexanucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1969762639,"SINCE Lowry et al.1 found X-ray evidence for the presence of longitudinally ordered myosin in vertebrate smooth muscle there has been much debate on the precise form in which it is present. Small et al.2,3 have found well ordered and well preserved broad ribbon-shaped elements (80 Å wide and 200–1100 Å broad) in micrographs of vertebrate smooth muscle fixed after relaxation in isotonic and hypertonic salines. They believe that these ribbons are the myosin contractile elements and support this view with the observation that the meridional X-ray reflection of 143 Å (indicative of an ordered myosin structure) could arise from such ribbons."

https://openalex.org/W1536410026,"Abstract In this paper is described a method for the purification of CDP-d-glucose pyrophosphorylase from a rough mutant of Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis type V which yields an enzyme 50% pure with high specific activity. When this material is subjected to gel electrophoresis at pH 7.5, the activity can be identified with one of the two major bands on the gel. By means of Sephadex gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies, the enzyme was found to be a single subunit composed of a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 110,000. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was observed for the four compounds utilized by the enzyme. Values of Km for each of the substrates are as follows: CTP, 0.11 mm; glucose 1-phosphate, 0.11 mm; CDP-d-glucose, 0.41 mm; and Mg2-PPi, 0.43 mm. The enzyme requires a divalent cation for activity, cobalt being the most active in the direction of CDP-glucose synthesis and magnesium and cobalt in the direction of pyrophosphorolysis. The enzyme was inhibited by CDP-ascarylose, CDP-abequose, and a mixture of CDP-d-fucose and CDP-6-deoxy-d-glucose. The inhibition by CDP-ascarylose is characterized by nonlinear Dixon plots of 1/v versus I, a Hill plot with a slope of 2.3 for I, but linear Lineweaver-Burk plots for CTP and glucose 1-phosphate in the presence of the inhibitor. The presence of CDP-ascarylose causes a 10-fold increase in the Km for CTP, but Km for glucose 1-phosphate remains unchanged. The possible implications of these results are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W54732151,"Abstract Bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B is a protein which is believed to have evolved with carboxypeptidase A by gene duplication from a common ancestral prototype enzyme. Whereas bovine carboxypeptidase A has but one disulfide bond, carboxypeptidase B has three. Reduced, S-aminoethylated carboxypeptidase B was maleylated and the product subjected to tryptic hydrolysis. The peptides with COOH-terminal arginine so produced were fractionated by gel filtration and by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25. Eleven of the 14 principal peptides possible were isolated. The peptides that contained the six S-aminoethylcysteine residues originating from the half-cystines in the enzyme were subjected to sequence analysis and were aligned on the basis of substantial homologies with sequences in carboxypeptidase A. Referred to the sequence of carboxypeptidase A, the half-cystines in carboxypeptidase B are at positions 66, 79, 138, 152, 161, and 166. Those at positions 138 and 161 are homologous with the two half-cystine residues in carboxypeptidase A. The remaining four half-cystines, when related to the known chain conformation of carboxypeptidase A, are in locations which would be stereochemically compatible with the presence of two additional disulfide bonds in the structure: one, as previously found, between half-cystines 66 and 79 and the other between half-cystines 152 and 166. One of the half-cystines is present in a peptide which terminates in an arginine residue recognized to be homologous with Arg-145 in carboxypeptidase A, a residue critical for the establishment of the specificity of carboxypeptidase A. The present experiments have permitted placement in sequence of an additional 85 residues in carboxypeptidase B, bringing the total residues so placed to 221. Of these residues, 100 are homologous with residues in carboxypeptidase A. These homologies, the configurational correlations revealed by the positions of the half-cystines, the conservation of at least two of the three residues involved in zinc binding (His-69 and Glu-72) and of the three functionally essential residues in the active site (Arg-145, Tyr-248 and Glu-270) all implicate the existence of a close structural homology with carboxypeptidase A."

https://openalex.org/W2084154117,"WHILE watching noise displayed on a television screen recently I noticed a visual effect which I report here. As normally viewed, displays of video noise (‘snow’) have the appearance of fields of small speckles which seem to dart about at random. When, however, the noise is viewed monocularly, the texture of the field seems finer and the speckles more nearly static. The display seen monocularly has the appearance of a field of smaller speckles which scintillate in situ. I have shown the effect to about ten friends and colleagues, without telling them what to expect. All noticed some difference between binocular and monocular viewing and several promptly described exactly what I had seen. In general, the size change was more consistently reported than the motion change."
