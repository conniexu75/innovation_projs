https://openalex.org/W1966655770,"Hydropic degeneration of the islands of Langerhans and permanent severe diabetes mellitus have followed the prolonged injection of intraperitoneal glucose-saline solution in normal as well as in partially depancreatized cats. Positive results were associated with prolonged hyperglycemia. These findings add further evidence in support of the hypothesis that a sustained elevation of blood glucose may, under certain conditions, lead to the production of damage to the islands of Langerhans in this species. Besides hyperglycemia, other disturbances which might be responsible wholly or in part for the island lesions are under study."

The fractionation factor, 1.0575, is the greatest yet observed. Isotopic resemblance to salt-dome sulfur deposits is evident, and, like saltdome calcite, the lake's carbon dioxide is depleted in heavy carbon (C13)."

This theory is consistent with findings for all known compounds of the system and yields predictions concerning other systems."

https://openalex.org/W2007030857,A brief review of the history of the Wisconsin Stage in Pleistocene stratigraphy and of research since 1950 shows that post-Sangoman glacial drift older than the Wisconsin drift reported in the older literature is present in central North America. Known and possible stratigraphic positions of the relevant units are shown.

https://openalex.org/W2021107724,"Streptomycin held in solution in concentrations of 100 and 1,000 microg./ml. at 10 degrees C. is stable at pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 for a period of three months. The depressor effect observed in the turbidimetric assay appears to be the result of two factors, buffer salt concentration and pH, and is most marked at pH 6.0. Almost normal activity reappears at pH 8.0 even in the presence of the greater concentration of phosphates."
