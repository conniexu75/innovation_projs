https://openalex.org/W2094177521,"We demonstrate a technique that uses high-order harmonic generation in molecules to probe nuclear dynamics and structural rearrangement on a subfemtosecond time scale. The chirped nature of the electron wavepacket produced by laser ionization in a strong field gives rise to a similar chirp in the photons emitted upon electron-ion recombination. Use of this chirp in the emitted light allows information about nuclear dynamics to be gained with 100-attosecond temporal resolution, from excitation by an 8-femtosecond pulse, in a single laser shot. Measurements on molecular hydrogen and deuterium agreed well with calculations of ultrafast nuclear dynamics in the H 2 + molecule, confirming the validity of the method. We then measured harmonic spectra from CH 4 and CD 4 to demonstrate a few-femtosecond time scale for the onset of proton rearrangement in methane upon ionization."

We found that the mass of the ice sheet decreased significantly, at a rate of 152 +/- 80 cubic kilometers of ice per year, which is equivalent to 0.4 +/- 0.2 millimeters of global sea-level rise per year. Most of this mass loss came from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet."

https://openalex.org/W2054793434,"The Sumatra–Andaman earthquake of 26 December 2004 is the first giant earthquake (moment magnitude Mw > 9.0) to have occurred since the advent of modern space-based geodesy and broadband seismology. It therefore provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the characteristics of one of these enormous and rare events. Here we report estimates of the ground displacement associated with this event, using near-field Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys in northwestern Sumatra combined with in situ and remote observations of the vertical motion of coral reefs. These data show that the earthquake was generated by rupture of the Sunda subduction megathrust over a distance of >1,500 kilometres and a width of <150 kilometres. Megathrust slip exceeded 20 metres offshore northern Sumatra, mostly at depths shallower than 30 kilometres. Comparison of the geodetically and seismically inferred slip distribution indicates that ∼30 per cent additional fault slip accrued in the 1.5 months following the 500-second-long seismic rupture. Both seismic and aseismic slip before our re-occupation of GPS sites occurred on the shallow portion of the megathrust, where the large Aceh tsunami originated. Slip tapers off abruptly along strike beneath Simeulue Island at the southeastern edge of the rupture, where the earthquake nucleated and where an Mw = 7.2 earthquake occurred in late 2002. This edge also abuts the northern limit of slip in the 28 March 2005 Mw = 8.7 Nias–Simeulue earthquake. The devastating Sumatra–Andaman earthquake of 26 December 2004 was the first giant earthquake to occur in the era of modern space-based geodesy and broadband seismology, and the mass of data collected during the event is now being analysed. A dataset of about 300 observations in the near field area has been used to produce a geodetic model of the rupture that began the event. It was over 1,500 km long and 150 km wide. A striking feature is the abrupt southern termination of the coral uplift, possibly due to a seafloor structural discontinuity."
https://openalex.org/W2001461251,"With only a few exceptions that are well understood, conventional superconductivity does not coexist with long-range magnetic order (for example, ref. 1). Unconventional superconductivity, on the other hand, develops near a phase boundary separating magnetically ordered and magnetically disordered phases2,3. A maximum in the superconducting transition temperature Tc develops where this boundary extrapolates to zero Kelvin, suggesting that fluctuations associated with this magnetic quantum-critical point are essential for unconventional superconductivity4,5. Invariably, though, unconventional superconductivity masks the magnetic phase boundary when T < Tc, preventing proof of a magnetic quantum-critical point5. Here we report specific-heat measurements of the pressure-tuned unconventional superconductor CeRhIn5 in which we find a line of quantum–phase transitions induced inside the superconducting state by an applied magnetic field. This quantum-critical line separates a phase of coexisting antiferromagnetism and superconductivity from a purely unconventional superconducting phase, and terminates at a quantum tetracritical point where the magnetic field completely suppresses superconductivity. The T → 0 K magnetic field–pressure phase diagram of CeRhIn5 is well described with a theoretical model6,7 developed to explain field-induced magnetism in the high-Tc copper oxides, but in which a clear delineation of quantum–phase boundaries has not been possible. These experiments establish a common relationship among hidden magnetism, quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity in copper oxides and heavy-electron systems such as CeRhIn5."

https://openalex.org/W2014161666,Immunity to a plethora of microbes depends on a diverse repertoire of naïve lymphocytes and the production of long-lived memory cells. We present evidence here that low clonal abundance in a polyclonal repertoire favors the survival and activation of naïve CD4 + T cells as well as the survival of their memory cell progeny. The inverse relation between clonal frequency and survival suggests that intraclonal competition could help maintain an optimally diverse repertoire of T cells and an optimal environment for the generation of long-lived memory cells.

Human β-defensins (hBDs), epithelial-derived antimicrobial peptides are critical components of host-defense at mucosal surfaces. The role of H. pylori-mediated NF-κB and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation on β-defensin expression was investigated. Transient transfection studies utilizing β-defensin promoter constructs were conducted in gastric cells with contribution of individual signaling events evaluated by the addition of specific inhibitors, small interference nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) RNA or plasmids encoding Vaccinia virus proteins that interrupt interleukin-1 and Toll-like receptor signaling. The role of individual MAPK pathways was further delineated in HEK-293 cells expressing conditional MAPK mutants. We found hBD2 expression exclusively dependent on the presence of the bacterial cag pathogenicity island, with NOD1 a critical host sensor. Impairment of murineβ-defensin 4 (an orthologue of hBD2) expression in NOD1-deficient mice 7-days post-infection further confirmed the role of this cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptor in eliciting host innate immunity. In contrast to hBD2, hBD3 expression was NOD1-independent but EGFR and ERK pathway-dependent. Importantly, Toll-like receptor signaling was not implicated in H. pylori-mediated hBD2 and hBD3 gene expression. The divergent signaling events governing hBD2 and hBD3 expression suggest temporal functional variation, such that hBD2 may contribute to antimicrobial barrier function during the inflammatory phase with hBD3 playing a greater role during the repair, wound healing phase of infection.

The major hallmark of H. pylori infection is its successful colonization in >50% of the world's population and its ability to persist for decades in infected individuals with the majority remaining asymptomatic.

The bacterium is known to attach and activate key gastric epithelial cell signaling pathways that lead to phenotypic and genotypic changes, including modulation of host innate immunity, proliferation, and apoptosis (13Covacci A.

To date studies investigating H. pylori-mediated host innate defense have focused on the regulation of IL-8, a potent neutrophil-chemoattractant, implicated in tissue injury and severity of disease (16Crabtree J.E.

Pattern recognition receptors are known to play a crucial role in host innate and adaptive immune responses to microbial pathogens and their products (21Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Immunol.

Interestingly, evidence to date suggests a minimal role for H. pylori LPS in NF-κB activation and chemokine gene expression in gastric epithelia (28Smith Jr., M.F. Mitchell A. Li G. Ding S.

Sherman P.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3496-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The known low biological activity of H. pylori LPS combined with variation in signaling components of the TLR4 pathway in different epithelial cell lines leaves the data at present inconclusive. In contrast, evidence for the effect of H. pylori LPS in NF-κB activation in monocytic cells is convincing (30Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Datta S. Chattopadhyay S. Basu J. Kundu M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The exact contribution of epithelial TLR2 and TLR5 in H. pylori detection remains ambiguous as HEK293 cells show bacterial-mediated IL-8 expression in the absence of TLR2, and H. pylori flagellin is known to elicit minimal IL-8 activation (31Gewirtz A.T. Yu Y. Krishna U.S. Israel D.A. Lyons S.L. Peek Jr., R.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 1914-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). NOD1 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) protein, a cytosolic Pattern recognition receptor has recently been implicated in innate detection of H. pylori peptidoglycan moieties. Studies by Viala and colleagues (32Viala J. Chaput C. Boneca I.G. Cardona A. Girardin S.E. Moran A.P. Athman R. Memet S. Huerre M.R. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Sansonetti P.J. Labigne A. Bertin J. Philpott D.J. Ferrero R.L. Nat.

There is increasing evidence that human β-defensins (hBDs), a family of endogenous antimicrobial peptides secreted at epithelial mucosal surfaces are critical components of host defense (33Boman H.G.

Importantly, we found hBD2 and -3 to be potent bactericidal agents against H. pylori (39George J.T. Boughan P.K. Karageorgiou H. Bajaj-Elliott M. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Hamanaka Y. Nakashima M. Wada A. Ito M. Kurazono H. Hojo H. Nakahara Y. Kohno S. Hirayama T. Sekine I. Gut. 2001; 49: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The increased expression and high microbicidal activity of hBDs against the bacterium led us to hypothesize that dynamic modulation of host epithelial antimicrobial responses by bacterial virulence factors may be a critical determinant of bacterial adherence and subsequent pathology in a susceptible individual. In the present study we explored the role of the H. pylori type IV secretion system and the effect of virulence factors CagA and VacA on the hBD2 and -3 gene expression. Further, the contribution of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in β-defensin regulation was investigated. We found hBD2 gene expression required the presence of cagPAI and was NOD1-dependent. In contrast, hBD3 expression was NOD1-independent but relied on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated ERK activation. The diverse nature of cellular events regulating hBD2 and -3 suggests distinct temporal functions for the two antimicrobials during infection. Cell Lines—AGS gastric cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).

Strains used were 60190 (ATCC 49503), 84-183 (ATCC 53726), and Tx30a (ATCC 51932). Isogenic vacA and cagE mutants of strains 60190 and 84-183 have been described previously (42Bebb J.R. Letley D.P.

HR1 and HM3 cells were stimulated with 100 nm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT, Sigma). ΔRaf-1:ER* and ΔMEKK3:ER* consist of the isolated kinase domains c-Raf1 and MEKK3, respectively, fused in-frame to a modified form of the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (hbER*) that can be de-repressed by 4-HT but not β-estradiol. Activation of ΔRaf-1:ER* leads to the selective activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, whereas activation of ΔMEKK3:ER* leads to the strong activation of the JNK and p38 pathways and a weaker activation of ERK1/2. Inhibitor Studies—AGS cells were pre-treated with specific inhibitors (Calbiochem) or neutralizing EGFR antibody (10 μg/ml, Autogen Bioclear, Wilts, UK) for 30–60 min prior to and during bacterial or IL-1β stimulation.

Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). 21-Nucleotide NOD1 (AF113925) coding sequences were selected, and the primer sets flanked with appropriate restriction sites were: NOD1 Oligo 1, forward: 5′-GGAACTTCTGGTCACTCACATA-3′; Oligo 1, reverse: 5′-AGCTTATGTGAGTGACCAGAAGTTCC-3′; Oligo 2, forward: 5′-AGCTTATGTGAGTGACCAGAAGTTCCCUTTTTTG-3′; Oligo 2, reverse: 5′-AATTCAAAAAGGGAACTTCTGGTCACTCACATA-3′. The second primer set allowed inclusion of five Ts for polymerase III transcription termination. Authenticity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A second strategy targeting endogenous NOD1 was carried out using siPort NeoFXP™ and 50 nm commercially available double-stranded RNA (Ambion Europe Ltd., Huntingdon, UK) for 48 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Defensin promoters were then transfected as described below. Reporter Gene Assays—AGS (2 × 104) cells were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected 24 h later with expression vectors A46R and A52R (60 ng/well), NOD1 siRNA-encoding plasmid (100 ng/well) and hBD2 or hBD3 promoter constructs (60 ng/well) with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). In all cases, 20 ng/well Renilla plasmid (Promega) was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency, and the amount of total DNA transfected was kept constant with the addition of pcDNA3.1 (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). After 24 h cells were exposed to bacterial strains for 8 h and reporter gene activity was quantified (LUCY1 luminometer, Anthos Labtech Instruments, Austria). All experiments were conducted three times and performed in triplicate. Luciferase activities were plotted as -fold induction compared with activity measured in unstimulated control cells. Western Blotting—All primary and secondary antibodies utilized in the present study were from Cell Signaling Technology (Hitchin, UK), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Autogen Bioclear, Wilts, UK), or Gentaur Molecular Products (Brussels, Belgium). Equipment and reagents were from Amersham Biosciences, St Albans, UK. Bacterially infected cell extracts were routinely subjected to 7–10% SDS-PAGE followed by semi-dry transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked (5% milk/Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6) for 2 h prior to overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibody (1:1,000 or 1:10,000 dilution for phospho-tyrosine). After appropriate washes (Tris-buffered saline/Tween) incubation in secondary antibody (1:2,000) was performed for 1 h prior to detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. Blots were stripped for 20 min and re-probed with anti-β-actin, EGFR, or corresponding non-phospho-specific MAPK antibody to confirm equal protein loading. Cell lysates and supernatants were quantified by Bio-Rad protein (Bradford) assay, and a total of 150 μg of total protein was subjected to 16% Tris-Tricine PAGE for the detection of hBD2 and -3 as detailed previously (48Zilbauer M.

Seven days after the first infection, mice were sacrificed, stomachs were harvested, and total RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed for mBD2, mBD4, MIP2, and β-actin mRNA expression using sequence-specific PCR primers and SYBR green I (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer sequences were as follows: β-actin forward: 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′; β-Actin reverse: 5′-CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT-3′; mBD2 forward: 5′-AAAGTATTGGATACGAAGCAGAACTTG-3′; mBD2 reverse: 5′-GGAGGACAAATGGCTCTGACA-3′; mBD4 forward: 5′-AACATGCATGACCAATGGAG-3′; mBD4 reverse: 5′-TCATCTTGCTGGTTCTTCATCT-3′; MIP-2 forward: 5′-AGTGAACTGGCTGTCAATGC-3′; and MIP-2 reverse: 5′-CCGCCTTGAGAGTGGCTAT-3′. Quantification of mRNA was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector using SYBRgreen (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Results were normalized to β-actin expression. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as means ± S.E. of three experiments each performed in triplicate.

To elucidate the role of bacterial virulence factors involved in β-defensin gene regulation, H. pylori isogenic vacA, cagA, cagE mutants of strains 60190 and 84-183, and strain Tx30a that possesses a non-vacuolating s2/m2 VacA and lacks the cag PAI, were employed. AGS cells were transfected with hBD2 or hBD3 promoter constructs for 24 h prior to bacterial or cytokine stimulation. The results of representative transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 1. A significant (p ≤ 0.02) increase in hBD2 promoter activity was observed during infection with H. pylori strains 60190 and 84-183 (Fig. 1A). Infections in the presence of isogenic cagA and vacA mutant strains showed activation of the hBD2 promoter to a similar extent as that observed for the wild-type strains. In contrast, cagE mutant and strain Tx30a failed to elicit an hBD2 response. Analysis of hBD3 promoter activity in response to a range of bacterial strains revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the presence of H. pylori strains 60190 and 84-183 and the isogenic vacA and cagA mutant strains (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, a modest increase in hBD3 promoter activity over control was observed for cagE mutant and strain Tx30a; however, this increase did not reach statistical significance. NF-κB Is Involved in the Regulation of hBD2 but Not hBD3 Gene Expression—Gastric epithelial cells respond to H. pylori infection by activating multiple signal transduction cascades. Activation of NF-κB transcription factor by H. pylori is well established, especially in the regulation of the innate immune gene, IL-8 (30Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Datta S. Chattopadhyay S. Basu J.

Prior to investigating the potential role of NF-κB in β-defensin gene regulation, we first confirmed the activation of NF-κB in our co-culture infection model by following the degradation of its inhibitor IκBα in the presence of two cytotoxic H. pylori strains. Detectable levels of IκBα were present in control unstimulated AGS cells (Fig. 2A). Exposure to H. pylori strain 60190 resulted in rapid (15–30 min) IκBα degradation with protein levels returning to that of control by 60 min. Similar results were obtained using H. pylori strain 84-183 (data not shown). To our knowledge this is the first rep"

To define the role of NP-1 in the biological functions of VEGF, we developed a specific peptide antagonist of VEGF binding to NP-1 based on the NP-1 binding site located in the exon 7- and 8-encoded VEGF-A165 domain. The bicyclic peptide, EG3287, potently (Ki 1.2μm) and effectively (>95% inhibition at 100 μm) inhibited VEGF-A165 binding to porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing NP-1 (PAE/NP-1) and breast carcinoma cells expressing only NP-1 receptors for VEGF-A, but had no effect on binding to PAE/KDR or PAE/Flt-1. Molecular dynamics calculations, a nuclear magnetic resonance structure of EG3287, and determination of stability in media, indicated that it constitutes a stable subdomain very similar to the corresponding region of native VEGF-A165. The C terminus encoded by exon 8 and the three-dimensional structure were both critical for EG3287 inhibition of NP-1 binding, whereas modifications at the N terminus had little effect. Although EG3287 had no direct effect on VEGF-A165 binding to KDR receptors, it inhibited cross-linking of VEGF-A165 to KDR in human umbilical vein endothelial cells co-expressing NP-1, and inhibited stimulation of KDR and PLC-γ tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of ERKs1/2 and prostanoid production. These findings characterize the first specific antagonist of VEGF-A165 binding to NP-1 and demonstrate that NP-1 is essential for optimum KDR activation and intracellular signaling. The results also identify a key role for the C-terminal exon 8 domain in VEGF-A165 binding to NP-1.

Overexpression of NP-1 in mice results in increased capillary formation, vasodilatation, and malformation of the heart (34Kitsukawa T. Shimono A. Kawakami A. Kondoh H. Fujisawa H.

Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of both NP-1 and NP-2 causes a more severe failure of embryonic vascularization resulting in death at E8.5 (36Takashima S. Kitakaze M. Asakura M. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Tashiro F. Niwa H.

Despite the strong evidence that NP-1 is essential for normal vascular development, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure, and the role of NP-1 in the biological functions of VEGF-A are not fully understood.We recently reported that a specific bicyclic peptide based on the C-terminal NP binding domain of VEGF-A165 (37Soker S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) is an antagonist of VEGF binding to NP-1 and inhibits the anti-chemorepulsive effect of VEGF-A165 in DRG neuronal explants (38Cheng L.

Here, we have identified the key features of EG3287 responsible for its antagonistic properties through a detailed structure-function analysis, and investigated its biological effects in vascular endothelial cells. Our findings show that the C-terminal six amino acid domain encoded by exon 8 plays a crucial role in VEGF-A165 binding to NP-1. Evaluation of EG3287 in endothelial cells demonstrates that VEGF-A165 binding to NP-1 is required for stable binding to KDR, full activation of KDR and downstream signaling and biological responses. This antagonist should be a valuable tool for probing the biological role of NP-1 in diverse cell types, and will also be useful for designing improved neuropilin antagonists.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis—Amino acids were purchased from Calbiochem Novabiochem, Alexis (both Nottingham, UK) or Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Linear, monocyclic, and bicyclic peptides based on residues 111–165 in VEGF-A165 were synthesized by Fmoc solid-phase synthesis using either Wang or Rink amide linkers. Side chain protections were: Arg(Pbf), Asn(Trt), Asp(OtBu), Cys(Trt), Cys(Acm), Gln-(Trt), Glu(OtBu), Lys(Boc), Ser(tBu), Thr(tBu), and Tyr(tBu); additional linear peptides (peptides 12–19) were synthesized by Pepceuticals Ltd; additional bicyclic peptides (peptides 3–8) were synthesized by Bachem (UK) Ltd.Linear peptides were synthesized by an automated multiple solid phase approach using the Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-p-alkoxybenzyl alcohol resin (0.59 mmol/g loading) or Fmoc-Rink Amide MBHA resin (0.59 mmol/g or 0.68 mmol/g loading). Amino acids were attached by Fmoc strategy on a 25- or 50-μmol scale with a basis coupling time of 30 min followed by a recoupling step. Each amino acid was sequentially coupled to the growing peptide chain from the C to the N termini applying benzotriazol-1-yloxy-Tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluoro-phosphate and N-methyl morpholine as coupling reagents via the active ester method. Removal of the N-Fmoc protecting group was carried out with 20% piperidine in DMF followed by sequential washes with DMF and DCM. The coupling reagent, Pybop, NMM, and all amino acid derivatives were dissolved in DMF (0.7 m, 4-fold excess). All solvents used were of HPLC grade quality.The peptides were cleaved from the resin with simultaneous deprotection using 90% trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature for 3 h, either in the presence of 5% thioanisole, 2.5% water, and 2.5% ethanedithiol or with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% water, and 2.5% triisopropylsilane. The cleavage mixture was filtered and precipitated in ice-cold methyl tert-butyl ether. The remaining resin was washed once with the cleavage reagent, filtered, and combined with the previous fractions. The precipitates were collected after centrifugation, washed three times with ice-cold methyl tert-butyl ether, and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. The crude peptides were dissolved in 15% aqueous acetic acid and lyophilized for 2 days (40 °C, 6 mbar).General Method for Bicyclic Peptide Synthesis—The crude linear precursor, prepared as above, was dissolved in the minimum trifluoroacetic acid and diluted to 2 liter/0.25 mmol with water. The first disulfide bridge was formed between unprotected Cys residues using K3Fe(CN)6. The peptide solution was adjusted to pH 7.5 with aqueous ammonium hydroxide. To this solution, 0.01 m K3Fe(CN)6 was added dropwise to excess, until a slight yellow color remained. The completion of the reaction was confirmed by HPLC sampling after acidification. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 4 using 50% aqueous acetic acid. The crude reaction mixture was stirred with Bio-Rex 70 weak cation-exchange resin (Bio-Rad) overnight and packed into a glass column. After thorough washing with water, the peptide was eluted using 50% aqueous acetic acid and detected by TLC using ninhydrin. Ninhydrin-positive fractions were pooled and lyophilized. Crude material was purified via reverse-phase HPLC (Gilson) using a preparative C-8 column (see conditions for linear peptides). The purified fractions were collected, combined, and lyophilized. The second disulfide bridge was formed via I2-oxidation between Cys(Acm) protected residues. A solution of the peptide (5 mg/ml) in 10% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid was mixed vigorously with 8 equivalents of iodine, and the resulting suspension stirred for 1.5 h.The progress of the cyclization reactions was monitored by analytical reverse-phase LC-MS. At completion of the reaction the excess iodine was quenched using 1 m ascorbic acid. The reaction mixture was diluted ×2 with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water, filtered through a 0.45-μm disposable filter and purified directly via preparative reverse-phase HPLC (Gilson) using a preparative C-8 column (see conditions for linear peptides). The relevant fractions were collected, evaporated, lyophilized, and stored at 4 °C. Confirmation of the structure was performed by analytical reverse-phase LC-MS and/or MALDI mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis.Alternative Cleavage Procedure for Bicyclic Peptides—The peptides were cleaved from the resin with simultaneous deprotection using 82.5% trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature for 3 h in the presence of 5% thioanisole, 5% water, 2.5% ethanedithiol, and 6% (w/v) phenol. In the case of Cys-containing peptides, the cleavage mixture was filtered and precipitated in ice-cold diethyl ether. The remaining resin was washed once with trifluoroacetic acid, filtered, and combined with the previous fractions. The precipitates were stored at 4°C overnight and were collected by filtration, washed with ice-cold diethyl ether, and allowed to dry at room temperature. For non-Cys-containing peptides the cleavage mixture was filtered, the resin washed with trifluoroacetic acid then dichloromethane, and the filtrates combined and concentrated under vacuum to oil. The peptide was precipitated in ice-cold diethyl ether, collected by filtration and allowed to dry at room temperature. The crude peptides were dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile/water and lyophilized overnight (-50 °C, 6 mbar). Crude peptides were characterized by reverse-phase HPLC (Gilson) using an analytical C-18 column (Vydac 218TP54, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, and 300 Å pore size) and a linear AB gradient of 0–100% for B over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, where eluent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid /water and eluent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% CH3CN/water. Mass was confirmed using MALDI-MS, and Ellman's color test confirmed the presence of free sulfhydryl groups where applicable.NMR Spectroscopy and Three-dimensional Structure Determination— For NMR studies, 15 mg of EG3287 (Ser138-Arg165, VEGF-A165) was prepared in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, with the resulting solution at pH 2.3. NMR spectra were acquired at 293 K and 298 K on a Varian INOVA spectrometer (operating at nominal 1H frequency of 600 MHz) equipped with triple resonance probe including Z-axis pulse field gradients. All two-dimensional data were recorded in phase-sensitive mode using the States-TPPI method for quadrature detection, and data were apodized using shifted cosine-bell squared functions, followed by zero-filling once in each dimension. Water suppression was achieved using WATERGATE (39Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific resonance assignments were obtained from two-dimensional 1H TOCSY (80-ms mixing time), 1H NOESY (100-ms mixing time), [1H,15N] HSQC, and [1H,13C] HSQC spectra (at natural isotopic abundance). All spectra were processed using NMRpipe/NMRDraw (40Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11388) Google Scholar) and analyzed using ANSIG for openGL v1.0.3 (41Kraulis J. Clore G.M. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G. Knowles J. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to DSS, using absolute frequency ratios (42Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were derived from two-dimensional 1H NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 250 ms. Cross-peaks were grouped into four categories according to their relative peak intensities: strong, medium, weak, and very weak, and were designated with interproton distance restraint bounds of 1.8–2.5 Å, 1.8–3.0 Å, 1.8–3.5 Å, and 1.8–4.5 Å, respectively. 0.5 Å was added for distances that involved methyl groups. The structure calculations were carried out using the PARALLHDGv5.1 parameter, with the PROLSQ non-bonded energy function (43Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) within the CNS program (44Wakefield R.I. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). 229 interproton distance restraints (138 intraresidue, 56 sequential, 9 short range, 17 long range, and 9 ambiguous) were applied in restrained molecular dynamics simulated-annealing calculations.Measurement of EG3287 Stability—EG3287 was recovered from tissue culture medium by a 1:1 addition of 20% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifugation of the precipitate. This method resulted in ∼90% recovery. Quantitation of EG3287 was performed by Inpharmatica Ltd (Cambridge, UK) using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay on a Micromass Quattro Micro.Computational Chemistry—Molecules were analyzed using SYBYL® 7.0 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The Biopolymer tools in Sybyl were used to build some of the peptides, check structures for errors, correct atom types, and add/remove hydrogens as necessary. For energy minimizations or molecular dynamics simulations we used starting conformations as described by Fairbrother et al. (46Fairbrother W.J. Champe M.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. Starovasnik M.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (VEGF-A55, Protein Data Bank code: 2vgh, Ala111-Arg155, VEGF-A165) or EG3287 VEGF-A55 (Protein Data Bank code: 1KMX, Ser138-Arg155 VEGF-A165). The terminal amino acids and polar side chains were charged, and the peptides were solvated in a box of water molecules (Tripos explicit box solvation algorithm). Electrostatic charges were calculated with the method of Gasteiger and Marsili (47Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3228Crossref Scopus (3545) Google Scholar). Structures were minimized using the Tripos force field with a steepest descent gradient of 100 iterations followed by a conjugate gradient of 0.01 kcal/mol or a maximum of 10,000K iterations as termination criteria. During minimizations, a 12-Å non-bonded cut-off was applied, and when solvent was not present and ionic strength was set to 4.00.For molecular dynamics simulations, all starting structures were solvated in a cubic box of explicit water molecules (edge 40 Å) using the XFIT solvation algorithm. This led to approximately ∼1700 water molecules depending on the solute starting conformation. All simulations were performed using periodic boundary conditions and the SHAKE algorithm. Constant temperature simulations (NTV, 300°K) were run at a time step of 0.1 ps for a total period of 2000 ps. The Lennard-Jones interactions were evaluated with an 8.0-Å cutoff value. The non-bonded pair list was updated every 100 steps. Generated structures were stored in trajectory files every 5 ps, providing 400 conformers for each run. The collected structural data were analyzed with the graphic tools of the SYBYL® 7.0. All calculations were performed on the dual Hewlett-Packard work station XW6000, 2 × 2.8 GHz CPUs running REDHAT Enterprise Linux WS4.Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from TCS CellWorks (Buckingham, UK) and cultured in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin-8. Porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing NP-1 (PAE/NP-1) (16Laitinen M. Zachary I. Breier G. Pakkanen T. Hakkinen T. Luoma J. Abedi H. Risau W. Soma M. Laakso M. Martin J.F. Yla Herttuala S. Hum.

MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells (gift of Professor Mike O'Hare) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS.Radiolabeled Ligand Binding—Confluent cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. At 4 °C various concentrations of peptides diluted in binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm HEPES pH 7.3 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) were added, followed by addition of the indicated concentration of 125I-VEGF-A165 (1200–1800 Ci/mmol, GE Healthcare Plc) or 125I-EGF. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C (or the indicated time at 37 °C), the medium was aspirated, and washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed with 0.25 m NaOH, 0.5% SDS solution, and the bound radioactivity of the lysates was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled VEGF-A165 or EGF (R & D Systems). Equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki) for peptides were calculated from IC50 values and the Kd of VEGF-A165 for NP-1 (0.3 nm) from Soker et al. (24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar), using the formula Ki = IC50/1 + ([125I-VEGF-A165]/Kd).Cross-linking—Confluent cells were bound with 125I-VEGF-A165 at 4 °C for 2 h as described above and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The bound 125I-VEGF-A165 was cross-linked to the cells by incubation with 1.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (64 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and scraped off the plates. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, cross-linked 125I-VEGF-A165-receptor complexes were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film.Immunoblotting—Cells were pretreated with peptides for 15 min followed by treatment with growth factors for 10 min, and cells were immediately extracted by lysis buffer (64 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin).

To help define the DNA repair role of BRCA2, we expressed and purified a polypeptide, BRC3/4-DBD, that harbors its BRC3 and BRC4 repeats and DNA binding domain. BRC3/4-DBD interacted with hRad51 and bound DNA with a distinct preference for single-stranded (ss) DNA. Importantly we demonstrated by biochemical means and electron microscopy that BRC3/4-DBD nucleates hRad51 onto ssDNA and acts as a recombination mediator in enabling hRad51 to utilize replication protein A-coated ssDNA as recombination substrate. These functions of BRC3/4-DBD required both the BRC repeats and the BRCA2 DNA binding domain. The results thus clarify the role of BRCA2 in Rad51-dependent DNA recombination and repair, and the experimental strategies described herein should be valuable for systematically deciphering this BRCA2 function.

A failure in HR leads to cancer formation (1Jasin M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2D'Andrea A.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which aptly underscores the importance of delineating the mechanism of the HR machinery. HR is best understood in the context of DNA double strand break repair wherein the break is processed nucleolytically to yield ssDNA, which serves as the nucleation site for the Rad51 recombinase. Polymerization of Rad51 onto the ssDNA results in a helical protein filament called the presynaptic filament. The presynaptic filament harbors a binding site for duplex DNA and provides the catalytic center for the search of homology in the duplex and the formation of a joint between the ssDNA and duplex substrates. Assembly of the presynaptic filament is slow, rendering it prone to interference by the single strand binding factor RPA. In addition, the timely delivery of Rad51 to the single-stranded recombination substrate is complicated by a high affinity of this recombinase for duplex DNA. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several HR factors, termed recombination mediators, act to promote the assembly of the Rad51 presynaptic filament (3Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In addition, the carboxyl terminus of BRCA2 contains a distinct Rad51 binding domain, and phosphorylation of this domain by cyclin-dependent kinases appears to modulate the interaction with Rad51 (11Esashi F. Christ N. Gannon J. Liu Y. Hunt T. Jasin M. West S.C. Nature. 2005; 434: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and biochemical characterization of mouse Brca2 has revealed a DNA binding domain that comprises three oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) folds (12Yang H. Jeffrey P.D.

Science. 2002; 297: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that BRCA2 functions as a recombination mediator. First, as noted above, BRCA2 interacts with Rad51 (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Second, BRCA2-deficient cells fail to assemble DNA damage-induced nuclear Rad51 foci, reflective of a failure to deliver Rad51 to recombination substrates (13Davies A.A. Masson J.Y. McIlwraith M.J.

Third, the Ustilago maydis Brh2 protein, which harbors a single Rad51-binding BRC repeat and a DNA binding activity, enables Rad51 to utilize RPA-coated ssDNA for recombination (16Yang H. Li Q. Fan J. Holloman W.K. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2005; : 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Due to its enormous size (3,418 amino acid residues), it has not been possible to obtain full-length human BRCA2 for testing its physical and functional interactions with Rad51. To circumvent this limitation, we constructed a polypeptide that harbors the BRCA2 DNA binding domain and two of the BRC repeats, BRC3 and BRC4. This BRCA2-derived polypeptide, BRC3/4-DBD, bound hRad51 and ssDNA and, importantly, was capable of delivering hRad51 to ssDNA and allowing hRad51 to utilize hRPA-coated ssDNA for the catalysis of recombination. Thus, these results provide direct evidence that BRCA2 targets hRad51 to recombination substrates and possesses recombination mediator activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidsBRC3/4-DBD harbors the human BRCA2 BRC repeats 3 and 4 (residues 1409–1596) and the DNA binding domain (DBD) (residues 2477–3194). To facilitate the purification of this BRCA2 polypeptide, an amino-terminal S tag (17Kim J.-S. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag were attached to it. The tagged BRC3/4-DBD polypeptide was introduced into the pET-32b vector (Novagen) that has been deleted for the amino-terminal His6 tag. The Escherichia coli GST-BRC3/4 (residues 1409–1596) expression plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Wen-Hwa Lee (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the purification of BRC3/4-DBD, E. coli cell paste (120 g from 48 liters of culture) was suspended in 600 ml of cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, and the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 3 μg/ml each, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then passed through a French press once at 20,000 p.s.i. The BRC3/4-DBD polypeptide is mostly soluble, and after centrifugation (at 100,000 × g for 90 min), the clarified lysate containing this polypeptide was gently mixed with 8 ml of nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for 5 h. The nickel beads were collected into a glass column with an internal diameter of 1.5 cm and washed with 150 ml of buffer K (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 m KCl and 0.01% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) followed by a 50-ml wash with buffer K containing 100 mm KCl and 15 mm imidazole. The nickel affinity column was then developed with an 80-ml gradient of 30–300 mm imidazole in K buffer containing 100 mm KCl with BRC3/4-DBD eluting at ∼150 mm imidazole. Fractions (4 ml each) containing the peak of BRC3/4-DBD were pooled (total of 20 ml) and loaded onto a 1-ml Macro hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column, which was eluted with 20 ml of 50–300 mm KH2PO4 in K buffer, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. BRC3/4-DBD eluted from the hydroxyapatite column at ∼180 mm KH2PO4, and the pool of BRC3/4-DBD (16 ml) was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 0.21 g/ml. The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 0.5 ml of K buffer containing 100 mm KCl, and then mixed gently with 0.5 ml of anti-S-agarose beads (Novagen) to bind BRC3/4-DBD. The anti-S affinity matrix was poured into a glass column with an internal diameter of 0.5 cm and washed with 10 ml of buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) followed by 10 ml of buffer K containing 1 m KCl. BRC3/4-DBD was released from the affinity matrix by three 10-min elutions at 23 °C with 1 ml of buffer K containing 3 m MgCl2 and 0.5 m KCl each time. The eluate, containing a total of 100 μg of BRC3/4-DBD, was dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer K containing 500 mm KCl, concentrated in a Centricon-30 device (Millipore) to 0.5 mg/ml, and stored in small portions at –80 °C.For the purification of GST-BRC3/4, extract was made from 10 g of E. coli cell paste as described above except that the cell breakage buffer (50 ml) contained 200 mm KCl. The lysate obtained after ultracentrifugation was passed through a 20-ml Q fast flow column and then mixed with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4 beads for 2 h. The beads were poured into a glass column with an internal diameter of 1 cm, washed with 20 ml of buffer K containing 500 mm KCl, and treated with 10 ml of 20 mm glutathione (Amersham Biosciences), collecting 1-ml fractions. The fractions containing the peak of GST-BRC3/4 (4 ml total) were loaded onto a 1-ml Macro hydroxyapatite column, which was developed with a 20-ml gradient of 50–320 mm KH2PO4 in buffer K. GST-BRC3/4 eluted from the hydroxyapatite column at 85–175 mm KH2PO4, and the peak of GST-BRC3/4 (4.5 ml total containing 1.5 mg of GST-BRC3/4) was concentrated in an Amicon Ultra microconcentrator (Millipore) to 3 mg/ml and stored in small portions at –80 °C. The purification of the DBD will be described elsewhere. 4L. Krejci, J. Etchin, J. San Filippo, M. G. Sehorn and P. Sung, manuscript in preparation. Purification of hRad51, hRad51 K133R, and hRPA—The hRad51 protein was expressed in the E. coli RecA-deficient strain BLR (DE3) and purified to near homogeneity using our previously described procedure (18Sigurdsson S.

After washing the beads twice with 100 μl of the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The experiment in Fig. 3C was done in the same manner with GST (15 μg), GST-BRC3/4 (5 μg), hRad51 (4 μg), and RecA (4 μg) using glutathione-Sepharose beads as the affinity matrix for protein pull-down (Amersham Biosciences). The supernatant, wash, and SDS eluate, 10 μl each, were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.For the experiment in Fig. 3B, we coupled hRad51 and BSA to Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad) to create matrices containing 3 mg/ml Rad51 and 12 mg/ml BSA. To examine complex formation, GST-BRC3/4, DBD, and BRC3/4-DBD (8 μg each) were mixed with 6 μl of Affi beads conjugated to Rad51 or Affi beads conjugated to BSA beads in 30 μlof buffer B at 4 °C for 60 min. The beads were washed twice with 100 μlof the same buffer before eluting the bound proteins with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The supernatant, wash, and SDS eluate, 10 μl each, were analyzed as above.DNA SubstratesThe oligonucleotides used are listed in Table 1. For DNA binding assays, the 80-mer Oligo 1 was labeled at the 5′-end with [α-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. To make the 80-bp duplex, the radiolabeled Oligo 1 was hybridized to its exact complement, Oligo 2. For the homologous DNA pairing reactions, 150-mer Oligo 3 was used as ss substrate, and the duplex substrate was prepared by hybridizing complementary 40-mer Oligo 4 (32P-labeled at the 5′-end) and Oligo 5. To prepare magnetic beads containing ssDNA, biotinylated (dT)83 (7.5 μg) was mixed with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Roche Applied Science) in 200 μl of buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA) for 4 h at 25 °C. The beads were washed twice with 400 μl of buffer C containing 1 m NaCl and stored in buffer C at 4 °C. The 60-bp dsDNA used as Rad51 trap in the magnetic bead pull-down assay (Fig. 5) consisted of Oligo 6 hybridized to Oligo 7. DNA hybridization was carried out by heating pairs of complementary oligonucleotides at 75 °C for 10 min in buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl) followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. All the DNA substrates were purified from 10% polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, with 0.5 mm EDTA) and eluted from gel slices by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into the same buffer.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligo 15′-TTATATCCTTTACTTTGAATTCTATGTTTAACCTTTTACTTATTTTGTATTAGCCGGATCCTTATTTCAATTATGTTCAT-3′Oligo 25′-ATGAACATAATTGAAATAAGGATCCGGCTAATACAAAATAAGTAAAAGGTTAAACATAGAATTCAAAGTAAAGGATATAA-3′Oligo 35′-TCTTATTTATGTCTCTTTTATTTCATTTCCTATATTTATTCCTATTATGTTTTATTCATTTACTTATTCTTTATGTTCATTTT TTATATCCTTTACTTTATTTTCTCTGTTTATTCATTTACTTATTTTGTATTATCCTTATCTTATTTA-3′Oligo 45′-TAATACAAAATAAGTAAATGAATAAACAGAGAAAATAAAG-3′Oligo 55′-CTTTATTTTCTCTGTTTATTCATTTACTTATTTTGTATTA-3′Oligo 65′-TGTCTCTTTTATTTCATTTCGTTTTATTCACTATATTTTTTATTTCTATTTTACTTATTT-3′Oligo 75′-AAATTAAGTAAAATAGAAATAAAAAATATAGTGAATAAAACGAAATGAAATAAAGAGACA-3′ Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5BRC3/4-DBD targets hRad51 to ssDNA. A, schematic of the assay. Magnetic bead-bound oligo(dT) was incubated with hRad51, BSA, and BRCA2-derived polypeptides, without or with an excess of dsDNA, as indicated. Proteins bound to the oligo(dT) were captured with a magnet and then eluted with SDS. B, the supernatants (super) and SDS eluates (beads) were analyzed for their protein and DNA contents. Although the majority of hRad51 was trapped on the dsDNA as expected (lane 3), BRC3/4-DBD efficiently targeted hRad51 to the ssDNA (lanes 4 and 5). GST-BRC3/4 (BRC3/4) or DBD was ineffective in this regard (lanes 6 and 7, respectively). C, the bead-bound fractions (from lanes 1, 3, and 5 in B) were examined for hRad51-mediated ATP hydrolysis. D, Rad51-mediated ATP hydrolysis was assayed in the presence of ssDNA and with or without BRC3/4-DBD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DNA Binding AssayBRC3/4-DBD (20–500 nm) was incubated with 30 nm ssDNA or dsDNA or the combination of the two substrates in 10 μl of buffer R (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml BSA) containing 60 mm KCl at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixtures were resolved in 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer at 4 °C. The gels were dried and then subjected to phosphorimaging analysis for data quantification.Targeting of hRad51 to Magnetic Bead-bound Biotinylated ssDNA by BRC3/4-DBDhRad51 (2.7 μm) was incubated with the indicated amounts of GST-BRC3/4, DBD, or BRC3/4-DBD in 18 μl of buffer R with 0.1 mm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C and then mixed with (dT)83-containing magnetic beads (12 μm in nucleotides) and 60-mer dsDNA trap (72 μm base pairs) for 10 min at 37 °C; the final volume of the reaction mixtures was 20 μl. The beads were captured with the Magnetic Particle Separator (Roche Applied Science), and the supernatants were set aside for further analysis. After washing the beads twice with 20 μl of buffer T (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.01% Igepal CA-630, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1 mm MgCl2, bound proteins were eluted from half of the beads with 10 μlof2%SDS. The various supernatants and SDS eluates (5 μl each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining to determine their content of proteins and also by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining to quantify the amount of dsDNA.ATPase AssayFor the experiment in Fig. 5C, the remaining half of the beads (Fig. 5B) were resuspended in 6 μl of buffer R containing 60 mm KCl and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) followed by incubation at 37 °C. For the experiment in Fig. 5D, hRad51 (2.7 μm) was incubated with the indicated amounts of BRC3/4-DBD in 10 μl of buffer R that contained 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) and (dT)83 (12 μm nucleotides) bound on magnetic beads at 37 °C. At the indicated times, 1 μl of the reaction mixtures was withdrawn and added to 1 μl of 500 mm EDTA to stop the reaction. The level of ATP hydrolysis was determined by thin layer chromatography in polyethyleneimine sheets (J. T. Baker Inc.).Homologous DNA Pairing AssayThe reaction mixtures were assembled in buffer R that contained 1 mm ATP and had a final volume of 12.5 μl. Unless stated otherwise, all the reaction steps were carried out at 37 °C. In the standard homologous DNA pairing reaction, the 150-mer Oligo 3 (6 μm nucleotides) was incubated with hRad51 (2 μm) with or without the indicated concentration of BRC3/4-DBD for 5 min followed by the addition of 32P-labeled homologous dsDNA (6 μm base pairs) and 4 mm spermidine hydrochloride. After 30 min of incubation, the reactions were mixed with an equal volume of 1% SDS containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K. Following a 10-min incubation, samples were run in 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer at 4 °C. The gels were dried and analyzed in a PhosphorImager. For evaluating the recombination mediator function of the various BRCA2-derived polypeptides, the ssDNA was preincubated with hRPA (600 nm) or SSB (4 μm) for 5 min; all the subsequent steps were as described above. The reactions with RecA were done in buffer R that contained 5 mm MgCl2 but were otherwise assembled and processed in the same manner.Electron MicroscopyReaction mixtures were assembled with combinations of hRad51 K133R (2 μm), hRPA (600 nm), BRC3/4-DBD (200 nm), and the 150-mer ssDNA (6 μm nucleotides) as described for the homologous DNA pairing reactions except that BSA was omitted from the reaction buffer. After a 10-min incubation, the reactions were diluted 6 times with the reaction buffer, and a 3-μl portion was applied to 400-mesh grids coated with fresh carbon film that had been glow-discharged in air. Samples were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 15 s and examined with a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament and operated at 120 keV in conjunction with a GATAN 794 charge-coupled device camera at a nominal magnification of ×15,000.RESULTSExpression and Purification of hBRCA2-derived Polypeptides—Human BRCA2 harbors eight BRC repeats in its middle portion and, as deduced from studies with mouse Brca2, a DBD toward the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A) (12Yang H. Jeffrey P.D. Miller J. Kinnucan E. Sun Y. Thoma N.H. Zheng N. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Due to its uncommonly large size, we have not yet been able to purify full-length BRCA2. However, because several BRCA2-like molecules from organisms such as U. maydis and Caenorhabditis elegans are much smaller in size and contain only a single BRC (20Lo T. Pellegrini L. Venkitaraman A.R. Blundell T.L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 1015-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we reasoned that a BRCA2 polypeptide harboring the DBD and some of the BRC repeats may be capable of physical and functional interactions with hRad51. We therefore constructed a BRCA2 polypeptide, BRC3/4-DBD (Fig. 1B), that comprises BRC3 and BRC4, both of which bind hRad51 very strongly (9Wong A.K. Pero R. Ormonde P.A. Tavtigian S.V. Bartel P.L.

We added S and His6 tags to BRC3/4-DBD to allow the use of anti-S antibody-agarose and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as affinity steps during protein purification.FIGURE 1Purification of BRC3/4-DBD. A, schematic outlining the functional domains in BRCA2. The DBD consists of a helical domain (HD) and three oligonucleotide binding (OB1, OB2, and OB3) folds that confer the ability to interact with DSS1 and ssDNA. In addition to the BRC repeats, the carboxyl terminus possesses a distinct Rad51 binding domain. B, the human BRCA2-derived polypeptide BRC3/4-DBD harbors two of the BRC repeats (BRC3 and BRC4 within residues 1409–1596) linked to the DBD (residues 2477–3194). BRC3/4-DBD contains thioredoxin (Trx) and S tags at its amino terminus and a His6 tag at its carboxyl terminus. C, schematic of the chromatographic procedure devised for BRC3/4-DBD purification. D, purified BRC3/4-DBD was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (2 μg in lane 2) or immunoblotting with anti-histidine antibodies (200 ng in lane 3).

The identity of purified BRC3/4-DBD was established by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the His6 affinity tag on the polypeptide (Fig. 1D) and by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 1E). Four independent preparations of BRC3/4-DBD gave very similar results in all the assays performed. For the functional characterization of BRC3/4-DBD, we obtained E. coli RecA and SSB from Michael Cox and also purified to near homogeneity hRad51, the hRad51 K133R variant, and the heterotrimeric ssDNA binding factor hRPA using our published procedures (18Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8798-8806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As controls in the biochemical analyses, we also expressed and purified to near homogeneity a GST fusion protein that contains the BRC3 and BRC4 repeats (GST-BRC3/4) and also a His6-tagged form of the DBD. The SDS-PAGE analysis of the aforementioned proteins can be found in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Analysis of proteins by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Lane 2, hRad51; lane 3, hRad51 K133R; lane 4, RecA; lane 5, GST-BRC3/4; lane 6, BRCA2-DBD; lane 7, hRPA (RPA70, RPA34, and RPA14 subunits); lane 8, SSB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Association of BRC3/4-DBD with Rad51—We used in vitro pull-down assays to test whether BRC3/4-DBD binds hRad51. First we incubated purified hRad51, hRad51K133R, or RecA with BRC3/4-DBD and then captured the resulting protein complexes on anti-S antibody-agarose beads through the S tag on BRC3/4-DBD. Fig. 3A shows that BRC3/4-DBD bound both hRad51 and hRad51 K133R but was unable to associate with RecA. We next used Affi-Gel beads containing cross-linked hRad51 to confirm protein complex formation and to ascertain the role of the BRC repeats. As shown in Fig. 3B, although BRC3/4-DBD and GST-BRC3/4 were retained on the Affi-hRad51 beads as anticipated, DBD was not. In control experiments (Fig. 3B), none of the BRCA2-derived polypeptides were retained on Affi beads containing BSA. When we performed pull-down through the GST tag on GST-BRC3/4 using glutathione-Sepharose, we saw complex formation with hRad51 but not with RecA (Fig. 3C). From these results, we conclude that BRC3/4-DBD associates with hRad51 and hRad51 K133R in a specific manner through the BRC repeats.DNA Binding by BRC3/4-DBD—To determine whether BRC3/4-DBD has DNA binding capability, increasing amounts of the purified polypeptide were incubated with either 32P-labeled 80-mer ssDNA or 80-bp duplex. The reaction mixtures were resolved in polyacrylamide gels followed by phosphorimaging analysis to reveal shifting of the DNA species by BRC3/4-DBD. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, BRC3/4-DBD bound both DNA forms but with a distinct preference for the ssDNA species. Consistent with these results, when we incubated BRC3/4-DBD w"

We isolated a multicopy suppressor that alleviated RseP and DegS requirement. The suppressor encodes a novel small RNA, RseX. Its activity required the RNA-binding protein Hfq. We used the property that small RNAs are often involved in RNA-RNA interactions to capture RseX putative partners; ompA and ompC mRNA, which encode two major outer membrane proteins, were identified. RseX activity was shown to confer an Hfq-dependent coordinate OmpA and OmpC down-regulation. Because RseP is shown to be no longer essential in a strain lacking OmpA and OmpC, we conclude that RseP, which is required for normal σE activation, prevents toxicity due to the presence of two specific outer membrane proteins that are down-regulated by RseX.

These factors often activate gene transcription and regulate different processes such as spore formation in bacteria or cell differentiation and lipid biosynthesis in eukaryotes. RseP is an integral membrane protein with a zinc metalloprotease active site motif and an ortholog of the eukaryotic S2P protease involved in RIP (18Dartigalongue C. Loferer H. Raina S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5908-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Kanehara K. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 281: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As such, the release of σE from the membrane-associated protein RseA by the successive activity of DegS and RseP is an example of the RIP process.Fine tuning of bacterial gene expression is often performed by small noncoding RNA, frequently called sRNA (23Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 303-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Biocomputing based analysis suggested that E. coli have about a hundred of them (24Wassarman K.M. Repoila F.

The sRNAs contribute to many processes including transcriptional and translation regulation, DNA replication, and even protein degradation and translocation (23Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 303-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). A remarkable example of their role in gene expression is given by their regulation of rpoS, which encodes σS, itself a regulator of stationary phase-induced genes (27Repoila F. Majdalani N. Gottesman S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). rpoS is regulated post-transcriptionally by at least three sRNAs. Two of them (DsrA and RprA) stimulate RpoS translation, whereas the other (OxyS) represses RpoS translation. Each of these sRNAs is transcribed in response to specific stress conditions, allowing adaptation to changing environments. Recent observations also reveal that expression of outer membrane proteins (Omps) is also under the control of several sRNAs (28Andersen J. Delihas N. Ikenaka K. Green P.J. Pines O. Ilercil O. Inouye M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2089-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Chen S. Zhang A. Blyn L.B. Storz G. J.

The suppression mechanism requires the RNA-binding protein Hfq. Using RseX as bait, two of its targets, ompA and ompC mRNA were captured. RseX overproduction results in reduced amounts of ompA and ompC mRNA and corresponding outer membrane proteins. The absence of both OmpA and OmpC itself allows survival to RseP depletion independently of RseX. Our results show that the sRNA RseX allows survival in the absence of the RIP protease RseP by preventing ompA and ompC expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, Oligonucleotides, and Culture Conditions—The E. coli strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this work are described in supplemental Tables S1–S3, respectively.P1 vir-mediated transduction was carried out as described (31Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). We previously reported the construction and use of an E. coli genomic DNA library (32Bohn C. Bouloc P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6072-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosomal rseX gene was deleted (see supplementary tables) by targeted gene substitution using a combination of two published protocols (33Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G.

The rseX deletion was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Excision of antibiotic-resistant cassettes flanked by flippase recognition targets from several strains (36Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mol. Syst. Biol. February 21, 2006; 10.1038/msb.4100050Google Scholar) were removed using pCP20 (34Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10970) Google Scholar).Cells were grown in NZ broth or on solid NZ containing 15 mg ml–1 agar (37Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). When necessary, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin, 20 μg ml–1 chloramphenicol, 30 μgml–1 kanamycin, and 10 μgml–1 tetracycline. Expression from the PLtetO-1 promoter was obtained by the addition of 1 μm anhydrotetracycline (aTc), and from the Plac/ara-1 promoter it was obtained by the addition of 1 mm IPTG and 0.2% l-arabinose.Molecular Biology and Protein Techniques—The β-galactosidase assay was described previously (31Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar, 35Bohn C. Collier J. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with the modification that cultures were grown in NZ broth. Plasmid preparations, DNA cloning and ligation, PCR amplification, and DNA transformation were carried out according to standard protocols (37Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) or to manufacturer instructions. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI310 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Histidine-tagged Hfq was purified from strain PhB3247 (containing pTE607) as described (38Folichon M. Arluison V. Pellegrini O. Huntzinger E. Regnier P. Hajnsdorf E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7302-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Outer membrane protein analyses were performed as follows. MG1655Z1 overnight cultures were diluted 500-fold and grown at 37 °C in medium with or without aTc, as indicated. The bacteria were harvested (at A600 of about 0.2 and 1.5) by centrifugation at 4 °C and concentrated to a growth equivalent of A600 100. Pellets washed once in 10 ml Tris-HCl (50 mm) EDTA (5 mm) buffer, pH 8.0 (TE), and suspended in 2.5 ml of TE were lysed by lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and by sonication. Unlysed bacteria and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatants were then ultracentrifuged at 70,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellets were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 2 ml of Tris-HCl (50 mm), pH 8, MgCl2 (25 mm), Triton X-100 (1%). Solubilized proteins and Triton X-100-insoluble materials were then separated by ultracentrifugation as above. 10 μl of outer membrane proteins (in pellet) were run on 12% SDS-PAGE containing 8 m urea. The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The band intensities were quantified by integrating corresponding signals obtained from four gel scans using GelScan 1.2 software (developed by Dr. Yvan Zivanovic). The intensity of each lane was normalized to an observed invariant band. Samples containing pZE11-RSEX were compared from cultures growing in the presence or absence of RseX inducer (aTc). The reported differences of OmpA and OmpC signals between the two conditions are possibly underestimated because other invariant proteins might compose the signal.RNA Techniques—5′ RACE mapping was previously described (25Argaman L.

Dunny G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7794-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed as described (37Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar, 40Collier J. Bohn C. Bouloc P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54193-54201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), except that membrane prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 65 °C, and for identification of RseX RNA, the samples were electro-phoresed under denaturing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. Primers used for PCR α32P-labeled products used are described (supplemental Table S3).Gel mobility shift assays were performed in as follows: 5′ end-labeled RseX (0.05 pmol) were incubated with increasing amounts of Hfq, unlabeled RseX, yeast tRNA, or ompA mRNA in 10 μl of RNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 100 ng/μl tRNA) at 30 °C for 20 min. RNAs were obtained by T7 RNA polymerase-driven transcription (using MEGAshortscript kit; Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) performed on PCR products having the rseX or truncated ompA mRNA genes under control of the T7 promoter (for primers, see supplemental Table S3). The binding reactions were mixed with 2.5 μl of native loading dye and resolved on native PAGEs (8 or 10%) at 4 °C.RESULTSSelection of rseX, a Multicopy Suppressor of RseP Depletion—The rseP gene is an essential gene in E. coli (18Dartigalongue C. Loferer H. Raina S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5908-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Kanehara K. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 281: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To understand the reason for RseP essentiality, we selected for multicopy suppressors permitting survival of RseP-depleted strains. We previously reported the construction of a strain with a deletion of chromosomally encoded rseP and carrying an ectopic copy of rseP under the control of a PLtetO-1 (PhB2387) promoter (35Bohn C. Collier J. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this strain, viability depended upon rseP expression obtained by the addition of a gratuitous inducer (aTc) to the media. This strain was transformed with a confirmed E. coli genomic DNA library (32Bohn C. Bouloc P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6072-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 200 clones that grew in the absence of RseP expression were isolated among ∼106 transformants. Analysis of 12 of these multicopy suppressors showed that the selected plasmids carried inserts from the 4- or 44-min (min) region of the E. coli chromosome (4 and 8 clones, respectively). Inserts from the 4-min region contained rseP and were not further analyzed. Using a similar selection, Akiyama and co-workers (14Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) selected plasmids encoding σE, allowing them to demonstrate that RseP is involved in RseA degradation. None of the 12 plasmids that we characterized encoded σE. Subcloning of inserts from the 44-min region led to a plasmid containing solely a 170-bp insert (pRSEX), which was sufficient to permit survival to an RseP depletion. Presence of pRSEX in the wild-type strain allowed the establishment of an rseP disruption mutant by P1-vir-mediated transduction (supplemental Table S1), whereas no clones were obtained in the corresponding strain having the control plasmid; the selected plasmid thus compensated for the complete absence of RseP.The cloned insert was a DNA fragment corresponding to the yedR-yedS intergenic region. yedR gene encodes a putative integral membrane protein, and yedS encodes a putative homolog of OmpS1, an outer membrane protein from Salmonella typhi (41Fernandez-Mora M. Oropeza R. Puente J.L. Calva E. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); we will refer to YedS as OmpS1. The cloned insert did not encode any putative open reading frame, and we therefore considered, as we will show later, that suppression could be due to activity of a small RNA. The putative corresponding gene and sRNA were named rseX and RseX for RNA suppressor of extracytoplasmic stress protease, respectively.Identification of RseX sRNA—The existence of more than 200 putative sRNA genes in the E. coli genome was predicted using a bioinformatics approach (42Chen S. Lesnik E.A. Hall T.A. Sampath R. Griffey R.H. Ecker D.J. Blyn L.B. Biosystems. 2002; 65: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Among them, it was proposed that the yedR-ompS1 (yedS) intergenic region expresses IS096, a 122-nucleotide sRNA, although authors failed to detect any transcript by Northern blot hybridization probing for IS096 and thus had no proof of its existence. We did detect an RseX-specific transcript of about 100 nucleotides by Northern blot analysis in a strain containing pRSEX (Fig. 1). RACE mapping of RseX in a strain containing pRSEX showed that the 5′ end initiates likely at base pair 2031671 on the E. coli genetic map (supplementary Table S4). Because the RACE was more efficient after a tobacco acid pyrophosphatase treatment, we concluded that the observed amplified fragment originates from an RNA having its transcriptional promoter rather than an RNA issued from an endonucleolytic cleavage. A putative σ70 promoter for this initiation point was detected as well as a strong putative rho-independent terminator (finishing at position 2031761 on the E. coli genetic map). This observation shows that the length of RseX is of 91 nucleotides, with no apparent open reading frame. Regulatory sRNAs are characterized by the presence of stable secondary structures; indeed, a stem loop in the 5′ extremity of RseX is predicted (Fig. 1) by mfold software (43Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10084) Google Scholar). Thus far, the RseX sequence is conserved among enterobacteria closely related to E. coli.Expression of RseX was placed under transcriptional control of the PLtetO-1 promoter on multicopy plasmid (pZE11-RSEX). When transformed in a strain having the TetR repressor, expression of RseX was conditional upon the addition of aTc (see Fig. 5A). In this strain, the ΔrseP allele was introduced in the presence of aTc, and the strain remained viable as long as the inducer was present, showing that rseX transcription is necessary for the suppression phenotype (data not shown).FIGURE 5RseX prevents ompA and ompC expression. A, multicopy RseX affects the amount of ompA and ompC mRNA. Autoradiogram of a Northern blot analysis, probed for ompA or ompC mRNAs as indicated is shown. Below the ompA and ompC lanes, an SsrA-specific probe is hybridized to each membrane and is presented as control for normalization. Isogenic derivative strains derived from MG1655Z1 with the indicated genotype were grown in rich medium to A600 0.3. RNA extraction, Northern blotting, and quantification of hybridization signals were done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, RseX leads to decreased amounts of OmpA and OmpC. The outer membrane protein extracts from strains (derived from MG1655Z1) at A600 0.2 with the indicated genotypes were separated on PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Similar results were obtained with cells harvested at A600 1.5 (data not shown). C, RNA structure 4.2 software (56Mathews D.H. Disney M.D. Childs J.L. Schroeder S.J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl.

The 5′-GAGG-3′ Shine-Dalgarno sequences are indicated in bold. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RseX Activity Is Hfq-dependent—Hfq, initially identified as required for the replication of Qβ phage RNA in E. coli, is an abundant pleiotropic regulator that controls expression of many proteins by affecting mRNA translation, stability, or polyadenylation (reviewed in Ref. 44Valentin-Hansen P. Eriksen M. Udesen C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Its inactivation results in a wide variety of phenotypes caused by the loss of its RNA chaperone activity, which is proposed to facilitate interactions between sRNAs and their targets. Because RseX was putatively an sRNA acting through an RNA/RNA interaction, we hypothesized that RseX suppression of RseP depletion could be Hfq-dependent. To test this, we used a strain (PhB2364) in which RseP expression was conditionally dependent on the presence of inducers (arabinose/IPTG) (35Bohn C. Collier J. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As described above, the presence of pRSEX permitted growth of this strain in the absence of inducers. However, introduction of an hfq deletion in this strain prevented its growth in the absence of arabinose/IPTG (Fig. 2A). This hfq-dependent phenotype was not due to a polar effect of the deletion, because it was complemented by an Hfq encoding plasmid (pTX381). The suggested putative binding activity of Hfq with respect to RseX was tested in vitro by gel mobility shift assays. Migration of a constant amount of labeled synthetic RseX mRNA was determined in the presence of increasing amounts of purified histidine-tagged Hfq, using physiological pH and salt concentrations and a large excess of tRNA from yeast to reduce nonspecific RNA binding to Hfq. RseX Hfq-dependent mobility retardation was observed, showing that Hfq binds to RseX (Fig. 2B). Binding between RseX and Hfq is specific, because an 8000-fold molar excess of total tRNA displaced only a minor fraction of RseX from a preformed RseX·Hfq complex, whereas a 20-fold excess of cold RseX released labeled RseX from the complex (Fig. 2, C and D).FIGURE 2The RseX Hfq-dependent phenotype is mediated via RseX/Hfq interactions. A, 5-μl spots on NZ plates (with and without IPTG/arabinose as indicated) of 10-fold serial dilutions (from left to right) of overnight cultures grown in NZ supplemented with IPTG and arabinose (Ara). The strains are derivatives of PhB2364 (attHK022 [Plac/ara-1::rseP] ΔrseP), containing pRSEX as indicated. The plasmid pRSEX is a suppressor that allows growth of PhB2364 in the absence of inducer. However, introduction of the hfq deletion prevents the pRSEX suppressive effect. The phenotype observed in the hfq mutant is reversed by pTX381 encoding Hfq. B, autoradiogram of a native gel retardation assay using purified labeled RseX (RseX*) with increasing amounts of purified His-tagged Hfq. The observed interaction between RseX and Hfq (RseX*-Hfq) is specific because the interaction between RseX and Hfq is not affected by the presence of large amounts of unlabeled total yeast tRNA (C), and it is displaced by the addition of small amount of unlabeled RseX (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We concluded that Hfq binds to RseX and is required for its suppressive activity on ΔrseP. This observation suggested that the activity of RseX occurred through an RNA/RNA interaction.Multicopy rseX Is a Suppressor of ΔdegS but Not of the Absence of σE—The viability of a strain containing the degS gene solely under control of the Plac promoter depends on the presence of IPTG in the medium (17Alba B.M. Zhong H.J. Pelayo J.C. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because inactivation of RseA suppresses a ΔdegS mutation, it was concluded that DegS is essential because it contributes to the release of σE by degrading RseA (17Alba B.M. Zhong H.J. Pelayo J.C. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When transformed by a plasmid containing rseX, growth of the ΔdegS strain became IPTG-independent (Fig. 3A), suggesting that a high level of RseX can bypass the need for DegS. To confirm this result, we used a strain in which RseX was conditionally expressed upon the addition of aTc (pZE11-RSEX). The ΔdegS arg::Tn5 allele was introduced in these strains in the presence of inducer (supplemental Table S1); removal of inducer was deleterious to strain growth (data not shown). We concluded that accumulation of RseX, in addition to its suppressive effect on rseP, was also a suppressor of degS.FIGURE 3RseX is a suppressor of DegS depletion that does not restoreσE activity. A, 5-μl spots on NZ plates (with and without IPTG as indicated) of 10-fold serial dilutions (from left to right) of overnight cultures grown in NZ supplemented with IPTG. The strains are CAG43190 derivatives (having degS under the control of the PLlacO-1 promoter) containing either pZE11-RSEX or pZE11-MCS1 (indicator + or –, respectively). Multicopy RseX permits survival of DegS-depleted strains. The experiment performed in a different parental background (using MC1061 derivatives [CAG43187]) gave the same result (data not shown), showing that the presence of multicopy RseX permits survival to DegS depletion.

Surface delivery of membrane carrying newly synthesized TNFα is controlled and limited by the level of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23. Many functions in immune cells are coordinated from lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, and we investigated a possible role for lipid rafts in TNFα trafficking and secretion. TNFα surface delivery and secretion were found to be cholesterol-dependent. Upon macrophage activation, syntaxin 4 was recruited to cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts, whereas its regulatory protein, Munc18c, was excluded from the rafts. Syntaxin 4 in activated macrophages localized to discrete cholesterol-dependent puncta on the plasma membrane, particularly on filopodia. Imaging the early stages of TNFα surface distribution revealed these puncta to be the initial points of TNFα delivery. During the early stages of phagocytosis, syntaxin 4 was recruited to the phagocytic cup in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Insertion of VAMP3-positive recycling endosome membrane is required for efficient ingestion of a pathogen. Without this recruitment of syntaxin 4, it is not incorporated into the plasma membrane, and phagocytosis is greatly reduced.

Chem. 1998; 273: 974-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This ensures the rapid and abundant synthesis of the 26-kDa transmembrane form of TNFα, which initially accumulates in the Golgi complex (5Shurety W. Merino-Trigo A. Brown D. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and is then trafficked to the cell surface for proteolytic cleavage by the TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) (6Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that TNFα is transported from the trans-Golgi network to the recycling endosome and is then delivered to the cell surface via fusion of the recycling endosome membrane at the site of the phagocytic cup formation (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Murray R.Z. Wylie F.G. Khromykh T. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10478-10483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Two distinct steps of membrane fusion are therefore required during the post-Golgi transport of TNFα. Membrane fusion of TNFα transport vesicles is mediated by members of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein family (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Murray R.Z. Wylie F.G. Khromykh T. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10478-10483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cognate pairing of an R-SNARE (generally on the vesicle) and a Q-SNARE complex (generally on the target membrane) is necessary at each trafficking step for specificity in vesicle docking and membrane fusion (9Hong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 120-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 10Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). A variety of SNARE proteins is expressed in macrophages. The trans-Golgi Q-SNARE complex of syntaxin 6/syntaxin 7/Vti1b pairs with VAMP3 on the recycling endosome in the first step of post-Golgi transport of TNFα. Next the VAMP3 pairs with the cell surface Q-SNARE complex of syntaxin 4/SNAP-23 for TNFα delivery to the cell surface (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Murray R.Z. Wylie F.G. Khromykh T. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Biol.

Syntaxin 4, syntaxin 6, Vti1b, SNAP-23, and VAMP3 are up-regulated during LPS activation to accommodate the increased trafficking during TNFα secretion (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G.

During phagocytosis, the Q-SNARE syntaxin 4 concentrates at the phagocytic cup to mediate fusion of the recycling endosome, providing excess membrane for microorganism engulfment and rapidly delivering TNFα to the cell surface for secretion (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts, specific membrane microdomains that are enriched in sterols and sphingolipids, play a number of important roles in immune cells; for instance, they contribute to B cell receptor signaling and antigen uptake (12Cheng P.C.

In macrophages, phagosomes are enriched in raft proteins (19Garin J. Diez R. Kieffer S. Dermine J.F. Duclos S. Gagnon E. Sadoul R. Rondeau C. Desjardins M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 20Gatfield J. Pieters J. Science. 2000; 288: 1647-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 21Li N. Mak A. Richards D.P. Naber C. Keller B.O. Li L. Shaw A.R. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 536-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In other cell types lipid rafts have been shown to organize and regulate SNARE proteins (22Gaus K. Rodriguez M. Ruberu K.R. Gelissen I. Sloane T.M. Kritharides L. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1526-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Salaun C. James D.J. Chamberlain L.H. Traffic. 2004; 5: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We thus investigated a possible role for lipid rafts in SNARE-mediated delivery of TNFα to the cell surface. We show here that an inducible association of syntaxin 4 with lipid rafts and a cholesterol-rich membrane environment at specific exit sites are required for TNFα secretion. Antibodies and Reagents—Rabbit polyclonal and rat monoclonal antimouse TNFα antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem and Auspep (Victoria, Australia), respectively. Anti-SNAP-23 and VAMP2 antibodies were purchased from Synaptic Systems (Goettingen, Germany); anti-Gαi-3 antibodies were purchased from DuPont, and antibodies specific for flotillin and syntaxin 6 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibodies specific for TACE were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and anti-VAMP3 antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Alexa-488 or Alexa-647 conjugated to phalloidin to label F-actin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and filipin III was purchased from Sigma. Anti-actin antibody was a gift from Peter Gunning (Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia), and antibodies specific for syntaxin 4 and Munc18c were the kind gifts from David James (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia). Candida albicans was kindly provided by Robert Ashman (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). Cell Culture, Activation, and Cholesterol Depletion—RAW264.7 murine macrophages were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% serum supreme and 1% l-glutamine as described previously (24Shurety W. Pagan J.K. Prins J.B. Stow J.L. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were activated with 100 ng/ml LPS (Salmonella minnesota Re 595, Sigma) in the presence or absence of TACE inhibitor (BB-3103, British Biotech Pharmaceuticals). For cholesterol depletion, cells were incubated for 15-30 min in 7.5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (Sigma) in serum-free RPMI 1640. Phagocytosis—In some experiments macrophages were primed for 18 h in the presence of 500 pg/ml IFNγ (R & D Systems) prior to their incubation with live C. albicans at a ratio of 10:1 (yeast:macrophage) for 10-40 min as described previously (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Sucrose Density Gradient Separation—Sucrose density gradient separation of membrane extracts was performed according to published protocols (25Morrow I.C. Rea S. Martin S. Prior I.A. Prohaska R. Hancock J.F. James D.E. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48834-48841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were lysed by 20 passages through a 27-gauge needle in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing either 0.2 or 1% Triton X-100, and the lysate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was loaded onto a 45 to 5% discontinuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 200,000 × g in a TLS-55 rotor at 4 °C for 18 h. Eleven fractions (150 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient, plus an additional fraction of 600 μl representing the load fraction. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (5Shurety W. Merino-Trigo A. Brown D. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Staining—Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (5Shurety W. Merino-Trigo A. Brown D. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In some experiments cells grown on coverslips were partially air-dried, and the apical membranes were removed by application (30 s) and removal of damp filter paper (Millipore) (26Wylie F. Heimann K. Le T.L. Brown D. Rabnott G. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C497-C506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining adherent plasma membrane and cell fragments were fixed and immunostained. Cholesterol in cell membranes was stained using 250 μg/ml filipin III in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus Provis AX70 microscope equipped with a 100× oil objective and MTI digital camera and NIH Image software. Confocal microscopy was performed using an LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss Microscope Systems). Three-dimensional reconstructions were generated using LSM 510 META software. Assays for TNFα Trafficking and Secretion—The trafficking of TNFα from the Golgi complex to the cell surface was measured as described previously using an immunofluorescence-based assay (11Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine levels of secreted TNFα, a commercial enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay kit (OptEIA, BD Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. SNARE Recruitment to Lipid Rafts—Cholesterol-rich membrane domains and their associated proteins, typically insoluble in nonionic detergents, can be isolated by flotation on sucrose density gradients (27Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Macrophage membranes extracted with 1% Triton X-100 were investigated by sucrose density gradient separation and immunoblotting to analyze the distribution of SNARE proteins involved in TNFα secretion (Fig. 1, A and B). Cholesterol-rich lipid raft domains (fractions 5-8) were characterized by the enrichment of known raft marker proteins flotillin (25Morrow I.C. Rea S. Martin S. Prior I.A. Prohaska R. Hancock J.F. James D.E. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48834-48841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 28Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and the heterotrimeric Gαi-3 subunit (29Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The cell surface Q-SNARE protein SNAP-23 distributed throughout both raft and nonraft fractions, although its Q-SNARE partner syntaxin 4 was recovered almost entirely in nonraft fractions (Fig. 1A). Munc18c, a protein known to bind and regulate syntaxin 4 (30Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), also partitioned in nonraft fractions (Fig. 1A). The trans-Golgi Q-SNARE syntaxin 6 (8Murray R.Z. Wylie F.G. Khromykh T. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10478-10483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) segregated into nonraft fractions, although the R-SNAREs VAMP2 and VAMP3 were detected in discrete fractions from both raft and nonraft fractions (Fig. 1A). LPS activation of macrophages induces increased expression of syntaxin 4 (11Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and initiates a 4-fold recruitment of syntaxin 4 to raft domains, resulting in over 40% of cellular syntaxin 4 now being concentrated in lipid rafts (Fig. 1, B and C). The distributions of other proteins analyzed were unchanged after LPS activation (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, the differential distributions of the Q-SNARE components SNAP-23 and syntaxin 4 in lipid raft domains and the LPS-induced recruitment of syntaxin 4 to rafts may represent a mechanism for modulating vesiclemediated delivery to the cell surface during TNFα secretion. Syntaxin 4 Localizes to Cholesterol-dependent Puncta with LPS Activation—We next examined the distribution of syntaxin 4 on the plasma membrane by immunostaining. Because SNARE proteins are typically on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, staining was performed on patches of ripped open cells exposing the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (26Wylie F. Heimann K. Le T.L. Brown D. Rabnott G. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C497-C506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Staining of F-actin provided orientation for identifying and viewing cell patches. Prior to macrophage activation, syntaxin 4 was localized to distinct puncta (∼0.5-1 μm diameter) randomly distributed on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). Upon macrophage activation, syntaxin 4-stained puncta on the main cell body increased in size (∼1-2 μm), whereas smaller syntaxin 4 puncta (less than 500 nm) also appeared de novo on filopodia (Fig. 2B). Treatment of cells with MβCD depletes cholesterol from cell membranes disrupting cholesterol-dependent lipid raft domains (31Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion with MβCD resulted in a significant loss of syntaxin 4 puncta from the cell body in activated cells and a complete loss of small syntaxin 4 puncta on filopodia (Fig. 2C). Disruption of cholesterol with MβCD in LPS-activated macrophages also resulted in depletion of syntaxin 4, and the raft markers flotillin and Gαi-3 from sucrose density gradient fractions corresponding to lipid rafts (Fig. 2D). Thus, syntaxin 4, the SNARE responsible for TNFα surface delivery, is found in cholesterol-dependent clusters corresponding to lipid rafts at the plasma membrane. The increased number and size of syntaxin 4 clusters on activated cells is consistent with LPS-induced recruitment of syntaxin 4 to lipid rafts. Surface Delivery of TNFα Is Cholesterol-dependent—Treatment of LPS-activated macrophages with MβCD revealed that secretion of TNFα, but not its synthesis, is cholesterol-dependent. Secretion of soluble TNFα, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was greatly reduced (>60%) after cholesterol depletion in activated cells (Fig. 3A). This reduction in surface delivery of TNFα was confirmed by using an immunofluorescence-based assay that measures the transport of newly synthesized TNFα from the Golgi complex to the cell surface (11Pagan J.K. Wylie F.G. Joseph S. Widberg C. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Stow J.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). TNFα is labeled on the surface of LPS-activated macrophages (Fig. 3B), although depletion of cholesterol effectively blocks this surface delivery of TNFα (Fig. 3B). LPS signaling through the CD14-MD2-TLR4 complex occurs in lipid rafts, and pretreatment of monocytes with MβCD has been shown to inhibit TNFα secretion (33Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. Triantafilou K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways are reportedly initiated (34Cuschieri J. Surgery. 2004; 136: 169-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, TNFα staining is present at the level of the Golgi complex, suggesting TNFα surface delivery rather than its synthesis is disrupted (Fig. 3C). In addition, depletion of cholesterol had no effect on the total levels of TNFα present in LPS-activated cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, disruption of cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts effectively reduced TNFα secretion by blocking its surface delivery, without affecting earlier steps in its synthesis or trafficking. Cholesterol-dependent Syntaxin 4 Puncta Represent the Delivery Sites for TNFα—Additional sucrose density experiments were performed using 0.2% Triton X-100 (35Chamberlain L.H. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49750-49754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), producing a cleaner separation of the raft maker flotillin and again showing the LPS-induced recruitment of syntaxin 4 to lipid rafts (Fig. 4A). Activation of macrophages induced the synthesis of full-length TNFα, which accumulates in the presence of TACE inhibitor and is partially lipid raft-associated (Fig. 4A). Confocal imaging was used to examine the relationship between syntaxin 4 and newly synthesized TNFα delivery to the cell surface. To capture and stain TNFα at the surface, its proteolytic release was prevented by using a TACE inhibitor, and the external aspect of the cell surface was imaged on intact macrophages shortly after LPS activation. Three-dimensional composite confocal images were enhanced by surface rendering to remove background staining and reveal TNFα surface staining (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions, the earliest appearance of newly synthesized TNFα was observed in discrete patches on the macrophage surface. TNFα patches (Fig. 4B, red labeling) were notably concentrated on filopodia where they colocalized with the syntaxin 4 puncta (Fig. 4B). At later times (1-2 h), TNFα staining becomes more widely spread across the cell surface (data not shown and Fig. 3B), either because of additional delivery sites being recruited or because of retention and spreading of uncleaved TNFα. Thus, these syntaxin 4 patches correspond to the cholesterol-dependent syntaxin 4 puncta labeled on filopodia in ripped open cells and can now be pinpointed as the initial delivery sites for TNFα on the macrophage surface. Interestingly, TACE, the enzyme responsible for cleaving TNFα at the cell surface (6Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar), is totally excluded from lipid raft fractions (36von Tresckow B. Kallen K.J. von Strandmann E.P. Borchmann P. Lange H. Engert A. Hansen H.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4324-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A), suggesting that surface delivery and TNFα cleavage occur in different membrane domains. Cholesterol Dependence of SNARE Accumulation and TNFα Delivery to the Phagocytic Cup—During the phagocytosis of C. albicans, TNFα is delivered to the actin-rich phagocytic cup (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A) where TACE also accumulates (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C). Disruption of cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts inhibited TNFα surface delivery to the phagocytic cup without affecting TNFα synthesis (Fig. 5B). Macrophages were stained for cholesterol using filipin, which revealed the presence of cholesterolrich membrane domains in the phagocytic cups (Fig. 5D). Syntaxin 4 also concentrates in the cups (37Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Bennett M.K. Klip A. Grinstein S. Manolson M.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4377-4383PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A); however, depletion of cholesterol ablated syntaxin 4 staining at the phagocytic cup (Fig. 6A). Likewise, staining of the cognate R-SNARE for TNFα delivery, VAMP3, which is normally enriched at the phagocytic cup (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 38Bajno L. Peng X.R. Schreiber A.D. Moore H.P. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B), is abolished by pretreatment of macrophages with MβCD (Fig. 6B). Thus, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in the phagocytic cup are required for the concentration of SNARE complexes necessary for TNFα delivery at this site.FIGURE 6Cholesterol-dependent localization of SNARE proteins at the phagocytic cup. A, IFNγ-primed macrophages incubated in the presence or absence of MβCD for 30 min prior to incubation with C. albicans were stained for syntaxin 4 and F-actin. Syntaxin 4 localization to the actin-rich phagocytic cup is dependent upon cholesterol. Bar, 10 μm. B, IFNγ-primed macrophages were treated as in A and stained for VAMP3 and F-actin. VAMP3 localization to the actin-rich phagocytic cup is dependent upon cholesterol. C, IFNγ-primed macrophages incubated in the presence or absence of MβCD prior to incubation with C. albicans were stained for F-actin. Macrophages were examined under the microscope for the presence of internalized yeast. Bar chart, with the means ± S.E., shows the percentage of macrophages containing yeast. A minimum of 500 cells was counted per condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cholesterol-rich lipid rafts at the site of phagocytic cup formation are also required for efficient phagocytosis of yeast. Treatment of cells with MβCD reduced the number of macrophages with internalized yeast from 60 to 11% (Fig. 6C), confirming the importance of cholesteroldependent lipid rafts in phagocytosis. This reinforces the dual function of recycling endosome membrane delivery to the phagocytic cup for both cytokine secretion and phagocytosis. Clustering of SNAREs in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts at these sites permits the delivery of this membrane for these innate immune functions. We show here that upon macrophage activation, syntaxin 4, a Q-SNARE responsible for the surface delivery of TNFα, is recruited to discrete cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts on the plasma membrane, predominantly on filopodia, which then become the site of delivery for TNFα. TACE, the enzyme responsible for cleavage of TNFα at the cell surface, is excluded from these raft domains suggesting that TNFα is translocated to other membrane subdomains prior to its cleavage. During the initial stages of phagocytosis, syntaxin 4 recruitment to lipid rafts is concentrated at the phagocytic cup and is crucial for the delivery of the excess membrane required to engulf a microorganism in addition to the rapid delivery and secretion of TNFα. It has been suggested that spatial distribution of SNAREs in the plasma membrane may play a prominent role in regulating exocytosis. In other cell types (35Chamberlain L.H. Gould G.W. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1526-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). SNAREs display different levels of raft association depending on the cell type (23Salaun C. James D.J. Chamberlain L.H. Traffic. 2004; 5: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); however, to date no other cell type has shown the stimulus coupled relocation of SNARE proteins into lipid rafts that we demonstrate occurs with syntaxin 4 in LPS-activated macrophages. The precise role of lipid rafts in SNARE-mediated fusion is currently unclear. The lipid rafts may act as sites for transmembrane pairing and membrane fusion, or they may function in a regulatory fashion by spatially separating the Q-SNARE partners in the membrane until they are required for fusion. Consistent with lipid rafts as fusion sites in PC12 cells (39Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 41Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), neutrophils (43Tuluc F. Meshki J. Kunapuli S.P. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2003; 3: 1775-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), synaptosomes (44Gil C. Soler-Jover A. Blasi J. Aguilera J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and now macrophages, disruption of lipid rafts leads to a decrease in secretion. In contrast, the decreased lipid raft association of SNAP-23/25 increased the secretion of recombinant growth hormone from PC12 cells (45Salaun C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19449-19453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggesting a more regulatory role for lipid rafts in this case. There are of course many other examples of molecules being recruited to lipid rafts in immune cells. The relocation of receptors for antibody complex or antibody in B cells, T cells, mast cells, and basophils to lipid rafts coordinates signaling (46Dykstra M. Cherukuri A. Sohn H.W. Tzeng S-J. Pierce S.K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 457-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The Sec/Munc18 family of SNARE-binding proteins regulates SNARE complex formation, and because in macrophages Munc18c is completely excluded from raft domains, it may function to restrict the movement of syntaxin 4 into lipid rafts for SNARE complex formation (47Grusovin J. Stoichevska V. Gough K.H. Nunan K. Ward C.W. Macaulay S.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 48Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Similar results are seen in mast cells where syntaxin 3/Munc18b complexes were found in nonraft fractions, whereas syntaxin 3-containing SNARE complexes were found within lipid rafts domains (49Pombo I. Rivera J. Blank U. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts may also orchestrate the fate and biological activities of TNFα. TNFα can be retained on cells as an active 26-kDa transmembrane protein at the cell surface, otherwise it is cleaved by the enzyme TACE and released as a soluble 17-kDa cytokine for other roles in immunity (50Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 51Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M.

Zachariades N. Gooding L. Kriegler M. Cell. 1990; 63: 251-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We found TACE in nonraft fractions regardless of the activation state of the macrophages, implying that TNFα must first exit the lipid raft domains in order to be cleaved and released from the membrane, although this remains to be formally shown. Retaining TNFα in lipid rafts could potentially preserve the 26-kDa transmembrane form at the surface, and the release from lipid rafts would allow cleavage and release of the 17-kDa form, thus dictating the physiological functions of TNFα. Upon activation, macrophages assume a highly ruffled cell surface with the extension of exaggerated filopodia (53Williams L.M. Ridley A.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) rich in cholesterol and lipid rafts (54Gaus K. Gratton E. Kable E.P.W. Jones A.S. Gelissen I. Kritharides L. Jessup W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15554-15559Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). We now show syntaxin 4 in resting macrophages localizes to discrete puncta mainly on the cell body similar to the syntaxin 1 cholesterol-dependent puncta found in neuroendocrine cells (41Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and the punctate staining of SNAP-23 on adipocytes (35Chamberlain L.H. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49750-49754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Upon activation, additional cholesterol-dependent syntaxin 4 puncta appear on the surface, particularly on filopodia forming the sites for the initial delivery of TNFα. Larger cholesterol-dependent clusters also emerge on the surface of macrophages after LPS activation, the significance of which is not yet clear. Individual lipid raft microdomains are typically below 50 nm diameter (55Laude A.J. Prior I.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 56Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 141-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and TNFα delivery occurs at the many smaller syntaxin 4-labeled clusters; nevertheless, raft clustering has been demonstrated at sites of T cell receptor stimulation during T cell activation (57Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1999; 283: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The formation of preferential fusion sites on filopodia is important in the context of macrophages where excess membrane is required for the formation of the nascent phagocytic cup (58Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 59Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We have recently shown the delivery of recycling endosome membrane containing TNFα to the nascent phagocytic cup serves to provide extra membranes to engulf a microbe while simultaneously delivering TNFα to surface delivery for rapid secretion (7Murray R.Z. Kay J.G. Sangermani D.G. Stow J.L. Science. 2005; 310: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The relocation of syntaxin 4 to lipid rafts in the phagocytic cup ensures the recycling endosome and its cargo TNFα are delivered to these specific sites. Efficient phagocytosis of particles, such as mycobacteria, opsonized red blood cells, and now yeast, requires cholesterol (20Gatfield J. Pieters J. Science. 2000; 288: 1647-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 60Loike J.D. Shabtai D.Y. Neuhut R. Malitzky S. Lu E. Husemann J. Goldberg I.J. Silverstein S.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our data suggest this reliance on cholesterol is because of the requirement of SNAREs to be associated with lipid rafts for delivery of extra membrane to the phagocytic cup. The family of serum cholesterol-reducing drugs termed statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties, such as reducing inducible nitric-oxide synthase and proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, in macrophages treated with lovastatin (61Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 62Joukhadar C. Klein N. Prinz M. Schrolnberger C. Vukovich T. Wolzt M.

Mitchell D.J. Sobel R.A. Steinman L. Zamvil S.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). However, other reports show that statins can increase the pro-inflammatory response; for example, simvastatin can increase the promoter activity and production of IL-12p40 and TNFα in macrophages (65Matsumoto M. Einhaus D. Gold E.S. Aderem A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7377-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 66Kiener P.A. Davis P.M. Murray J.L. Youssef S. Rankin B.M. Kowala M. Int.

How the requirement of cholesterol for the delivery to the cell surface of cytokines is involved in the statin influence on inflammatory response has yet to be determined. In conclusion, the data presented here show that the delivery of TNFα to the plasma membrane in LPS-activated and phagocytosing macrophages is dependent upon the movement of syntaxin 4 into cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts to be fusion-competent. Our findings are in keeping with the participation of lipid rafts in forming surface delivery and exit sites for cytokine secretion. We thank I. Morrow and S. Martin for expert advice and J. Venturato, T. Khromykh, and D. Brown for technical assistance. Our thanks to all members of the Stow laboratory for useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1967594273,"A novel member of the IκB family, human IκB-ζ, was identified by a differential screening approach of apoptosis-sensitive and -resistant tumor cells. The protein consists of 6 ankyrin repeats at its COOH terminus and shares about 30% identity with other IκB members. IκB-ζ associates with both the p65 and p50 subunit of NF-κB and inhibits the transcriptional activity as well as the DNA binding of the transcription factor. Interestingly, IκB-ζ is localized in the nucleus where it aggregates in matrix-associated deacetylase bodies, indicating that IκB-ζ regulates nuclear NF-κB activity rather than its nuclear translocation from the cytoplasm. IκB-ζ expression itself was regulated by NF-κB, suggesting that its activity is controlled in a negative feedback loop. Unlike classical IκB proteins, IκB-ζ was not degraded upon cell stimulation. Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and lipopolysaccharide induced a strong induction of IκB-ζ transcripts. Expression of IκB-ζ was detected in different tissues including lung, liver, and in leukocytes but not in the brain. Suppression of endogenous IκB-ζ by RNA interference rendered cells more resistant to apoptosis, whereas overexpression of IκB-ζ was sufficient to induce cell death. Our results, therefore, suggest that IκB-ζ functions as an additional regulator of NF-κB activity and, hence, provides another control level for the activation of NF-κB-dependent target genes.

NF-κB is an evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic transcription factor that plays a crucial role in many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis (Refs. 2Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 3Barkett M. Gilmore T.D.

Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). The mammalian NF-κB/Rel family consists of RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 that bind as homo- or heterodimers at κB sites in the DNA of their target genes. This combinatorial diversity contributes to the regulation of a distinct but overlapping set of genes, in that the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different κB sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. In addition, whether the transcription of a target gene is activated or repressed depends on the dimer combination. While RelA/p50, RelA/c-Rel, RelB/p50, and RelB/p52 heterodimers are transcriptional activators, p50/p50 and p52/p52 homodimers generally repress transcription (7Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 8Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S.

Regulation of the great diversity of genes requires a precise control of NF-κB, which is achieved by various mechanisms of posttranslational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. Dysregulation of NF-κB activation results in a wide range of human disorders including inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases (10Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar, 11Grilli M. Memo M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and different types of cancer (4Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 12Gilmore T.D. Koedood M. Piffat K.A. White D.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1367-1378PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB activity is also tightly regulated by interaction with IκB proteins (13Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Characteristic for all IκB proteins is a domain of multiple ankyrin repeats that bind to the conserved Rel homology domain of NF-κB proteins. Various members of the IκB family target different NF-κB complexes, e.g. IκB-α and IκB-β interact preferentially with p65/p50 and c-Rel/p50 heterodimers, whereas IκB-ϵ binds only to p65 and c-Rel hetero- and homodimers (14Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 15Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and Bcl-3 associates exclusively with p50 or p52 homodimers (16Nolan G.P. Fujita T. Bhatia K. Huppi C. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even if different IκB proteins interact with the same NF-κB dimers, the transcription factor can be regulated differentially due to functional differences between the IκB proteins. For instance, upon cell stimulation IκB-α is rapidly degraded, leading to an immediate but transient activation of NF-κB. In contrast, IκB-β persists over a longer time, and its degradation causes a more delayed and sustained activation of the transcription factor (14Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 17Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In most cell types NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound to IκB proteins. A variety of stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 3The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL-1, interleukin-1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SMRT, silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor; HDAC-5, histone deacetylase-5. interleukin-1 (IL-1), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lead to the phosphorylation of IκBs by the IκB kinase complex, which promotes their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). This event exposes a nuclear localization signal of NF-κB leading to its nuclear translocation and activation of target genes. The rapidly resynthesized IκB-α, which itself is an NF-κB target gene, can enter the nucleus, dissociate NF-κB from the DNA, and translocate it back to the cytoplasm, thereby terminating gene transcription (19Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the typical IκB proteins (IκB-α, IκB-β, IκB-ϵ) that are preferentially localized in the cytoplasm and behave exclusively as inhibitors, Bcl-3 is a nuclear protein that preferentially promotes κB-dependent gene transcription. Bcl-3 can cause derepression of transcription by removing p50 and p52 dimers, which are transcriptionally inactive, from κB sites (20Franzoso G. Bours V. Azarenko V. Park S. Tomita-Yamaguchi M. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3893-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Bcl-3 can lead to direct transcriptional activation by forming a ternary complex with DNA through these homodimers (21Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 22Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In a continuous attempt to define molecular mechanisms involved in apoptosis, we performed a suppression subtractive hybridization approach with two HeLa cell lines that differ in their susceptibility to TNF (24Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Jänicke R.U. Lin X.Y. Lee F.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5245-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Among several differentially expressed genes, a cDNA clone was identified encoding a novel IκB protein. In this study, we describe the structural and functional characterization of this protein, termed IκB-ζ. Unlike typical IκB proteins, IκB-ζ is not rapidly degraded but, rather, stably accumulates in the nucleus where it inhibits NF-κB activity. Interestingly, this inhibitory capability is opposite to the transactivating function of the nuclear Bcl-3 protein. Furthermore, IκB-ζ is only inducibly expressed in different cell types. Thus, these features of IκB-ζ, which are distinct from the cytosolic IκBs and Bcl-3, may confer an additional control mechanism of NF-κB activity.

A549 human lung carcinoma cells were maintained in Ham's F-12, and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, 293 human embryonic kidney cells, and HaCaT human keratinocytes were in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's. All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml concentrations of streptomycin and penicillin, each. Unless indicated, the various stimuli were used at the following concentrations: TNF (10 ng/ml), IL-1 (10 ng/ml), and LPS (1 μg/ml). RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted with TRI reagent (Sigma) and analyzed for integrity by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Suppression Subtractive Hybridization—TNF-resistant H21 and TNF-sensitive D98 cells were stimulated with a combination of TNF (100 pg/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h, and the poly(A)+RNA was isolated from the total RNA using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Amersham Biosciences). The suppression subtractive hybridization was performed with the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) as described previously (27Stier S. Totzke G. Grünewald E. Neuhaus T. Fronhoffs S.

Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE); Plasmids and Retroviral Constructs—The initiation codon of the 5′-untranslated region of human IκB-ζ was determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pcDNA4/Myc-His (Invitrogen), pCMV-Tag4 (Stratagene), pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), and pEGFP-C1 or pCFP-C1 (Clontech) expression plasmids. Both the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 1-317) and the COOH-terminal region (amino acids 318-618) as well as NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 were subcloned into the pcDNA4/Myc-His plasmid. The correct cDNA sequences were confirmed by sequence analyses. IκB-ζ was also cloned into the bicistronic retroviral vector pCFG5-IEGZ, allowing expression of GFP from the same mRNA as IκB-ζ. A transdominant non-degradable IκB-α (S/A) mutant cloned in pCFG5-IEGZ was provided by S. Ludwig. Retrovirus generation and infection of target cells were performed essentially as described (29Denk A. Goebeler M. Schmid S. Berberich I. Ritz O. Lindemann D. Ludwig S. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28451-28458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Northern and Dot Blot Hybridization—To detect expression of IκB-ζ in normal human tissues, the commercially available MTN and RNA Master Blots (Clontech) were used. A 714-bp BamHI/Hind III fragment was taken as probe. Hybridization with the α-32P-labeled cDNA probe and washing procedure was carried out according to standard protocols. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—For semiquantitative mRNA expression studies HeLa D98 and MCF-7/casp-3 cells were exposed to TNF and IL-1β, and MonoMac6 cells were exposed to LPS for the indicated times. To investigate a possible IκB-ζ regulation by NF-κB, HeLa D98 cells were pretreated with BAY 11-7082 or MG-132 for 1 h before stimulation with IL-1. The 5′ (5′-GCTAATCCCATGCAGACTTC-3′) and 3′ (5′-GAACGTGTCACCATCTGCAT-3′) primers for the amplification of the IκB-ζ DNA fragment and the 5′ (5′-AAAGGATCCGCCACCATTTCCAGGCGGCCGAG-3′) and 3′ (5′-TTTAAGCTTTAACGTCAGACGCTGGCCTCC-3′) primers for amplification of the IκB-α cDNA were synthesized commercially (Invitrogen). For standardization purposes each RT sample was subjected to PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′ primer, 5′-GCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-GTAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′). RT and PCR were performed as described previously (30Ko Y. Totzke G. Schiermeyer B. Zeitler H. Schmitz U. Vetter H. Sachinidis A. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1995; 9: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 20 μl of each PCR reaction were electrophoresed on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—To determine NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity, a NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid containing six κB binding sites in front of the luciferase promoter was used. A β-galactosidase (lacZ) vector served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. HEK 293 cells were seeded into 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. The cells were transiently transfected with the NF-κB luciferase plasmid and the lacZ plasmid together with the indicated expression plasmids using the Lipofectamine/PLUS reagent. 24-48 h after transfection, cells were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with TNF or IL-1 for 6 h, lysed in 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. 10 μl of the supernatant were assayed in 100 μl of assay buffer (15 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.8, 25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP) using a microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Light emission was measured after injection of 100 μl of luciferin (0.3 mg/ml), and the values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HEK 293 cells were plated at 3 × 105/well in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection with 500 ng of the p65 or p50 plasmid and increasing amounts (1-16 μg) of the IκB-ζ or, as a control, the IκB-α plasmid. The total amount of transfected DNA was normalized with the empty vector control. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection, and the binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in a 20-μl volume containing 4 μl of extract, 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2,1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% Ficoll), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, and the 32P-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide. Samples were loaded on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer, pH 8. After drying, the gels were exposed to x-ray films. Preparation of Whole, Cytosolic, and Nuclear Cell Extracts—To obtain whole protein extracts, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml concentrations each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. For the preparation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts, HeLa D98 cells were collected by centrifugation and broken by 4 freeze-thaw cycles in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm NaF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. After incubation for 10 min on ice and a centrifugation step (14,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a fresh tube. The pellet was resuspended in high salt buffer (400 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 5 mm NaF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing protease inhibitors and incubated for 30 min on ice. Thereafter, the freeze-thaw cycle was repeated four times, and the nuclear extract (supernatant, soluble fraction) as well as the nuclear pellet (insoluble fraction) was collected by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Equal amounts of the proteins were separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween for 2 h, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the IκB-ζ, IκB-α, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, caspase-3, or actin antibodies in blocking buffer. After incubation for 1 h with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween, 5% bovine serum albumin, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent staining using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged IκB-ζ or IκB-α together with Myc-tagged p65 or p50 for 24 h using Lipofectamine/PLUS™ reagent. Then lysis was performed for 30 min on ice in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 84 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. After centrifugation the supernatants were incubated with protein G-Sepharose and either anti-FLAG or anti-IκB-α antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (Invitrogen, 1:5000). A horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG served as a secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded on coverslips and transfected with the indicated plasmids. FLAG-tagged silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged histone deacetylase-5 (HDAC-5) constructs were obtained from Dr. R. M. Evans. After 18 h of incubation, the cells were fixed for 5 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in IF buffer (4% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were then labeled with primary antibodies (anti-PML, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-FLAG, Sigma) in IF buffer at 4 °C overnight. After washing, incubation with secondary antibodies (Alexa-594-coupled chicken anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes) was performed for 4 h. Finally, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using DAKO fluorescence mounting medium supplemented with Hoechst 33342 (500 ng/ml). Digital pictures were captured using a Leica TCS-SP2/AOBS confocal microscope. Construction of Small Interfering RNAs and Stable Transfection—For the suppression of IκB-ζ, two different siRNAs were designed using the Dharmacon siDESIGN Center. The selected sense sequences were 5′-GATTCGTTGTCTGATGGAC-3′ and 5′-TACTCGGAACTTGGAGAAC-3′. Oligonucleotides containing the sense, loop, antisense sequence, and a polythymidine tract were annealed and ligated into the pSilencer siRNA expression vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). HeLa D98 cells were stably transfected by electroporation using the Bio-Rad gene pulser (500 microfarads, 160 V). After hygromycin selection, several clones were obtained, and the successful reduction of IκB-ζ expression was controlled by Western blot analysis. Cytotoxicity Assay—Parental HeLa D98 cells and three different clones stably expressing IκB-ζ siRNA were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 3-4 × 105/ml. Before exposure to various concentrations of the apoptosis-inducing reagents TNF and anti-CD95, each combined with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), the cells were stimulated with IL-1 for 2 h. For determination of cell death, the standard crystal violet assay was employed (31Engels I.H. Totzke G. Fischer U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The viable cells were stained with 20% methanol containing 0.5% crystal violet and solubilized in 33% acetic acid. The absorbance was measured at A560 nm. Percentage-specific cell death is defined as 100 - (A560 of test well × 100/A560 of untreated well). Each experiment was performed independently at least three times, and an individual experiment was carried out in triplicate. Isolation of a cDNA Encoding a Novel Member of the IκB Family—To identify genes involved in the modulation of apoptosis, the human HeLa cell lines D98 (TNF-sensitive) and H21 (TNF-resistant) were exposed to TNF combined with cycloheximide for 1 h, and the mRNAs were subjected to the suppression subtractive hybridization procedure. Among several differentially expressed genes, a cDNA clone was identified encoding a protein that contains six ankyrin repeats at its COOH terminus sharing about 30% identity with different members of the IκB protein family. Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNA has a length of about 3.5 kilobases kb (data not shown). The full-length cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1857 bp encoding a protein of 618 amino acids. The sequence data were deposited in the data base (GenBank™ DQ224339). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. Besides the COOH-terminal ankyrin repeats, the gene product consists of a potential PEST domain which, however, in contrast to IκB-α and IκB-β, is located at the NH2 terminus (amino acids 84-104). The other NH2-terminal regions exhibit no significant homology with other proteins. The structural similarity to IκB members suggested that we had identified a novel IκB protein. Data base analysis revealed an 80% homology to a mouse protein, termed molecule possessing ankyrin repeats induced by lipopolysaccharide (MAIL). This protein exists in two isoforms, MAIL-L and MAIL-S, which is identical to IκB-ζ (32Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 33Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). During the course of our functional characterization of the novel gene product, sequences of different human MAIL isoforms were deposited in the data base. Our identified gene product is most similar to MAIL-S (GenBank™ AF548362), with the difference that it lacks exon 2 (nucleotides 193-268) in the 5′-untranslated region and therefore represents a to date unknown isoform of MAIL. Because the MAIL proteins are also known as nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor ζ (NFKBIZ), transcript variant 1 and transcript variant 2, we termed the novel isoform human IκB-ζ, transcript variant 3. In the following this variant is referred to as IκB-ζ. IκB-ζ Is Expressed in Different Human Tissues—To obtain an mRNA expression profile of IκB-ζ, a commercially available RNA dot blot was used. Expression was detectable in different human tissues such as lung, placenta, and liver and also in peripheral blood leukocytes. In contrast, IκB-ζ was not expressed in different regions of the brain (Fig. 1C). To verify these results, a Northern blot was performed with mRNA from 12 different human tissues. Again, lung and peripheral blood leukocytes showed the highest expression, liver and placenta showed moderate expression, and spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart showed a low expression level, whereas no expression could be detected in the brain (Fig. 1D). NF-κB Promoter Activity Is Inhibited by the COOH-terminal Domain of IκB-ζ—The presence of ankyrin repeats in the COOH-terminal region of IκB-ζ suggested that we had identified a bona fide NF-κB inhibitor, which encouraged us to investigate its effect on the regulation of NF-κB activity. To this end, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with a κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid together with a β-galactosidase vector and a plasmid containing the cDNA for either IκB-ζ or as a control IκB-α. As measured in a luciferase reporter gene assay, activation of NF-κB was observed when cells were exposed to TNF (Fig. 2A). IκB-ζ was able to inhibit NF-κB activity in TNF-stimulated as well as in unstimulated cells in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that IκB-ζ indeed belongs to the class of proteins that inhibit NF-κB. Compared with TNF, the cytokine IL-1 was a weaker NF-κB activator in HEK 293 cells. Nevertheless, the IL-1-induced NF-κB activation was also reduced by IκB-ζ (Fig. 2B), confirming its inhibitory effect on NF-κB. To find out which functional domain of IκB-ζ is responsible for this inhibition, truncated mutants of IκB-ζ were constructed. The COOH-terminal region containing the ankyrin repeats efficiently inhibited NF-κB activity to an even greater extent than full-length IκB-ζ, whereas the NH2-terminal domain had no effect (Fig. 2C). As a control, in all experiments the effect of IκB-α was investigated in parallel. IκB-α was a much stronger NF-κB inhibitor, indicating that the transcriptional activity of NF-κB is regulated differentially by these two IκB proteins. Such a weaker inhibition of NF-κB activity in comparison to IκB-α has been also reported for IκB-ϵ (34Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). IκB-ζ Binds to the p65 and p50 Subunits of NF-κB and Inhibits Its DNA Binding and Transactivation Activity—Because IκB-ζ was identified as an NF-κB inhibitor, the question arose of which NF-κB subunits associate with IκB-ζ. Therefore, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with IκB-ζ and p65 or p50, and th"

Direct alteration of ion channel subunits by kinases is a candidate mechanism for functional modulation of these channels. We find that activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) with forskolin (50 μm) causes a dramatic decrease in surface localization of the SK2 channel subunit expressed in COS7 cells due to direct phosphorylation of the SK2 channel subunit. PKA phosphorylation studies using the intracellular domains of the SK2 channel subunit expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein constructs showed that both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions are PKA substrates in vitro. Mutational analysis identified a single PKA phosphorylation site within the amino-terminal of the SK2 subunit at serine 136. Mutagenesis and mass spectrometry studies identified four PKA phosphorylation sites: Ser465 (minor site) and three amino acid residues Ser568, Ser569, and Ser570 (major sites) within the carboxyl-terminal region. A mutated SK2 channel subunit, with the three contiguous serines mutated to alanines to block phosphorylation at these sites, shows no decrease in surface expression after PKA stimulation. Thus, our findings suggest that PKA phosphorylation of these three sites is necessary for PKA-mediated reorganization of SK2 surface expression.

Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Functionally, the SK channels are best characterized in the central nervous system. Three genes encode the SK channel subunits (SK1, SK2, and SK3) in mammalian brain (2Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). SK channels are blocked by the bee venom toxin, apamin, although SK1 is slightly less sensitive than SK2 and SK3 (2Kohler M.

Arch. 1999; 438: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In neurons throughout the nervous system, the apamin-sensitive SK channels modulate firing frequency by contribution to the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows a single or a train of action potentials (5Schwindt P.C. Spain W.J. Crill W.E. J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 59: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Storm J.F. J. Physiol. 1989; 409: 171-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 7Storm J.F. Prog. Brain Res. 1990; 83: 161-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). SK2 is thought to specifically underlie the medium AHP current (ImAHP) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (8Bond C.T. Herson P.S. Strassmaier T. Hammond R. Stackman R. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5301-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The ImAHP is Ca2+-dependent with a time constant of 100-250 ms and sensitivity to apamin (9Sailer C.A. Hu H. Kaufmann W.A. Trieb M. Schwarzer C. Storm J.F. Knaus H.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9698-9707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cloues R.K. Sather W.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wagner E.J. Ronnekleiv O.K. Kelly M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 21-30PubMed Google Scholar). The apamin-sensitive ImAHP modulates instantaneous firing rates and sets the interspike duration in action potential trains to produce spike frequency adaptation (12Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, SK channels are localized to the dendrites of pyramidal cells in hippocampal area CA1 and pyramidal neurons of the lateral amygdala where they function to shape synaptic potentials and limit Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors (13Ngo-Anh T.J. Bloodgood B.L. Lin M. Sabatini B.L. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 14Faber E.S. Delaney A.J. Sah P. Nat.

Thompson S.M. Neuron. 2004; 44: 351-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Other studies have linked overexpression of SK2 and enhancement of the ImAHP in hippocampus with neuroprotection (16Lee A.L. Dumas T.C. Tarapore P.E. Webster B.R. Ho D.Y. Kaufer D. Sapolsky R.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), attenuation of hippocampal LTP, and memory deficits (16Lee A.L. Dumas T.C. Tarapore P.E. Webster B.R. Ho D.Y. Kaufer D.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1844-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These functions have major implications for a role for SK2 channels in the formation of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory (17Hammond R.S. Bond C.T. Strassmaier T. Ngo-Anh T.J. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Stackman R.W. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1844-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Stackman R.W. Hammond R.S. Linardatos E. Gerlach A. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Tzounopoulos T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10163-10171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the important role in pyramidal neurons, SK channels are critical for regulation of firing frequency in neurons in other parts of the nervous system. In magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus, the characteristic bursting pattern of oxytocinergic cells that precedes milk ejection is modulated by a Ca2+-dependent, apamin-sensitive ImAHP that appears to be formed by SK3 channels (19Armstrong W.E. Rubrum A. Teruyama R. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 491: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Stern J.E. Armstrong W.E. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore in immature cerebellum, SK2 channels are highly expressed and determine the spontaneous firing pattern of Purkinje cells (21Cingolani L.A. Gymnopoulos M. Boccaccio A. Stocker M. Pedarzani P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4456-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In retinal ganglion cells, the apamin-sensitive IAHP that controls firing pattern and excitability is mediated by SK2 channel subunits (22Klocker N. Oliver D. Ruppersberg J.P. Knaus H.G. Fakler B. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hence, understanding the functional regulation of SK2 channel subunits would yield valuable information about the molecular regulation of the ImAHP. Currently, the molecular mechanism of modulating the ImAHP and neuronal firing frequency is poorly understood. A number of studies have shown that another component of the AHP current, the slow AHP current is regulated by kinase cascades (23Madison D.V. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. 1986; 372: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 24Haug T. Storm J.F. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2071-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). One intriguing possible molecular mechanism of regulating the ImAHP is direct kinase phosphorylation of the SK channel subunits conducting the ImAHP. Indeed, direct K+ channel phosphorylation is a well known post-translational modification regulating neuronal excitability. Phosphorylation of K+ channels is associated with modulation of channel kinetics and cellular localization changes (25Jonas E.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have suggested that activity-dependent potassium channel phosphorylation and functional modulation may be controlled by net kinase activity (26Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that activation of PKA causes a decrease in SK2 surface expression. Furthermore, the PKA phosphorylation sites within the SK2 channel subunit were mapped, and we developed a phospho-selective antibody based on the identified sites. The phospho-selective antibody was used as a tool for further study of PKA modulation of the SK2 subunit. We showed that SK2 was phosphorylated in the COS7 cell expression system and that direct PKA phosphorylation of SK2 subunits in COS7 cells leads to altered cellular localization of the channel subunits, suggesting that the SK2 channel is a downstream target of the PKA cascade. These studies advance our understanding of the molecular regulation of SK channels by post-translational modification. Molecular Biology—The original SK2 cDNA construct was kindly provided by Dr. J. P. Adelman. This construct represents the short isoform of SK2 (49 kDa). Recently a long isoform of SK2 (78 kDa) was defined with extended sequence in NT (27Strassmaier T. Bond C.T. Sailer C.A. Knaus H.G. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21231-21236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For the purpose of this study, we focused on the 49-kDa isoform of the SK2 subunit. Plasmids containing the NT (amino acid residues 1-140), CT (residues 395-580), and SK2 subunit second intracellular loop (residues 278-306) domains were constructed using the modified glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX-YR with NotI and EcoRI sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Point mutations were made using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primers were used: S15A (forward, 5′-GGCGTCATGCGTCCGCTCGCCAACTTGAGCTCGTCCCGCCGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGCGGGACGAGCTCAAGTTGGCGAGCGGACGCATGACGCC-3′), S136A (forward, 5′-CCTGTTTGAGAAGCGCAAGCGGCTCGCCGACTATGCGCTCATCTTCGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCGAAGATGAGCGCATAGTCGGCGAGCCGCTTGCGCTTCTCAAACAGG-3′), S465A (forward, 5′-CAATTAAGAGCGGTGAAGATGGAACAGAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTCTGTTCCATCTTCACCGCTCTTAATTG-3′), S561A (forward, 5′-GCTGAGCGTTCCCGGGCCTCGTCCAGGAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTCCTGGACGAGGCCCGGGAACGCTCAGC-3′), S568A (forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCGGCGGGCCTCCTCCACAGCGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGCTGTGGAGGAGGCCCGCCGCCTCCTGGAC-3′), S559stop (forward, 5′-TACAATGCTGAGCGTTAACGGTCCTCGTCCAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTGGACGAGGACCGTTAACGCTCAGCATTGTA-3′), S568stop (forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCGGCGGTAATCCTCCACAGCGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGCTGTGGAGGATTACCGCCGCCTCCTGGAC-3′), T575stop (forward, 5′-CCTCCACAGCGCCACCATAATCATCTGAGAGTAGCTAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAGCTACTCTCAGATGATTATGGTGGCGCTGTGGAGG-3′), SAAA mutant (forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCGGCGGTCCGCCGCCGCAGCGCCACCAACTTCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GATGAAGTTGGTGGCGCTGCGGCGGCGGACCGCCGCCTCCTGGAC-3′), ASAA mutant (forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCGGCGGGCCTCCGCCGCAGCGCCACCAACTTCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GATGAAGTTGGTGGCGCTGCGGCGGAGGCCCGCCGCCTCCTGGAC-3′), and AASA mutant (forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCGGCGGGCCGCCTCCGCAGCGCCACCAACTTCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GATGAAGTTGGTGGCGCTGCGGAGGCGGCCCGCCGCCTCCTGGAC-3′), AAAT mutant (forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCGGCGGGCCGCCGCCACAGCGCCACCAACTTCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GATGAAGTTGGTGGCGCTGTGGCGGCGGCCCGCCGCCTCCTGGAC-3′), AAAA mutant (forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCGGCGGGCCGCCGCCGCAGCGCCACCAACTTCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GATGAAGTTGGTGGCGCTGCGGCGGCGGCCCGCCGCCTCCTGGAC-3′), and AAA mutant (S568A/S569A/S570A) (forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCGGCGGGCCGCCGCCACAGCGCCACCAACTTCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GATGAAGTTGGTGGCGCTGTGGCGGCGGCCCGCCGCCTCCTGGAC-3′). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (SeqWright, Houston, TX). Protein Expression and Purification—GST fusion protein constructs of the SK2-NT and -CT (GST SK2-NT and GST SK2-CT, respectively) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using methods previously described (28Anderson A.E. Adams J.P. Qian Y. Cook R.G. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5337-5346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, single colonies of BL-21 (DE3) cells transformed with plasmids containing the NT, CT, or second intracellular loop domains were selected and grown in LB broth. After growing to an optical density of 0.6-0.8 (A600), the bacteria were induced by incubation at room temperature with 200 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 4 h and were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended and incubated in STE buffer (in mm): 10 Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 EDTA, 150 NaCl, containing Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) for 15 min on ice. 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1.5% N-laurylsarcosine were added, and then the sample was sonicated for a total of 2 min. The lysates were then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and adjusted to 0.7% N-laurylsarcosine and 2% Triton X-100. The GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione affinity absorption. Glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4; in mm: 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 4.3 Na2HPO4, 1.4 KH2PO4) and then incubated with the lysates for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with PBS buffer by centrifugation (100 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). After the final wash, the bead preparation was resuspended in PBS buffer containing Protease Inhibitor Mixture. The recombinant proteins were left on the beads for subsequent experiments and stored at 4 °C. PKA Phosphorylation of GST SK2 Fusion Proteins—GST SK2-NT or -CT fusion proteins were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 70 ng of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma), Tris buffer, and ATP mix buffer(100 μm ATP, 100 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). For time-course studies of phosphorylation of the GST SK2-NT and -CT fusion proteins incubation periods of 5, 10, 30, 60, and 90 min were used. Reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C with sample buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.04 mg/ml bromphenol blue). The GST fusion proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Phosphopeptides were identified by autoradiography. As a control, parallel reactions were performed for GST alone and PKA alone with ATP mix buffer. The optical density of autoradiography was normalized to the corresponding Coomassie bands (29Adams J.P. Anderson A.E. Varga A.W. Dineley K.T. Cook R.G. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide Mapping—Identification of the specific amino acids phosphorylated by PKA within the SK2 CT was performed by a modified tandem mass spectroscopy method in the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at Baylor College of Medicine as previously described (30Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau R.W.T. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The product of a 60-min preparative scale reaction (volume of 300-400 μl) of activated PKA, the GST SK2-CT, and ATP was separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) stained by Coomassie Blue and digested in-gel by Lys-C. The separated peptide fragments were desalted using a C18 ZipTip column (Millipore) then analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (API 3000 LC/MS/MS System, PE Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Phosphopeptides were identified by a -79-dalton precursor ion scan and subsequently sequenced with tandem mass spectrometry. Phospho-antibody Production—Synthetic peptides corresponding to SK2 residues 558-580, which included the identified phosphorylation sites (Ser568, Ser569, and Ser570, unphosphorylated and phosphorylated) were produced by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at Baylor College of Medicine. The peptides were synthesized with a cysteine at the C-terminal end of the peptide to allow conjugation to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin via m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The conjugates of the phosphopeptides were used for the production of custom antibodies (Cocalico, Inc., CA). After a preimmune blood sample was taken, the conjugates of the phosphopeptide were injected into two albino New Zealand rabbits with the adjuvant Titermax via intradermal injections. The animals were boosted with antigen several times. The phospho-SK2 antiserum was affinity-purified and characterized with Western blotting (28Anderson A.E. Adams J.P. Qian Y. Cook R.G.

COS7 Cell Expression Systems and Membrane Preparation—COS7 cells were cultured and transfected with FuGene6 (Roche Diagnostics). In brief, cells were grown in poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates and maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. 1 μg of SK2 cDNA was used for transfection in each well with FuGene6 according to manufacturer's instructions. To optimize PKA phosphorylation of full-length SK2 expressed in the cells, we determined basal PKA phosphorylation of SK2 with medium that contained either 1% or 10% serum. Western blotting using a PKA-substrate phospho-antibody revealed basal phosphorylation in both 1 and 10% serum media. However, 10% serum demonstrated higher basal phosphorylation (data not shown). After PKA stimulation, there was a marked increase in the phosphorylation of PKA substrates with 1% serum relative to basal levels (data not shown). Therefore, to obtain a robust response to PKA activation, 1% serum was used in all subsequent PKA manipulation experiments. Transfection of the SK2 channel was performed on COS7 cells with FuGENE 6 and grown for 36-48 h. The media was switched from 10% serum to 1% serum ∼12 h before PKA manipulation. Sham transfections were performed using a blank vector (pDs-Red, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or a Kv4.2 construct. COS7 cells were treated with PKA modulators dissolved in Me2SO. Me2SO alone served as the vehicle control. In all conditions the final concentration of Me2SO was 0.2%. The PKA pathway manipulations were are follows: 1) Me2SO alone; 2) 15-min incubation with 50 μm forskolin (FSK, PKA activator) plus 100 μm Ro-201724 (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) (28Anderson A.E. Adams J.P. Qian Y. Cook R.G. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5337-5346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); 3) 30-min preincubation with 10 μm H89 (PKA inhibitor) (31Perrotti N. He R.A. Phillips S.A. Haft C.R. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); or 4) preincubated with 10 μm H89 for 30 min followed by a 15-min incubation with 50 μm FSK/100 μm Ro-201724. Cell membrane preparation was performed; briefly, plates were put on ice to stop the reaction and washed three times by cold PBS with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 100 μm). After harvesting by scraping cells off the plates in BHB buffer (in mm: 20 Tris, pH 7.5, 1 EGTA, 1 EDTA, 1 Na4P2O7, 1 Na3VO4, 0.1 PMSF), membranes were prepared by centrifuging at 92,500 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5% SDS with 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm PMSF. Sample buffer was then added, and the samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel for Western blotting. Immunostaining of COS7 Cells—Transfected COS7 cells were treated with the PKA activators or inhibitors and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) for 40 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature followed by SK2 antibody diluted 1:500 in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then washed in 0.1% Triton X-100 or Tween 20 three times for 5 min each. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was diluted to 1:5000 and incubated with cells for 30-40 min at room temperature. The cells were visualized on the Nikon TE-200 inverted fluorescence microscope. All immunohistochemistry studies were performed in three independent experiments. Cell-surface Biotinylation—After PKA pathway manipulation, the SK2-transfected COS7 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/Ca2+ plus Mg2+, pH 8.0) then treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) at 4 °C for 40 min. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4), supplemented with 0.01 mm PMSF, 0.005 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.005 μg/ml pepstatin for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (50 μl, Pierce) were added to each group sample, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed four times with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and eluted with 50 μl of Laemmli loading buffer (Bio-Rad) for 5 min at 95 °C. The eluates (25 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with the SK2 antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000). Immunoreactivity values of surface SK2 channels were normalized to levels of actin immunoreactivity in total cell extracts to preclude errors that accompany sample loading and transfer. Western Blot Analysis—Gels were blotted electrophoretically to Immobilon filter paper using a transfer tank maintained at 4 °C as described previously (32Adams J. Anderson A. Dineley K. Quian Y. Pfaffinger P. Sweatt J. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; 25: 541Google Scholar). Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in a blocking solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% milk, 0.01% thimerosal. The blots were incubated at room temperature with one of the following primary antibodies: total SK2 antibody, 1:500, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel; phospho-SK2 antibody, 1:500; phospho-PKA substrate antibody, 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for 1 h. After washing, blots were incubated in a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000, Cell Signaling Technology) for 60 min. Blots were washed extensively in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) after incubation with the secondary antibody. Then enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, IL) was used for detection of immunoreactivity. Data Analysis—Immunoreactivity was quantified by densitometry (Scion Corp., version Beta4). The GraphPad Prism software package was used for statistical analysis of the data. Data are expressed as standard error of mean (S.E.). Representative examples are shown under “Results.” One-way analysis of variance with post-hoc analysis or Student's t test was used for comparison. Statistical significance was taken as p < 0.05. The PKA Pathway Modulates SK2 Channel Surface Expression in COS7 Cells—We first investigated PKA pathway regulation of SK2 channel trafficking and localization in the COS7 cell expression system. Immunostaining was performed on the SK2-transfected COS7 cells with the commercial SK2 antibody after treating the cells with PKA pathway modulators (Fig. 1A). Immunostaining for SK2 was visualized on the cell-surface membrane and concentrated in presumptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in the vehicle control (Me2SO). PKA activation using forskolin (FSK (50 μm) together with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-201724 (100 μm)) attenuated surface expression and increased perinuclear expression (presumptive ER and Golgi complex) of the SK2 subunits, whereas the PKA inhibitor, H89 (10 μm), facilitated SK2 channel trafficking to the cell surface. The decrease in surface expression of SK2 channels by forskolin is attenuated by preincubation with H89. These data suggest that PKA regulates the surface expression of SK2. As controls and in parallel with the studies presented above, we processed untransfected and sham-transfected COS7 cells for SK2 immunohistochemistry. These COS7 cells showed no SK2 staining (sham-transfected COS7 cells shown in supplemental Fig. S1). We further investigated this effect with surface biotinylation experiments to quantify the cell-surface expression of SK2 following PKA cascade manipulation in COS7 cells. Western blotting with the commercial SK2 antibody was performed to compare the biotinylated and total pools of SK2 channels in each experimental group (Fig. 1B). Western blotting showed no difference in the total SK2 channel expression in lysates of all treated groups. However, there was a significant reduction in SK2 channel expression on the cell surface following forskolin application relative to control (65 ± 4% of Me2SO control, p < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 1C). Western blotting with a second SK2 antibody (generated in the laboratory of J.P.A.) against a different epitope (SK2 residues 538-547) revealed similar results (data not shown). In contrast, following H89 treatment, there was a significant elevation of SK2 channel expression on the cell surface compared with control (168 ± 13% of Me2SO control, p < 0.01, n = 3). There was no significant difference in surface expression of cells treated with both FSK and H89 (104 ± 9% of Me2SO control). Together these results demonstrate that, in SK2-transfected COS7 cells, activation of the PKA cascade attenuates surface expression of SK2 channel subunits, whereas a reduction of PKA activity increases SK2 subunit surface expression. Based on the observation that there are PKA consensus sites within the SK2 amino acid sequence, we hypothesized that PKA regulates SK2 surface expression by direct phosphorylation of the SK2 subunits. Candidate PKA Sites within the SK2 Amino Acid Sequence—The SK2 subunit is composed of 580 amino acid residues with six putative transmembrane domains, and cytoplasmic NT and CT regions. We focused our study on SK2 cytoplasmic domains, because these would be accessible to cellular kinases. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of SK2 with NetPhos (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/) (33Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar) predicted multiple serine and threonine residues (>95% probability) as candidate PKA phosphorylation sites. Two candidate PKA sites were located within the NT and five within the CT cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 2). No candidate PKA sites were identified within the two cytoplasmic loops. PKA Phosphorylates the SK2-NT and -CT Domains—To test our hypothesis that the SK2-NT and -CT domains are PKA substrates, recombinant GST fusion proteins of SK2-NT (amino acid residues 1-140, 42 kDa) and -CT (amino acid residues 395-580, 50 kDa) cytoplasmic domains were constr"
https://openalex.org/W1975005333,"The possible role of the peripheral cannabinoid receptor (CB2) in neutrophil migration was investigated by using human promyelocytic HL60 cells differentiated into neutrophil-like cells and human neutrophils isolated from whole blood. Cell surface expression of CB2 on HL60 cells, on neutrophil-like HL60 cells, and on human neutrophils was confirmed by flow cytometry. Upon stimulation with either of the CB2 ligands JWH015 and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), neutrophil-like HL60 cells rapidly extended and retracted one or more pseudopods containing F-actin in different directions instead of developing front/rear polarity typically exhibited by migrating leukocytes. Activity of the Rho-GTPase RhoA decreased in response to CB2 stimulation, whereas Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 activity increased. Moreover, treatment of cells with RhoA-dependent protein kinase (p160-ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 yielded cytoskeletal organization similar to that of CB2-stimulated cells. In human neutrophils, neither JWH015 nor 2-AG induced motility or morphologic alterations. However, pretreatment of neutrophils with these ligands disrupted N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced front/rear polarization and migration and also substantially suppressed fMLP-induced RhoA activity. These results suggest that CB2 might play a role in regulating excessive inflammatory response by controlling RhoA activation, thereby suppressing neutrophil migration.

It has been suggested that the gene encoding CB2 is a protooncogene and that aberrant expression of CB2 in myeloid precursor cells results in the development of leukemia by blocking neutrophil differentiation (3Valk P.J.M.

This report indicates that CB2 may be involved in a wide range of physiologic phenomena related to immunity and that some CB2 ligands may have application in the treatment of inflammatory disease. However, research into CB2 is still in its early stages. In particular, the involvement of only a few molecules, Gαi/Gαo protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-κB families, in the CB2 signaling pathways has been reported (6Berdyshev E.V.

Among the possible roles of CB2 in immunity is the induction of leukocyte migration to sites of infection and inflammation, an important step in the host defense against pathogenic microorganisms. CB2 is a seven-transmembrane, Gαi/Gαo protein-coupled receptor, as are receptors for chemoattractants such as N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanine (fMLP). It has been reported that several genes encoding chemotactic cytokines are up-regulated in response to CB2 stimulation (12Derocq J.-M. Jbilo O. Bouaboula M. Ségui M. Clère C. Casellas P. J. Biol.

Nature. 2005; 434: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) reported that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol inhibits monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-induced macrophage migration, a crucial step in the progression of atherosclerosis. In the present study, the possible role of CB2 in neutrophil migration was investigated. We constructed an in vitro model of neutrophil migration on blood vessels as described previously (20Miura Y. Tohyama Y. Hishita T. Lala A. De Nardin E. Yoshida Y. Yamaura H. Uchiyama T. Tohyama K. Blood. 2000; 96: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but with some modification: we studied human promyelocytic HL60 cells, differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) into neutrophil-like cells, on plates coated with fibrinogen, an adhesive extracellular matrix glycoprotein. We show that two CB2 ligands, 2-AG and a synthetic CB2-specific ligand JWH015, induce increased motility of the cells but that the cells do not develop the front/rear polarity that migrating leukocytes typically exhibit, with a lamellipodium at the front and a retracting tail at the rear (21Sánchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, to investigate the possible physiological implication of the results, the effects of the CB2 ligands, alone and as pretreatment before fMLP stimulation, were analyzed in human neutrophils isolated from whole blood. We show that pretreatment of human neutrophils with the ligands disrupts fMLP-induced front/rear polarization and migration. Antibodies and Reagents—The rabbit polyclonal anti-CB2 anitibody was purchased from Calbiochem Corp.. The mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (sc-9996) and the rabbit polyclonal anti-RhoA (sc-179) and anti-Rac2 (sc-96) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody was from Sigma. The mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 and anti-Cdc42 antibodies were from BD Biosciences. The mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated (serine 473) PKB/Akt, the rabbit polyclonal anti-PKB/Akt, the mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated myosin light chain (MLC) II, and the rabbit polyclonal anti-MLC II antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Invitrogen Corp. The HRP-conjugated goat secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin was from Invitrogen Corp. Human fibrinogen was from Yoshitomiyakuhin Corp. (Osaka, Japan). JWH015 and 2-AG were from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). CB2 inhibitor SR144528 was kindly donated by Sanofi Aventis (Paris, France). CB1 inhibitor AM251 was from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). fMLP was from Sigma. Y27632 was from Calbiochem Corp. Cell Preparation—Human promyelocytic HL60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Some HL60 cells and HL60 cells transiently expressing the pleckstrin homology domain of PKB/Akt tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP-PKB/Akt-PH domain) were induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells by treatment with 1 μm ATRA (Sigma) for 4 days. Human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) were isolated from whole blood donated by healthy volunteers with Ficoll-Hypaque Polymorphprep™ solution (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway). May-Gruenwald-Giemsa Staining—For the morphological assessment, the cell smears were prepared with cytospin centrifugation for 5 minat70 × g (Shandon Cytospin3; Thermo Electron Corp., Pittsburgh, PA) and stained with May-Gruenwald-Giemsa solution. Flow Cytometric Analysis—CB2 expression on the cell surface was examined by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were incubated for 45 min with anti-CB2 antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA-containing PBS) and washed twice with BSA-containing PBS. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody and washed with BSA-containing PBS before being subjected to flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur™ system (BD Biosciences). All of these procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Plasmid Constructs and DNA Transfection—The PH domain of human pkb/akt protein kinase (amino acids 1-167) was amplified from human spleen cDNAs (Ambion, Austin, TX) with the following primer pair: 5′-ATGAGCGACGTGGCTATTGTGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CACCAGGATCACCTTGCCGAAAGTG-3′. The second amplification reaction was performed with primers that contained EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites and the amplified products were cloned into the pEGFP-N1 plasmids (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). After the sequences of both strands were verified with ABI PRISM Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), the plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis for the presence of GFP fusion proteins with anti-GFP antibody. GFP-PKB/Akt-PH domain was introduced into HL60 cells by electroporation. Cell Migration Assay—Migration of live cells was observed as described previously (23Matsusaka S. Tohyama Y. He J. Shi Y. Hazama R. Kadono T. Kurihara R. Tohyama K. Yamamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) but with some modification. In brief, cells were plated in culture medium onto a 100 μg/ml fibrinogen- or 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated 35-mm culture dish, which was placed on the stage of a Power IX microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) coupled to an MI-IBC CO2 incubator (Olympus Corp.) to allow for observations at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were stimulated with either uniform concentration of ligands or a point source of ligands from a micropipette (Femtotips®: Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). Cell morphology and motility alterations were monitored by obtaining single-frame images every 10 s for at least 20 min. Approximately 160-200 cells were present per 297.0 × 397.9-μm frame. Those cells which remained in the frame throughout the observation (∼90-95%) were examined. Cell lengths and migratory distances were measured with image analyzing software MacSCOPE Version 2.6 (Mitani Corp., Fukui, Japan). In particular, migratory distances were calculated by monitoring two-dimensional coordinates of each cell center at 30-s intervals. Other morphologic alterations were examined by observing individual cells during stop-time playback of time-lapse images. Immunofluorescence Microscopic Analysis—In preparation for staining, cells were plated in culture medium onto 100 μg/ml fibrinogencoated FALCON™ culture slides (BD Biosciences), fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed twice with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.5% BSA (staining buffer), and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in staining buffer for 3 min. Nonspecific binding to Fc receptors was blocked by incubation for 15 min with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 5% BSA. To confirm CB2 expression, samples thus prepared were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-CB2 antibody for 45 min. This antibody was produced with the use of a Zenon™ rabbit IgG labeling kit (Invitrogen Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After three washes with staining buffer, chromosomes were stained with the DNA-specific fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). To examine cytoskeletal organization, prepared cells were incubated with anti-α-tubulin antibody for 45 min. After three washes with staining buffer, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin (to visualize F-actin) for 30 min. To examine localization of the active form of MLC II, cells were incubated with anti-phosphrylated MLC II antibody. The following procedures were identical to those for staining of α-tubulin. All of these procedures were conducted at room temperature. Stained cells were washed twice with staining buffer, mounted in antifade mounting medium (ProLong™ Antifade kit; Invitrogen Corp.), and analyzed by confocal microscopy with an LSM 510 laser scanning unit and an Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) run with imaging software LSM 510 META Version 3.0 (Olympus Corp.). Rho-GTPase Pull-down Assay—The GTP-bound (active) forms of four Rho-GTPases, Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and RhoA, were isolated by pull-down assay. Recombinant protein PAK1-PBD-GST, which binds specifically to the GTP-bound forms of Rac and Cdc42, was produced as described previously (24Miah S.M.S. Hatani T. Qu X. Yamamura H. Sada K. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA of the Rac- and Cdc42-binding domain of human PAK1 (PAK1-PBD; amino acids 67-150) was cloned into expression vector pGEX4T-3 as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells treated with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The fusion protein was purified with gluthathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). For production of recombinant protein rhotekin-RBD-GST, which binds specifically to the GTP-bound forms of Rho (-A, -B, and -C), cDNA of the Rho-binding domain of mouse rhotekin (rhotekin-RBD; amino acids 7-89) was cloned according to the procedure of Ren et al. (25Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Other procedures were identical to those for PAK1-PBD-GST. Neutrophil-like HL60 cells and human neutrophils (1 × 107) were stimulated with 100 nm JWH015, 300 nm 2-AG, or 100 nm fMLP. Because cell adhesion to extracellular matrix affects Rho-GTPase activity (25Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) and because cells are known to polarize in suspension culture (26Eddy R.J. Pierini L.M. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4470-4483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we stimulated cells in suspension culture in a BSA-coated microtube. The cells were then lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in Mg2+ lysis buffer (MLB) containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. A proportion of each supernatant was diluted in Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min for detection of total (both GTP- and GDP-bound) Rho-GTPases. The remaining supernatants were incubated with either PAK1-PBD-GST or rhotekin-RBD-GST for 1 h at 4°C followed by three washes with MLB. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by being heated in Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min and, along with samples for detecting total Rho-GTPases, were subjected to Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—To detect activity of the four Rho-GTPases, we used samples lysed in MLB. To detect PKB/Akt and MLC II activity, cells were lysed in a solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1.5 μm aprotinin. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were then blocked with 1% skim milk in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, incubated with antibodies to Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, RhoA, phosphorylated PKB/Akt, or phosphorylated MLC II for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (to detect Rac1, Cdc42, phosphorylated PKB/Akt, or phosphorylated MLC II) or HRP-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (to detect RhoA and Rac2) for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with TBS-T and once with PBS. Immune complexes were visualized with Western Lightning™ chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a lumino-image analyzer (LAS-1000; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). For quantification, the density of each band was measured with image analyzing software NIH Image Version 1.63 f. To detect total (both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) PKB/Akt and MLC II, immune complex of HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody with anti-phosphorylated PKB/Akt and that with anti-phosphorylated MLC II antibody were stripped by bathing the membranes in a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 7 mm SDS, and 95 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, and the membranes were reprobed with either general anti-PKB/Akt or anti-MLC II antibody. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, with a p value of <0.05 considered significant. CB2 Was Detected on the Surface of Neutrophil-like HL60 Cells and Human Neutrophils—HL60 cells are known to differentiate morphologically and functionally into neutrophil-like cells when treated with ATRA (27Breitman T.R. Selonick S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). We examined CB2 expression in HL60 cells, in HL60 cells 4 days after exposure to 1 μm ATRA (ATRA-treated HL60 cells), and in human PMNs isolated from whole blood. By flow cytometric analysis, CB2 was detected on the surface of these cells (Fig. 1A, panels a-c). The cell surface expression levels of CB2, as reflected by fluorescence intensity, were highest in HL60 cells; ATRA-treated HL60 cells and PMNs showed levels similar to each other (Fig. 1A, panel d). Prior to flow cytometric analysis, we confirmed by May-Gruenwald-Giemsa staining that 77 ± 3% of ATRA-treated HL60 cells revealed neutrophilic maturation, and >95% of the PMNs were mature neutrophils (data not shown). Moreover, CB2 expression in these cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopic analysis (Fig. 1B, panels d-f). We also observed nuclear morphology with Hoechst 33342 and confirmed that ATRA-treated HL60 cells were successfully induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells (Fig. 1B, panel b), and that most of the PMNs were mature neutrophils (Fig. 1B, panel c). Because similar levels of CB2 expression in neutrophil-like HL60 cells and in human neutrophils were confirmed, we used neutrophil-like HL60 cells as an in vitro model of human neutrophils in further experiments. JWH015 and 2-AG Induced Motility with No Front/Rear Polarization in Neutrophil-like HL60 Cells—Alterations in motility and morphology of neutrophil-like HL60 cells following stimulation with either 100 nm JWH015 (a synthetic CB2-specific ligand) or 300 nm 2-AG (a physiological ligand for both CB1 and CB2) were monitored by video microscopy. Most unstimulated cells were spherical, with occasional small spike-like projections (Fig. 2A, upper left image). Approximately 3 min after JWH015 or 2-AG stimulation, 60% of the cells elongated (i.e. polarized), rapidly extending and retracting one or more pseudopods in different directions (Fig. 2A (JWH015); data not shown for 2-AG). These cells did not develop the front/rear polarity that migrating leukocytes typically exhibit and displayed almost no migratory activity during observations of up to 60 min (data not shown). A point source of 10 μm JWH015 by micropipette also induced polarization accompanied by the extension of one or more pseudopods in different directions (Fig. 2B). Quantitative analysis of image sequences of samples unstimulated or stimulated with uniform concentration of the CB2 ligands is shown in Fig. 2, C-E. To ensure consistency in distinguishing polarized cells from non-responding cells, cells with a value of X greater than 2 were counted as polarized (X = L/W, where L is the longest distance across the cell, and W is the greatest width perpendicular to L as shown in the illustration next to Fig. 2C). The percentage of polarized cells increased significantly after stimulation with the CB2 ligands (p < 0.01). This increase was almost completely inhibited by pretreatment with 1 μm CB2 inhibitor SR144528 but not by 1 μm CB1 inhibitor AM251 (Fig. 2C). In addition, the percentage of cells that extended multiple pseudopods increased significantly after CB2 stimulation (p < 0.01, Fig. 2D). Approximately 90% of the cells that polarized in response to the CB2 ligands were devoid of a retracting tail of the sort observed at the rear of migrating leukocytes (Fig. 2E). In contrast, >90% of the cells responding to uniform concentration (100 nm) of fMLP exhibited front/rear polarity, with a single pseudopod (lamellipodium) at the front and a retracting tail at the rear (Fig. 2, D and E; an image of a typical fMLP-stimulated cell is shown in the illustration next to Fig. 2E). F-actin Formed in the Pseudopods in CB2-stimulated Cells—The cytoskeletal reorganization underlying the morphologic alterations accompanying CB2 stimulation was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig. 3A, panels a-d, shows fluorescence images of F-actin (red) and microtubules (green). In a typical unstimulated cell (panel a), only faint F-actin staining was observed at the periphery, and from a single point, an array of microtubule filaments extended radially to the cell periphery. Three types of JWH015-stimulated cells are shown. In one type with a single pseudopod (panel b), a large accumulation of F-actin was observed in the pseudopod, toward which microtubule filaments emanated from a single point. In the other types, F-actin was found in two (panel c) or 3 (panel d) pseudopods, and microtubule filaments emanated from a single point to each pseudopod. GFP-PKB/Akt-PH Domain Accumulated in One or More Regions in Neutrophil-like HL60 Cells—HL60 cells transiently expressing GFP-PKB/Akt-PH domain, a fluorescence probe for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and other products of PI3K (PI3Ps) (28Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 29Xu J. Wang F. Van Keymeulen A. Herzmark P. Straight A. Kelly K. Takuwa Y. Sugimoto N. Mitchison T. Bourne H.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), were induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells by treatment with ATRA and stimulated with JWH015. Distribution of GFP-PKB/Akt-PH domain was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In cells that exhibited typical morphologic alterations in response to CB2 stimulation, GFP-PKB/Akt-PH domain accumulated in one or more regions, mostly in pseudopods (Fig. 3B, panels b and c). JWH015 Decreased RhoA Activity in Neutrophil-Like HL60 Cells—Among numerous molecules implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration, four Rho-GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42, play particularly important roles. The effects of CB2 stimulation on the activities of these four Rho-GTPases were assessed by Rho-GTP pull-down assay, where active (GTP-bound) forms of Rho-GTPases can be detected. The time courses of RhoA, Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 activities are shown in Fig. 4, A-D. Notably, RhoA activity decreased 2 min after JWH015 stimulation (A). In contrast, Rac1 activity increased rapidly and peaked at 30 s at ∼20-fold the basal level (B). Rac2 activity also increased although more gradually and to a lower peak of 3-fold basal (C). Cdc42 activity increased even more gradually (D). We also observed that activity of PI3K-dependent kinase PKB/Akt increased rapidly in response to JWH015 stimulation, peaking at a high level (Fig. 4E)."
https://openalex.org/W1984150373,"d-Aspartate ligase has remained the last unidentified peptide bond-forming enzyme in the peptidoglycan assembly pathway of Gram-positive bacteria. Here we show that a two-gene cluster of Enterococcus faecium encodes aspartate racemase (Racfm) and ligase (Aslfm) for incorporation of d-Asp into the side chain of the peptidoglycan precursor. Aslfm was identified as a new member of the ATP-grasp protein superfamily, which includes a diverse set of enzymes catalyzing ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine ligation reactions. Aslfm specifically ligated the β-carboxylate of d-Asp to the ϵ-amino group of l-Lys in the nucleotide precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide. d-iso-Asparagine was not a substrate of Aslfm, indicating that the presence of this amino acid in the peptidoglycan of E. faecium results from amidation of the α-carboxyl of d-Asp after its addition to the precursor. Heterospecific expression of the genes encoding Racfm and Aslfm in Enterococcus faecalis led to production of stem peptides substituted by d-Asp instead of l-Ala2, providing evidence for the in vivo specificity and function of these enzymes. Strikingly, sequencing of the cross-bridges revealed that substitution of l-Ala2 by d-Asp is tolerated by the d,d-transpeptidase activity of the penicillin-binding proteins both in the acceptor and in the donor substrates. The Aslfm ligase appears as an attractive target for the development of narrow spectrum antibiotics active against multiresistant E. faecium. d-Aspartate ligase has remained the last unidentified peptide bond-forming enzyme in the peptidoglycan assembly pathway of Gram-positive bacteria.

Peptidoglycan is a macromolecule found on the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane of all eubacteria except certain halophilic bacteria, such as Halobacterium halobium, and intracellular parasites, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This structure is essential to protect bacteria against the internal osmotic pressure and plays a key role in cell division. The basic unit of peptidoglycan is a disaccharide peptide assembled by a series of cytoplasmic and membrane reactions (2van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It is composed of GlcNAc linked to N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) 2The abbreviations used are: MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; Asl, β-d-aspartate:UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (ADP-forming) (EC.6.3.1.x); Rac, aspartate racemase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography; rp-HPLC, reverse-phase HPLC; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; iGln, iso-Gln. 2The abbreviations used are: MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; Asl, β-d-aspartate:UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (ADP-forming) (EC.6.3.1.x); Rac, aspartate racemase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography; rp-HPLC, reverse-phase HPLC; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; iGln, iso-Gln. substituted by a stem peptide. In pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, the stem peptide consists of a conserved pentapeptide (l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine) and a variable side chain linked to the ϵ-amino group of l-Lys3 (1Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the side chain is conserved in members of the same species but highly variable between species as it contains from 1 to 5 residues of the l and d configurations as well as glycine (1Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). l-Amino acids and glycine are activated as aminoacyl-tRNAs and transferred to the precursors by a family of non-ribosomal peptide bond-forming enzymes (Fem) (3Plapp R.

In contrast, little is known about the incorporation of d-amino acids into peptidoglycan precursors. In 1972, a d-aspartate ligase of E. faecium, formerly designated as Streptococcus faecalis, has been partially purified (11Staudenbauer W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5095-5102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Staudenbauer W. Willoughby E. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5289-5296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activates d-aspartate as β-d-aspartyl-phosphate and links d-Asp to the ϵ-amino group of l-Lys3 in the cytoplasmic precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (11Staudenbauer W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5095-5102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A).The side chains of peptidoglycan precursors play a critical role since their N terminus is used by the d,d-transpeptidases in the last cross-linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis (Fig. 1B). In S. aureus, the transferase responsible for incorporation of the first residue in the pentaglycine side chain (FmhB) is essential presumably because the d,d-transpeptidases cannot catalyze cross-link formation with unsubstituted pentapeptide stems (5Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Tschierske M. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9351-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, FemA and FemB are essential for methicillin resistance mediated by a low affinity d,d-transpeptidase (PBP2a) (13Rohrer S. Berger-Bachi B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Stranden A.M. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because of their essential role in peptidoglycan synthesis and β-lactam resistance, Fem transferases are considered as promising targets for the development of novel antibiotics (15Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In this report, we have identified by reverse genetics a two-gene cluster responsible for incorporation of d-Asp into the peptidoglycan precursors of E. faecium. Heterospecific expression of the cluster in E. faecalis was used to demonstrate the function of the proteins in vivo and to study the consequences of substitution of l-Ala2 by d-Asp on peptidoglycan cross-linking by the d,d-transpeptidases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESd-Aspartate Ligase Assays—The standard assay was performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 8.5), MgCl2 (50 mm), ATP (20 mm), d-[14C]aspartic acid (0.11 mm, 2 GBq/mmol, Isobio, Fleurus, Belgium), and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (0.15 mm) prepared from S. aureus (16Billot-Klein D. Shlaes D. Bryant D. Bell D. Legrand R. Gutmann L. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated for 15–120 min at 37 °C and stopped by boiling for 3 min. UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide-d-[14C]Asp was separated from d-[14C]Asp by descending paper chromatography (Whatman 4MM, Elancourt, France) with a mobile phase composed of isobutyric acid and 1 m ammonia (5:3, v/v). Alternatively, the products of the reaction were separated by reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (rp-HPLC) on a Hypersil C18 column (3 μm, 4.6 × 250 nm, Interchrom, Montluçon, France) using isocratic elution (10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The products were detected by the absorbance at 262 nm and liquid scintillation with a Radioflow Detector (LB508; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Courtaboeuf, France) coupled to the HPLC apparatus (L-62000A; Merck, Nogent-Sur-Marne, France).The specificity of the d-aspartate ligase was studied by replacing d-[14C]Asp by d-Asp, l-Asp, d-iso-asparagine, d-Glu, d-Ala, and d-malic acid (5 mm; Sigma, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). The products of the addition reactions were detected by mass spectrometry (MS), and their structures were determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Severin A. Tabei K.

Gutmann L. Horaud T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 1933-1940PubMed Google Scholar) was partially purified in three chromatographic steps and identified as a member of the ATP-grasp protein family by MS/MS amino acid sequencing. Briefly, E. faecium D359 was grown to an OD650 nm of 0.7 in 20 liters of brain heart infusion broth (Difco, Elancourt, France), harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and washed twice in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Bacteria were disrupted with glass beads in a refrigerated cell disintegrator (Sartorius, Palaiseau, France) for 3 × 30 s. The extract was centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 200 mm NaCl (buffer A). Proteins (1.3 g) were loaded onto a cation exchange column equilibrated with buffer A (HiLoad 26/10 SP Sepharose HP; Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France). Active fractions, eluting between 0.8 and 0.9 m NaCl, were pooled (12 mg of proteins), concentrated in a dialysis bag with solid polyethylene glycol, and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 HR26/60, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Active fractions (1.8 mg of proteins) were loaded onto a 1-ml cation exchange column (HiTrap SP Sepharose fast flow, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins (200 μg) eluting between 0.8 and 0.95 m NaCl were dialyzed against buffer A, concentrated by lyophilization, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The native enzyme was stored at –20 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 200 mm NaCl.For amino acid sequencing, protein bands were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel, reduced with dithiothreitol (Sigma, Poole, UK), alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin (modified trypsin, sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science). Tryptic digests were dried under vacuum, resuspended in 4 μl of 0.1% formic acid, and analyzed by HPLC (LC Packing system, LC Packing, San Francisco, CA) coupled to mass spectrometry. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 200 nl/min in 0.1% formic acid with three consecutive linear acetonitrile gradients (0–2% for 1 min, 2–50% for 40 min, and 50–90% for 10 min). The LC system was connected to an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ Deca, Finnigan Corp., San Jose, CA). The spray voltage was set at 2.1 kV, the temperature of the ion transfer tube was set at 180 °C, and the normalized collision energies were set at 35% for MS/MS. The sequences of the uninterpreted spectra were identified by correlation with the peptide sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein data base using the SpectrumMill program (Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). The d-aspartate ligase was identified as a member of the ATP-grasp protein family present in the major 49-KDa protein band.Production of the d-Aspartate Ligase in Escherichia coli and Purification of the Protein—DNA of E. faecium D359 was amplified with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers Asl1 (5′-GAGAGACCATGGTGAACAGTATTGAAAATGAAG-3′) and Asl2 (5′-CTCCATGGCTAGGATCCTTCTTTCACATGAAAATACTTTTTG-3′). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI (underlined) and cloned into pET2818 (18Mainardi J.L. Fourgeaud M. Hugonnet J.E. Dubost L. Brouard J.P. Ouazzani J. Rice L.B. Gutmann L. Arthur M. J.

For protein production, bacteria were grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.7 in 2 liters of brain heart infusion broth containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added (0.5 mm), and incubation was continued for 3.5 h at 37 °C. Aslfm was purified from a clarified lysate by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetateagarose resin (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and cation exchange chromatography (HiTrap SP-Sepharose fast flow, Amersham Biosciences). The protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at –20 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 50% glycerol.Western Blot Analysis—Anti-Aslfm antiserum was obtained by three subcutaneous injections at 3-week intervals of 200 μg of purified Aslfm in a New Zealand rabbit. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK), and incubated with the anti-Aslfm antiserum at a 1/1000 dilution. Goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to peroxidase (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) was used as a secondary antibody, and Aslfm was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Pierce and Amersham Biosciences). Tagged proteins were alternatively detected using polyclonal anti-His6 rabbit antibodies (Ebiosciences, San Diego, CA).Heterospecific Expression of the d-Aspartate Ligase Gene (aslfm) in E. faecalis—The shuttle expression vector pJEH11 (our laboratory collection) is a derivative of pAT392 (20Arthur M. Depardieu F. Snaith H.A. Reynolds P.E. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that confers gentamicin resistance and replicates in E. coli and in Gram-positive hosts. The NcoI site used for cloning in pJEH11 is preceded by a constitutive promoter (20Arthur M. Depardieu F. Snaith H.A. Reynolds P.E. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and a ribosome binding site active in enterococci. The BamHI site is followed by in-frame codons specifying a His6 tag. The NcoI-BamHI fragment of pSJL1 (above) containing the aslfm open reading frame was cloned into pJEH11. The resulting plasmid pSJL2(aslfm) was introduced into E. faecalis JH2-2 by electroporation (20Arthur M. Depardieu F. Snaith H.A. Reynolds P.E. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and clones were selected and subcultured in brain heart infusion containing 128 μg/ml gentamicin.Co-expression of the d-Aspartate Ligase (aslfm) and Aspartate Racemase (racfm) Genes in E. faecalis—The racfm open reading frame was amplified with primers rac1 (5′-AAAGAAGGATCCTAGCCATGGAGAATTTTTTCAGTATTTTAGGCGG-3′), containing BamHI (underlined) and a stop codon (bolded), and rac2 (5′-AAAGGATCCCTTTTCCGATGCTGTATCCAATGCC-3′), containing BamHI. The PCR fragment was cloned into the BamHI restriction site of pSJL2(aslfm) (above). Insertion of the PCR product introduced a stop codon at the end of aslfm (TAG present in primer rac1) and generated an in-frame fusion between the 3′ end of racfm and the sequence of the vector pJEH11 specifying the His6 tag. The resulting plasmid, pSJL3(aslfm racfm), carried a bi-cistronic operon encoding Aslfm and E. faecium His6-tagged aspartate racemase (Racfm). To obtain inducible expression of aslfm and racfm, the genes were subcloned with SacI and XbaI under the control of the IPTG-inducible promoter of vector pJEH4, generating pSJL4(aslfm racfm). The shuttle vector pJEH4 (our laboratory collection) confers resistance to spectinomycin (120 μg/ml for selection) and carries the lacI gene and lac operator fused to transcription and translation signals that are functional in enterococci.Peptidoglycan Structure Analysis—The structure of the peptidoglycan was determined by mass spectrometry as described previously (21Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E. Sentilhes A.C. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Monsempes C. Blanot D. Brouard J.P. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41546-41556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, derivatives of E. faecalis JH2-2 harboring plasmids pJEH11, pSJL2(aslfm), and pSJL4(aslfm,racfm) were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7 in 250 ml of brain heart infusion broth in the presence or absence of d-aspartate (50 mm). Peptidoglycan was extracted with boiling SDS and digested with mutanolysin and lysozyme (Sigma). The resulting muropeptides were cleaved under alkaline conditions to generate lactoyl-peptides, separated by rp-HPLC, and analyzed by MS and MS/MS using an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer operating in positive mode (Qstar Pulsar I, Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France).RESULTSAslfm Is a Member of the ATP-Grasp Protein Family—d-Aspartate ligase activity was detected in a cytoplasmic fraction of E. faecium D359 using a radioactive assay (Fig. 2A) and partially purified in three chromatographic steps (Fig. 2B). Amino acid sequencing was performed by MS/MS on individual protein bands digested with trypsin. The 49-kDa protein (Fig. 2B) was encoded by the EfaeDRAFT_0086 nucleotide sequence in the E. faecium genome data base (U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute). Sequence data obtained by MS/MS included the N terminus of the 49-kDa protein, revealing that the methionine specified by the proposed translation initiation codon had been cleaved. The protein was produced in E. coli with a C-terminal His6 tag and purified by affinity and cation exchange chromatographies (Fig. 2C). The recombinant protein was active in the radioactive assay (Fig. 3A), indicating that the gene encoding the d-aspartate ligase (aslfm) had been successfully identified. Aslfm belonged to the ATP-grasp protein superfamily composed of highly diverse enzymes that catalyze ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine ligation reactions (22Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and form acylphosphate intermediates (23Kothe M. Eroglu B. Mazza H. Samudera H. Powers-Lee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (0.15 mm), d-[14C]aspartic acid (0.11 mm, 2 GBq/mmol), ATP (20 mm), and MgCl2 (50 mm) were incubated in the absence (–) or presence (+) of cytoplasmic extract (60 μg of protein) for 2 h at 37 °C.The products were separated by descending paper chromatography and revealed by autoradiography.

The monoisotopic mass of the compound eluting with the same retention time as radioactive peak II was determined to be 1,264.4 Da from peaks at m/z 1,265.4, 633.2, 644.2, and 652.2, which were assigned to be [M+H]1+, [M+2H]2+, [M+H+Na]2+, and [M+H+K]2+ ions, respectively (Fig. 3B). This monoisotopic mass matches the predicted value of 1,264.4 Da for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide-d-Asp. Fragmentation of the peak at m/z 1,265.4 gave ions at m/z 861.4 and 676.3 corresponding to the MurNAc-pentapeptide-d-Asp and lactoyl-pentapeptide-d-Asp moieties of the molecule (Fig. 3C). An additional stage of MS-MS was performed on the peak at m/z 676.3 (lactoyl-pentapeptide-d-Asp) to sequence the peptide portion of the molecule (Fig. 3D). The peak at m/z 561.3 matched the predicted value for loss of one d-aspartate residue. Loss one or two C-terminal d-Ala from the ion at m/z 676.3 gave ions at m/z 587.3 and 516.3, respectively. The peak at m/z 533.2 and 404.2 matched the expected mass of γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-(Nϵ-d-Asp)-d-Ala-d-Ala and l-Lys-(Nϵ-d-Asp)-d-Ala-d-Ala. These ions confirmed that one d-aspartate residue is branched to the l-lysyl residue. The remaining peaks can be accounted for by combinations of the fragmentations described above. For example, loss of one or two d-Ala from peak at m/z 533.2 resulted in the peaks at m/z 444.2 and 373.2, respectively.To gain insight in the specificity of Aslfm, d-[14C]Asp was replaced by 2-amino and 2-hydroxy acids, and their addition to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was determined by mass spectrometry. l-Asp was not a substrate, indicating that Aslfm is stereospecific. Product formation was not observed with d-Glu, d-Ala, d-iso-asparagine, and d-malic acid, indicating that Aslfm is highly specific for d-Asp in vitro. Finally, the radioactive assay confirmed that the ligase activity of Aslfm was dependent upon the presence of ATP and Mg2+ and independent from tRNA using RNase A (data not shown).Aslfm Is Functional in a Heterologous Host—To assess the in vivo activity of the d-aspartate ligase, plasmid pSJL2(aslfm) was introduced in E. faecalis JH2-2, which produces two transferases of the Fem family (BppA1 and BppA2) for the addition of an l-Ala2 side chain to the peptidoglycan precursors. This approach was used as versatile tools for gene inactivation have not been developed for E. faecium. Expression of the aslfm d-aspartate ligase gene under the control of a constitutive promoter led to production of the protein as determined by Western blot analysis with anti-Aslfm (Fig. 4A) and anti-His6 (Fig. 4B) antisera. d-Aspartate ligase activity was detected in extracts from E. faecalis JH2-2/pSJL2(aslfm) but not in the control strain harboring the vector pJEH11 used to construct pSJL2 (data not shown).FIGURE 4Heterospecific expression of the aslfm and racfm genes in E. faecalis JH2-2. Western blot analysis was performed with polyclonal anti-Aslfm (A and C) or anti-His6 (B and D) antibodies. Proteins (10 μg) from crude extracts of derivatives of E. faecalis JH2-2 harboring the vector pJEH11 (lane 1), pSJL2(aslfm) (lane 2) and pSLJ4(aslfm racfm) (lanes 3–6) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Induction of the aslfm and racfm genes of pSLJ4 was performed with IPTG at 0, 0.003, 0.03, and 0.3 mm (lanes 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). The Aslfm antiserum was raised against an Aslfm-His6 tagged protein and therefore contained anti-His6 antibodies (data not shown). This accounts for detection of Racfm-His6 in panel C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the impact of Aslfm ligase activity on growth rate and peptidoglycan composition, E. faecalis JH2-2/pSJL2(aslfm) and JH2-2/pJEH11 were grown in the presence or absence of d-Asp. The addition of d-Asp (50 mm) to the culture medium had no significant impact on the growth rate of the control strain E. faecalis JH2-2/pJEH11. The rp-HPLC profile of the muropeptides (Fig. 5A) and their structure determined by MS (Table 1) were indistinguishable from those previously reported for E. faecalis JH2-2 (21Arbeloa A.

Approximately 20% of the Escherichia coli proteome concerns inner membrane proteins (1Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins insert into the membrane via the Sec translocase (for review, see Ref. 2Dalbey R.E. Chen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, YidC has been identified as a novel membrane protein that facilitates insertion of a subset of membrane proteins on its own (3Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. van den Berg L. Kiefer D.

Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), where it contacts transmembrane (TM) insertion segments of newly synthesized membrane proteins (6Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). YidC is homologous to Oxa1 in mitochondria and Alb3 in chloroplasts (5Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The latter two proteins act as membrane protein insertases and play an important role in the membrane insertion of subunits from major energy transducing complexes (for review, see Refs. 9van der Laan M. Nouwen N.P. Driessen A.J.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and 10Yi L. Dalbey R.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In analogy, in E. coli the functional assembly of the F1F0 ATPase and cytochrome bo3 quinol oxidase is shown to be dependent on YidC (11van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J.M. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and YidC is also implicated in lipoprotein translocation (12Froderberg L. Houben E.N.G. Baars L. Luirink J. de Gier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31026-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that membrane insertion and assembly of the F0c subunit of the F1F0 ATPase solely depend on YidC (4van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). CyoA is the quinol binding subunit of the cytochrome bo3 quinol oxidase complex (13Abramson J. Riistama S. Larsson G. Jasaitis A. Svensson-Ek M. Laakkonen L. Puustinen A. Iwata S. Wikstrom M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Unlike F0c, CyoA is a polytopic membrane protein with a lipoprotein signal sequence and a large periplasmic domain (Fig. 1A). Here we report on the minimal requirements for insertion of pre-CyoA into the E. coli membrane using an in vitro approach. The data demonstrate that pre-CyoA is a substrate of a novel pathway that requires both the Sec translocase and YidC. Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain SF100 was used for the isolation of inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) 2The abbreviations used are: IMVs, inner membrane vesicles; PMF, proton motive force; TM, transmembrane. and for overexpression of SecYEG and YidC (14van der Laan M. Houben E.N.G. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The S135 lysate was prepared from E. coli MC4100.

Lübben, Department of Biophysics, Ruhr-Universitat-Bochum) were used for in vitro transcription of FtsQ and CyoA, respectively. In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Insertion Reaction—In vitro transcription was performed using the RiboMax® kit (Promega) with plasmids pBSKftsQ and pET27bCyoA as templates. In vitro translation-insertion reactions were performed as described (15van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) except that the reaction was coupled to the transcription and performed for 40 min at 37 °C. Other Methods—IMVs containing overproduced SecYEG or YidC were isolated as described (16van der Does C. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J.M.

Proteoliposomes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining to verify the reconstituted levels of SecYEG and YidC (14van der Laan M. Houben E.N.G. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M.

J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) assays, respectively. SecA was removed from the S135 lysate by immunodepletion and verified by immunoblotting using monoclonal SecA antibodies (15van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Co-translational Insertion of Pre-CyoA into Inverted E. coli Inner Membrane Vesicles—Subunit II (CyoA) of cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase (315 residues) from E. coli is synthesized as a precursor with an N-terminal signal sequence (pre-CyoA) that upon lipid modification of the mature N terminus is cleaved by signal peptidase II (18Ma J. Katsonouri A. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11298-11303Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mature CyoA with a mass of 32 kDa is composed of two domains, an N-terminal membrane region with two TM domains and a large periplasmic C-terminal domain (13Abramson J. Riistama S. Larsson G. Jasaitis A. Svensson-Ek M. Laakkonen L. Puustinen A. Iwata S. Wikstrom M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To study its membrane insertion, pre-CyoA was synthesized in vitro using an E. coli S135 lysate and [35S]methionine. In vitro synthesis of CyoA results in the formation of a 35-kDa protein visualized on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, lane 1). When the in vitro transcription/translation reaction was performed in the presence of SecYEG-overexpressed IMVs, trypsin treatment of pre-CyoA resulted in the formation of a 25-kDa protease-protected fragment (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Solubilization of IMVs with Triton X-100 resulted in complete degradation of pre-CyoA (Fig. 1B, lane 3). In its correct topology, the large periplasmic domain of CyoA is translocated into the vesicle lumen and thus becomes protected from externally added trypsin. The cytoplasmic loop connecting TM1 and TM2, however, will be accessible to trypsin. Based on the available crystal structure of CyoA (19Abramson J. Larsson G. Byrne B. Puustinen A. Garcia-Horsman A. Iwata S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1076-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), this cytoplasmic loop contains four possible trypsin cleavage sites (at amino acid positions 70, 74, 77, and 87). Trypsin cleavage at one or all of these sites will result in the removal of the signal sequence and part of N-terminal region of the mature CyoA yielding an ∼25-kDa fragment (ΔN-CyoA). Correspondingly, trypsin treatment of endogenous CyoA in inside-out IMVs yielded a 25-kDa protease-protected fragment that degraded upon solubilization of the membrane vesicles with Triton X-100 (Fig. 1C). We therefore conclude that the in vitro observed 25-kDa trypsin-protected fragment in the presence of IMVs represents correctly membrane-inserted CyoA. To examine the insertion mechanism of pre-CyoA, IMVs with high levels of SecYEG were used as described previously (16van der Does C. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Levels of overexpression for SecYEG were calculated to be at least 10-fold that of wild-type levels of SecYEG (see also Fig. 7). Although wild-type IMVs showed only a low level of inserted CyoA (Fig. 2, lane 2), overproduction of SecYEG (SecYEG+) enhanced membrane insertion more than 5-fold (lane 5). This correlates well with the observed 5–6-fold stimulation of proOmpA translocation into IMVs upon SecYEG overexpression 3D. J. F. du Plessis, N. Nouwen, and A. J. M. Driessen, unpublished data. (20van der Does C. den Blaauwen T. de Wit J.G. Manting E.H. Groot N.A. Fekkes P. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and shows that insertion of pre-CyoA is a SecYEG-mediated process. The low level of membrane insertion with wild-type IMVs has been observed more often with in vitro systems (15van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and likely results from a general inefficiency of in vitro translation/translocation reactions for inner membrane proteins and competing reactions such as aggregation. Other missing factors may contribute to the efficiency of membrane insertion, such as an intact lipid modification pathway needed to modify the mature N terminus of pre-CyoA prior to its processing by the lipoprotein peptidase. Finally, co-factor assembly and CyoB maturation may contribute to the overall efficiency of stably inserted CyoA.FIGURE 2Membrane insertion of pre-CyoA is facilitated by SecYEG. Pre-CyoA was synthesized in the presence of 25 μg of wild-type (WT) or SecYEG+ IMVs. After 40 min at 37 °C, samples were treated with trypsin without (lanes 2 and 5) or with 1% Triton X-100 (lanes 3 and 6) for 30 min on ice and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Lanes 1 and 4 represent 10% of the total translation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the in vitro assays, pre-CyoA was synthesized in the presence of IMVs (co-translational insertion). To investigate whether CyoA also inserts post-translationally, pre-CyoA was first synthesized in the absence of IMVs. Next, protein synthesis was blocked by chloroamphenicol, and SecYEG+ IMVs were added to allow insertion (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6). Although efficient insertion of pre-CyoA was observed under co-translational conditions (Fig. 3, lane 5), no pre-CyoA insertion could be detected under post-translationally conditions (lane 2). These data demonstrate that membrane insertion of pre-CyoA occurs co-translationally. The Proton Motive Force Is Not Required for Membrane Insertion of CyoA—The proton motive force (PMF) has been shown to play a pivotal role in the insertion of some membrane proteins such as M13 procoat (21Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and FtsQ (15van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that YidC depletion from cells results in a reduced capacity of cells to generate a PMF (11van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J.M. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The observed assembly defect of CyoA in YidC-depleted cells could therefore relate to a PMF requirement of the insertion reaction. Therefore, the role of the PMF in pre-CyoA insertion was examined in vitro. Insertion of pre-CyoA into wild-type and SecYEG+ IMVs was only marginally affected by the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin that collapse the entire PMF (Fig. 4A). In contrast, ionophore addition completely blocked membrane insertion of the control membrane protein FtsQ (Fig. 4B) (15van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that membrane insertion of pre-CyoA occurs independently of the PMF. Membrane Insertion of CyoA Requires Both SecYEG and YidC—To investigate the minimal requirements for insertion of pre-CyoA, proteoliposomes were used that contained purified YidC, SecYEG, or both YidC and SecYEG. Herein, a molecular YidC/SecY ratio of 3 was used as described previously (14van der Laan M. Houben E.N.G. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). No insertion was observed when pre-CyoA was synthesized in the presence of empty liposomes (Fig. 5A, lane 2) or proteoliposomes reconstituted with YidC only (lane 11). A low level of insertion was observed with proteoliposomes containing purified SecYEG (Fig. 5, lane 5), but co-reconstitution of YidC with SecYEG resulted in a drastic increase in the membrane insertion efficiency of pre-CyoA (lane 8). The increased level of pre-CyoA insertion was not because of differences in SecYEG reconstitution as the liposomes equally effective translocated the precursor protein proOmpA (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4). A further increase in the amount of YidC in the proteoliposomes only marginally improved the insertion (data not shown). Taken together, the above results indicate that both SecYEG and YidC are required for efficient membrane insertion of pre-CyoA. Membrane Insertion of Pre-CyoA Is Dependent on SecA—Membrane proteins with large periplasmic domains such as FtsQ (15van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8993-8997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and YidC (24Koch H.G. Moser M. Schimz K.L. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5715-5718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have been shown to require SecA for membrane insertion. As CyoA contains a large periplasmic domain (Fig. 1A), we next determined the SecA dependence of the insertion reaction. Pre-CyoA was synthesized in the presence of SecYEG/YidC proteoliposomes in a SecA-immunodepleted E. coli lysate. Although the lysate supported synthesis of pre-CyoA, no insertion could be observed (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6). When the lysate was supplemented with purified SecA, pre-CyoA insertion was restored (Fig. 6, lanes 7–9). This demonstrates a catalytic requirement for SecA. Mutations in SecY have been described that differently affect protein translocation and membrane protein insertion (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SecY39 (R357E mutation in the C5 cytoplasmic loop of SecY) is blocked in protein translocation (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shimohata N. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3997-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and exhibits a functional defect in the SecA/SecY interaction (27Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5128-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This mutant is also defective in the insertion of some signal recognition particle-dependent membrane proteins (27Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5128-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Koch H.G. Muller M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SecY40 (A363S) is defective in signal recognition particle-dependent membrane protein insertion but supports normal protein translocation (26Shimohata N. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3997-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Angelini S. Deitermann S. Koch H.G. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As pre-CyoA is a protein that contains both TM domains and a large periplasmic domain, we determined the effect of the SecY mutations on the membrane integration of pre-CyoA. IMVs were isolated from cells overproducing SecY(R357E)EG and SecY(A363S)EG and analyzed for pre-CyoA insertion. Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the SecY mutant proteins were overproduced to the same level as wild-type SecY (Fig. 7B). Both SecY(R357E)EG (Fig. 7A, lanes 7–9) and SecY(A363S)EG (lanes 10-12) IMVs showed a severe defect in the membrane integration of pre-CyoA as compared with SecYEG+ IMVs (lanes 4-6). The residual level of insertion above that of IMVs containing chromosomal levels of SecYEG (lanes 1-3)is in line with previous observations that these mutants are not completely defective (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that pre-CyoA is a substrate of a novel route that involves both the Sec translocase and YidC. Recently, we have shown that in E. coli the functional assembly of major energy-transducing complexes such as the H+-translocating F1F0 ATPase and cytochrome bo3 oxidase is strongly affected by the depletion of YidC (11van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J.M. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments demonstrate that the membrane insertion of F0c is solely mediated by YidC (4van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), thus establishing a novel route for membrane insertion of authentic E. coli membrane proteins, which involves only YidC. YidC is also required for membrane insertion of foreign small phage proteins such as M13 and Pf3 (3Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. van den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J.

Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) that apparently usurp the YidC pathway for their insertion. YidC also interacts with the SecYEG complex, and cross-linking approaches have shown that it contacts the TMs of newly inserted membrane proteins (5Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The role of YidC in the membrane insertion of these Sec-dependent membrane proteins is less understood as no strict requirement for YidC is demonstrated for their functional assembly (5Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 15van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We now show that pre-CyoA, the precursor of subunit a of the cytochrome bo3 quinol oxidase complex, utilizes both the Sec translocase and YidC for its insertion. We used an in vitro assay, which employed proteoliposomes with a defined protein composition, to reveal the minimal requirements for membrane insertion of pre-CyoA. For the first time, our data demonstrate a catalytic requirement for YidC by a membrane protein that inserts into the membrane in a Sec-dependent manner. This study explains why depletion of YidC in cells results in a loss of functional cytochrome o oxidase complex. Pre-CyoA insertion also requires SecA for its assembly, which most likely relates to the translocation of the large periplasmic domain of CyoA as expected for membrane proteins with periplasmic domains larger than 60 amino acids (30Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Pre-CyoA membrane insertion presumably occurs in the following manner. First, the signal sequence and the first transmembrane segment insert into the SecYEG channel as a helical hairpin. This state may resemble the recent cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a ribosome-SecYEG complex in which the N-terminal TM domain of FtsQ was inserted as a hairpin structure (31Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Shaikh T. Tama F. Jenni S. Brooks III, C.L. Ban N. Frank J. Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This process is likely followed by the lipid modification of the cysteine position of the mature N terminus of CyoA and then by the removal of the signal sequence by signal peptidase II. There are processes that are not monitored in the in vitro system as described in this study. During the lipid modification, TM2 of CyoA (Fig. 1A) must insert into the membrane, whereupon the large periplasmic domain of CyoA needs to be translocated across the membrane. TM2 likely loops into the SecYEG pore together with the N-terminal region of the periplasmic domain of CyoA. The translocation of the periplasmic domain likely involves SecA as this reflects a true translocation reaction. YidC may be involved in various stages of the insertion reaction. It may facilitate clearance of the SecYEG pore and promote transfer of the hairpin of the signal sequence and TM1 into the lipid phase. Alternatively, YidC may be involved in the insertion of TM2 that needs to loop into the translocation pore. The latter process resembles the insertion mechanisms of Foc and M13 in which YidC may facilitate looping in of a single or of both TM domains of these small membrane proteins. Future experiments should reveal how YidC facilitates membrane insertion of the various regions of CyoA. CyoA is the quinol binding subunit of the cytochrome o oxidase complex. CyoB is a very large heme-binding membrane protein of 74 kDa with 15 predicted TM domains, whereas CyoC is a smaller membrane protein of 20 kDa with 5 TM domains and an unknown function. Our current study deals with pre-CyoA, but in vivo, insertion of the subunits and their assembly into the cytochrome o oxidase complex is likely a coordinated process that also involves timely incorporation of the various co-factors. It will be a major challenge to elucidate the exact mechanism by which this energy-transducing complex assembles.

https://openalex.org/W1965851529,"The large clostridial cytotoxins toxin A and toxin B from Clostridium difficile are major virulence factors known to cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Both toxins mono-glucosylate and thereby inactivate small GTPases of the Rho family. Recently, it was reported that toxin B, but not toxin A, induces pore formation in membranes of target cells under acidic conditions. Here, we reassessed data on pore formation of toxin A in cells derived from human colon carcinoma. Treatment of 86Rb+-loaded cells with native or recombinant toxin A resulted in an increased efflux of radioactive cations induced by an acidic pulse. The efficacy of pore formation was dependent on membrane cholesterol, since cholesterol depletion of membranes with methyl-β-cyclodextrin inhibited 86Rb+ efflux, and cholesterol repletion reconstituted pore-forming activity of toxin A. Similar results were obtained with toxin B. Consistently, methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment delayed intoxication of cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In black lipid membranes, toxin A induced ion-permeable pores only in cholesterol containing bilayers and at low pH. In contrast, release of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored structures by phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase C treatment did not reduce cell sensitivity toward toxins A and B. These data indicate that in colonic cells toxin A induces pore formation in an acidic environment (e.g. endosomes) similar to that reported for toxin B and suggest that pore formation by clostridial glucosylating toxins depends on the presence of cholesterol.

Clostridium difficile toxin A and toxin B are major virulence factors implicated in antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis (1Bartlett J.G. Moon N. Chang T.W. Taylor N.

By mono-O-glucosylation at Thr-37 and Thr-35 of RhoA and Rac1/Cdc42, respectively, the GTPases are fixed in their inactive conformation and unable to interact with their effector molecules (7Aktories K. Just I. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 291: 113-145PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schirmer J. Aktories K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Just I. Gerhard R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 23-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Rho GTPases inhibits signaling mediated by these molecular switches, including organization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression, gene transcription, and the regulation of the activity of numerous enzymes (10Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar, 11Burridge K. Wennerberg K.

Recently, it was reported that toxins A and B are able to up-regulate the expression of Rho B (13Gerhard R. Tatge H. Genth H. Thum T. Borlak J. Fritz G. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1499-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The most apparent effect of toxins A and B is the destruction of the actin cytoskeleton accompanied by rounding up and arborization of cultured cells (14Fiorentini C. Thelestam M. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 543-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). C. difficile toxins A and B are large single-chained proteins of 308 and 270 kDa. Recent studies indicate a tripartite structure (15Von Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16Barroso L.A. Moncrief J.S. Lyerly D.M. Wilkins T.D. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 16: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain is located at the N terminus (17Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic stretch in the middle of the protein is thought to mediate membrane insertion and pore formation. The C terminus, which mainly consists of clostridial repetitive oligopeptides, takes part in membrane binding (18Dove C.H. Wang S.Z. Price S.B. Phelps C.J. Lyerly D.M. Wilkins T.D. Johnson J.L.

Accordingly, the actions of toxins A and B on mammalian target cells is suggested to follow a sequence of steps including membrane binding, endocytosis, translocation, (20Florin I. Thelestam M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and finally, catalytic modification of target GTPases (8Schirmer J. Aktories K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Thelestam M. Chaves-Olarte E. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Whereas the nature of the membrane receptor of toxin B is totally unclear, toxin A binding to various types of carbohydrate structures has been reported (23Krivan H.C. Clark G.F. Smith D.F. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 573-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Teneberg S. Lönnroth I. López J.F.T. Galili U. Halvarsson M.Ö. Ångström J. Karlsson K.A. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the precise type of receptor is still a matter of debate. Once taken up by endocytosis, two major trafficking pathways are known for bacterial toxins by which the catalytic activity reaches the cytosol. Cholera and Shiga toxin utilize the retrograde pathway; the toxins are transported from the endosomal compartment via the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum from where the catalytic domain is released to the cytoplasm (25Lencer W.I. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 293: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J.

Microbiol. 2004; 293: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Another group of toxins, including diphtheria, anthrax, or Clostridium botulinum C2-toxins, are translocated from acidic endosomes (“short trip model”) (28Lord J.M. Smith D.C. Roberts L.M. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Barth H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Here, the acidification of the endosomal lumen induces a conformational change of the corresponding polypeptides, resulting in an insertion of hydrophobic regions into the endosomal membrane. This is accompanied by pore formation and allows translocation of the catalytic domain. Consistently, bafilomycin, an inhibitor of the vacuolar H+-ATPase pump, inhibits intoxication of the corresponding toxins (31Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the case of large clostridial cytotoxins, the uptake mechanism is best understood for toxin B. In agreement with the short trip model, a pH-dependent conformational change and the inhibition of intoxication by bafilomycin have already been shown (13Gerhard R. Tatge H. Genth H. Thum T. Borlak J. Fritz G. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1499-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Florin I. Thelestam M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain could be detected in the cytosol (32Pfeifer G. Schirmer J. Leemhuis J. Busch C. Meyer D.K. Aktories K. Barth H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44535-44541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Rupnik M. Pabst S. Rupnik M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Urlaub H. Soling H.D. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The binding and translocation domains are thought to remain in the endosomes and to be transported to the lysosomes for consecutive degradation. Furthermore, toxin B was shown to form pores in cell membranes as well as in artificial membranes under acidic conditions. Although toxins A and B display 48% identity at amino acid sequence (15Von Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), no pore formation at cellular membranes could be detected for toxin A under the same conditions (31Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To clarify recent discrepancies in pore formation obtained with toxins A and B, we compared the interaction of both toxins with cells derived from colon carcinoma. When utilizing highly toxin A-sensitive HT-29 cells, we found a comparable formation of rubidium-permeable pores in target cell membranes under acidic conditions for both toxins. Moreover, we show that the pore formation of the toxins as well as the intoxication efficiency of cells is dependent on the presence of cholesterol. Regardless of the role of cholesterol, we excluded glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 2The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; Tox, toxin; rToxA, recombinant His-tagged ToxA; rToxAed, enzyme-deficient mutant of toxin A; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TER, transepithelial resistance; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; BLM, artificial black lipid membrane. -anchored structures as possible receptors for both toxins. Consistent with the rubidium release assays, toxin A was able to induce pores in artificial membranes only in the presence of cholesterol. Materials and Proteins—Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium (MEM) (1:1) and Dulbecco's MEM cell culture medium were from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). McCoy's 5A medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from PAN Biotech GmbH (Aidenbach, Germany). Cell culture materials were purchased from Falcon (Heidelberg, Germany). Rubidium-86 (specific activity 2 mCi/mg) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cholesterol and water-soluble cholesterol were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Toxins A and B from C. difficile VPI 10463 were purified as described (34Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Bacterial toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology.in: Aktories K. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 159-168Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged toxin A (rToxA) and an enzyme-deficient mutant of toxin A (rToxAed) were cloned and expressed in Bacillus megaterium and purified as described (35Burger S. Tatge H. Hofmann F. Genth H. Just I. Gerhard R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies directed against rToxA (α-rToxA) or rToxAed (α-rToxAed) were produced in rabbit. Cell Culture and Determination of Transepithelial Resistance—CHO-K1 cells were cultivated in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium (1:1), CaCo-2 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium, and HT-29 cells were cultivated in McCoy's 5A medium. All cells were routinely kept in tissue culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with medium containing 10% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were trypsinized and reseeded 2 or 3 times a week. For the transepithelial resistance (TER) assay, CaCo-2 cells were seeded on Falcon™ cell culture inserts and incubated 6–9 days with medium exchange every 3 days. Assays were performed when TER values reached ∼2000–3000 ohms·cm2. TER was determined using a resistance system for electrophysiological readings of filter cups (Endohm-12; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). To deplete cholesterol, cells were incubated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min at 37 °C before toxin treatment. To avoid a drastic drop in starting-TER due to treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, all washing and incubation steps were carried out using medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Toxin A (100 ng/ml; ∼300 pm) and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (0.5–2 mm) were applied to the upper compartment of the Falcon™ cell culture inserts, and decrease of TER was monitored for up to 9 h. 86Rb+ Efflux Measurements—86Rb+ efflux experiments were conducted essentially as described recently (31Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HT-29 or CHO-K1 cells were plated in adequate complete medium containing 86Rb+ (1 μCi/ml) at a density of ∼2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well cell culture plates. After 48–72 h cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 3 times and cooled down to 4 °C. Afterward, fresh medium (4 °C, without serum) containing toxin A, recombinant toxin A variants, or toxin B in varying concentrations was added. Toxins were allowed to bind for 30–60 min at 4 °C, and subsequently cells were washed 2 times with cold medium to remove unbound toxin. To initiate membrane insertion of the toxins, warm medium (37 °C; without serum, pH 4.5–7.5) was applied, and cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After a shift back to 4 °C, incubation was continued for 30 to 40 min at low temperature to allow 86Rb+ efflux. Aliquots of the medium were removed, and 86Rb+ release was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For inhibition of pore formation with anti-toxin A polyclonal antibody, native and recombinant toxins were preincubated with 1–30 μl of the corresponding antisera for 1 h at 4 °C. Afterward, the toxin-antibody mixture was used in 86Rb+ efflux assays. Alternatively, the antiserum was applied after toxin A binding at 4 °C for 1 h. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin Treatment and Repletion of Cholesterol—To deplete cholesterol, monolayers of 86Rb+-loaded HT-29 cells in 24-well cell culture plates were treated with 0.5–10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, and 11 mm glucose) for 20–40 min at 37 °C. After washing two times with buffer A, cells were incubated with toxin A and used for rubidium release assay as described above. Cholesterol (water-soluble) was loaded to cells by incubating control and cholesterol-depleted cells with cholesterol (0.1/0.25 mm cholesterol and 1/2.5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin, respectively) for 30 min at 37 °C. The unincorporated cholesterol was removed by washing the cells with buffer A before cells were used in the 86Rb+ release assay as detailed above. Black Lipid Bilayer Experiments—The methods used for black lipid bilayer experiments have been described previously in detail (36Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Membranes were formed either from a 1% solution of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) or from a 1% solution of a mixture of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (molar ratio 1:1) or from a 1% solution of oxidized cholesterol (36Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) in n-decane. Reduction of pH was achieved by the addition of predetermined amounts of 0.1% HCl to the volume on one or both sides bathing lipid bilayer membranes (37Andersen C. Schiffler B. Charbit A. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41318-41325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol-specific Phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Treatment of HT-29 Cells—Subconfluent HT-29 were incubated with 0.1 unit of PI-PLC/ml for 60 min at 37 °C (PI-PLC, Roche Applied Science), PI-PLC was removed, and the cells were incubated with toxin A (100 ng/ml; ∼300 pm) and toxin B (200 ng/ml; ∼740 pm), respectively, for 30 min on ice to allow cell binding. Unbound toxins were removed, and cell morphology was examined at 37 °C. The efficacy of PI-PLC treatment was checked by determination of the enzyme activity of alkaline phosphatase, which is a GPI-anchored membrane protein (38Netzer A. Gstraunthaler G. Ren. Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 16: 299-310PubMed Google Scholar). Pore Formation by Toxin A in HT-29 Cells—In the case of large clostridial cytotoxins, pore formation under acidic conditions was shown only for toxin B and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (31Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In all cells tested (e.g. CHO, HeLa, Vero), toxin A failed to induce pores under the same conditions. Because toxin A has been described as an enterotoxin with much less cytotoxic activity than toxin B on non-enterocytic cells, the susceptibility of cells is one possible explanation. To investigate pore formation by toxin A, highly susceptible enterocytic HT-29 and control CHO-K1 cells were preloaded with 86Rb+ before the toxins were applied at low temperature to allow binding but not internalization. To mimic the acidification in early endosomes, extracellular pH was decreased to pH values ranging from 4.5 to 5.6, and the cells were concomitantly shifted to 37 °C for 5 min. These conditions should enable the toxins to undergo the conformational change necessary for membrane insertion and pore formation. Upon membrane insertion, 86Rb+ was released from the cells through the pores, and therefore, the presence of 86Rb+ in the medium indicates pore formation. Cells that were kept at constant neutral pH and cells that were treated without toxins served as controls (pH values are as indicated in Fig. 1). As reported recently (31Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), when CHO cells were tested with 500 ng/ml toxin A (∼1.6 nm) and toxin B (∼1.8 nm), toxin A caused only an insignificant rubidium release compared with toxin B, which was used as positive control (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when HT-29 cells were used under the same conditions, toxins A and B produced comparable rubidium release (Fig. 1B). Therefore, toxin A has the same potential to induce pores in the cell membrane as toxin B in HT-29 cells. A 3-fold increase in toxin concentrations was not paralleled by a strong signal increase, most likely indicating the formation of a limited number of pores caused by saturation of toxin binding. As expected, denaturation of the toxins at 95 °C for 5 min before application completely inhibited toxin-dependent channel formation (Fig. 1B). The dynamics of 86Rb+-release were quite rapid. About 80% were released within 5 min after the acidic shift, and maximum values were reached after 30 min. An increase of the pH above pH 5.5 abolished pore formation (e.g. pH 5.6 in Fig. 1C; x-fold induction of rubidium release as compared with corresponding controls without toxin is shown; see also Fig. 2). Moreover, if the acidic shift was not paralleled by a temperature shift to 37 °C, no 86Rb+ release was detectable (Fig. 1C). All measurements presented here were conducted at pH 5, and efflux times were between 30 and 40 min if not otherwise mentioned. Note that the cells did not round up during the whole experimental procedure, indicating that no intoxication occurs under the chosen conditions (4 °C). Determination of EC50 and pH Optimum—To further characterize the toxin A-induced pore formation, a wide range of toxin A concentrations from 1 to 7500 pm were tested at pH 5 (see Fig. 2A). The x-fold induction of toxin A-induced 86Rb+ efflux is shown in Fig. 2A′, and the corresponding normalized values against maximum value are shown in Fig. 2A. The EC50 for toxin A-induced pore formation is in the range of 240 pm, and concentrations as low as 100 pm induced significant rubidium release from the cells. The concentration of toxin A (500 ng/ml; ∼1.6 nm), which was used in subsequent rubidium release assays, caused ∼90% of the maximal effect observed. Different pH values ranging from pH 6 to 4.5 were tested for the induction of 86Rb+ release, and the x-fold induction of pore formation as compared with the corresponding control at pH 7.5 is shown in Fig. 2B. Maximal effect in pore formation was detectable at pH 5. Further reduction of the pH did not increase signal strength. Above pH 5, rubidium release decreased with increase in pH values. At pH 5.5, 86Rb+ release was reduced to one-third of maximum values, and at and above pH 5.6 no pore formation was detectable (see also Fig. 1C). Here, 500 pm toxin A was used, but comparable results were achieved with 100 and 1000 pm toxin A (data not shown). Altogether, these data indicated that toxin A inserted into membranes of eukaryotic cells and increased the membrane permeability after exposure to low pH. Similar results were obtained with CaCo-2 cells (although signal strength was less pronounced; data not shown), demonstrating that pore formation was not restricted to HT-29 cells but was also true for other colonic cell lines susceptible to toxin A. Specificity of Toxin A-induced Pore Formation—To verify that the 86Rb+ release is toxin A-specific, different preparations of the toxin were used. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of toxin A-specific antisera on toxin binding and subsequent induction of 86Rb+ efflux was tested. HT-29 cells were preloaded with 86Rb+ and treated either with ToxA, a recombinant toxin A produced in B. megaterium (rToxA), or an enzyme-deficient mutant of toxin A (DXD mutant, produced in B. megaterium, rToxAed). The mutation of the aspartic acid residues at positions 286 and 288 to alanine in toxin B was formerly shown to reduce the enzymatic activity by about 1000-fold (39Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro J. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The corresponding residues in toxin A are at position 285 and 287, and their change to alanine also inhibited glucosyltransferase activity. 3R. Gerhard and I. Just, unpublished results. All three toxin variants induced the release of 86Rb+ after an acidic pulse from HT-29 cells in a comparable manner (Fig. 3A). Because the toxins were from different sources (B. megaterium), these findings indicated the specificity of pore formation. Similarly, toxin A highly purified by thyreoglobulin affinity chromatography had the same effect (data not shown). When the toxins were preincubated with toxin A-specific antisera before application to HT-29 cells, inhibition of pore formation was observed. An antibody raised against UDP-dialdehyde-inactivated recombinant protein (α-rToxA) reduced efflux of 86Rb+ to ∼25%, and an antibody raised against enzyme-deficient toxin A (α-rToxAed) reduced efflux of 86Rb+ to ∼15% of the maximum values (Fig. 3A) when the same amounts of the antibodies were used. These effects were comparable for all three toxin variants used. In contrast, when toxin B was preincubated with α-rToxA under the same conditions, no reduction of pore formation was detectable, indicating the specificity of anti-toxin A serum (Fig. 3B). A slight difference was observed when the antibody was either preincubated with the toxin before application (see above, Fig. 3B, pre) or applied to the cell suspension after toxin binding but before the acidic shift (Fig. 3B, post). Therefore, the antiserum is either able to partially extract toxin A already bound to the cell surface or it interferes with the conformational changes of the toxin responsible for membrane insertion and pore formation. The titration of the optimal amount of antibody for preincubation with toxin A is shown in Fig. 3C. The inhibitory effect of the antisera is also demonstrated by the prevention of cytotoxic effects of toxin A in cell culture. HT-29 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml (∼160 pm) toxin A or a toxin A-antibody mixture as indicated in Fig. 3D. Both antibodies completely abolished cell rounding. Cholesterol Dependence of Toxin-induced 86Rb+ Efflux—An increasing number of reports indicate a requirement for membrane cholesterol in membrane binding, insertion, and pore formation of bacterial protein toxins (40Palmer M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 238: 281-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of cholesterol depletion on membrane permeabilization by toxin A. HT-29 cells loaded with 86Rb+ were incubated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin at increasing concentrations (as indicated in Fig. 4A) for 30 min at 37 °C. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin is known to deplete cholesterol from cellular membranes (41Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). After washing, cells were cooled to 4 °C, and 86Rb+ release assay was performed as described above. Fig. 4A shows that methyl-β-cyclodextrin impaired pore formation in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction of 86Rb+ efflux was already detectable at concentrations of 0.5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin. At 1 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin, the compound inhibited membrane permeabilization by about 50%. 2.5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in complete inhibition. Toxin A and toxin B are supposed to accomplish their own uptake in the same way. Accordingly, when toxin B was tested in the same experimental setup, cholesterol depletion had the same inhibitory effect on toxin B-induced 86Rb+ release (Fig. 4A′). To verify a specific cholesterol-dependent effect, cholesterol was repleted after methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment. HT-29 cells treated either with 1 or 2.5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin were subsequently incubated with 0.1 or 0.25 mm water-soluble cholesterol, respectively, for 20 min at 37 °C before the 86Rb+ release assay was performed. The reduction in 86Rb+ release observed by cholesterol depletion was completely reversed after the re-addition of cholesterol in the case of the lower concentrations (1 mm/0.1 mm; Fig. 4B). The reversion was statistically significant with a p value of 0.0035. Higher concentrations of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (2.5 mm) and cholesterol (0.25 mm) had the same effect, but under this condition the recovery of the 86Rb+ efflux was not complete in comparison to the untreated control. This was due to loss of cells during the assay verified by the cholesterol control (see Fig. 4B, right panels, cells lost) and by light microscopy (data n"

M., Vaughan, L., Winterhalter, K. H., and Zimmermann, D. R. (1995) Development 212, 2303-2312). To test for an active involvement of these isoforms in the guidance process, we have now established protocols to isolate intact versican V0 and V1 in quantities sufficient for functional experiments. Using stripe choice assays, we demonstrate that pure preparations of either a mixture of versican V0/V1 or V1 alone strongly inhibit the migration of multipotent Sox10/p75NTR double-positive early neural crest stem cells on fibronectin by interfering with cell-substrate adhesion. We show that this inhibition is largely core glycoprotein-dependent, as the complete removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains has only a minor effect on the inhibitory capacity. Our findings support the notion that versican variants V0 and V1 act, possibly in concert with other inhibitory molecules such as aggrecan and ephrins, in directing the migratory streams of neural crest cells to their appropriate target tissues.

The highly precise and coordinated migration of neural crest cells during early phases of embryonic development is controlled by the differential expression of permissive substrates and non-permissive/inhibitory molecules within the pathways and the bordering tissues, and the set of membrane receptors present on the moving cells (reviewed by Refs. 1Krull C.E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Bronner-Fraser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 392-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Erickson C.A.

The journey of the multipotent neural crest stem and progenitor cells begins in the dorsal neural tube from where they emerge shortly after its closure. In the trunk region the cells are initially guided along a ventral trajectory before a second wave starts to invade the dorsolateral tissue underneath the ectoderm. Whereas the ventrally migrating populations differentiate into neurons and glia of the sensory and the sympathetic nervous system, the laterally progressing cells give rise to the melanocytes of the skin. On their route, neural crest cells pass through highly permissive extracellular matrices, which allow rapid cellular movements. These pathways are flanked by tissues that block neural crest cell immigration and thus provide the directional information. These barrier tissues, previously identified by microsurgical manipulations, include the posterior sclerotomes (5Bronner-Fraser M. Stern C. Dev. Biol. 1991; 143: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the perinotochordal region (6Pettway Z. Guillory G. Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and for a short period also the subectodermal matrix prior to melanocyte precursor invasion (7Erickson C.A. Duong T.D. Tosney K.W. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Consequently, the streams of neural crest cells, which originally emigrate in an unsegmented fashion from the dorsal neural tube, are on their ventral path canalized into the anterior sclerotome strictly avoiding the posterior somitic halves and the more ventrally localized perinotochordal zone. This particular migration behavior finally leads to the characteristic segmental pattern of the forming sensory and sympathetic ganglia. Since the major migration promoting substrates, fibronectin and laminin (8Rovasio R.A. Delouvee A.D. Yamada K.M. Timple R. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 462-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), are uniformly expressed in both halves of the somites (9Rickmann M. Fawcett J.W. Keynes R.J. J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 1985; 90: 437-455PubMed Google Scholar), the guidance of the migratory neural crest cells appears to depend mainly on inhibitory cues. Several extracellular matrix and cell surface components match the candidate profile for a migration blocking function as they are selectively expressed in non-permissive tissues. Molecules consistently absent from the pathways, but highly expressed within the barriers, include chondroitin 6-sulfate proteoglycans, peanut agglutinin (PNA) 4The abbreviations used are: PNA, peanut agglutinin; eNCSCs, early neural crest stem cells; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondinlike motifs. -binding glycoproteins (10Oakley R.A.

Unexpectedly, however, neither the gene inactivation of semaphorin3A (19Kawasaki T. Bekku Y. Suto F. Kitsukawa T. Taniguchi M. Nagatsu I. Nagatsu T. Itoh K. Yagi T. Fujisawa H.

These observations suggested that a concerted action of multiple inhibitory and some attractive cues are required to guide trunk neural crest cells in vivo (1Krull C.E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Santiago A. Erickson C.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu.

Prime candidates for a cooperative partnership with the cell surface contact inhibitors of neural crest motility are extracellular matrix components belonging to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and PNA-binding glycoproteins (10Oakley R.A. Lasky C.J. Erickson C.A. Tosney K.W. Development. 1994; 120: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Oakley R.A. Tosney K.W. Dev.

Krotoski D. Lallier T. Domingo C. Sorrell J.M. Bronner-Fraser M. Development. 1991; 111: 583-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Especially, the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans versican (27Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and aggrecan (28Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appear to be functionally involved in the inhibition. Both proteoglycans are members of the hyalectan family forming large complexes through interactions with hyaluronan and link proteins (29Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). They play key roles during development, as the constitutive abrogation of their expression leads in homozygous mice to early intra-uterine (versican) or perinatal death (aggrecan) (30Mjaatvedt C. Yamamura H. Capehart A. Turner D. Markwald R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 31Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). At least four different isoforms of versican (V0 to V3) exist as a result of alternative splicing of two exons encoding the central glycosaminoglycan carrying domains, glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-α and GAG-β (32Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zako M. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3914-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The largest splice variants of versican, V0 and V1, are highly expressed during embryogenesis and are frequently associated with little adhesive, fast-proliferating tissues displaying a high extracellular matrix turnover rate (34Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. Berl. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Landolt R.M. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. Development. 1995; 121: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Versican V2, a smaller central nervous system-specific isoform is in contrast produced late during neurogenesis (36Milev P. Maurel P. Chiba A. Mevissen M. Popp S. Yamaguchi Y. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is a potent inhibitor of axonal growth and hence, seems to participate in restricting the structural plasticity of myelinated fiber tracts and impede regeneration in the mature central nervous system (37Schmalfeldt M. Bandtlow C.E. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 807-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the expression of versican V0 and V1 is during neural crest cell migration tightly associated with the formation of barrier tissues in the trunk of chicken embryos (35Landolt R.M. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. Development. 1995; 121: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Versican V0 and V1 are selectively deposited in the posterior half of the sclerotome, transiently present within the dorsolateral subectodermal tissues and to a lesser extent expressed in the perinotochordal tissue where aggrecan appears to be the prominent hyalectan (38Domowicz M. Li H. Hennig A. Henry J. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Pettway Z. Domowicz M. Schwartz N.B. Bronner-Fraser M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This intriguing co-distribution of versican V0 and V1 with barrier tissues prompted us to isolate the intact forms of these large versican proteoglycan variants and to explore their potential guidance function in neural crest cell migration during early embryonic trunk development. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant fragments of the GAG-α or GAG-β domains of bovine, human, and mouse versicans were affinity purified from rabbit antisera previously prepared in our laboratory (32Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Schmalfeldt M. Bandtlow C.E. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies CS-56 recognizing intact chondroitin sulfate chains and ΔDi-6S specific for chondroitin 6-sulfate “stubs” exposed after chondroitinase ABC digestion were obtained from Sigma and Seikagaku, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against p75NTR were purchased from Chemicon and a monoclonal antibody specific for Sox10 (42Paratore C. Goerich D.E. Suter U. Wegner M. Sommer L. Development. 2001; 128: 3949-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Michael Wegner (University of Erlangen, Germany). For immunostaining of fibronectin the monoclonal antibody IST-4 (Sigma) was used. Isolation of Versican Isoforms—Intact versicans V1, V2, and a mixture of V0 and V1 were isolated from calf aorta, bovine spinal cord, and the spent culture medium of the human glioma cell line U251MG, respectively. Our previously developed procedure for the isolation of brain versican V2 was adapted for this purpose (40Schmalfeldt M. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15758-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 summarizes sources and steps involved in the protein-chemical purification of the individual isoforms. Bovine tissues obtained from the local abattoir were homogenized in 6 volumes of ice-cold extraction buffer containing 4 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm Pefabloc, 25 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, and 5 mm benzamidine and extracted overnight. After filtration through cheesecloth, the extract was cleared by centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The precipitate formed during dialysis was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Subsequently, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to reach 20% saturation. Proteins were allowed to precipitate overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 45 min the ammonium sulfate concentration was raised to 60% saturation. After an additional overnight incubation at 4 °C the precipitate was collected and resuspended in urea buffer (6 m urea, 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 6) followed by dialysis against 10 volumes of the same buffer. This crude extract was batch absorbed on Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) overnight and then packed into a column. The bound proteins were first washed with urea buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl and then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient to 1 m. 10-μl aliquots of each fraction were tested for the presence of versicans by slot blotting using antibodies against bovine GAG-α (V2) or GAG-β (V1) epitopes (40Schmalfeldt M. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15758-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Samples positive on the blot were pooled, dialyzed against 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8, and batch-absorbed overnight to hyaluronan-Sepharose, which had previously been prepared according to the method of Tengblad (43Tengblad A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 578: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) by coupling hyaluronan from bovine trachea (Sigma) to EAH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Separate hyaluronan-Sepharose batches were used for each versican isoform preparation to avoid cross-contamination. The hyaluronan-Sepharose affinity column was subsequently packed and washed with a gradient of 0.5 to 3 m NaCl. Finally, hyalectans were eluted with 4 m guanidinium buffer (4 m GdnHCl, 20 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8). After analysis with slot blotting, the versican-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to a volume of 500 μl using Biomax 100/Ultrafree-15 filters (Millipore). For the V1 preparation from aorta, an additional gel filtration step on Sepharose CL-4B was required to remove partially degraded versican. For this purpose, the column was equilibrated with 3 bed volumes of the GdnHCl buffer before loading of the sample. The column was run at a slow flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Every second fraction was tested for the presence of versican V1 on a slot blot. Antibody-reactive samples were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and concentrated. For the isolation of a mixture of versicans V0 and V1 from U251MG cell supernatants the proteoglycans were first precipitated from conditioned medium by adding ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation followed by purification with anion exchange and hyaluronan affinity chromatography as described above. Domain-specific antibodies recognizing the human versican homologues were used for the slot blot detection instead. To obtain core glycoproteins, 1 to 5-μg aliquots of the versican preparations were digested with 10 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) in chondroitinase buffer (40 mm Tris, 40 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc, 3 μm pepstatin, 4 μm leupeptin, pH 8.0). Reactions were allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Versican samples were separated on 4-15% PHAST SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Amersham Biosciences) under reducing conditions and stained with either Coomassie Blue (NOVEX colloidal blue staining kit, Invitrogen) or with silver stain (PHAST GEL Silver Kit; Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblotting, chondroitinase ABC-digested samples were resolved on 4-15% PHAST polyacrylamide gels followed by diffusion transfer onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) at 70 °C for 30 min. The blots were blocked with 3% dry milk in PBS for 30 min followed by incubation with the primary antibodies (all diluted 1:1000 in the blocking buffer) overnight. After washing, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies (BIOSOURCE International, CA; diluted 1:15000 in PBS) were allowed to bind for 1 h. The color reaction was performed with Western blue substrate solution (Promega). Preparation of Primary Cultures of Early Neural Crest Stem Cells (eNCSCs) and Embryonic Fibroblasts—eNCSCs cultures were derived from neural tubes of embryonic day 9 (E9) mice according to the protocol of Kléber et al. (44Kléber M. Lee H.Y. Wurdak H. Buchstaller J. Riccomagno M.M. Ittner L.M. Suter U. Epstein D.J. Sommer L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 45Kléber M. Sommer L. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3rd Ed. Elsevier, San Diego2006: 69-77Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos were gently squeezed out of the uterus. After cleaning with Hanks' balanced salt solution, the trunk region caudal of the heart extending to the most posterior somite was cut from the rest of the embryo with the help of forceps and tungsten needles. The isolated trunks were pooled and transferred to a digestion solution containing 0.4 units/ml Dispase (Roche Diagnostics) in Hanks' buffer without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The trunks were slowly triturated and then kept at 4 °C for 6 min. This procedure was repeated 3 times using a fresh digestion mixture. Finally the neural tubes were triturated again very gently to completely free them of all other tissues and then transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to stop the digestion reaction. The explants were subsequently grown on various substrates in SN1 medium (SN medium with 10 ng/ml of bovine fibroblast growth factor) while keeping the cultures in a gas tight modular incubator chamber flushed with 1% O2, 6% CO2 and balanced N2 (44Kléber M. Lee H.Y. Wurdak H. Buchstaller J. Riccomagno M.M. Ittner L.M. Suter U. Epstein D.J. Sommer L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from the trunk of E14.5 mouse embryos as described by Talts et al. (46Talts J.F. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 129: 153-187PubMed Google Scholar). Stripe Choice Assays—Stripe choice assays were done as described previously (37Schmalfeldt M. Bandtlow C.E. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 807-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (modified protocol from Vielmetter et al. (47Vielmetter J. Stolze B. Bonhoeffer F. Stuermer C.A.O. Exp. Brain Res. 1990; 81: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)). 20 × 20-mm glass coverslips were coated in alternating stripes of test and control substrates for migratory eNCSCs. The coating solutions of the test substrate contained variable concentrations of versican isoforms (0 to 100 μg/ml) admixed to 100 μg/ml human fibronectin, whereas the control lanes were treated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin (Roche Diagnostics) alone. To exclude major differences in the coating efficiency of fibronectin upon addition of versican to the test substrate, ratios of immunofluorescence staining intensities of control and substrate lanes were determined using the image software analySIS (Soft Imaging System/Olympus; region of interest: 480 μm2, n = 10 each) (Fig. 2). For each assay, three to four neural tubes were placed perpendicular to the stripe pattern, covered with little SN1 culture medium, and first incubated for 45 to 50 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere allowing the attachment of the explants. Once the tubes adhered to the substrate, the dishes were gently flooded with medium and kept at reduced oxygen levels. For this purpose, the dishes were placed in a gas-tight modular incubator chamber, which was flushed for 3 to 5 min with a gas mixture containing 1% O2,6%CO2 and balanced N2 to generate 3 to 6% actual levels of O2. eNCSCs were allowed to migrate out of the neural tube for 20 h and were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. They were either directly visualized by phase-contrast microscopy or processed for immunofluorescence staining. Alternatively, embryonic fibroblasts were allowed to emigrate onto the stripe pattern from the surface of small uncoated circular coverslips. Neural Crest Cell Adhesion Assay—For the adhesion assays, eNCSCs were isolated from E10.5 rat embryos as described (48Lee H.Y. Kleber M. Hari L. Brault V. Suter U. Taketo M.M. Kemler R. Sommer L. Science. 2004; 303: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and re-plated after 15 h in culture on plastic dishes coated with fibronectin alone (100 μg/ml), versican (75 μg/ml) alone, or a mixture of versican and fibronectin (75 and 100 μg/ml, respectively). The time course and saturation of the attachment was monitored by fixing the cells after 5, 15, 30, or 45 min of incubation. The number of cells that attached after 45 min on fibronectin alone was taken as 100%. Immunofluorescence Staining of Cells and Tissue Sections—eNCSCs were visualized by double immunofluorescence staining of fixed cultures with polyclonal antibodies against p75NTR (1:300 dilution; Chemicon) and with a monoclonal antibody against Sox10 (1:3 dilution (42Paratore C. Goerich D.E. Suter U. Wegner M. Sommer L. Development. 2001; 128: 3949-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). For this purpose, cells were first blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Subsequently they were incubated with the primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and then labeled for fluorescence detection with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (both 1:200 dilution; Jackson Laboratories). Alternatively, the substrate coats were immunostained in some experiments with polyclonal antibodies against the GAG-β domain of versican (dilution: 1:100) and with the monoclonal antibody IST-4 recognizing human fibronectin. For immunostaining of tissue sections, mouse embryos were formalin fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. 2-μm sections of the tissue were deparaffinized in xylene and re-hydrated by a dilution series of ethanol in water. Heat unmasking of the antigens was done in 10 mm Tris, 1.7 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.8, in a steam cooker for 2 min at 100 °C. The sections were two times washed in PBS for 5 min and subsequently blocked, first in 0.2% gelatin and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min and then in blocking buffer from a M.O.M. kit (mouse-over-mouse, Vector Laboratories). The incubation with the monoclonal antibody against Sox10 (1:6) and the polyclonal antibodies specific for versican GAG-β (1:1000) was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. All antibodies were diluted in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% gelatin, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (both Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200 in PBS. Counterstaining was done with Hoechst H33258 bis-benzimide stain (Invitrogen) for 2 min. Sections were finally washed in PBS and mounted in fluorescence mounting medium (Dako). Images were taken with an Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with a F-view II camera using the analySIS 3.2 software (Soft Imaging System). Red, green, and blue fluorescence were stored separately in the corresponding color channels in RGB-format. Brightness and contrast were adjusted with Photoshop 7.0. Isolation of the Proteoglycan Isoforms of Versican (V0, V1, and V2)—The preparation of the large isoforms of versican for functional studies has notoriously been difficult, as they are, except for versican V2, predominantly expressed in embryonic tissues yielding only very small quantities of the intact proteoglycans (49Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Shinomura T. Yamagata M. Uritani M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13517-13525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, adult tissues such as blood vessels contain frequently moderate amounts of immunohistochemically detectable versicans (50Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). At this stage, however, versican is largely present in fragments resulting from a physiological cleavage process involving ADAMTS proteases and/or other matrix degrading metalloenzymes (51Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Mazaneque J.C. Zimmermann D.R. Lemire J.M. Fischer J.W. Wight T.N. Clowes A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We therefore sought for new sources of intact versicans in tissues of young animals (calves) and in supernatants of cells in culture. Adapting our previously developed protein-chemical protocol to purify versican V2 from bovine brain (40Schmalfeldt M. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15758-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we were able to isolate a mixture of versican V0/V1 from the culture supernatant of the glioma cell line U251MG, versican V1 with trace amounts of V0 from calf aorta, and for biochemical comparison, versican V2 from bovine spinal cord (Fig. 1). Practically all the isoforms were intact revealing their characteristic high molecular mass core protein bands on SD"

Little is known about the mechanisms regulating CaR synthesis and degradation. Screening of a human kidney yeast two-hybrid library identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase dorfin as a binding partner for the intracellular carboxyl terminus of CaR. Interaction between CaR and dorfin was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from HEK293 cells. Ubiquitination of CaR was observed in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132; mutation of all putative intracellular loop and carboxyl-terminal lysine residues abolished ubiquitination of CaR. Coexpression with dorfin decreased the amount of total CaR protein and increased CaR ubiquitination, whereas a dominant negative fragment of dorfin had opposite effects. The AAA-ATPase p97/valosin-containing protein associates with both CaR and dorfin in HEK293 cells. Treatment with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, induced the appearance of the unglycosylated 115-kDa CaR form, which was further increased by exposure to MG132, or upon transfection with a dorfin dominant negative construct, suggesting that dorfin-mediated proteasomal degradation of immature CaR occurs from the endoplasmic reticulum. Because endogenous CaR in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells is also subject to degradation from the endoplasmic reticulum, dorfin-mediated ubiquitination may contribute to a general mechanism for CaR quality control during biosynthesis.

Macleod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). CaR belongs to family C of the GPCR superfamily, having structural similarities to metabotropic glutamate receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid, type B receptors, and some putative pheromone/taste receptors (1Brown E.M.

Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). Common to all members of family C is a large extracellular domain of more than 600 amino acids containing the agonist binding site, a heptahelical transmembrane domain, and a large intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail of more than 200 amino acids (1Brown E.M. Macleod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 2Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). Members of Family C, including CaR, function as dimers, stabilized either by a disulfide bond or non-covalent interactions (3Romano C. Yang W. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol.

Upon agonist stimulation, CaR activates diverse signaling pathways leading to changes in hormone secretion, cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis (1Brown E.M. Macleod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the structure, activation, and signaling of CaR, the biosynthesis, trafficking, targeting, and turnover mechanisms regulating CaR remain largely unexplored. To identify novel proteins that might regulate trafficking and/or targeting of CaR, the intracellular carboxyl terminus of CaR was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen of a human kidney cDNA library. One of the proteins identified in the screen was the E3 ubiquitin ligase dorfin (double-RING finger protein) (11Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dorfin was originally cloned from human spinal cord and is expressed in many organs, including kidney, liver, intestine, and the central nervous system (11Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dorfin localizes to a region near the centrosome in an aggresome-like structure in cultured cells (11Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, dorfin ubiquitinates superoxide dismutase-1 (12Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M.

Ubiquitination results in the attachment of ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid polypeptide, to the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues of target proteins, and requires the sequential actions of three enzymes. Final transfer of activated ubiquitin to target proteins is coordinated by the E3 ligase, which specifically interacts with both E2-ubiquitin and the target protein (15Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Dorfin contains two RING domains at its amino terminus, which function as recruiting motifs for specific E2s (11Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of dorfin has no identifiable motifs but has been shown to confer specificity of binding to synphilin-1 (13Ito T. Niwa J. Hishikawa N. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29106-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dorfin interacts directly with VCP (valosin-containing protein, also called p97 or Cdc48 homologue) (14Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Niwa J. Iemura S. Natsume T. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Tanaka K. Sobue G. J.

VCP assists in translocation of ubiquitinated proteins from the ER and acts as a chaperone, targeting ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation (16Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 6864: 652-656Crossref Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 17Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 8: 740-744Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 18Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J.

In this report, we characterize the functional interactions between CaR and dorfin in HEK293 cells and demonstrate that dorfin mediates CaR ubiquitination, leading to degradation by the proteasome. Both dorfin and CaR interact with VCP in HEK293 cells, and a dominant negative fragment of dorfin protects immature forms of CaR from degradation. Finally, endogenous CaR in MDCK cells is also subject to ER-associated degradation, suggesting a common mechanism may regulate quality control of both exogenously and endogenously expressed CaR. These results suggest that dorfin may recognize misfolded or nonfunctional CaR at the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Materials—Human kidney cDNA library and all the materials for the Y2H screen were purchased from Clontech. HEK293 and MDCK cells were from the American Tissue Culture Collection and used through laboratory passage number 30. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs and Promega. The EGFP-dorfin plasmid (dorfin chimera with EGFP at the amino terminus) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against dorfin (D-30) were generated as described previously (11Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The HA-ubiquitin plasmid was generously provided by Dr. Richard J. H. Wojcikiewicz (SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY). Monoclonal antibodies were from various sources (anti-FLAG M2 and anti-actin antibodies, Sigma; anti-HA antibody, Roche Diagnostics; anti-VCP antibody, Research Diagnostics; and anti-GFP antibody, Molecular Probes). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against CaR (LRG) was generated as described (20Goldsmith P.K. Fan G. Miller J.L. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (p42/44) polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. ECL anti-mouse and anti-rabbit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. MG132 and tunicamycin were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid Construction—CaR with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope (FLAG-CaR) was generated as described (21Zhang M. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11140-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CaR carboxyl-terminal (CaR-CT) fragments in the Y2H bait vector pGBKT7 were prepared by PCR using primers containing NdeI and SalI sites, using FLAG-CaR as template. PCR products were digested with NdeI/SalI and subcloned into NdeI/SalI-digested pGBKT7. Dorfin carboxyl-terminal fragments in the Y2H prey vector pACT2 were prepared similarly, using NcoI and XhoI sites. The dominant negative construct of dorfin was generated as a chimera with EGFP at the carboxyl terminus (DCT-EGFP). The DCT fragment containing dorfin residues 561–838 was prepared by PCR using primers containing BglII and SalI sites. The PCR product was digested with BglII/SalI and subcloned into BglII/SalI-digested PEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Another version of dominant negative dorfin (DCT-c-myc) was prepared similarly by PCR the DCT fragment using primers containing XbaI and HindIII sites. The PCR product was digested with XbaI/HindIII and subcloned into XbaI/HindIII-digested pcDNA3.1A(–) vector (Clontech). Another construct of dorfin (DNT-EGFP) containing the N-terminal RING-finger domains of dorfin from residue 1–367 was prepared by PCR using primers containing SacI and KpnI sites. The PCR product was digested with SacI/KpnI and subcloned into SacI/KpnI-digested pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Point mutations were generated by a modified inverse PCR mutagenesis method (22Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 814-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All PCR reactions used Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by dideoxy-DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Sequences of primers will be provided upon request. Y2H Assay Screening—Gal4-based Y2H library screening was performed by yeast mating as recommended in the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae MATa strain AH109 was transformed with bait plasmid containing CaR-CT (amino acids 866–1078) and incubated with yeast S. cerevisiae MATα strain Y187 pretransformed with human kidney cDNA library (Clontech) in 2xYPDA/Kan at 30 °C for 24 h. The mixture was plated on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp plates to screen for ADE2+ and HIS3+ clones. Plates were incubated at 30 °C until colonies appeared. Colonies were restreaked on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp plus X-α-gal plates to screen for MEL1+ clones. Clones that activated three reporter genes, ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1, were considered positive and identified by purifying plasmids and sequencing inserts. Directed Y2H studies were performed by cotransformation using the lithium acetate method (23Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Bait plasmids containing CaR-CT fragments and prey plasmids containing dorfin carboxyl-terminal fragments were cotransformed into AH109 and plated on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp plus X-α-gal plates. An interaction was considered positive when three reporter genes (ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1) were activated. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and MDCK cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (37 °C, 5% CO2). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Novafector (Venn Nova LLC, Pompano, FL) according to the manufacturer's instructions; experiments were done 72 h after transfection. For inhibitor studies, cells were treated with MG132 and/or tunicamycin (solubilized in Me2SO) for 12 h prior to lysis. Comparable levels of Me2SO had no effect on measured parameters. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Transfected HEK293 cells or MDCK cells were washed with PBS-EDTA and lysed on ice with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm iodoacetamide, plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were agitated for 30 min at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were mixed with loading buffer (12 m urea, 4% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 200 mm Tris) and separated on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (GFP, 1:500; LRG, 1:1000; HA, 1:1000; actin, 1:1000; D-30, 1:3000; or VCP, 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce). Assay of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was as previously described (21Zhang M. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11140-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When the same blot was probed for the presence of coprecipitated proteins, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped in Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) and probed with a second primary antibody. Immunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK293 cells were washed with PBS and lysed as described. After sonication on ice, samples were agitated for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated with 10 μl of protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) to minimize nonspecific binding. Samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were incubated with antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. 15 μl of protein G-agarose was then added, and samples were rotated overnight (4 °C). Precipitates were incubated in loading buffer for 30 min at 25 °C and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described. To detect specific ubiquitination, a two-step immunoprecipitation was performed. After the first immunoprecipitation as described, pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and incubated with 1% SDS/PBS for 30 min (25 °C) to disrupt non-covalent interactions. Samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were diluted with lysis buffer, followed by a second immunoprecipitation. The resultant precipitates were incubated in loading buffer and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described. Densitometry and Statistics—Blots were digitized using an Epson Expression 800 Photo scanner and quantified by densitometry using AlphaEaseFC StandAlone Software (San Leandro, CA). Results were mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments; graphs were generated using Sigma Plot 2000. Student's t test (two comparisons) was performed, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Y2H Screen Identifies the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Dorfin as a CaR-binding Protein—The cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of CaR (CT, residues 866–1078) was used as bait to screen a human kidney cDNA library (Fig. 1A). Positive clones were selected by activation of three reporter genes, ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1. Blast searches of the NCBI data base with positive clones identified in the screen yielded a fragment corresponding to the carboxyl terminus (residues 561–838) of the E3 ubiquitin ligase dorfin, an 838-amino acid protein (Fig. 1B) (11Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To localize the dorfin interaction site on the CaR carboxyl terminus, various truncations of the CaR carboxyl terminus (in pGBKT7), illustrated in Fig. 1A, were screened against the carboxyl terminus of dorfin (residues 561–838, in pACT2) after cotransformation in the AH109 strain. The full CaR-CT (residues 866–1078) interacted with dorfin, confirming the results of the initial screen. Truncations of the carboxyl end of CaR-CT were well tolerated, displaying positive interactions with dorfin. Only the smallest fragment, containing residues 866–886, did not interact with dorfin. Truncations from the amino terminus of the CaR-CT narrowed the region for interaction with dorfin to residues 880–900 (Fig. 1A). Complementary directed Y2H screens were performed to localize the CaR-CT interaction site on the carboxyl terminus of dorfin (residues 561–838). Any truncations from the carboxyl terminus of dorfin inhibited interactions with CaR-CT, whereas interaction with CaR-CT was retained upon removal of up to 100 residues from the amino terminus of the dorfin fragment (residues 561–660). The minimal fragment of the dorfin carboxyl terminus required for interaction with CaR-CT contains residues from 660–838 (Fig. 1B). Coimmunoprecipitation of CaR and Dorfin from HEK293 Cells Confirms Their Interaction—Human CaR having an amino-terminal FLAG epitope (FLAG-CaR) was transfected into HEK293 cells, and FLAG-CaR was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitate was separated on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE reducing gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-dorfin antibody D-30. Endogenous dorfin was observed as a doublet with molecular mass of ∼100 kDa in the presence (lane 1) but not in the absence (lane 2) of transfected FLAG-CaR (Fig. 2A, top panel). The two lower panels in Fig. 2 illustrate the expression of endogenous dorfin (probed with anti-dorfin antibody D-30) or FLAG-CaR (probed with anti-CaR LRG antibody) in cell lysates. These results confirm the interaction of full-length CaR and dorfin in HEK293 cells. To confirm that the dorfin fragment identified in the Y2H studies is required for the interaction of dorfin and CaR in mammalian cells, FLAG-CaR and full-length dorfin (EGFP-dorfin) or dorfin truncations (DNT-EGFP or DCT-EGFP) were tested for coimmunoprecipitation from HEK293 cells. DNT-EGFP contains the amino-terminal RING-finger domains of dorfin from residues 1–367; DCT-EGFP contains the carboxyl-terminal domain of dorfin from residues 561–838. Anti-FLAG antibody was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-CaR, and blots were probed with anti-GFP antibody to detect the dorfin species. EGFP-dorfin (130 kDa) and DCT-EGFP (60 kDa) coprecipitated with FLAG-CaR (Fig. 2B, top panel), but DNT-EGFP (68 kDa) did not. The middle and bottom panels of Fig. 2B illustrate expression of the indicated constructs in cell lysates when probed with anti-GFP (middle) or anti-CaR LRG (bottom) antibodies. These results confirm that the domain of dorfin mediating the interaction with CaR in yeast, i.e. the carboxyl terminus, is also required for the interaction of dorfin with CaR in mammalian cells. CaR Is Ubiquitinated—Interaction between CaR and dorfin suggests that CaR may be ubiquitinated. To test this possibility, FLAG-CaR and amino-terminal HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) were cotransfected into HEK293 cells, and a two-step, denaturing protocol was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-CaR. Briefly, anti-FLAG antibody was used to immunoprecipitate CaR, followed by treatment of the pellet with 1% SDS/PBS to disrupt non-covalent interactions between CaR and its associated proteins. The supernatant was diluted with lysis buffer and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. The Western blot was probed with anti-HA antibody to detect ubiquitinated species. Ubiquitination of CaR was observed in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, appearing in the range from 150 to >250 kDa, while ubiquitination was barely detectable in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). MG132 increased the amount of CaR protein (Fig. 3A, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that ubiquitination followed by proteasomal degradation contributes to regulation of CaR. Ubiquitin ligases covalently conjugate ubiquitin to lysine residues of target proteins. To confirm that CaR is ubiquitinated, we mutated intracellular lysine residues to arginine. There are nine lysine residues within the CaR carboxyl terminus (residues 863, 882, 897, 917, 931, 963, 965, 984, and 1002) and seven lysine residues within the three intracellular loops (residues 636, 644, 709, 717, 793, 796, and 805). When each lysine residue was mutated to arginine individually, the resulting mutants were still heavily ubiquitinated (data not shown). Because single point mutations did not abolish ubiquitination, CaR must be ubiquitinated at more than one lysine residue. All 16 lysine residues were therefore mutated to arginine simultaneously, and ubiquitination of the mutant, termed FLAG-CaR(0K), determined in the absence or presence of MG132 (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). FLAG-CaR(0K) was not ubiquitinated to a significant extent even in the presence of MG132. In addition, the amount of FLAG-CaR(0K) was not significantly changed upon addition of MG132 (100% in the absence versus 107.6 ± 10.7% in the presence of MG132) (Fig. 3A, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4), whereas wild-type FLAG-CaR was sensitive to MG132 treatment (100% in the absence versus 148.4 ± 4.7% in the presence of MG132) (Fig. 3A, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2). Both FLAG-CaR and FLAG-CaR(0K) achieved mature glycosylation consistent with plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3A, lower panel) (6Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and had a comparable ability to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon exposure of cells to 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). The absence of FLAG-CaR(0K) ubiquitination is not the result of an inability to associate with dorfin, because immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody of either FLAG-CaR or FLAG-CaR(0K) results in coprecipitation of comparable levels of endogenous dorfin (Fig. 3C, top panel). Also illustrated in Fig. 3C is the presence of endogenous dorfin (middle panel) or transfected FLAG-CaR (bottom panel) in cell lysates. These results confirm that CaR is ubiquitinated at multiple lysine residues and degraded by the proteasome. Dorfin Mediates CaR Ubiquitination—Dorfin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and interacts with CaR and, therefore, likely mediates CaR ubiquitination. To test this possibility, FLAG-CaR and HA-Ub cDNAs were cotransfected into HEK293 cells, without or with EGFP-dorfin cDNA. Anti-FLAG antibody was used to immunoprecipitate CaR; Western blots were probed with anti-HA antibody to detect ubiquitinated species. In the absence of dorfin, a low level of CaR ubiquitination was detected; cotransfection with dorfin dramatically increased CaR ubiquitination (Fig. 4A). HEK293 cells express endogenous dorfin (data not shown, but see, e.g. Figs. 2A or 3C), and thus basal CaR ubiquitination (in the absence of cotransfected dorfin) might be catalyzed by endogenous dorfin. To test this possibility, we used DCT-EGFP as a dominant negative to interfere with ubiquitination mediated by endogenous dorfin. This construct cannot catalyze ubiquitination of substrates, because it does not contain the amino-terminal RING domains, which are essential for interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (11Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of HEK293 cells with FLAG-CaR, HA-Ub, and DCT-EGFP resulted in a reduction in CaR ubiquitination, compared with ubiquitination mediated by endogenous dorfin (-DCT) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the E3 ubiquitin ligase dorfin mediates ubiquitination of CaR. Dorfin Regulates the Amount of CaR Protein in HEK293 Cells—Because dorfin mediates CaR ubiquitination, it must contribute to regulation of total cellular CaR protein. FLAG-CaR cDNA was transfected into HEK293 cells with increasing amounts of EGFP-dorfin cDNA (Fig. 5A). Total cDNA was kept constant with pcDNA3.1. The expression of CaR and dorfin were characterized by immunoblotting lysates from HEK293 cells with either anti-CaR LRG antibody (Fig. 5A, top blot) or anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 5A, bottom blot). Actin was used as a loading control (Fig. 5A, middle blot). When dorfin was increased, the amount of CaR decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). The graph in Fig. 5A shows averaged results for three independent experiments and demonstrates a significan"

In this study, the functional roles of the p12 subunit of pol δ were studied. The inter-subunit interactions of the p12 subunit were determined by yeast two-hybrid assays and by pulldown assays. These assays revealed that p12 interacts with p125 as well as p50. This dual interaction of p12 suggests that it may serve to stabilize the p125-p50 interaction. p12 was shown to be a novel PCNA-binding protein. This was confirmed by identification of a PCNA-binding motif at its N terminus by binding assays and by site-directed mutagenesis. The activities and reaction products of recombinant pol δ containing a p12 mutant defective in PCNA binding, as well as purified recombinant pol δ and its subassemblies, were analyzed. Our results indicate that p12 contributes to PCNA-dependent pol δ activity, i.e. the p12-PCNA interaction is functional. Our data indicate that both p12 and p68 are required for optimal pol δ activity. This supports the hypothesis that the interaction between pol δ and PCNA is a divalent one that involves p12 and p68. We propose a model in which pol δ interacts with PCNA via at least two of its subunits, and one in which p12 could play a role in stabilizing the overall pol δ-PCNA complex as well as pol δ itself.

DNA pol δ is the key enzyme that is thought to play a central role in the elongation of both the leading and the lagging strands of DNA and the maturation of Okazaki fragments (1Bell S.P. Dutta A.

Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2817-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mammalian pol δ holoenzyme consists of the p125 catalytic subunit (which harbors both 5′–3′ DNA polymerase and 3′–5′-exonuclease activities) and a tightly associated second subunit p50; this core is associated with two other subunits, p68 and p12, that are also referred to as the third and fourth subunits (5Lee M.Y.

The fourth subunit of mammalian pol δ, p12, is a 12-kDa protein identified by its association with highly purified pol δ from calf thymus (9Liu L. Mo J. Rodriguez-Belmonte E.M. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18739-18744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). S. pombe pol δ also possesses a fourth subunit, Cdm1 (22Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), that is nonessential (23Reynolds N. Watt A. Fantes P.A. MacNeill S.A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) but is absent in S. cerevisiae pol δ, which is a three-subunit enzyme (12Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the fourth subunits of pol δ play a minor role in pol δ function. However, it has been reported that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of p12 causes a significant decrease in the FGF2-driven proliferation rate of FGF2-T-MAE cells (24Dell'Era P. Nicoli S. Peri G. Nieddu M. Ennas M.G. Presta M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); this suggests that p12 is nonessential but is required for efficient chromosomal DNA replication in mammalian cells. Studies of the reconstitution of human pol δ subcomplexes using tagged subunits have shown that the trimer lacking p12 (p125/p50/His-p68) exhibits less than 10% of the activity of the tetrameric pol δ holoenzyme, although the trimeric complex lacking p68 (p125/His-p50/p12) appeared to be fully active (25Podust V.N. Chang L.S. Ott R. Dianov G.L. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3894-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) when assayed on poly(dA)/oligo(dT) templates in the presence of PCNA. These findings point to an important role for p12 in pol δ function, and the finding that the trimeric complex lacking p68 exhibits PCNA-stimulated activity indicates that one or more of the other three subunits must be able to interact with PCNA. However, the trimeric complex containing p125, p50, and p12 has not been rigorously characterized, and the exact mechanisms of how the p12 subunit contributes to the PCNA-dependent activity of polδ are largely unknown. In this study we have identified the subunit contacts of p12, and we show that it binds to both p125 and p50 and may function to stabilize the pol δ complex. In addition, we show that p12 is a PCNA-binding protein and contributes to the binding of pol δ to PCNA. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except as otherwise indicated. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Qiagen (Stanford, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against p125 (78F5) and p50 (13D5 and 17D2) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p68 and p12 were as described previously (26Xie B. Mazloum N. Liu L. Rahmeh A. Li H. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions—Wild type His-tagged p68 was constructed by insertion of the full-length p68 cDNA sequence between the NdeI and HindIII sites of the pTacTac vector with eight histidine residues added at its N terminus. His-tagged p125 or p50 was constructed by insertion of the full-length p125 or p50 cDNA sequence between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET33b vector, respectively. His-tagged p12 was constructed by insertion of the full-length p12 cDNA sequence between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET15b vector. GST full-length p21, p125, p50, p12, and p12 deletion mutants were generated by the PCR. The generated PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, subcloned in-frame into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-5X-3, and sequenced. A His-p12 mutant (His-p12Mt) that lost PCNA binding activity was generated. This was done by mutation of Ile-7, Ser-10, and Tyr-11 in the PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box to alanines using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA). The primer pairs were as follows: p12 5′-GGGCCGGAAGCGGCTCGCGACTGATGCCGCACCGGTTGTGAAGAGGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTCCTCTTCACAACCGGTGCGGCATCAGTCGCGAGCCGCTTCCGGCCC-3′. A unique restriction site for NruI, which is underlined in the primer sequences given above, was created to screen the mutants. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing after cloning into pET15b. Protein Purifications—GST fusion or His-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21DE3(plys) and purified by the use of either glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). His-p12 and His-p12Mt were further purified using Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Wild type human PCNA expressed in E. coli was purified using conventional chromatography as described previously (20Xu H. Zhang P. Liu L. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4512-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). GST Pulldown Assays—GST or GST fusion proteins (0.5 μg) in GST binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were mixed with purified p125, His-p50, His-p12, or His-p68 (0.5 μg of protein). The reaction mixtures were incubated by gentle rocking for 2 h at 4 °C, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for another 2 h at 4°C, and washed five times with binding buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted with either anti-His monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti-p125 monoclonal antibody (78F5).

Mazloum N. Liu L. Rahmeh A. Li H. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pFastBac-p12Mt was generated by PCR using pET15b-12Mt as template. p12Mt baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). For expression and purification of the recombinant enzymes, 50 ml of 2 × 106/ml insect Hi Five cells in suspension culture were co-infected with the different combinations of p125, p50, p68, and p12 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 48 h. Cell pellets were lysed in 20 ml of TGEE (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) buffer and disrupted by a French press. The supernatant was diluted five times with TGEE buffer and loaded onto a 5-ml anti-p125 (78F5) immunoaffinity column (27Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 0.4 m NaCl TGEE buffer and eluted with 30% ethylene glycol, 0.4 m NaCl, TGEE buffer. The peak fractions were combined, diluted five times with TGEED (TGEE plus 1 mm dithiothreitol) buffer, loaded onto a Mono-Q 5/5 column, and eluted with a 0 to 1 m NaCl gradient in TGEED buffer. The pol δ complex eluted between 350 and 450 mm NaCl. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for Detection of PCNA-p12 Protein-Protein Interactions—Purified E. coli His-p12 and His-p12Mt were diluted to a concentration of 0.001 μg/μl in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and 100 μl was added to the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate and allowed to coat overnight at 4 °C. For the control experiment, BSA was substituted for His-p12 or His-p12Mt in the coating step. Wells were rinsed three times with ELISA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20), then blocked with ELISA buffer containing 3% BSA, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Increasing amounts of PCNA in ELISA buffer containing 1% BSA were added to appropriate wells and allowed to incubate overnight at 4 °C. Wells were emptied and washed four times with ELISA buffer. The primary mouse monoclonal antibody against PCNA (1:2000 dilutions; PC-10 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was then washed four times with ELISA buffer; secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase; Pierce) was diluted 1:5,000 in ELISA buffer containing 1% BSA and added to appropriate wells to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were rinsed five times. Complexes were detected using TMB substrate (Pierce) and then quenched with 1 n sulfuric acid for 10 min. Absorbance readings were taken at 450 nm. ELISA was also performed by coating a 96-well plate with 0.001 μg/μl purified PCNA and adding increasing amounts of purified His-p12, His-p12Mt, or BSA. DNA Polymerase Assays—Assays using sparsely primed poly(dA)/oligo(dT) assay were performed as described previously (4Byrnes J.J. Downey K.M. Black V.L. So A.G.

Standard reactions for the poly(dA)/oligo(dT) assay contained 0.25 OD units/ml poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (40:1), 200 μg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 100 cpm/pmol [3H]TTP, and ∼0.2 unit of pol δ in the absence or presence of 100 ng of PCNA in a total volume of 30 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and were terminated by spotting onto DE81 papers that were then washed four times with 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 7.8, once with 95% ethanol, and counted. One unit of pol δ activity catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTMP per h at 37 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by PAGE of the products as described (28Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. Mallaber L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 0.25 OD units/ml of poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (40:1), 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 μm dTTP, 0.5 μCi/mol [α-32P]dATP, the indicated amounts of PCNA, and 10–40 ng of pol δ. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of salmon testis DNA (10 mg/ml) in 20 mm EDTA. The DNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% xylene cyanol. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 2 min, cooled on ice, and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. Assays using M13 DNA as the template were performed as follows. M13mp18 DNA (New England Biolabs) was primed with 20-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACC-3′) complementary to nucleotides 6262–6243. An M13 DNA/primer mixture (1:2 molar ratio) in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl was heated at 70 °C for 15 min and annealed by slow cooling overnight to room temperature. The standard reaction contained 10 ng of pol δ, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 50 mm NaCl, 250 μm each of dTTP, dCTP, dTTP, and 25 μm dATP, 3 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, 100 ng of primed M13 template, 80 ng of RFC, 200 ng of RPA, and variable amounts of PCNA in a 30-μl reaction volume. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and were terminated by the addition of 20 mm EDTA. The reaction products were run on 1.5% alkaline agarose gels at 50 V for 2.5 h. The gels were visualized with a PhosphorImager. PCNA Overlay Assay—PCNA gel overlay for the detection of PCNA-binding proteins was performed as described previously by the use of digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled PCNA as a probe (20Xu H. Zhang P. Liu L. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4512-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Yeast Pairwise Assay—Yeast pairwise assays for protein-protein interactions were performed as described previously (19Zhang P. Mo J.Y. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L. Mazloum N. Xu H. Lee M.Y. J. Biol.

By using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we tested the ability of p12 to interact with p125, p50, or p68 (Fig. 1A). Human p125, p50, and p68 coding sequences were inserted into the pAS2-1 vector and tested for their pairwise interactions with p12 inserted in the pACT-2 vector using the yeast two-hybrid system. For these experiments, the yeast transformants were grown and the lysates tested for β-galactosidase activity. The results were compared on the basis of the relative specific activities (arbitrary units of β-galactosidase activity per unit of cell culture density). The results show that p12 interacts with both p125 and p50 but not with p68 (Fig. 1A). In order to confirm the yeast two-hybrid data, interactions between p12 and the other three subunits were examined by systematic GST pulldown assays using purified pol δ subunits. GST-p12 and GST-p50 were tested for their ability to pull down purified recombinant p125 or p68. GST-p50 could pull down purified p125 and His-p68, although GST-p12 interacted with p125 but not with His-tagged p68 (Fig. 1B, a and b). The interaction between p12 and p50 was confirmed by a pull-down assay using GST-p12 and p50 (Fig. 1B, c) and by the reciprocal pulldown assay using GST-p50 and p12 (Fig. 1B, d). GST-p125 could pull down p50 and p12 but not p68 (Fig. 1B, e–g). A diagram of the interactions between the subunits of human pol δ based on these experiments is shown in Fig. 1B, h. The p125, p50, and p68 subunits form a linear arrangement. p12 bridges p125 and p50. This ability of p12 to bind to both p125 and p50 is consistent with the view that it serves to strengthen the interaction between them, effectively functioning as a brace. p12 Interacts with PCNA Directly and Is Part of a Network of pol δ-PCNA Interactions—We have tested the ability of p12 to bind to PCNA. A PCNA overlay assay was performed using DIG-labeled PCNA (20Xu H. Zhang P. Liu L. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4512-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) on His-p125, His-p50, His-68, and His-p12. GST-p21 (29Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar, 30Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. The overlay assay (Fig. 2A) showed that p12 interacted strongly with DIG-PCNA, although His-p50 and GST did not. In the same experiment, His-p68 and His-p125 also interacted with PCNA. The band for p125 is weaker than those for p68 and p12, but this may be due in part to a lower protein loading as shown by the protein stain for the membrane in Fig. 2B. These results show that p12 is a PCNA-binding protein and that p68 and p125 are also detected as PCNA-binding proteins in the same overlay blot. This clarifies previous issues as to which subunits of pol δ have the capacity to interact with PCNA and raises some important questions regarding the network or architectural arrangement of the overall protein-protein interactions of the pol δ-PCNA complex that is required for DNA replication (see “Discussion”). Identification of the Interaction Site of p12 That Is Involved in PCNA Binding—A panel of GST-p12 deletions was constructed and purified. These purified proteins and control proteins, GST-p21 (29Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar, 30Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and GST, were loaded at equal amounts onto SDS-PAGE and subjected to the PCNA overlay assay. Only the GST-p12-(1–31) fusion protein bound to PCNA (Fig. 3A). GST, GST-p12-(32–72), GST-p12-(73–107), GST-p12-(20–107), and GST-p12-(30–107) fusion proteins did not show any interaction with PCNA (Fig. 3A). This indicates that the binding region for PCNA lies in the N-terminal 31 residues of p12. The failure of the GST-p12-(20–107) fusion protein to interact with PCNA (Fig. 3A) narrows the region to residues 1–19. PCNA, besides being a critical partner of pol δ in the process of chromosomal DNA replication, also binds to a number of other proteins involved in DNA transactions (31Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 32Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The sequences responsible for PCNA binding have been found to conform to a loose consensus sequence, the PIP box (Table 1). Examination of the first 19 N-terminal amino acid residues of p12 indicates that there is a putative PCNA-binding motif (KRLITDSY) between amino acid residues 4 and 11 (Table 1). In order to establish that this was the PCNA-binding sequence, a p12 mutant (“p12Mt”) was constructed in which residues Ile-7, Ser-10, and Tyr-11 in the putative PIP box were mutated to alanines. His-p12 and His-p12Mt were expressed in E. coli and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (see “Experimental Procedures”). Purified His-p12 and His-p12Mt were examined by Western blotting using anti-His antibody or overlay analysis using DIG-PCNA. Western blot analysis showed that equal amounts of His-p12 and His-p12Mt were loaded (Fig. 4). Although His-p12 interacted with DIG-PCNA, His-p12Mt lost its ability to interact with DIG-PCNA (Fig. 4).TABLE 1PIP boxes of PCNA-binding proteinsProteinResiduesPIP boxHs p21144-151QTSMTDFYHs p68456-463QVSITGFFHs FEN1337-344QGRLDDFFHs DNA ligase 12-9QRSIMSFFHs MCMT164-171QTTITSHFSp Cdm1aThe PIP box in p12 is conserved in S. pombe Cdm1, although it is as yet unknown if the latter is a PCNA-binding protein.14-21NTNIRDVFHs p124-11KRLITDSYPIP boxQXXZXXF(F/Y)a The PIP box in p12 is conserved in S. pombe Cdm1, although it is as yet unknown if the latter is a PCNA-binding protein. Open table in a new tab Next, ELISAs were used to analyze the interaction between p12 and p12Mt with PCNA. ELISA plates were coated with His-p12, His-p12Mt, or BSA. Increasing amounts of PCNA were then added to the plate (see “Experimental Procedures”). PCNA bound to the wells coated with His-p12 but not to wells coated with His-p12Mt or BSA (Fig. 5A). Alternatively, a 96-well plate was coated with purified PCNA, and increasing amounts of His-p12, His-p12Mt, or BSA were added (Fig. 5B). His-p12Mt did not bind to the PCNA-coated wells. Nonlinear regression analysis of the data gave a value of ∼240 nm for the apparent Kd value for the binding of p12 to PCNA. These results prove that p12 interacts with PCNA directly and that this interaction is mediated through a sequence that is a novel member of the PIP box motif. The Contribution of p12 to the PCNA-stimulated Activity of pol δ—Our findings raise an important possibility that p12 may play a significant role in the pol δ-PCNA interaction. p12, together with p68 and p125, could form a triad of interactions that mediate pol δ-PCNA interaction, assuming that all three subunits are capable of interacting with PCNA when in the pol δ-PCNA complex. In order to gain further insights into the roles of the p12 and p68 subunits in PCNA-pol δ interactions, we characterized the PCNA-dependent enzyme activities of pol δ and its subassemblies. For this study the recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified to near-homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography and Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). The subunits were not tagged in order to avoid potential steric effects on pol δ assembly that could compromise the data. The first parameter we examined was the specific activities of the purified preparations when determined by the commonly used assay for pol δ activity. This assay determines activity using a poly(dA)/oligo(dT) template in the presence of PCNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). We compared the p125 subunit alone, p125/p50, p125/p50/p68, p125/p50/p12, and p125/p50/p68/p12. The data are summarized in Fig. 6 as a bar graph of the relative specific activities, with that of the holoenzyme taken as 100. The specific activity of the holoenzyme was 20,000 units/mg protein, which is comparable with the values we have reported previously for reconstituted human pol δ and calf thymus pol δ (7Mo J. Liu L. Leon A. Mazloum N. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Xie B. Mazloum N. Liu L. Rahmeh A. Li H. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The relative specific activities were also normalized to reflect the activities based on the molar content of the p125 subunit (Fig. 6, shaded bars). (The relative specific activities of all five pol δ assemblies in the absence of PCNA were very similar, at ∼2,000 units/mg.) The data, interpreted in the simplest context that there are no conformational changes that affect the p125 catalytic subunit when it is assembled in larger complexes, would reflect the strength of the PCNA-pol δ interaction and thereby the combined contributions of the individual subunits to PCNA binding. The p125 catalytic subunit and the p125/p50 assembly were not significantly stimulated by PCNA, as we have shown previously (26Xie B. Mazloum N. Liu L. Rahmeh A. Li H. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41:"
https://openalex.org/W2057678823,"The vasoactive hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) probably triggers inflammatory cardiovascular diseases by activating transcription factors such as NF-κB. We describe here a novel mode of NF-κB activation in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to Ang II. Ang II treatment resulted in an increase in the phosphotransferase activity of the IKK complex, which was mediated through the AT1 receptor subtype. The typical phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα were not observed. Rather, Ang II treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells led to the phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536, a signal detected in both the cytoplasm and the nuclear compartments. The use of pharmacological inhibitors that inhibit the activation of MEK by Ang II revealed that phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 did not require the MEK-ERK-RSK signaling pathway. On the other hand, specifically targeting the IKKβ subunit of the IKK complex by overexpression of a dominant negative version of IKKβ (IKKβ K44A) or silencing RNA technology demonstrated that the IKKβ subunit of the IKK complex was responsible for the detected phosphoserine 536 signal in Ang II-treated cells. Characterization of the signaling pathway leading to activation of the IKK complex by Ang II revealed that neither epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation nor the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT signaling cascade were involved. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the proinflammatory activity of Ang II is independent of the classical pathway leading to IκBα phosphorylation and degradation but clearly depends on the recruitment of an IKK complex signaling cascade leading to phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536.

It binds to two distinct receptor subtypes, designated AT1 and AT2 (7De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T.H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the known effects of Ang II are relayed through binding of the AT1 subtype, and studies in models of vascular injury have demonstrated that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system or gene disruption of the AT1 receptor can prevent the development of atherosclerosis (8Aberg G.

Indeed, it is a hypertrophic factor for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and cardiac myocytes and has mitogenic effects for different cell types, such as cardiac fibroblasts (for review, see Refs. 13Schelling P. Fischer H. Ganten D. J. Hypertens. 1991; 9: 3-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Raizada M.K. Phillips M.I. Sumners C.

Interestingly, other studies have demonstrated that Ang II has proinflammatory actions by promoting an increase in the expression level of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and several chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (for reviews, see Refs. 16Suzuki Y.

Activation of the Ang II AT1 receptor (AT1R) in VSMC is functionally linked to the recruitment and activation of cytosolic kinases such as the classical Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), protein kinases C, calmodulin (CAM) kinases, and Janus kinases. These kinases can in turn lead to the activation of transcription factors involved in gene regulation and the growth promoting effect of Ang II (15Meloche S. Pelletier S. Servant M.J. Mol. Cell.

The NF-κB family is represented by five members: p50, p65(RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB. In resting cells, they exist as homo- or heterodimers that are sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form through their association with one of several inhibitory molecules, namely IκB-α,-β,-ϵ, p105, and p100. These inhibitors mask the nuclear localization sequence in the Rel homology domain of NF-κB, thereby preventing it from accumulating in the nucleus (for recent reviews, see Refs. 27Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar and 28Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). IκBα is the most characterized member in this family. It is composed of three domains: an N-terminal signal responsive domain, a central ankyrin repeat domain that interacts with NF-κB, and a C-terminal PEST domain that is responsible for the basal turnover of the protein (29Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the classical pathway, the first phase of NF-κB activation mainly consists of the regulated degradation of IκBα and is triggered by prototypical activators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, lipopolysaccharide, IL-1β, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These stimuli induce the phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 in the N-terminal signal responsive domain by the canonical IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits called IKKα and -β and one regulatory subunit IKKγ. Phosphorylated IκBα is subsequently polyubiquitinated and targeted to the 26 S proteasome complex, resulting in the release and nuclear accumulation of NF-κB, which can now stimulate target gene transcription. Studies report that Ang II can stimulate degradation of IκBα, but the decrease in its expression level is very small suggesting the existence of other pathways to regulate NF-κB activity (24Han Y. Runge M.S. Brasier A.R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 26Wolf G. Wenzel U. Burns K.D. Harris R.C. Stahl R.A. Thaiss F.

Part of this second phase involves phosphorylation of the p65 subunit, which plays a key role in determining both the strength and duration of the NF-κB-mediated transcriptional response (for recent reviews, see Refs. 30Chen L.F.

The sites of phosphorylation reported to date are Ser276 and Ser311 in the Rel homology domain and three phosphoacceptor sites located in the transactivation domain, Ser468, Ser529, and Ser536. Several candidate kinases that phosphorylate each serine residue have been identified, such as protein kinase A and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 for Ser276 (32Zhong H. Voll R.E.

Importantly, phosphorylation at Ser536 was recently shown to reduce the ability of p65 to bind IκBα (36Bohuslav J. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Mu Y. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26115-26125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and to allow the recruitment of TAFII31, a component of the basal transcriptional machinery (37Buss H.

Phosphorylation at Ser536 is also responsible for recruitment of coactivators such as p300 (38Chen L.F. Williams S.A. Mu Y. Nakano H. Duerr J.M. Buckbinder L. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7966-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and also triggers its rapid turnover in the nucleus (39Lawrence T. Bebien M. Liu G.Y. Nizet V. Karin M. Nature. 2005; 434: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). All these evidences support the importance of p65 phosphorylation at Ser536 in the function of NF-κB. Notably, a recent study proposed that Ang II induces NF-κB through a RSK-dependent pathway leading to Ser536 phosphorylation of p65 (40Zhang L. Ma Y. Zhang J. Cheng J. Du J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In light of these interesting findings, we have set up experiments to identify more precisely the molecular mechanism by which Ang II induces proinflammatory action in VSMC and now describe a series of studies dissecting the novel mechanism by which Ang II activates NF-κB. We show that following binding to the AT1R, Ang II leads to an increase in the phosphotransferase activity of the IKK complex, which leads to phosphorylation of p65 on Ser536. Because IκBα is not degraded in response to Ang II, we propose a model where it is the phosphorylation of p65 on Ser536 that is likely to be involved in the proinflammatory actions of Ang II in VSMC. Reagent, Antibodies, and Plasmids—Ang II was purchased from Hubakel Scientific (St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada). EGF and TNF-α were from BioSource (Camarillo, CA). The tyrphostin AG1478, a selective EGFR kinase inhibitor, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, the MEK1/2 inhibitors UO126 and PD98059 were all from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). G418 was from Invitrogen. Commercial antibodies were from the following suppliers: anti-IKKγ (SC-8330), anti-IκBα (SC-371), anti-p65 (SC-372), and anti-IKKα (SC-7218) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-β-actin clone AC-74 (A5316) was from Sigma; anti-IKKβ antibody, phospho-IκBα (Ser32) antibody (number 9241), phospho-AKT (Ser473) antibody (number 9271), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202-Tyr204) antibody (number 9101), phospho-p65 (Ser536) antibody (number 3031), and phospho-RSK (Ser380) antibody (number 9341) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-phosphotyrosine, clone 4G10, and anti-Lamin A/C were from Upstate Cell Signaling Solution (Lake Placid, NY). An antibody that recognizes both p105 and p50 was a generous gift of Dr. John Hiscott (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα-(1-54) has been described (41Gravel S.P. Servant M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7477-7486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GST-p65-(354-551) was produced by subcloning PCR-amplified fragments in pGEX-KG. The resulting construct were transformed in Escherichia coli and following isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction (1 mm for 3 h at 37°C), purified over a glutathione-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences). The expression plasmids pTrack-Flag-IKKβ (K44A) and pCDNA3.1-HA-AT1R were provided by Drs. John Hiscott and Stephane Laporte (McGill University), respectively. Cell Types and Transfection—Rat VSMC and VSMC overexpressing a dominant-negative version of EGFR (HERCD533) (42Voisin L. Foisy S. Giasson E. Lambert C. Moreau P. Meloche S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C446-C455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Sylvain Meloche (University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec) and Darren Richard (Laval University, Quebec, Quebec) and grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm-glutamine, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO. All experiments were conducted on cells at passage levels 9-14. Quiescent VSMC were obtained by incubation of 95% confluent cell cultures in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5 μg/ml transferrin for 48 h. For experiments with pharmacological inhibitors, the cells were treated with vehicle alone or with the indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 30 min before addition of Ang II. 293T cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. All cells tested negative for mycoplasm contamination. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Two 21-nucleotides siRNA duplexes with 2-nucleotides (2-deoxy)-thymidine 3 overhangs were obtained from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) and directed against rat IKKβ: IKKβ number 1 (nucleotide 1460 to 1478 (AAACCAGCATCCAGATTGA)) and IKKβ number 2 (nucleotide 2028 to 2046 (GAATGTGTCTCGACTTAGT)). A siCONTROL non-targeting silencing RNA (siRNA) (number D-001210-01-20) was as described previously (41Gravel S.P. Servant M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7477-7486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded into six-well plates (8.0 × 105 cells/well) without antibiotics. After 24 h, cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. siRNA were used at a concentration of 120 nm in transfections. Cells were harvested for analysis 72 h after transfection. Retrovector Construction, Transduction, and Generation of Rat VSMC Overexpressing IκBα2NΔ4—The pMSCVneo IκBα2NΔ4 retrovector was a kind gift of Dr. John Hiscott (McGill University) and has been described (43Kwon H. Pelletier N. DeLuca C. Genin P. Cisternas S. Lin R. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7431-7440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Phoenix Amphotropic packaging cell line was transiently transfected with plasmids pMSCVneo and pMSCVneo IκBα2NΔ4. At 48 h post-transfection, retrovirus-containing medium was harvested and used to infect rat VSMC. VSMC were infected twice at 24-h intervals in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma); selection with 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was started 5 days later. After 14 days, a population of resistant VSMC was selected. For selection of clones from both rat VSMC (Neo) and rat VSMC (IκBα2NΔ4), cloning rings were used, and expression of the transgene was verified by immunoblot analysis. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). DNase-treated (Ambion, Austin, TX) cellular RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Sigma) in a 20-μl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCRs were subsequently performed per the manufacturer's specifications with the following primers: rat IL-6 forward and reverse, 5′-TGTTGTTGACAGCCACTGC-3′ and 5′-TTTCAAGATGAGTTGGATGGTC-3′ respectively; rat MCP-1 forward and reverse, 5′-CAGGTCTCTGTCACGCTTCT-3′ and 5′-AGTATTCATGGAAGGGAATAG-3′, respectively, and rat RPL32 forward and reverse, 5′-GTGAAGCCCAAGATCGTC-3′ and 5′-GAACACAAAACAGGCACAC-3′, respectively. PCR were performed using the following schedule: denaturation, annealing, and primer extension at 94, 56, and 72 °C for 1, 1, and 2 min, respectively, for 30 cycles. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized using a gel documentation device (Typhoon scanner 9410). Immunoblot Analysis—After the different treatments, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell extracts were prepared using Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10-4 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10-6 m leupeptin, 10-6 m pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min and equal amounts of lysate proteins (30-75 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5, 10, or 12% acrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and fixed for 10 min in methanol/acetic acid/glycerol (40:7:3). Immunoblot analysis of IκBα and β-actin were accomplished as described previously (41Gravel S.P. Servant M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7477-7486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phospho-IκBα (Ser32), phospho-AKT (Ser473), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202-Tyr204), phospho-p65 (Ser536), and phospho-RSK (Ser380) were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Both anti-p65 and anti-IKKβ were used at 1 μg/ml. Rabbit anti-p105/p50 and monoclonal antibody 4G10 were used at 1:1000 and 1:5000, respectively. In Vitro Kinase Assays—The phosphotransferase activity of the IKK complex was measured as described previously (41Gravel S.P. Servant M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7477-7486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 to 400 μg of whole cell extracts were incubated for 4 h at 4°C with specific antibody to IKKγ (anti-IKKγ (SC-8330)) preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2,and 2mm dithiothreitol). IKK complex activities were assayed by resuspending the beads in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μgofGST substrates (GST-IκBα or GST-p65) as indicated, 20μm ATP, and 20μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 5× Laemmli's sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Following Coomassie staining, the gels were dried and exposed to a Gel Documentation device (Typhoon scanner 9410, Amersham Biosciences) for imaging and quantification. In some experiments, the upper part of the gel was electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes and immunoprecipitated IKK complex was revealed by immunoblotting. Phosphorus 32 Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Quiescent VSMC in 100-mm Petri dishes were metabolically labeled for 4 h at 37 °C in bicarbonate and phosphate-free Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.75 mCi/ml [32P]phosphoric acid. The cells were then stimulated by the addition of 100 nm Ang II or 20 ng/ml TNF-α to the medium for the indicated periods of time. Following a quick wash with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, whole cell extracts were prepared as described above and precleared for 1h with 10 μl of normal rabbit serum and incubated for 4 h at 4°C with anti-p65 antibody preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed six times with lysis buffer. Protein complexes were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in denaturating sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels. The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol, and exposed to a gel documentation device (Typhoon scanner 9410, Amersham Biosciences) for imaging and quantification. The membranes were used in immunoblotting experiments using anti-p65 antibody to verify the immunoprecipitated p65. Biosynthetic Labeling Experiments—To examine the turnover of IκBα protein, quiescent VSMC in 100-mm Petri dishes were pulse-labeled for 1 h with 166 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and then chased for the indicated times in serum-free medium containing excess methionine and cysteine and either Ang II or TNF-α. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Lysates (500 μg of protein) were precleared for 1 h with 5 μl of normal rabbit serum and the resulting supernatants were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads preabsorbed with 2 μg of anti-IκBα for 4 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed five times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in denaturing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels. The IκBα protein was detected by fluorography and visualized using a gel documentation device (Typhoon scanner 9410, Amersham Biosciences). Electromobility Shift Assays—Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts as well as electromobility shift assays was accomplished as described previously (44Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). NF-κB-dependent Chemokine Gene Induction by Ang II in VSMC— Because controversy exists in the literature as to know whether Ang II has the ability to activate NF-κB transcription factor (45Sano M. Fukuda K. Sato T. Kawaguchi H. Suematsu M. Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Harada M. Saito Y. Ogawa S. Circ.

This mutant molecule has been shown to abrogate totally NF-κB induction by different stimuli. It involves mutation of the IκB serine phosphorylation sites to alanine (S32A/S36A) and removal of the C-terminal PEST domain to generate a form of IκB (IκBα2NΔ4). The basal turnover of this mutated IκB is diminished but most importantly, IκBα2NΔ4 is no longer responsive to inducer-mediated phosphorylation and degradation, and thus acts as a transdominant repressor of the NF-κB pathway (by sequestering NF-κB subunits in the cytoplasm) (43Kwon H.

https://openalex.org/W2117556618,"Friedreich ataxia is a human neurodegenerative and myocardial disease caused by decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Proteomic analysis of the mutant yeast model of Friedreich ataxia presented in this paper reveals that these cells display increased amounts of proteins involved in antioxidant defenses, including manganese-superoxide dismutase. This enzyme shows, however, lower activity than that found in wild type cells. Our results indicate that this lack of activity is a consequence of cellular manganese deficiency, because in manganese-supplemented cultures, cell manganese content, and manganese-superoxide dismutase activity were restored. One of the hallmarks of Friedreich ataxia is the decreased activity of iron/sulfur-containing enzymes. The activities of four enzymes of this group (aconitase, glutamate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, and isopropylmalate dehydratase) have been analyzed for the effects of manganese supplementation. Enzyme activities were recovered by manganese treatment, except for aconitase, for which, a specific interaction with frataxin has been demonstrated previously. Similar results were obtained when cells were grown in iron-limited media suggesting that manganese-superoxide dismutase deficiency is a consequence of iron overload. In conclusion, these data indicate that generalized deficiency of iron-sulfur protein activity could be a consequence of manganese-superoxide dismutase deficiency, and consequently, it opens new strategies for Friedreich ataxia treatment.

FRDA patients suffer from multiple symptoms, including progressive gait and limb ataxia, hypertrophic cardiomyophathy, and diabetes mellitus (2Rötig A. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Trends Mol.

However, although a large number of studies link frataxin to iron metabolism, its precise function remains a matter of debate. Frataxin has been suggested to play a role in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis (3Gerber J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 4Yoon T.

In hearts from FRDA patients, decreased activities of iron-sulfur-containing proteins and increased mitochondrial iron accumulation have been reported (12Rotig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conditional knock-out mice in neuronal and cardiac tissues have been developed as an animal model for FRDA. Accordingly, this model displays iron accumulation and decreased activity of iron-sulfur proteins (13Puccio H. Simon D. Cossee M. Criqui-Filipe P. Tiziano F. Melki J. Hindelang C. Matyas R. Rustin P. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Consequently, some therapeutic approaches under study suggest reducing the degree of iron accumulation by chelators or prevent its prooxidant effects by the use of antioxidants such as idebenone, a coenzyme Q analogue (2Rötig A. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

Frataxin and Yfh1 are mitochondrial proteins; the S. cerevisiae mutant in the YFH1 gene (Δyfh1) accumulates iron and shows decreased activities of iron-sulfur-containing enzymes (14Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar); and finally, human frataxin complements Δyfh1 mutant strains (15Cavadini P. Gellera C. Patel P.I. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2523-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Despite the great amount of data obtained with these different model systems, the analysis of the proteome of frataxin-deficient cells has not been addressed. Thus, we have focused on the effects of the absence of frataxin on the cellular proteome of yeast. One of the major findings is that, although the amount of the antioxidant enzyme manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is increased, its activity is decreased in Δyfh1 cells. This deficiency contributes to lowered activities of several iron-sulfur-containing enzymes, one of the hallmarks of Friedreich ataxia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOrganisms and Culture Conditions—S. cerevisiae W303 and its isogenic null Δyfh1 derivative (MML298) were kindly provided by Dr. Enrique Herrero from the Universitat de Lleida (16Rodriguez-Manzanequem M.T.

It carries upstream and downstream regulatory sequences and is cloned in pRS416, an ARS-CEN-URA vector. Yeast cells were grown in rich medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) with either 2% glucose (YPD) or 3% glycerol (YPG) by incubation in a rotary shaker at 30 °C. Raffinose synthetic medium contained 2% raffinose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 0.25% ammonium sulfate, a mixture of amino acids, and the required auxotrophic supplements (17). The Δyfh1 mutant transformed with pRS416-YFH1 plasmid was maintained in synthetic medium without uracil. Before each experiment the strain was transferred to rich medium for 4–5 generations.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, plus 8 m urea and disrupted using glass beads. An equal volume of 8 m urea, 8% CHAPS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol was added to the lysed cells, and after centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 5 min) 10 μl of the supernatant were diluted in 350 μl of rehydration buffer (18Reverter-Branchat G. Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31983-31989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing was performed in immobilized pH gradient strips (3–10 NL; Bio-Rad). Second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were scanned in a GS800 densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with PDQuest software (Bio-Rad).Analyses—Total cellular iron was determined under reducing conditions with bathophenanthroline sulfonate as chelator (19Tamarit J. Irazusta V. Moreno-Cermeño A. Ros J. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 351: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Manganese content was assayed in a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Superoxide ion levels were measured in a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5000, Shimadzu). Exponentially growing cells were washed in water and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% glycerol and 5 μg/ml the superoxide specific probe dihydroethidium (DHE) (Fluka) (20Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nystrom T. Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The rate of oxidation of DHE was calculated from the rate of increase in fluorescence for 30 min (excitation 520 nm, emission 590 nm).Enzyme Activities—Cell extracts were prepared using glass beads and assayed as described in the following references: aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase (16Rodriguez-Manzanequem M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), glutamate synthase (21Cogoni C. Valenzuela L. Gonzalez-Halphen D. Olivera H. Macino G. Ballario P. Gonzalez A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 792-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), isopropylmalate dehydratase (22Kohlhaw G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), superoxide dismutase (23Luk E.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Antibodies against superoxide dismutases were from Stress-Gene (SOD-111, Mn-SOD) and from Chemicon (AB1237, CuZn-SOD). Anti-Aco1 aconitase (from R. Lill, Marburg, Germany) and anti-succinate dehydrogenase (from B. Lemire, University of Alberta) antibodies were also used. A peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was used for detection. Image acquisition was performed in a ChemiDoc CCD camera (Bio-Rad).RESULTSAnalysis of the Proteome of Δyfh1 Cells by Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Tissues affected in FRDA are those with elevated oxidative metabolism, like heart and nervous system (2Rötig A. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, unless otherwise stated, our experiments were carried out on yeast cells grown in rich medium containing glycerol (YPG), because in this medium cells exhibit high respiration rates. It is worth mentioning that the ability of this strain to grow in a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol has been described previously (24Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 25Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Duby G. Foury F. Ramazzotti A. Herrmann J. Lutz T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Wild type and Δyfh1 cells were harvested during exponential phase and the crude extracts analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Spots that repetitively showed at least 2-fold difference in protein amount between both strains were identified and are shown in Table 1. Similar results were found in cells grown on rich medium containing glucose (YPD) (Fig. 2). Cells deficient in YFH1 clearly exhibit increased amounts of enzymes involved in the oxidative stress response. Among these proteins, four thiol peroxidase isoenzymes have been identified. These enzymes eliminate H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxides with the use of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase as thiol-reducing donor (27Park S.G. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), two proteins that are also induced in Δyfh1 cells. Two additional enzymes involved in the oxidative stress response that have been identified are both mitochondrial and cytosolic SODs. These enzymes catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into O2 and H2O2 (28Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2689) Google Scholar). The increased expression of these eight proteins indicates an endogenous situation of oxidative stress in Δyfh1 cells. It is interesting to mention that no changes in the expression of antioxidant enzymes were observed by gene expression analysis of Δyfh1 mutant cells using DNA microarrays (25Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), even though the strain used had the same genetic background in both studies. A partial explanation to this fact is that, in the reference cited, many of the induced genes code for membrane proteins that are poorly resolved in two-dimensional gels. Furthermore, lack of concordance between proteomic and transcriptomic analysis is not unusual (29de Nobel H. Lawrie L. Brul S. Klis F. Davis M. Alloush H. Coote P. Yeast. 2001; 15: 1413-1428Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), thus highlighting the importance of both approaches.TABLE 1Proteins identified differentially expressed in wild type and Δyfh1 cellsProteinGeneSpotsCoverageFold inductionYPDYPG%Thiol peroxidase 1TSA1730.610.6 ± 3.17.1 ± 3.0850.2Thiol peroxidase 2TSA21313.4>21.0>14.0Thiol peroxidase 3AHP1970.45.6 ± 2.78.5 ± 0.61062.01122.21239.11635.6Thioredoxin reductaseTRR1137.7>25.0>20.0Thioredoxin 1TRX21537.83.9 ± 0.214.7 ± 4.5Mitochondrial thiol peroxidasePRX1630.35.3 ± 0.48.3 ± 0.6CuZn-superoxide dismutaseSOD11470.05.5 ± 0.34.0 ± 0.3Manganese-superoxide dismutaseSOD2542.04.0 ± 0.93.0 ± 0.3Triosephosphate isomeraseTPI1222.71.9 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.9466.2Adenylate kinaseADK1335.62.1 ± 0.32.9 ± 1.3 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Analysis of the proteome of wild type and Δyfh1 cells grown in YPD by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

This result was further confirmed by Western blotting using specific antibodies (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, when the enzymatic activity of Mn-SOD (coded by SOD2) was analyzed, we found that in Δyfh1 cells it was lower than in wild type cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The decreased Mn-SOD activity resulted in increased steady state levels of superoxide anion inside yeast cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, the rate of oxidation of DHE, a superoxide-specific probe, is increased by 2-fold in YFH1-deficient cells.FIGURE 3Decreased superoxide dismutase activity in Δyfh1 and effect of manganese supplementation. A, cultures of wild type, Δyfh1, Δyfh1-YFH1, and Δyfh1 plus 100 μm MnCl2 were grown in YPG medium, and cell lysates (20 μg of protein) were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis and SOD activity staining. Western blot analysis of total cell extracts against Sod1 and Sod2 was performed under denaturing conditions; B, wild type (white bars) and Δyfh1 cells (gray bars) were grown in YPG medium supplemented with the indicated amounts of MnCl2. Cell lysates were analyzed for SOD activity in native gels. Bands corresponding to Mn-SOD were measured with a densitometer and the relative density calculated (Quantity One software, Bio-Rad); C, wild type (white bars) and Δyfh1 cells (gray bars) were grown in YPG medium supplemented with the indicated amounts of MnCl2 and analyzed for the rate of oxidation of DHE by endogenous superoxide. Data are represented as means ± S.E. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Trying to unravel the cause of Mn-SOD deficiency in Δyfh1 cells, we first analyzed the manganese content of wild type and Δyfh1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, manganese concentration in the latter was 20% of that found in wild type cells, suggesting that manganese transport could be altered in that strain. To further confirm that this altered phenotype is a consequence of YFH1 deficiency, we transformed the Δyfh1 strain with a plasmid containing the YFH1 gene with its own promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”), and transformants (Δyfh1-YFH1) were analyzed for the altered parameters. As shown in Fig. 3A, Mn-SOD activity, as well as Sod1 and Sod2 protein levels, were restored. Also, Δyfh-YFH1 cells displayed manganese and iron concentrations close to those found in wild type cells (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Total cellular manganese and iron concentrations of wild type, Δyfh1, and Δyfh1-YFH1 cells. A, wild type (white bars) Δyfh1 cells (gray bars) and Δyfh1-YFH1 (black bars) cells were grown in YPG medium. Manganese and iron content were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, wild type (white bars) and Δyfh1 cells (gray bars) were grown in YPG medium supplemented with the indicated amounts of MnCl2 and analyzed for total cellular manganese. The same experiment was performed to analyze total cellular iron (C). Data are represented as means ± S.E. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recovery of Mn-SOD Activity by Manganese Treatment—The results described above suggested that intracellular manganese and Mn-SOD activity in Δyfh1 could be reestablished by supplementing growth media with this metal. To this purpose, Δyfh1 cell cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of MnCl2. As shown in Fig. 4B, manganese levels were restored. Consistently, recovery of Mn-SOD activity in a dose-dependent manner was also observed (Fig. 3A). Thus, lack of Mn-SOD activity in Δyfh1 cells is a consequence of cellular manganese deficiency. In accordance with these results, a clear decay in superoxide anion levels was observed in Δyfh1 cells grown in manganese-supplemented media, and the values were indistinguishable from those of the wild type cells (Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 4C, manganese treatment had no significant effect on total cellular iron concentration, both in wild type or Δyfh1 cells.Recovery of Iron-Sulfur Enzymes by Manganese Treatment—Frataxin has been suggested to play an important role in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. This hypothesis is based on the decreased activities of iron-sulfur enzymes found in frataxin-deficient cells (12Rotig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and a physical and genetic interaction with Isu1, a scaffold protein required for iron-sulfur clusters biogenesis (3Gerber J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 4Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, decreased activities of iron-sulfur enzymes have been observed in yeast lacking SOD2 (30Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and in Mn-SOD knock-out mice (31Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). In this context, our results suggest that a decline in iron-sulfur enzyme activities in Δyfh1 cells could be a consequence of oxidative stress in mitochondria due to decreased Mn-SOD activity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed activities of three iron-sulfur mitochondrial enzymes (aconitase, glutamate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase) and a cytosolic one (isopropylmalate dehydratase) in wild type and Δyfh1 cells grown in manganese-supplemented YPG (Fig. 5). Values of iron-sulfur enzyme activities in Δyfh1 cells are in agreement to those described by other authors (9Gonzalez-Cabo P. Vazquez-Manrique R.P. Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Sanz P. Palau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Foury F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Duby G. Foury F. Ramazzotti A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) With the exception of aconitase, all other enzyme activities analyzed showed a clear recovery by manganese treatment, indicating that lack of Mn-SOD activity contributes to inactivating these enzymes. Also, these results suggest that YFH1 is not essential for iron-sulfur biosynthesis, except for aconitase. Such an exception can be explained by recent observations reporting that frataxin interacts with aconitase and that such interaction is crucial for reconstitution of the aconitase [4Fe4S] cluster (10Bulteau A.L.

Wild type (white bars) and Δyfh1 cells (gray bars) were grown in YPG medium supplemented with increasing amounts of MnCl2. A, enzymatic activities of glutamate synthase, aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and isopropylmalate dehydratase (IMD) in whole cell extracts; B, no changes in the amounts of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase were found in Western blot analysis of total cell extracts against Aco1 and Sdh2.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it was found that succinate dehydrogenase, but not aconitase activity, could be rescued when Δyfh1 yeast cells were grown in iron-limited medium using bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS) as iron chelator. In such conditions, cellular iron accumulation is prevented. To test whether such treatment is also capable of restoring iron-sulfur enzymes other than succinate dehydrogenase, wild type and Δyfh1 cells were grown in raffinose synthetic medium supplemented with BPS (Fig. 6). The results obtained not only confirmed the findings reported by Foury but also showed that isoprpopylmalate dehydratase and Mn-SOD activities were recovered in such conditions. These are additional indications that decreased Mn-SOD activity leads to inactivation of iron-sulfur containing enzymes in Δyfh1 cells.FIGURE 6Activities of Mn-SOD and iron-sulfur containing proteins in Δyfh1 yeast cells grown in iron-limited medium. Wild type and Δyfh1 cells were grown in raffinose synthetic medium supplemented (black bars) or not (white bars) with 10 μm BPS. Iron content and enzymatic activities in Δyfh1 cells (relative to wild type grown in the same conditions) are shown. In iron-limited medium (plus BPS), Mn-SOD, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and isopropylmalate dehydratase (IMD) activities were recovered; iron accumulation was prevented; and aconitase activity was not restored. Data are represented as means ± S.E. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Manganese and Mn-SOD Deficiency Are the Consequence of Iron Overload—As shown above, Δyfh1 cells displayed low levels of manganese that caused decreased activities of several iron-sulfur containing enzymes. This phenotype was corrected by manganese supplementation. Nevertheless, iron accumulation, induction of Sod1 and Sod2 (Fig. 3A), and slow growth in YPG (data not shown) persisted in manganese-treated Δyfh1 cells, suggesting that they are not strictly a consequence of manganese deficiency. Then, could manganese deficiency be a consequence of iron accumulation caused by the absence of Yfh1? The experiments in iron-limited media support this hypothesis, because Mn-SOD activity is restored when iron accumulation is prevented in Δyfh1 cells (Fig. 6). To study whether this phenotype is a more general phenomenon and not restricted to the mutant strain used, we further checked this hypothesis by analyzing manganese content and SOD activity in a strain with altered iron homeostasis such as a yeast mutant lacking GRX5. Mutants deficient in this glutaredoxin exhibit a strong iron accumulation, as well as decreased activities in aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase (16Rodriguez-Manzanequem M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, manganese levels in this strain were 60% of those found in wild type cells, in agreement with the data obtained in Δyfh1 mutant strain. Also, Δgrx5 cells exhibit an 80% decrease in Mn-SOD activity. In this case, this activity can also be restored by manganese supplementation (Fig. 7B). Taken together, the data obtained from both mutant strains clearly suggest that manganese deficiency would be a side effect of iron accumulation.FIGURE 7Manganese deficiency and decreased superoxide dismutase activity in Δgrx5.

These phenomena are controlled by a spatial asymmetry in signals at the front and the back of the cell. We show here that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTP-PEST, is required for the coupling of protrusion and retraction during cell migration. PTP-PEST null fibroblasts, which are blocked in migration, exhibit exaggerated protrusions at the leading edge and long, unretracted tails in the rear. This altered morphology is accompanied by changes in the activity of Rho GTPases, Rac1 and RhoA, which mediate protrusion and retraction, respectively. PTP-PEST null cells exhibit enhanced Rac1 activity and decreased RhoA activity. We further show that PTP-PEST directly targets the upstream regulators of Rac1 and RhoA, VAV2 and p190RhoGAP. Moreover, we demonstrate that the activities of VAV2 and p190RhoGAP are regulated by PTP-PEST. Finally, we present evidence indicating the VAV2 can be regulated by integrin-mediated adhesion. These data suggest that PTP-PEST couples protrusion and retraction by acting on VAV2 and p190RhoGAP to reciprocally modulate the activity of Rac1 and RhoA.

Cell motility is a concerted process involving protrusion of the leading edge, formation and turnover of cell-substrate adhesions, contraction of the cell body, and retraction of the trailing tail (1Ridley A.

These phenomena are controlled by Rho family GTPases which regulate the actin cytoskeleton (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A.

Although low levels of RhoA are required to maintain adhesion to the substratum (10Nobes C. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), perturbation of its activity results in impaired motility. Modest overexpression of activated RhoA or inactivation of p190RhoGAP leading to increased RhoA activity suppresses membrane protrusion at the leading edge (11Arthur W. Burridge K. Mol. Biol.

The intracellular mechanisms maintaining this asymmetry of Rac1 and RhoA activity are poorly understood. It is likely that integrins transmit distinct signals at the front and back of migrating cells to control local activity of Rac1 and RhoA. Although integrins have been shown to modulate the activity of Rho GTPases (16Arthur W. Petch L. Burridge K. Curr.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to soluble factors (21Bustelo X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 24Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A. Blagoev B. Bustelo X. Mann M. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), but its regulation by integrins is complex (23Liu B. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Moores S. Selfors L. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F. Brugge J. Swat W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). VAV2 plays a role in integrin-mediated cell spreading (26Marignani P. Carpenter C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); however, its tyrosine phosphorylation is not enhanced by adhesive signals (23Liu B. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Moores S. Selfors L. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F. Brugge J. Swat W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One possibility is that VAV2 contains both positive and negative phosphorylation sites; thus, a net change in phosphorylation may not reflect its activity state (27Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that VAV2 associates with a tyrosine phosphatase. Overexpression of activated VAV2 in fibroblasts results in a highly protrusive phenotype with increased motility (23Liu B. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggesting that its activity is spatially regulated to restrict protrusions to the leading edge. Like GEFs, numerous GAPs have been identified, many of which are tissue-specific, but few have been characterized (20Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). p190RhoGAP is ubiquitously expressed and one of the best-studied GAPs. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP is associated with its activation (28Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It is regulated by integrins (29Nakahara H. Mueller S.C. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and its activity is required to down-regulate RhoA in response to cell-matrix adhesion (16Arthur W. Petch L. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p190RhoGAP in fibroblasts leads to excessive protrusion of the leading edge in a wound assay (11Arthur W. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), suggesting that its activity at the leading edge is regulated. PTP-PEST is a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase implicated in controlling membrane protrusion and focal adhesion turnover. Both overexpression of PTP-PEST (30Garton A. Tonks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or its targeted deletion suppress cell motility (31Angers-Lousteau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L. Tremblay M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We recently showed that overexpression of PTP-PEST impairs membrane protrusion through inhibition of Rac1 (32Sastry S. Lyons P. Schaller M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study we utilize PTP-PEST –/– fibroblasts (31Angers-Lousteau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L. Tremblay M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) to further investigate mechanisms by which this protein-tyrosine phosphatase regulates motility. We find that PTP-PEST controls the balance of forward protrusion and tail retraction by differentially regulating Rac1 and RhoA activity. The PTP-PEST –/– fibroblasts plated on FN exhibit enhanced Rac1 activity and decreased RhoA activity compared with PTP-PEST –/– cells re-expressing PTP-PEST at wild type levels. We further show that PTP-PEST directly acts on upstream regulators of Rho family GTPases. Using substrate trapping, we demonstrate that VAV2 and p190RhoGAP are direct targets of PTP-PEST. Finally, we present evidence that the activity of VAV2 and p190RhoGAP are enhanced in PTP-PEST null fibroblasts. Our data show that PTP-PEST acts at multiple steps of the migration cycle and that PTP-PEST can modulate Rho GTPase activity by both direct and indirect mechanisms. Cell Culture and Transfection—PTP-PEST –/– and +/– and re-expressing (RE) fibroblasts were previously described (31Angers-Lousteau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L. Tremblay M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and maintained in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, fungizone; Invitrogen). In some experiments wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (a gift of Dr. J. Ceci, University of Texas Medical Branch) were used and maintained in DMEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum. CHOK1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and nonessential amino acids. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine plus (Invitrogen) as described (32Sastry S. Lyons P. Schaller M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DNA and Antibodies—Plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein-tagged Rho GTPases, N17Rac1 and L63RhoA, as well as pGEX vectors encoding GST fusion proteins for 15ARac1 and L63RhoA were gifts of Dr. Krister Wennerberg (University of North Carolina). PTP-PEST substrate trapping mutants were a gift of Dr. Michael D. Schaller (University of North Carolina). Myc-tagged wild type VAV2 in pcDNA was a gift of Dr. Michelle Booden (University of North Carolina). The T7-tagged dominant negative VAV2 mutant, VAV2 L342R/L343S, was a gift of Dr. Chris Carpenter (26Marignani P. Carpenter C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The p130cas mutant, casSD, was a gift of Dr. Kristiina Vuori (Burnham Institute). Dominant negative p190RhoGAP, p190RA, was a gift of Dr. Jeff Settleman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and was subcloned in-frame with green fluorescent protein as described (11Arthur W. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding wild type and DDH2 DOCK180 were as described (65Cote J.F. Motoyama A. Bush J. Vuori K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The VAV2 antiserum was raised against a C-terminal GST fusion protein as described (23Liu B. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Anti-serum recognizing mouse PTP-PEST was previously described (32Sastry S. Lyons P. Schaller M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The anti-Myc 9E10 mAb was purchased from Covance. Antibodies against Rac1, p190RhoGAP, p120Ras GAP, and SOS-1 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-DOCK 180 and RhoA antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated on 12-mm round glass coverslips coated with FN (Invitrogen; 10 μg/ml) in serum-free medium (DMEM containing 2% bovine serum albumin) for the indicated times. Coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. F-actin was stained with Texas Red phalloidin or Alexa 594-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Cells expressing the VAV2 R/S mutant were stained with an anti-T7 epitope tag antibody (Novagen) and Alexa 488-anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cells expressing p130cas mutant, CAS SD, or crkII mutants were immunostained with anti GST or anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. DOCK 180-transfected cells were detected with anti-DOCK 180 mAb, H-4 (Santa Cruz). Immunofluorescence was viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope equipped with a MicroMax CCD digital camera (Southern Micro Systems, Marietta, GA), and images were obtained using Metamorph software. Video Microscopy—PTP-PEST –/– cells or re-expressors were plated in 35-mm culture dishes containing a glass coverslip insert (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) coated with FN (10 μg/ml) in serum-containing medium. Video microscopy was performed on an Olympus IX-81 microscope with differential interference contrast (Nomarski) optics (60× objective, 1.45 N.A.). Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu C4880 cooled down CCD camera driven by Metamorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Cells were plated for 1 h and then filmed for 3 h with frames captured every 2 min. Cells were maintained in an environmental chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Movies were converted to quick time format using Adobe Image ready software. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin)) on ice. Lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 15 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA method (Pierce). For VAV2 immunoprecipitations, cells were transfected with myc-wild type VAV2. Lysates were incubated with anti-myc monoclonal antibody, 9E10, for one h at 4 °C on a rotator. Anti-mouse agarose beads (20 μg, Sigma) were added for an additional hour. p190RhoGAP immunoprecipitations were identical except that lysates were incubated with anti-p190RhoGAP monoclonal antibody (Transduction Labs, BD). Immunoprecipitations were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose (34Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar) and membranes were blocked in 5% cold fish gelatin in TBST. Filters were first immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine using PY20H diluted in 5% cold fish gelatin and then stripped and reprobed for VAV2 or p190RhoGAP with anti myc or anti p190RhoGAP monoclonal antibodies. To detect p120RasGAP co-precipitation, membranes from p190RhoGAP immunoprecipitations were reprobed with anti RasGAP mAb. Endogenous VAV2 was detected with a polyclonal anti-serum diluted 1:20,000 in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (23Liu B. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse- or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase and chemiluminescence detection (Pierce super signal) on Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film were used to visualize bands. Substrate Trapping Assay—Phosphatase substrate trapping experiments were performed essentially as described (35Flint A. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 36Lyons P. Dunty J. Schaefer E. Schaller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24422-24431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, either 293T cells or HeLa cells were grown to subconfluence in growth medium and then pretreated with 50 mm pervanadate (100 mm NaVO4 was mixed with 12 ml of % H202 for each 100 ml of NaVO4 in PBS to a final stock concentration of 50 mm pervanadate) for 30 min in growth medium. For trapping of endogenous VAV2, lysates were prepared from re-expressing cells or PTP-PEST –/– cells in the absence of pervanadate pre-treatment. Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (see above) on ice, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Approximately 2 mg of lysate were incubated with 5–10 μg of GST fusion protein (GST alone) or GST fused to the catalytic domain of PTP-PEST (GST-wild type PTP-PEST, GST PTP-PESTC231S, or GSTPTP-PEST D199A) for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. Beads were washed several times in lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as indicated above. Rho GTPase, GEF, and GAP Activity Assays—RhoA activity assays were performed according to the method described by Ren et al. (19Ren X. Kiosses W. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST null or RE cells were serum-starved for 4 h, kept in suspension in serum-free DMEM containing 2% delipidated bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and then plated on FN-coated dishes in the same medium for various time points. Cells were lysed in buffer A, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at maximal speed at 4 °C for 10 min. GST Rhotekin beads were added (10 μg) and incubated with lysates for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Pull-downs were washed in buffer B and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Total lysate and pull-downs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-RhoA mAb (Santa Cruz). Rac1 activity was measured as described previously (37Glaven J. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using a p21-activated kinase binding domain pull-down assay. PTP-PEST null cells or RE cells were plated identically as for RhoA assays and were lysed in buffer B. Rac1 was detected using anti-Rac1 mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories). VAV2 activity was assessed by affinity precipitation with a GST fusion protein encoding Rac1 with a point mutation at amino acid 15 (Gly-15 → Ala) to mimic a nucleotide-free state. PTP-PEST –/– cells, re-expressors, or CHOK1 cells transiently transfected with Myc wild-type VAV2 were plated on FN-coated tissue culture dishes or kept in suspension in serum-free medium for 1 h. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin) on ice. Cleared lysates were incubated with 20 μg of fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. After washes with lysis buffer, beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The amount of VAV2 bound to the beads was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. Sos-1 activity was assayed under identical conditions. As a positive control, SOS-1 activity was measured in 293T cells that were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with PDGF-BB (25 ng/ml) for 15 min. An analogous method was used to assay p190RhoGAP activity (38Noren N. Arthur W. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13615-13618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A GST fusion protein encoding activated RhoA (L63 RhoA) was used to precipitate active p190RhoGAP from cell lysates. Plating and lysis conditions were identical to those used for VAV2. PTP-PEST Is Required for Tail Retraction—PTP-PEST is a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase implicated in controlling membrane protrusion and focal adhesion turnover. Both the overexpression of PTP-PEST (30Garton A. Tonks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or its targeted deletion (31Angers-Lousteau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L. Tremblay M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) suppress cell motility. We recently showed that overexpression of PTP-PEST impairs membrane protrusion through inhibition of Rac1 (32Sastry S. Lyons P. Schaller M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we utilize PTP-PEST –/– fibroblasts to further investigate mechanisms by which this protein-tyrosine phosphatase regulates motility. As previously reported, PTP-PEST –/– fibroblasts are unable to migrate in a wound assay (31Angers-Lousteau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L. Tremblay M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We confirmed these findings by comparing the ability of wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts, PTP-PEST +/– fibroblasts, and PTP-PEST –/– fibroblasts that stably re-express PTP-PEST and PTP-PEST –/– cells to migrate in a wound assay (supplemental Fig. 1A). Only PTP-PEST –/– cells were unable to close a wound after 24 h. To determine the relative levels of PTP-PEST expression in these various cells, we immunoblotted cell lysates with an antiserum that recognizes mouse PTP-PEST. The cDNA used to re-express PTP-PEST is a mouse cDNA (31Angers-Lousteau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L. Tremblay M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar); therefore, this antiserum is useful to compare total levels of PTP-PEST. Both wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts and re-expressors show equivalent expression, +/– cells have reduced expression, and PTP-PEST null cells are negative for protein expression (supplemental Fig. 1B). These data establish that wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts, re-expressors, and +/– cells migrate to a similar extent. When we examined the morphology of the re-expressors and +/– cells, the re-expressors most closely resembled the wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts. Furthermore, the +/– cells showed a heterogeneous morphology (not shown). Therefore, we chose to further examine the differences between PTP-PEST –/– cells and those that re-express PTP-PEST at wild type levels. We first examined their morphology on FN-coated coverslips over a time course of 3– 4 h. PTP-PEST –/– cells show enhanced spreading within 30 min to 1 h after plating (Fig. 1, right upper panels) when compared with heterozygous controls (+/–) (not shown) or null cells that re-express PTP-PEST (RE) (Fig. 1, left upper panels). However, when PTP-PEST –/– fibroblasts are plated on FN-coated coverslips for greater than 90 min they undergo a dramatic change in morphology (Fig. 1, right lower panels). They form exaggerated membrane ruffles and lamellipodia at the leading edge but also develop long, thin tails in the rear. Some cells also show a bipolar morphology with at least two prominent lamellae. To distinguish between a loss of polarity or a defect in tail retraction, we utilized time-lapse video microscopy to monitor the cells over a longer time course of migration (Fig. 2, see video images). Fig. 2A shows the time-lapse frames of the development of tails in PTP-PEST –/– cells. Cells were plated on FN-coated dishes for 1 h and then filmed for 3 h. Compared with RE controls, which exhibit minimal membrane activity with modest movement, PTP-PEST null cells initially show enhanced membrane activity along with a flatter, pancake-like morphology. By 1–2 h, the cells begin to form tails in the rear that become highly elongated after 3– 4 h. Once a tail develops, the cell body continues to protrude and move forward, but migration is impeded due to an inability of the tail to detach from the substrate (Fig. 2B, see video images). The fraction of cells that formed tails was quantitated (Fig. 2D). Nearly 70% of null cells were observed to form tails after 3 h of plating, whereas only 10% of control cells formed tails. We also performed migration assays using transwell filters to compare directional versus random migration. As shown in Fig. 2C, in a random transwell filter assay (where the top and bottom of the filter are coated with FN), PTP-PEST –/– cells are completely blocked in migration. However, a greater fraction of the null cells are able to undergo haptotaxis, where only the bottom of the filter is coated. This observation suggests that PTP-PEST –/– cells are able to protrude toward a directional cue but are unable to detach the cell body from the upper surface when both are coated. Together with the video data, these results demonstrate that PTP-PEST is required to mediate tail retraction. PTP-PEST Reciprocally Regulates Rac1 and RhoA Activity—The phenotype described above suggested that PTP-PEST may differentially regulate Rho GTPase activity. We recently reported that overexpression of PTP-PEST blocks membrane protrusion through down-regulation of Rac1 (32Sastry S. Lyons P. Schaller M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We also showed that Rac1 activity is enhanced in PTP-PEST –/– fibroblasts plated on a FN substrate (Ref. 32Sastry S. Lyons P. Schaller M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Fig. 3A). This observation is consistent with the increased protrusive behavior observed at the leading edge of PTP-PEST –/– cells (Fig. 2). Because RhoA activity is required for tail retraction (13Worthylake R. Lemoine S. Watson J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 14Worthylake R.

Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Prokaryotes and eukaryotes have evolved similar systems for repair (2Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar) and in Escherichia coli MMR is initiated when MutS binds to mismatched DNA, possibly through its interaction with the β-clamp accessory protein that is required for processive DNA replication (3Lopez de Saro F.J.

MutL binds to MutS to form MutS-MutL-DNA complexes that stimulate MutH binding and cleavage of unmethylated DNA strands at GATC sequences, either 5′ or 3′ of recognized mismatches. Exonucleases then chew away at the DNA beyond the mismatch site so that highly accurate DNA polymerase III can correctly re-synthesize the strand. In eukaryotes, mismatch recognition is accomplished by MSH2 (MutS homolog 2) forming a heterodimer with either MSH3 or MSH6 to bind to distinct but overlapping spectra of mismatches (7Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In both the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans, the repair of base-base mismatches appears to be solely dependent on MSH2-MSH6, whereas both MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3 can participate in the repair of small (1 to 12-nucleotide) loop insertions. Currently, it is thought that MSH heterodimer binding to a mismatch triggers ATP-dependent steps that allow interactions with MLH (MutL homolog) heterodimers composed of MLH1-Pms1 or MLH1-MLH3 (7Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 8Jiricny J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). No MutH homolog, however, has been identified in eukaryotes, and the exact details of strand discrimination and error removal are not known, although in both yeast and humans a number of other proteins have been implicated in MMR, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor C (RF-C), and DNA polymerases δ and ϵ (9Tran H.T.

PCNA was originally characterized as a DNA sliding clamp for replicative DNA polymerases, but subsequent studies have revealed its striking ability to interact with multiple partners involved in several meta-bolic pathways (17Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). One role of PCNA in MMR is mediated by interactions with MSH2-MSH6 or MSH2-MSH3 complexes through PCNA interaction motifs present in MSH6 and MSH3 (18Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat.

PCNA increases the in vitro mispair binding specificity of the MSH2-MSH6 complex, and this is eliminated by amino acid substitutions in PCNA that cause MMR defects (19Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that MMR may be coupled to DNA replication through the physical interaction between MutS family proteins and PCNA and through co-localization of PCNA with MSH6 and MSH3 in replication foci (18Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat.

The PCNA-MSH6-MSH2 complex can form a stable ternary complex with fully base-paired DNA, but when a mispair is present, PCNA is excluded from the complex in an ATP-dependent fashion (21Lau P.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that MSH2-MSH6 binds to PCNA to search of mispairs on newly replicated DNA and is then transferred from PCNA to the mispaired bases. PCNA also interacts with RF-C, which contains five subunits ranging between 36 and 140 kDa and possesses an DNA-dependent ATPase that is stimulated by PCNA. At present, its chief known function is to load PCNA onto DNA (22Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12896-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M.

A. 1999; 96: 1869-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Following its association with DNA at a primer end, RF-C recruits PCNA (the clamp) and loads it onto DNA in the presence of ATP (clamp loading), this being required for MMR (25Xie Y. Counter C. Alani E. Genetics. 1999; 151: 499-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This RF-C-dependent PCNA loading mechanism is conserved among human, E. coli, and the T4 bacteriophage. Viral DNA genome replication is closely linked with host cellular DNA replication, repair, and recombination. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human lymphotropic herpesvirus with a linear double-stranded DNA, 172 kb in length (26Baer R. Bankier A.T. Biggin M.D. Deininger P.L. Farrell P.J. Gibson T.J. Hatfull G. Hudson G.S. Satchwell S.C. Seguin C. Tuffnell P.S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1984; 310: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). Primary EBV infection targets resting B lymphocytes, inducing their continuous proliferation. In resultant B lymphoblastoid cell lines only limited numbers of viral genes are usually expressed and there is no production of virus particles, this being termed latent infection. Reactivation from latency, which can occur spontaneously or be induced artificially, is characterized by the expression of lytic genes, which leads to the production of virions and eventually to host cell lysis. The EBV genome is amplified 100-1,000-fold by viral DNA replication machinery composed of seven viral replication proteins: BZLF1, an oriLyt-binding protein; BALF5, a DNA polymerase; BMRF1, a polymerase processivity factor; BALF2, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein; and BBLF4, BSLF1, and BBLF2/3, predicted to be helicase, primase, and helicase-primase-associated proteins, respectively (27Fixman E.D. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral lytic replication occurs in discrete sites in nuclei, called replication compartments, containing specific sets of viral replication proteins, displaying active viral progeny genome DNA synthesis (28Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Shirata N. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3409-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Takagi S. Takada K. Sairenji T. Virology. 1991; 185: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). With progression of lytic replication the replication compartments became enlarged and appear to fuse to form large globular structures that eventually fill the nucleus in late stages (28Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Shirata N. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3409-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have previously isolated EBV latently infected Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells in which exogenous BZLF1 protein is conditionally expressed under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter, leading to highly efficient induction of lytic replication (30Kudoh A. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Kuzushima K. Sugaya Y. Izuta S. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Using this system, we could demonstrate that induction of the EBV lytic program results in inhibition of replication of cellular DNA despite replication of viral DNA (30Kudoh A. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Kuzushima K. Sugaya Y. Izuta S. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We show here for the first time that PCNA, RF-C, and a series of MMR proteins like MSH-2, MSH-6, MLH1, and hPSM2 are assembled precisely to sites of viral DNA synthesis after induction of EBV lytic replication. Levels of the DNA-bound form of PCNA increase with progression of lytic replication and chromatin immunodepletion analyses combined with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling revealed that PCNA is loaded onto newly synthesized viral DNA as well as the BALF2 and BMRF1 viral proteins. PCNA and RF-C are precisely co-localized within viral replication compartments. RF-C might load PCNA onto newly synthesized viral DNA. Because MSH-3 and MSH-6 interact with PCNA (19Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 20Kleczkowska H.E. Marra G. Lettieri T. Jiricny J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), such loading might trigger transfer of a series of host MMR proteins to sites of viral DNA synthesis. Cell Culture—Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells (30Kudoh A. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Kuzushima K. Sugaya Y. Izuta S. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin, 250 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 10% tetracycline-free fetal calf serum (Clontech) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. To induce lytic EBV replication the tetracycline derivative, doxycycline, was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Antibodies—Anti-BALF2 and anti-BMRF1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were prepared as follows. Recombinant BALF2 or BMRF1 protein were individually expressed in Sf21 cells infected with AcBALF2 or AcBMRF1 recombinant baculovirus and purified as described previously (31Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tsurumi T. Kishore J. Yokoyama N. Fujita M. Daikoku T. Yamada H. Yamashita Y. Nishiyama Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The anti-BALF2 or anti-BMRF1 protein-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against ∼200 μg of each purified protein mixed with RIBI adjuvant system R-730 (RIBI Immunochem Research) and affinity purified (33Fujita M.

The antibodies recognized proteins migrating at 130 and 48-52 kDa in whole cell lysates from lytic-induced B95-8 cells, demonstrating specific immunoprecipitation. Anti-BALF5 protein-specific rabbit antibody (34Tsurumi T. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Daikoku T. Kurachi R. Nishiyama Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4651-4658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was affinity-purified with the BALF5 protein coupled-Sepharose 4B as described (33Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An anti-EBV EA-D-p52/50 (BMRF1 gene product) protein-specific mouse monoclonal antibody, clone name R3, was purchased from Chemicon Inc. and anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Transduction Laboratories and Oncogene, respectively. Anti-MSH2, -MSH3, and -MSH6 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences, and anti-hPMS2 and anti-MLH1 antibodies from Calbiochem and BD Pharmingen International, respectively. Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-BrdUrd mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Anti-human RF-C p140 monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Waga (Osaka University) (35Waga S. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4177-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and anti-DNA polymerase δ rabbit polyclonal antibody by Dr. Tamai (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.). The secondary goat anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or 594 were purchased from Molecular Probes. Biochemical Cellular Fractionation—Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells (1.5 × 107) treated with or without doxycycline at a concentration of 2 μg/ml were cultured and harvested at the indicated times. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and were lysed for 10 min on ice with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100/mCSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing multiple protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cell extracts, Sigma; 25 μl/ml), 200 μm Na3VO4, and 20 mm NaF. The samples were then subjected to centrifugation (2000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C) to obtain Triton X-100-extractable nuclear fractions that were digested with 250 units/ml DNase I (10 units/μl, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 0.1% Triton X-100/mCSK containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2 at 25 °C for 20 min. The samples were then centrifuged (2000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C) to obtain the solubilized chromatin fraction and the remaining non-chromatin nuclear structures. Each sample was adjusted to the same volume by adding 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and aliquots corresponding to 1.8 × 104 cells per lane were applied for SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence Analysis—All staining procedures were carried out at room temperature except for extraction and incubation with primary antibodies. For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100/mCSK buffer on ice for 2 min. Multiple protease inhibitors (Sigma; 25 μl/ml), 200 μm Na3VO4, and 20 mm NaF, were also added to the buffer. Cells were fixed with 70% methanol for 30 min on ice, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, blocked for 1 h in 10% fetal calf serum in PBS, and then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum. The anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibodies and control mouse IgG were used at 2.5 μg/ml, the anti-BALF2 rabbit polyclonal antibody at 2 μg/ml, and the control rabbit IgG and anti-BMRF1 mouse monoclonal antibodies at 5 μg/ml. The samples were then incubated for 1 h with secondary goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594. Neither of the control antibodies yielded specific signals in either single-staining or double-staining experiments. For BrdUrd staining, newly synthesized DNA was labeled by incubating Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells with 10 μm BrdUrd added directly to the incubation medium for 1 h prior to harvesting. For the pulse-chase experiment, the cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 1 h at 24 h post-induction and then chased for 24 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100/mCSK buffer on ice for 2 min. Multiple protease inhibitors (Sigma; 25 μl/ml), 200 μm Na3VO4, and 20 mm NaF, were also added to the buffer. Cells were then fixed with 70% methanol for 30 min on ice and treated for 10 min with 2 n HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 to expose the incorporated BrdUrd residues before blocking. The cells were washed twice with PBS and neutralized with 0.1 m sodium tetraborate, pH 9.0, for 5 min. For fluorescence in situ hybridization, an EBV BamHI-W fragment was labeled with Chroma Tide Alexa Fluor 594-5-dUTP (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and used for the detection of amplified EBV genomes. First, immunostaining was performed as described above and then cells were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde to cross-link bound antibodies. After permeabilizing in 0.2% Triton X-100 (20 min on ice), cells were digested with RNase A, dehydrated in ethanol, air dried, and immediately covered with a probe mixture containing 50% formamide in 2× SSC containing probe DNA (10 ng/μl), 10% dextran sulfate, salmon sperm DNA (0.1 μg/μl), and yeast tRNA (1 μg/μl). Probes and cells were simultaneously heated at 94 °C for 4 min and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After hybridization, specimens were washed at 37 °C with 50% formamide in 2× SSC (two times for 15 min each) and then 2× SSC. Finally, cells were equilibrated in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc). Image acquisition was performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a PlainApo 100 × 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective lens. Images were processed and assembled in an Apple G4 computer using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested at the indicated times post-treatment with doxycycline, washed with PBS, and treated with lysis buffer (0.02% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min on ice. Multiple protease inhibitors, 200 μm Na3VO4, and 20 mm NaF were added to the buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and clarified cell extracts were assayed for their protein concentrations using a Bio-Rad kit. Equal amounts of proteins (20-50 μg) were loaded into each lane for SDS-10% PAGE (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29.2:0.8). The proteins were then processed as described previously (30Kudoh A. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Kuzushima K. Sugaya Y. Izuta S. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Detection of target proteins was with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). BrdUrd-labeled Chromatin Immunodepletion Assays—Chromatin immunodepletion assays were performed as follows. 5 × 107 Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells per sample were cultured in 100-mm plates in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 27 h. Newly synthesized DNA was labeled by incubation with 50 μm BrdUrd added directly to the incubation medium for 3 h prior to harvesting. After washing twice in PBS, cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100/mCSK buffer for 10 min on ice and centrifuged (2000 × g, 5 min) to obtain Triton X-100-extractable fractions. The Triton X-100-extracted nuclei were cross-linked in situ with 5 ml of 1% formaldehyde in 0.5% Triton X-100/mCSK buffer for 20 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were suspended in Solution I (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C and sonicated to reduce the average DNA fragment length to 500-1000 bp (verified on agarose gels; data not shown). After centrifugation, the supernatants were reacted for 1 h with 1 μg each of anti-BALF2, anti-BMRF1, anti-MCM7-specific rabbit IgGs, anti-PCNA mouse IgG, or 1 μg of non-immune mouse or rabbit IgGs as controls. Immune complexes of proteins cross-linked to BrdUrd-incorporated DNA were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose CL-4B beads and immunodepleted samples were treated with 0.5% SDS and 0.7 mg/ml proteinase K for 5 h at 45 °C. Protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 6 h and then DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit from Qiagen and dot-blotted onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). BrdUrd-incorporated DNA was detected with 5 μg/ml of anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Chemicon), and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG. Immunoprecipitation—Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells were cultured in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline, harvested at 48 h post-induction, and treated with 0.5% Triton X-100/mCSK buffer. After centrifugation, Triton X-100-extracted nuclei fraction were sonicated. The lysates were diluted with NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA). The aliquots were mixed with 1.5 μg each of control IgG, anti-BMRF1, -PCNA, -MSH2, -MSH3, and -MSH6 mouse monoclonal antibodies, respectively, for 90 min at 4 °C. After the addition of 20 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads, the mixtures were further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, rocking gently. The beads were then washed with NET buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant were collected, added to β-mercaptoethanol, reboiled, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Assembly of PCNA to Viral Replication Compartments after Induction of Lytic Replication—Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells were treated with doxycycline to induce lytic replication (30Kudoh A. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Kuzushima K. Sugaya Y. Izuta S. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), harvested, and treated with a buffer containing non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 at relatively physiological salt condition, which extracts not only cytoplasmic but also nuclear proteins not tightly bound to nuclear structures. Triton X-100 treatment is known to disrupt nuclear envelopes, but the nuclear lamina remains intact, thus maintaining nuclear structures (36Hozak P. Hassan A.B. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 361-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and proteins remaining in extracted nuclei have been shown to indeed bind to chromatin or viral DNA/nuclear matrix material (33Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37Fujita M. Ishimi Y. Nakamura H. Kiyono T. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10354-10361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the BMRF1 polymerase processivity factor shows a homologous, not dot-like, distribution in viral replication compartments and the BALF2 single-stranded DNA-binding protein is distributed as distinct dots within the replication compartments (28Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Shirata N. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3409-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, panels a and c, the sites stained with anti-BMRF1 protein-specific antibodies completely coincided with the foci of newly synthesized viral DNA as judged by BrdUrd incorporation and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses on confocal immunofluorescence analyses. Furthermore, we assumed that viral DNA would move out of the nucleus as a component of maturing virus but cellular DNA would remain in the nucleus and so assessed the fate of incorporated BrdUrd label by chasing newly synthesized DNA. When Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd for 1 h at 24 h post-induction and then chased for 24 h, fluorescence intensity of BrdUrd-labeled DNA in nucleus was greatly reduced during the chase period (compare Fig. 1A, panels a and b). Thus, the demonstration that a majority of the BrdUrd pulse-labeled DNA moved out of the nucleus with time clarified that BrdUrd-labeled DNAs at 24 h post-induction are mostly viral and not cellular DNAs. Collectively, because BMRF1 protein-localized sites represent loci of viral DNA synthesis, BMRF1 protein staining was used as a marker for viral replication compartments. To investigate whether the MMR system is involved in EBV lytic DNA replication, we first examined subcellular localization of PCNA, a protein involved in the early step of MMR, in lytic replication-induced Tet-BZLF1/B95-8 cells (Fig. 1B). PCNA is an abundant protein that is generally distributed throughout the nucleus. However, in S phase, it appears to be found in foci of aggregate that have been shown to colocalize with newly replicated DNA labeled with BrdUrd in nuclei (38Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Because both hMSH6 and hMSH3 are known to colocalize with PCNA to these foci (20Kleczkowska H.E. Marra G. Lettieri T. Jiricny J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the MMR system is coupled with chromosomal DNA replication. As shown in Fig. 1B, PCNA was found to become resistant to mild detergent extraction and was localized as distinct spots within the BMRF1 protein-localized replication compartments. In contrast, PCNA was sensitive to detergent treatment in most of the latently infected cells (data not shown), although in a portion of the cells PCNA was resistant to detergent extraction and was observed as punctate spots throughout nuclei (Fig. 1B, panel c), probably representing in S phase cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, BALF2 single-stranded DNA-binding proteins were also co-distributed as distinct spots within viral replication compartments. PCNA staining loci coincided with and/or were nearby those for the BALF2 protein (Fig. 1C, panels a and b). When viral DNA replication was blocked by the addition of PAA, a herpesvirus DNA polymerase inhibitor, viral prereplicative sites represented by staining of the BALF2 protein were formed (Fig. 1C, panel c), as reported previously (39Bell P.

Because multivalent aggregation of α3β1 integrin up-regulates uPA and induces a dramatic co-clustering of uPAR, we explored the hypothesis that lateral ligation of α3β1 integrin by uPAR contributes to uPA regulation in oral mucosal cells. To investigate mechanisms by which uPAR/α3β1 binding enhances uPA expression, integrin-dependent signal activation was assessed. Both Src and ERK1/2 were phosphorylated in response to integrin aggregation, and blocking Src kinase activity completely abrogated ERK1/2 activation and uPA induction, whereas inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity did not alter uPA expression. Proteinase up-regulation occurred at the transcriptional level and mutation of the AP1 (–1967) site in the uPA promoter blocked the uPAR/integrin-mediated transcriptional activation. Because uPAR is redistributed to clustered α3β1 integrins, the requirement for uPAR/α3β1 interaction in uPA regulation was assessed. Clustering of α3β1 in the presence of a peptide (α325) that disrupts uPAR/α3β1 integrin binding prevented uPA induction. Depletion of cell surface uPAR using small interfering RNA also blocked uPA induction following integrin α3β1 clustering. These results were confirmed using a genetic strategy in which α3 null epithelial cells reconstituted with wild type α3 integrin, but not a mutant α3 unable to bind uPAR, induced uPA expression upon integrin clustering, confirming the critical role of uPAR in integrin-regulated proteinase expression. Disruption of uPAR/α3β1 binding using peptide α325 or small interfering RNA blocked filopodia formation and matrix invasion, indicating that this interaction stimulates invasive behavior. Together these data support a model wherein matrix-induced clustering ofα3β1 integrin promotes uPAR/α3β1 interaction, thereby potentiating cellular signal transduction pathways culminating in activation of uPA expression and enhanced uPA-dependent invasive behavior.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) 2The abbreviations used are: OSCC, oral squamous cell carcinoma; uPA, urinary-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. 2The abbreviations used are: OSCC, oral squamous cell carcinoma; uPA, urinary-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. is the most common malignancy of the oral cavity, with a distinctly low (50%) 5-year survival rate (www.NIH.gov). Advanced OSCC is associated with high mortality resulting from local, regional, and distant metastasis (2Hicks W.L. Jr-Loree T.R. Garcia R.I. Maamoun S. Marshall D. Orner J.B. Bakamjian V.Y. Shedd D.P. Head Neck. 1997; 19: 400-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the cellular and biochemical factors that underlie OSCC dissemination are poorly understood. Recent studies have used cDNA microarray analysis for genome-wide monitoring of genetic and epigenetic changes associated with OSCC primary tumors and lymph node metastases. These studies have identified enhanced expression of the proteinase urinary type plasminogen activator (uPA) and the cell-matrix adhesion molecule α3 integrin as key candidate biomarkers for prediction of poor disease outcome (3Nagata M. Fujita H. Ida H. Hoshina H. Inoue T. Seki Y. Ohnishi M. Ohyama T. Shingaki S. Kaji M. Saku T. Takagi R. Int. J.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2634-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).The serine proteinase uPA converts plasminogen to plasmin, a broad spectrum proteinase active against numerous matrix substrates and additional proteinase zymogens. Acquisition of uPA activity is the net result of regulatory interplay between uPA, its cell surface receptor (uPAR), and its physiological inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (5Myohanen H. Vaheri A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2840-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These components have been extensively studied for their contribution to cell migration and invasion in various physiological and pathological conditions, particularly in cancer (6Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The uPAR is a cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecule that binds uPA and “focalizes” proteolytic activity to the cell-matrix interface (7Ploug M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1499-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Increased pericellular proteolysis of basement membrane proteins can then remove growth constraints imposed by the mechanical properties of a three-dimensional matrix and potentiate invasion and metastasis (8Yu W. Kim J. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J.

Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have identified other interesting biological functions of uPAR, including regulation of cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation via interaction with other cell surface molecules including integrins and growth factor receptors (11Kugler M.C. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Blasi F. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Recently published x-ray crystallography data suggest that uPAR does not undergo significant conformational changes upon uPA binding to its central cavity. Thus, uPAR, bound to uPA in its central core, retains a large outer receptor surface accessible to additional binding partners such as integrins, which in turn may mediate other biological functions of uPAR (14Llinas P. Le Du M.H. Gardsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. Gilquin B. Stura E.A. Menez A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Integrins are transmembrane heterodimeric proteins comprised of α and β subunits that mediate adhesion to matrix proteins through the extracellular domain and modulate signaling and cytoskeletal organization through the cytoplasmic tail. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the glycolipid-anchored uPAR can form lateral associations with transmembrane integrins (15Degryse B. Resnati M. Czekay R.P. Loskutoff D.J. Blasi F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These data support a mechanism whereby the glycolipid-anchored uPAR can couple to cytoplasmic signaling pathways via binding to transmembrane integrins and thereby regulate gene expression and cell behavior (13Ossowski L. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).While investigating the regulation of uPA activity in premalignant oral keratinocytes, we observed that multivalent aggregation of integrin α3β1 up-regulates uPA expression via a MEK/ERK1/2-dependent pathway, suggesting a mechanism whereby cell-matrix adhesion may regulate subsequent invasive behavior (23Ghosh S. Brown R. Jones J.C. Ellerbroek S.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23869-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Integrin clustering was accompanied by a redistribution of endogenous uPAR to sites of clustered α3β1 integrins and formation of a uPAR/α3β1complex as demonstrated using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. This finding was supported by studies showing binding of exogenous uPAR to α3β1 in 293 cells and identification of a peptide, designated α325, that blocks uPAR/α3β1 integrin binding (24Wei Y. Eble J.A. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Chapman H.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2975-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). More recently, the uPAR-binding site was mapped to loop 4 in the α3 subunit β-propeller region (residues 242–246), and a point mutation (H245A) in the α3 subunit was identified that abrogates uPAR binding (25Zhang F. Tom C.C. Kugler M.C. Ching T.T. Kreidberg J.A. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to evaluate the functional contribution of uPAR/α3β1 interaction to regulation of uPA expression and activity. Our data support a model wherein matrix-induced clustering of α3β1 integrin promotes uPAR/α3β1 interaction, thereby potentiating cellular signal transduction pathways culminating in enhanced uPA expression and uPA-dependent invasive behavior in premalignant oral keratinocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Plasminogen and plasmin were purified by affinity chromatography from outdated human plasma as described previously (23Ghosh S. Brown R. Jones J.C. Ellerbroek S.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23869-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Anti-human integrin α3 and β1 monoclonal antibodies (P1B5 and P5D2) were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody specific for phosphorylated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (anti-ACTIVE® MAPK p42/p44 or ERK1/2) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-ERK1/2 (anti-p42/p44) antibodies, which recognize both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated p42/p44, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-Src (Tyr416) antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1/2 (PD98059), Src kinase (PP2), PI3K (LY294002), p38 MAPK (SB203580), and EGFR kinase (AG1478) were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-human uPAR antibodies (3936, 3937, and 399R) and anticatalytic uPA antibodies (394) were obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Hydrobond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and Pierce, respectively.Cell Culture—HPV16 immortalized premalignant oral keratinocytes (pp126 cells) were a gift from Dr. D. Oda (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (26Oda D. Bigler L. Lee P. Blanton R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized normal oral keratinocytes (OKF6/T cells) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Rheinwald (Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Boston, MA) (27Rheinwald J.G. Beckett M.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1657-1663PubMed Google Scholar), and SCC25 cells derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. pp126 cells were maintained in keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract supplied with the medium, and 0.09 mm CaCl2. OKF6/T cells were maintained in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (supplied with the medium), 0.2 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.31 mm CaCl2. SCC25 were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.A kidney epithelial cell line derived from α3 integrin-null mice, as well as these cells reconstituted with wild type human α3 integrin or mutant (H245A) human α3 integrin were developed as previously described (25Zhang F. Tom C.C. Kugler M.C. Ching T.T. Kreidberg J.A. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Wang Z. Symons J.M. Goldstein S.L. McDonald A. Miner J.H. Kreidberg J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).α3 integrin-deficient cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and the α3-reconstituted cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50μg/ml of zeocin (Invitrogen).Prior to treatment with antibody-coated beads, the cell monolayers were released from culture flasks by the addition of trypsin/EDTA, seeded at a constant density of 0.7 × 105 cells/well into 12-well tissue culture plates, and allowed to attach overnight in the medium described above. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, incubated for 15 h in medium lacking bovine pituitary extract and EGF, and supplemented with fresh bovine pituitary extract/EGF-free medium prior to treatment with antibody-conjugated latex beads (20 μl of bead slurry). Following incubation for the indicated time periods, the conditioned media were collected for uPA activity determination. Alternatively, the cell lysates were prepared using 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS (mRIPA). The total protein concentration of the lysates was analyzed. In some experiments, inhibitors of signaling pathways including PD98039, PP2, AG1478, LY294002, SB203580, or Me2SO (vehicle control) were added to culture wells 120 min prior to the introduction of integrin clustering beads. The cells were found to be >95% viable by exclusion of trypan blue at the highest concentrations of all the inhibitors used.Preparation of Antibody-coated Latex Beads—Integrin antibodies and their IgG controls were covalently linked to 3.0-μm latex beads using a kit from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 250 μl of 2.5% bead slurry (Polysciences, Inc.) was used for each batch bead preparation. The beads were washed in PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of 8% gluteraldehyde. The bead mixture was rotated for 4–6 h at room temperature, centrifuged, washed thoroughly, and finally resuspended in 700 μl of PBS. 100 μg of antibody was added to the beads in PBS and incubated overnight on a rotator, following which beads were washed of excess, unbound antibodies, blocked with 0.2 m ethanolamine and bovine serum albumin and finally resuspended in 250 μl of storage buffer.uPA Activity Assay—Net plasminogen activator activity in conditioned media was quantified using a coupled assay to monitor plasminogen activation and the resulting plasmin hydrolysis of a colorimetric substrate (d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide; Sigma) as described previously (23Ghosh S. Brown R. Jones J.C. Ellerbroek S.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23869-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because the assay measures both uPA and tissue-type plasminogen activator activity, control reactions contained 10 μg/ml of the anti-catalytic uPA antibody (American Diagnostica) to assess the tissue-type plasminogen activator levels in cells. None of the oral cell lines tested expressed any tissue-type plasminogen activator, and all of the plasminogen converting activity in the conditioned medium was thus attributed to uPA.uPA Promoter Assays—p-uPA-CAT-2350 containing the sequence –2350 to +30 from the start site of the uPA gene was kindly provided by Dr. Douglas Boyd (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The construct containing the uPA promoter was digested with SmaI and cloned into the SmaI site of the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3 (Promega) to generate the 2350 uPA-Luc construct. The clones were verified by sequencing. To generate the –1967 AP1-Luc, a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. The oligonucleotides used to generate this mutation were: sense, CCT CTT TGT CCA GGA AAT GAA aga ATC TGT CCT CAG CAA TCA GCA TGA, and antisense, GTC ATG CTG ATT GCT GAG GAC AGA tct CTT CAT TTC CTC CTG GAC AA GAG G. The mutated bases are shown as lowercase letters. The clones were verified by restriction digestion and confirmed by sequencing.Subconfluent OKF6/T cells were grown in their normal growth medium and transfected with 2 μg of the reporter constructs using TransIT keratinocyte transfection reagent (Mirus, WI). The cells were then washed with growth factor-free medium after 12 h and treated with the integrin clustering beads coated with IgG, α3 integrin, or β1 integrin antibodies. After 18 h, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed, and the luciferase activities were determined by luminometry. The results were normalized to protein concentration and expressed relative to control cells.Detection of p44/42 ERK and Src Activation—To evaluate the phosphorylation state of ERK and Src, the cells (0.7 × 105) were cultured overnight in growth factor-free medium followed by treatment with IgG-, α3-, or β1-coated beads as described above. At varying time points, the cells were lysed with mRIPA buffer with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and extracted on ice for 20 min. The lysates were centrifuged, protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and equal amounts of cellular protein (20 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to Immobilon. The blots were then probed with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000) to detect total ERK1/2 expression or with anti-ACTIVE-MAPK p42/p44 (1:2000) to detect the phosphorylated, active forms of ERK or anti-phospho Src (1:1000) to estimate the level of active Src.Development of uPAR-deficient OKF6/T Cells—An siRNA knock-down approach was used to generate cells with reduced levels of surface uPAR. The paired oligonucleotides indicated below were annealed and ligated to BbsI-cut vector (psiRNAhH1neo from Invivogen) and transformed into HB101 competent cells. target seq2 oligonucleotide 4A (5′-tcccaagccgttacctcgaatgcatttcaagagaatgcattcgaggtaacggctttt-3′) and target seq2 oligonucleotide 4B (5′-caaaaaaagccgttacctcgaatgcattctcttgaaatgcattcgaggtaacggctt-3′) DNA was isolated (Qiaprep spin miniprep kit; Qiagen), and the identities of the clones were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing with primer OL381 (sequencing primer oligonucleotide OL381, 5′-ccctaactgacacacattcc-3′). Selected clones were then grown in 500-ml cultures, and DNA isolations were done using a nuclease-free DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). OKF6/T cells were transfected by electroporation using the human keratinocyte nucleofector kit and device (Amaxa) following the recommended protocol. Briefly, the cells were cultured to ∼65% confluence, trypsinized, and resuspended at a density of 500,000 cells/100 μl nucleofector solution. DNA (1.5 μg in less than 5 μl) was added to each aliquot of cells and gently mixed, and each aliquot was electroporated. After 24 h under nonselective conditions, the medium was replaced with medium containing 35 μg/ml G418. During outgrowth, the cells were subcultured before reaching 70% confluence, and the selection medium was replaced every 2–3 days. Colonies were picked at the 100 cell stage and grown until they were numerous enough to test for knockdown of uPAR by flow cytometry.Flow Cytometry—Surface expression of uPAR was determined using flow cytometry by incubating 1.8 × 105 cells/100 μl of medium containing antibodies against human uPAR (3937 from American Diagnostica, 1:100) for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with the corresponding fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate GM488 from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR)) at a 1:1000 dilution for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in medium for fluorescence analysis on an Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Control experiments contained only the appropriate secondary antibody.Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells transfected with uPAR siRNA were grown in a 6-well plate, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 30 min with 0.5 mg/ml cell-impermeable Sulfo-NHS-Biotin in ice-cold PBS, followed by washing with 100 mm glycine to quench free biotin. The cells were then detached by scraping, lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) with proteinase inhibitors, and clarified by centrifugation. To isolate biotinylated cell surface proteins, an equal amount of protein from each of the samples was incubated with streptavidin beads at 4 °C for 14 h, followed by centrifugation. After boiling in Laemmli sample dilution buffer to dissociate streptavidin bead-biotin complexes, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gels) and immunoblotted for uPAR (1:1000; American Diagnostica, clone 399R).Analysis of Filopodial Proteins—The relative localization of proteins in cellular versus filopodial fractions was evaluated following biochemical isolation of filopodia as described (29Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, six-well plates containing 1.0-μm pore size membrane inserts were coated on both top and bottom sides with rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences) to a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The collagen was diluted with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.6, and kept overnight at 4 °C for coating. Before the experiment, the inserts were washed twice with PBS. Nearly confluent dishes of OKF6/T cells were first serum-starved overnight. The cells were then trypsinized and neutralized with soybean trypsin inhibitor, centrifuged, and dissolved in serum-free medium. The cells (1 × 106) were then plated on top of each insert in growth factor-free medium. Each bottom chamber contained 2.5 ml of serum-free medium containing EGF (.25 μg/ml) as a chemoattractant. Following a 12-h incubation (empirically determined based on the lack of visible nuclei in the “bottom” fraction), total cell lysate was collected from the top and bottom of paired inserts using lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, 4.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture). The top and bottom lysates were collected and pooled from the replicate chambers, protein concentrations were determined, and samples (40 ug) were then analyzed by Western blotting (29Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30Chodniewicz D. Klemke R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 301: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The effect of peptide α325 or scrambled control peptide on filopodial protrusion was evaluated by performing the above assay in the presence of peptide (20 μm) followed by analysis of total filopodial protein as described above.Analysis of Invasion—Invasive activity was quantified using a Boyden chamber (8-μm pore size) coated with Matrigel (10 μg for 1 h at room temperature) as described earlier (23Ghosh S.

The cells (2 × 105) were added to the upper chamber in 500 μl of serum-free medium. Following 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the noninvading cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab, the filters were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik stain, and the invading cells adherent to the underside of the filter were enumerated using an ocular micrometer and counting a minimum of 10 high powered fields.

Integrins signal cellular responses by regulating the formation of signal transduction complexes on a cytoskeletal framework, and this integration of signaling and cytoskeletal events is dictated by the physical nature of the integrin-ligand interaction. Low valency integrin occupancy can be induced by matrix protein fragments or soluble integrin subunit-specific antibodies and results in redistribution of the integrin to focal adhesions without activation of tyrosine kinase signaling or accumulation of cytoskeletal components (32Miyamoto S.

Up-regulated signaling is associated with many forms of cancer. Casein kinase I ϵ (CKIϵ) is a known component of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway. We find that CKIϵ binds to LRP5 and LRP6 in vitro and in vivo and identify three CKIϵ-specific phosphorylation sites in LRP6. Two of the identified phosphorylation sites, Ser1420 and Ser1430, influence Wnt signaling in vivo, since LRP6 with mutation of these sites is a more potent activator of both β-catenin accumulation and Lef-1 reporter activity. Whereas Wnt3a regulates CKIϵ kinase activity, LRP6 does not, placing CKIϵ upstream of LRP6. Mutation of LRP6 Ser1420 and Ser1430 to alanine strengthens its interaction with axin, suggesting a mechanism by which CKIϵ may negatively regulate Wnt signaling. The role of CKIϵ is therefore more complex than was previously appreciated. Generation of active CKIϵ may induce a negative feedback loop by phosphorylation of sites on LRP5/6 that modulate axin binding and hence β-catenin degradation.

Wnts are secreted proteins that regulate morphogenesis by establishing cell polarity and stimulate cell proliferation and cell migration in response to Wnt concentration gradients in the embryo (1Moon R.T.

Wnt signaling is important both in development and adulthood, particularly for its role in regulating proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Understanding Wnt signaling is also of interest due to its up-regulation in many cancers (2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Groden J. Thliveris A. Samowitz W.

Wnt signal transduction is initiated when the ligand interacts with two integral membrane proteins: a member of the frizzled family of seven pass transmembrane proteins and one of two co-receptors, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins LRP5 and LRP6. This interaction recruits axin to LRP5/6 and leads to inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 (6Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol.

Consequently, β-catenin is not targeted to the proteasome and instead accumulates and translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF proteins to stimulate transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Depending on cell type and type of receptors present, distinct Wnts can also activate additional signaling pathways, including cell migration via RhoA, and changes in calcium-mediated signaling (9Veeman M.T.

CKIα is a potent negative regulator of β-catenin, and its inhibition (e.g. by RNA interference) leads to decreased phosphorylation and marked accumulation of β-catenin, leading to activation of downstream signaling (12Amit S.

In overexpression screens, other members of the CKI family, CKIϵ and the closely related CKIδ, were found to be positive regulators of the pathway, acting upstream of axin and GSK3 and stabilizing β-catenin (15Matsubayashi H.

CKIϵ phosphorylates multiple proteins in the β-catenin degradation complex, including axin, Dvl (disheveled), and the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein, and has previously been shown to destabilize the destruction complex, potentially through phosphorylation of axin or disheveled (19Gao Z.-H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 983-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Notably, the kinase activity of CKIϵ is also regulated by Wnt. In resting cells, both endogenous and overexpressed CKIϵ are inhibited by autophosphorylation of their own carboxyl-terminal autoinhibitory domain. The addition of Wnt ligand leads to rapid dephosphorylation and activation of CKIϵ. Similarly, withdrawal of Wnt ligand rapidly induces phosphorylation and inactivation of CKIϵ. The relevant substrates of activated CKIϵ are not known. Interestingly, overexpression of a constitutively active variant of CKIϵ (CKIϵ MM2) only modestly increases β-catenin stabilization compared with wild type CKIϵ, suggesting that activated wild type CKIϵ may function in downstream events distinct from its role in activation of canonical Wnt signaling (21Swiatek W.

LRP5 and LRP6 are co-receptors that bind Wnts in conjunction with members of the frizzled receptor family and are required to induce β-catenin stabilization and canonical Wnt signaling (23Pinson K.I.

The LRPs are single-pass transmembrane proteins with an extended extracellular domain with sequence similarity to the low density lipoprotein receptor family and a unique intracellular domain. Exactly how these receptor coreceptor pairs transmit their signal across the membrane is not fully understood. Truncation mutants of LRP5/6 that lack their extracellular domain are constitutively active in Wnt signaling, suggesting that this domain plays an inhibitory role against signaling in the absence of Wnt (6Tamai K.

One known requirement for signaling is Wnt-responsive phosphorylation of a series of five highly conserved PPP(S/T)P (PPPSP) motifs in the intracellular domain. Only a single copy of this motif is required for signaling, and mutation of the S/T residues in all five PPPSP motifs eliminates LRP6 ability to signal. Phosphorylation of the PPPSP motifs stimulates axin binding (6Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol.

It is postulated that this recruitment of the axin complex to the membrane via phosphorylated LRP5/6 protects β-catenin from phosphorylation events that target it for destruction (8Mao J. Wang J.

CKIϵ but not CKIα associates with and phosphorylates the intracellular domain of LRP5/6 in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro phosphorylation and mass spectroscopy, two juxtamembrane serines distinct from previously identified CKI sites in LRP6 were identified as CKIϵ substrates. Mutation of these novel CKIϵ target sites significantly stimulates both LRP6-mediated β-catenin accumulation and downstream signaling and is associated with increased binding of axin to LRP6. These findings are consistent with our previous finding that CKIϵ expression destabilizes the β-catenin destruction complex and demonstrate that CKIϵ can both positively and negatively regulate the canonical Wnt pathway.

The expression plasmids for VSVG- and MBP-tagged mutants of LRP6 were constructed by mutating Ser1420 and/or Ser1430 to alanine using pCS2-VSVG wild type or pMAL wild type parental templates and a standard QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene).

Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transient transfections, cells were seeded in individual wells of a 6-well dish treated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). At 60–80% confluence, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total transfected DNA per well was adjusted to 1 μg with empty vector. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 500 ng each of LRP5/6, CKIϵ, CKIα, or Axin expression plasmids were used. For kinase-induced mobility shift experiments, 500 ng of LRP6 expression constructs and 50–500 ng of CKIϵ, CKIα, and GSK3β were transfected. 48–64 h after transfection, IC261 (50 μg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) was added where indicated for up to 5 h prior to cell lysis. After IC261 treatment, growth medium was aspirated, and the transiently transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer. One of two types of lysis buffer was used with equivalent results: buffer I (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) or buffer II (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol).

Cell lysates and antibodies were incubated in lysis buffer (400-μl final volume) for 1 h on ice to allow formation of antigen-antibody complexes. Samples were then incubated with 15 μlof protein A-agarose beads (equilibrated in lysis buffer) for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation.

The kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on 10% acrylamide gels. After protein transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, MBP-LRP6 was visualized by Western blotting using anti-MBP antibody. IC261 was added when indicated. In-gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—SDS-polyacrylamide gel bands of phosphorylated MBP-LPR6 were sliced into 1-mm cubes and digested with 12.5 ng/μl trypsin or chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science), and peptides were extracted according to standard procedures (35Shevchenko A.

At 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and once with hypotonic lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). 200 μl of lysis buffer (supplemented with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors) was added, and cells were incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were then collected and mechanically sheared, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 12.5 μg of supernatant was analyzed for β-catenin levels by immunoblotting. LEF1-luciferase Reporter Assay—pCS2-VSVG-LRP6, pCS2-VSVG-LRP6 ΔN, and their point mutants were transfected (25–100 ng) into 293 STF cells in 6-well dishes along with a Renilla luciferase control plasmid (2 ng). pCS2 empty vector was used to equalize total DNA per well. At 46 h post-transfection, cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer (Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system; Promega), and firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) in a microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To standardize for transfection efficiency, firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The -fold increase of Lef-1-dependent activity was calculated by dividing each activity by that observed from cells transfected with empty pCS2 plasmid. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of experiments performed in triplicate. CKIϵ Interacts with LRP5 and LRP6 in Vivo—CKIϵ and the Wnt coreceptors LRP5 and -6 are both positive regulators of Wnt signaling. To investigate whether CKIϵ acts directly on LRP5/6 to regulate Wnt signaling, the ability of the proteins to interact in vivo was assessed. In reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments, CKIϵ interacted with both LRP5 and LRP6 (Fig. 1, A and B). The interaction with CKIϵ was specific, since antibodies against LRP5/6 did not precipitate CKIϵ in the absence of LRP5/6, and antibodies against tagged CKIϵ did not precipitate LRP5/6 in the absence of kinase. Furthermore, no interaction of LRP5/6 with CKIα was detected (Fig. 1C). The interaction between CKIϵ and LRP5/6 did not appear to require prior phosphorylation of the substrate by CKIϵ, since inclusion of the CKIϵ inhibitor IC261 had no effect on the interaction (Fig. 1D), and kinase-inactive CKIϵ K38A bound equally as well as wild type CKIϵ (data not shown). CKIϵ Interacts with and Phosphorylates LRP6 in Vitro—Visual analysis of the sequence of the cytoplasmic domains of LRP5/6 revealed a potential CKIϵ phosphorylation consensus site after each of the five PPPSP motifs. The consensus site pSXX(S/T) (where pS represents phosphoserine) (38Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A.Q. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been found in the human circadian clock protein PER2 and in the transcription factor NFAT 1 (39Okamura H.

Virshup D.M. Ptacek L.J. Fu Y.H. Science. 2001; 291: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of CKIϵ to phosphorylate LRP6 and to further characterize the CKIϵ/LRP6 interaction in vitro, the cytoplasmic domain of LRP6 (LRP6 ΔN)(containing amino acids 1394–1613 of human LRP6) was expressed and purified from E. coli as an MBP fusion protein. We also expressed and purified MBP-LRP6 ΔN(M5), a mutated version of LRP6 ΔN in which each of the five PPPSP sites have been mutated to PPPAP. Both LRP6 ΔN and LRP6 ΔN M5 showed similar concentration and time-dependent decreases in electrophoretic mobility when incubated with purified CKIϵ(Δ319) (Fig. 2, A and B). (This truncated kinase is constitutively active due to deletion of the autoinhibitory carboxyl terminus). Quantitation of the stoichiometry of in vitro phosphorylation shows that CKIϵ adds ∼3–4 mol of phosphate/mol of MBP-LRP6 when the reaction is driven to completion (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the interaction between CKIϵ and LRP6 is stable and several sites are phosphorylated. In control experiments, MBP alone did not interact with CKIϵ and was not a substrate (data not shown). Since LRP6 ΔN M5 was phosphorylated with kinetics and stoichiometry similar to those of the wild type protein in vitro, this strongly suggested that CKIϵ could not initiate phosphorylation of the PPPSP motifs. (Subsequent studies have indicated that LRP6 primed by GSK3 phosphorylation at the PPPS/TP site can be phosphorylated by CKIγ (26Davidson G. Wu W. Shen J. Bilic J. Fenger U. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2005; 438: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 27Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H. Woodgett J. He X. Nature. 2005; 438: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar)). The in vivo co-immunoprecipitation results combined with the in vitro phosphorylation data suggest a strong and direct interaction between CKIϵ and the cytoplasmic domain of LRP6. To directly test this, MBP-LRP6 ΔN was incubated with CKIϵ, and the interaction was assessed after precipitation of the MBP with amylose beads. As Fig. 2C shows, bacterially expressed and purified CKIϵ Δ319 both interacted with and phosphorylated bacterially expressed LRP6 ΔN, indicating that the interaction is direct and that the carboxyl terminus of CKIϵ is not required for the interaction. The CKIϵ-dependent mobility shift was dependent on kinase activity, since it was completely blocked by inclusion of the CKIϵ inhibitor IC261 (Fig. 2D). Further in vitro phosphorylation assays of LRP6 ΔN and LRP6 ΔNM5 with GSK3β, protein kinase A, or casein kinase II demonstrated a distinct and much less pronounced kinase-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the previous suggestion that GSK3 may be the kinase that activates LRP5 (8Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr III, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), the M5 mutation abrogated the GSK3-induced shift. Whereas the cytoplasmic domain of LRP6 underwent a smaller mobility shift after incubation with either protein kinase A or casein kinase II, the shift was not altered by mutation of the PPPSP motifs. Furthermore, incubations of LRP6 ΔN and the M5 derivative with CKIϵ combined with GSK3, protein kinase A, or casein kinase II produced no obvious supershift relative to that produced by CKIϵ alone (Fig. 2C), indicating that the gel mobility shift is due to CKIϵ alone and is not dependent upon prior priming phosphorylation of LRP6. The lack of detectable supershifting also indicates that CKIϵ does not visibly prime LRP6 for phosphorylation by GSK3, protein kinase A, or casein kinase II.

L-type calcium channels (Cav 1.1, dihydropyridine receptors) acting as voltage sensors activate an unknown signaling pathway involved in phospholipase C activation. We demonstrated that both G protein and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were activated by electrical stimulation, and both the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate rise and slow calcium signal induced by electrical stimulation were blocked by pertussis toxin, by a Gβγ scavenger peptide, and by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. Immunofluorescence using anti-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ antibodies showed a clear location in striations within the cytoplasm, consistent with a position near the I band region of the sarcomere. The time course of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, monitored in single living cells using a pleckstrin homology domain fused to green fluorescent protein, was compatible with sequential phospholipase Cγ1 activation as confirmed by phosphorylation assays for the enzyme. Co-transfection of a dominant negative form of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ inhibited the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity as well as the slow calcium signal. We conclude that Gβγ/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ signaling pathway is involved in phospholipase C activation and the generation of the slow calcium signal induced by tetanic stimulation. We postulate that membrane potential fluctuations in skeletal muscle cells can activate a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C pathway toward modulation of long term, activity-dependent plastic changes.

Recently, another sequence of molecular processes activated by cell membrane depolarization involving the DHPR also acting as membrane voltage sensor has been reported.A slow calcium signal, first described in rat myotubes stimulated with K+ depolarization, occurs several seconds after the fast calcium signal that is due to ryanodine receptor opening and mediates EC coupling. The former is refractory to ryanodine treatment and depends on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation (5Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C998-C1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Araya R. Liberona J.L. Cardenas J.C. Riveros N. Estrada M. Powell J.A. Carrasco A. Jaimovich E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This slow calcium signal has a predominant nuclear component, and its propagation between adjacent nuclei in the myotube can be frequently recorded (5Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C998-C1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the fact that the three types of IP3 receptors are located at different sites within rat myotubes, including the nuclear region, a functional calcium store in isolated nuclei has been recently described (7Cárdenas C. Liberona L.J. Molgó J. Colasante C. Mignery G.A. Jaimovich E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3131-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Treatment of these isolated nuclei with IP3 induces calcium release to the nucleoplasm, regulating phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (7Cárdenas C.

The slow calcium signal appears to participate in the regulation of transcription factors and the modulation of gene expression mediated by membrane depolarization and calcium via an IP3 signaling pathway (8Powell J.A.

In addition, a slow calcium signal localized near the motor endplate of depolarized adult muscle fibers was associated to a region rich in IP3 receptor (11Powell J.A. Molgó J. Adams D.S.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8185-8192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism involved in phospholipase C (PLC) activation induced by membrane depolarization is still not understood but in several systems, G protein-dependent PLC activation has been described. Both Gαq and Gβγ (released from heterotrimeric Gi/o) may directly activate PLCβ isoforms. Also, Gβγ may indirectly activate PLCγ increasing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) levels by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) γ (12Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 13Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar).When, tetanic electrical field stimulation was used instead of K+ depolarization, an enhanced IP3-dependent, slow calcium signal was observed, and again the DHPR was necessary to sense the action potentials induced by the stimulation protocol (14Eltit J.M. Hidalgo J. Liberona J.L. Jaimovich E. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3042-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this work we test the hypothesis that tetanic electrical stimulation of myotubes activates both G protein and PI3K and that both signaling pathways are required for the activation of PLC and the onset of the slow calcium signal. We now present evidence that both Gβγ and PI3Kγ are activated by tetanic stimulation and are involved in the generation of the slow calcium signal. Moreover, we found that electrical stimulation induce PLCγ1 phosphorylation in both cytoplasm and nuclear envelope suggesting that the Gβγ/PI3Kγ pathway could be involved in the transduction of the electrical message in the T-tubule membrane to an IP3-dependent calcium signal in the nucleus. This is the first study to suggest a role for the Gβγ/PI3Kγ pathway in the development of a depolarization-dependent calcium signal in excitable cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary and 1B5 Cell Cultures—Rat myotubes primary cultures were prepared as detailed previously (5Jaimovich E.

Allen (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). These cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids used encode the fusion protein between the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) ((PH)BTK-GFP) or the (PHmut)BTK-GFP (punctual mutation R28C of the PH domain). Both plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Tamas Balla (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (15Várnai P. Rother K.I. Balla T. J. Biol.

Alternatively, (PH)BTK-GFP was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the kinase-inactive p110γ K799R (PI3Kγ(KR)) (16Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R.

These p110γ plasmids and a monoclonal anti-p110γ antibody were kindly provided by Dr. Matthias P. Wymann (University of Fribourg, Switzerland). Also, these PI3Kγ plasmids were co-transfected with monomeric DsRed (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as transfection marker, and the calcium signals of the transfected cells were measured using Fluo3 (see below).Incubation of Cells and Calcium Measurements—Cells were incubated with 40 μm LY294002 (LY, Calbiochem), 100 nm wortmannin (Sigma-Aldrich), or for at least 4 h with 1 μg/ml PTX (Calbiochem). Adenoviral transfection is described below. For calcium measurements, cells were loaded with 5.5 μm Fluo3-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Krebs buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4) in the presence of the pharmacological agent to be tested for 40 min, washed three times and incubated in Krebs solution, also in the presence of the drug. Alternatively for the calcium-free condition, the washout and the measurement were performed in calcium-free saline (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4). As control, the vehicle instead of the drug was used. The electrical field stimulation (400 pulses of 1 ms at 45 Hz were used in all experiments except when indicated), and calcium signal acquisition was performed as was previously described (14Eltit J.M. Hidalgo J. Liberona J.L. Jaimovich E. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3042-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Action Potential Measurements—Membrane potential was measured with ∼40 mΩ tip resistance microelectrodes, filled with 1 m potassium glutamate, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.4. An Ag/AgCl electrode in a salt bridge filled with the same solution was used as ground reference. The microelectrode was connected to a Micro-Probe System Model M-707 (WPI, Sarasota, FL). The output was offset-corrected, and capacity was compensated and then digitized by an analog to digital converter (Labmaster DMA, Scientific Solutions, Mentor, OH). Trains of 20 pulses of 1 ms delivered at 2, 10, or 45 Hz were used; spontaneous action potentials were also observed.Enhanced GFP and Fluo3 AM Fluorescence Acquisition by Confocal Microscopy—Transfected 1B5 cells or primary myotubes loaded with Fluo3-AM were placed in an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Axiovert 200) coupled to an LSM 5-pascal confocal attachment. An argon laser at 488 nm was used as the excitation source, the laser power was used in the standby position at 1% of transmission to avoid photobleaching, and the emission was collected in one channel equipped with a 505-530 nm bandpass filter. The electrical stimulation was delivered by an independent device (14Eltit J.M. Hidalgo J. Liberona J.L. Jaimovich E. Biophys.

Graphs were generated using Origin 6.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).IP3 Measurements—Cells were exposed to pharmacological agents as described above or were transfected with adenovirus. An electrical field stimulator device previously described (14Eltit J.M. Hidalgo J. Liberona J.L. Jaimovich E. Biophys.

Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center). After stimulation, 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem) was added and centrifuged (10 min at 20,000 × g). Ten microliters of the supernatant was separated for the total Gβ determination (SDS-PAGE, see below). To the remaining extract, 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and 60 μg of the recombinant protein immobilized in the glutathione-agarose resin were added. After 45-min incubation at 4 °C with rotation, the agarose beads were washed three times with cold binding buffer, and retained proteins were removed from the beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Monoclonal antibodies against β subunit G protein (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were used, and the blots were developed with an anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Results were calculated as the relative amount of activated Gβ (pull down) corrected by the total amount of Gβ for each condition. Routinely, membranes were stained with Ponceau Red to check the equal amount of recombinant protein loaded (data not shown).PIP3 Measurements—Cultured myotubes were incubated in Krebs solution (phosphate-free) for 1 h. Then the cells were switched to Krebs plus 50 μCi/ml 32PO4 for 1.5 h. After stimulation the cells were scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold 2.5 m HCl, and the lysates were transferred to borosilicate glass test tubes. The chloroform extraction of phospholipids and the TLC development condition were performed as described previously (20Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography. Spots from PIP, PIP2, and PIP3 were scraped and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). The counts of PIP3 were corrected by dividing PIP plus PIP2 counts as internal controls, and the results were expressed as -fold over the control condition. At least 70% of the counts recovered from the TLC spot correspond to PIP3, evaluated by deacylation and high-performance liquid chromatography (20Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L.

Rios J. Muller M. Estrada M. Jaimovich E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3673-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were a polyclonal (rabbit) anti-p110γ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), a monoclonal (mouse) anti-α-actinin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), monoclonal (mouse) anti-fast myosin (Sigma-Aldrich), monoclonal (mouse) anti-α1S DHPR (ABR, Golden, CO), monoclonal (mouse) anti-PLCγ1 (BD Biosciences), a polyclonal (rabbit) anti-phospho-PLCγ1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a monoclonal (mouse) anti-LAP2 (BD Biosciences). As secondary antibodies an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 and an anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 633 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used for co-localization of PI3Kγ with the indicated markers. And as secondary antibodies an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 633 and an anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 was used when co-localization of pPLCγ1 with the indicated marker was studied. The double-labeled preparations were observed in a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Axiovert 200, LSM 5-pascal, argon laser at 488 nm for Alexa 488 and HeNe laser at 633 nm for Alexa 633). A single track acquisition was done, collecting emission in one channel the 505-530 bandpass signal for Alexa 488 and the 650 longpass signal in the other channel for Alexa 633. Images were deconvoluted using Iterative deconvolution software of Image J, 4W. S. Rasband (1997) rsb.info.nih.gov/ij. and the point spread function was calculated for each objective lens using calibrated fluorescent beads. Brightness and contrast were adjusted off-line to improve clarity for each image; no data were added or deleted. For phospho-PLC experiments, comparison between stimulated and non-stimulated condition was performed with identical acquisition settings.Recombinant Adenoviruses—Adenoviral vectors (Ad) were propagated and purified as previously described (21Shah A.S.

Two transgenes (a gift from Dr. W. J. Koch, Duke University Medical Center) were used: ctβARK (AdβARK) and an empty viral construct (EV). The ctβARK construct is a peptide inhibitor of Gβγ signaling (22Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myotubes were infected with adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 at least 48 h before were used for the indicated experiments.Statistical Analysis—Data of n experiments were expressed as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post test for comparison between groups. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSFast and Slow Calcium Signal Induced by Electrical Stimulation—To illustrate both the fast and slow calcium signals evoked by the same electrical stimulation, intracellular calcium was monitored by the Fluo3 fluorescence in loaded myotubes and visualized by confocal microscopy. Fluorescence image previous to stimulation (Fig. 1A) represents the basal level. During stimulation, a generalized calcium increase saturating the dye was induced (Fig. 1B). It is directly associated to the EC coupling mechanism, and cell contraction was visualized accordingly (data not shown). Seconds after, fluorescence returned to basal levels (Fig. 1C, 13 s after stimulation ended). 30-40 s after stimulation; the slow calcium signal arose, whereas cell contraction was absent (data not shown). Fluorescence during the slow calcium signal, 65 s after stimulus ended can be appreciated (Fig. 1D). The time course of changes in calcium levels in a single cell (Fig. 1E), can be seen during an experiment in which each image was acquired every 1 s. The signals depicted here illustrate the response of a single cell; a detailed statistical study of the two types of signals induced by electrical stimulation was published (14Eltit J.M. Hidalgo J. Liberona J.L. Jaimovich E. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3042-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In our previous work we demonstrated that field stimulation induces action potentials that in turn trigger both calcium signals (14Eltit J.M. Hidalgo J. Liberona J.L. Jaimovich E. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3042-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To define the relationship between extracellular stimulation and action potential induction at different stimulation frequencies, the membrane potential was monitored with an intracellular microelectrode. Fig. 1F shows action potentials elicited in the same cell by extracellular field stimulation using 1-ms pulses at 2, 10, and 45 Hz. The time needed to restore the resting membrane potential after the spike for a spontaneous action potential was 33.6 ± 1.1 ms; at 2 Hz external stimulation was 24.8 ± 0.2 ms, at 10 Hz was 19.6 ± 0.3 ms, and it was 15.1 ± 0.3 ms at 45 Hz. These results show that the myotube shortens the action potential duration by increasing the repolarization rate in response to higher stimulation frequencies, ensuring the generation of one action potential for each stimulation pulse at all the frequencies within the tested range.A G Protein Is Activated by Electrical Stimulation—To identify the relationship between changes in membrane potential and G protein activity, we assessed G protein activation using a pull-down assay. When G protein is activated, the α subunit binds GTP and the βγ dimer is released. Both GTP-α and βγ subunits have downstream targets (23Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). A molecular tool, frequently employed to study the participation of the βγ subunits in signaling pathways is the carboxyl terminus of the β adrenergic receptor kinase (ctβARK) that binds to the βγ dimer, which, working as scavenger, blocks its actions (22Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure G protein dissociation (upon activation), the ctβARK peptide fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” together with GST alone as a control (Fig. 2A). The recombinant protein immobilized in a glutathione-agarose resin was used as bait for affinity purification of βγ subunits in a pulldown assay, using lysates of myotubes previously subjected to electrical stimulation protocols. As control, when GST instead of GST-ctβARK was used, no βγ dimer was detected in the pull-down assay (Fig. 2B). The quantification of three independent experiments shows no change (the decrease of the Gβγ recovery 25 s after stimulation was not statistically different from control condition) until 50 s after stimulation, when a 65 ± 9% increase in Gβγ recovery over the control value was evident, and it returned to control levels after 75 s (Fig. 2C). This result suggests that G protein may be activated by our stimulation protocol but also shows that the ctβARK binds Gβγ in our system, even in non-stimulated cells. This is a good control for the following experiments were this scavenger peptide was delivered by adenoviral transfection to block Gβγ.FIGURE 2The G protein is activated by the electrical stimulation. Pull-down assay for Gβγ subunit was performed as describes under “Experimental Procedures.” For this purpose, the GST fused to the carboxyl terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (GST-ctβARK) was expressed and purified (this protein has high affinity for Gβγ) as a control was purified the GST (A). B, the stimulated lysates were exposed to the recombinant protein immobilized in glutathione-agarose resin, and the affinity-purified Gβγ from the lysates was subjected to Western blot developing using a monoclonal anti-Gβ antibody. Also, for each condition the total amount of Gβ was measured. C, the detected Gβ by the pull-down assay was corrected by the total Gβ of each condition and expressed n-fold over the control condition. The mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments is shown. The difference in the response is statistically significant; *, p < 0.05 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The βγ Subunits Are Involved in Both PLC Activation and the Slow Calcium Signal Onset—The slow calcium signal induced by electrical stimulation was monitored in myotubes preloaded with Fluo-3AM. When myotubes were exposed to PTX, the slow calcium signal was strongly blocked (Fig. 3A); likewise, transfection with an adenovirus that encodes ctβARK (AdβARK) blocked the slow calcium signal (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the control transfection with an empty adenovirus (EV) showed no inhibitory effect (control, Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Participation of G protein in the slow calcium signal induced by electrical stimulation. A, the slow calcium signal induced by electrical stimulation (400 pulses of 1 ms at 45 Hz, lower trace) was measured in the presence of Gi/o protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX); the control condition in the absence of extracellular calcium (0.5 mm EGTA) is shown. The mean trace ± S.E. of at least 10 experiments is shown. B, the calcium signal was measured in myotubes transfected with an adenovirus that encodes the Gβγ scavenger ctβARK (AdβARK), and the controls were myotubes transfected with the empty adenovirus (Control) in calcium-free condition. The mean trace ± S.E. of at least 10 experiments is shown. C, the IP3 mass was measured in myotubes 75 s after electrical stimulation (400 pulses of 1 ms at 45 Hz) in the presence and absence of PTX. The mean ± S.E. of three experiments is shown. IP3 production induced by electrical stimulation (***, p < 0.001 versus corresponding control) was significantly inhibited by PTX treatment (&&&, p < 0.001 versus control stimulated condition). D, IP3 measurement, 75 s after electrical stimulation in myotubes non-transfected (Control) or transfected alternatively with the empty adenovirus (EV) or AdβARK. The electrical stimulation induce an increase in IP3 mass in the control condition (***, p < 0.001 versus corresponding control) and in EV transfection (&&, p < 0.01 versus corresponding control). The transfection of the Gβγ scavenger (AdβARK) strongly blocks the IP3 production induced by the electrical stimulation ($$, p < 0.01 versus EV stimulated condition).

https://openalex.org/W2041313744,"The mechanism of partial agonism at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors is an unresolved issue, especially with respect to the role of protein dynamics. We have performed multiple molecular dynamics simulations (7 x 20 ns) to examine the behavior of the ligand-binding core of the NR1 subunit with a series of ligands. Our results show that water plays an important role in stabilizing different conformations of the core and how a closed cleft conformation of the protein might be stabilized in the absence of ligands. In the case of ligand-bound simulations with both full and partial agonists, we observed that ligands within the binding cleft may undergo distinct conformational changes, without grossly influencing the degree of cleft closure within the ligand-binding domain. In agreement with recently published crystallographic data, we also observe similar changes in backbone torsions corresponding to the hinge region between the two lobes for the partial agonist, D-cycloserine. This observation rationalizes the classification of D-cycloserine as a partial agonist and should provide a basis with which to predict partial agonism in this class of receptor by analyzing the behavior of these torsions with other potential ligands."

AHR binds a wide variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, including polycyclic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and mediates their toxic effects, such as teratogenesis, immunosuppression, and tumor promotion (1Hankinson O.

The best studied AHR ligand is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Unliganded AHR is found in the cytoplasm as part of a multimeric complex containing two molecules of HSP90, the HSP90 cochaperone p23, and one hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 (6Carlson D.B.

Upon ligand binding, AHR translocates into the nucleus and associates with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) to form a heterodimer (1Hankinson O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar, 3Denison M.S.

The AHR/ARNT dimer then recognizes and binds to xenobiotic-responsive elements (XREs) located in the regulatory domains of AHR-responsive genes, many of which are involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2S1, and aldehyde oxydase 1 (1Hankinson O.

Upon DNA binding, the AHR/ARNT dimer recruits multiple coactivator complexes to the promoter of AHR-responsive genes (1Hankinson O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Carlson D.B. Perdew G.H. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Each coactivator complex constitutes a signal transduction pathway that transmits the activating signal from the AHR to specific downstream targets in the transcription machinery. For example, a member of the SWI/SNF complex, the Brahma/SWI2-related gene 1 protein (Brg-1), has been reported to be involved in transcriptional activation by AHR and participates in the remodeling of chromatin conformation around the promoter by means of an ATPase activity (12Wang S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11821-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The TRAP-DRIP-mediator complex also plays a physiological role in AHR-mediated gene transcription by recruiting and activating RNA polymerase II (13Wang S. Ge K. Roeder R.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13593-13600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other transcription coactivators, such as p160 coactivators, p300/CBP, RIP140, CoCoA, and TRIP230, have also been shown to be involved in transcriptional activation by AHR (14Beischlag T.V. Wang S.

GRIP1-associated coactivator 63 (GAC63), is a newly identified nuclear receptor (NR) coactivator (19Chen Y.H. Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5965-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GAC63 (also known as human embryonic lung protein or HUEL) interacts with the bHLH-PAS domain of p160 coactivators as well as the ligand binding domain of some NRs, such as estrogen receptor and androgen receptor. Overexpression of GAC63 enhanced transcriptional activation by NRs in a hormone-dependent manner. Although GAC63 can interact with NR directly, its coactivator function depends on the presence of a p160 coactivator with an intact bHLH-PAS domain. Thus, it functions as a secondary coactivator in NR-mediated gene transcription. Because p160 coactivators and AHR share bHLH-PAS domains, we investigated the possibility that GAC63 is also a coactivator in AHR-mediated transcription. We report here that GAC63 interacts with AHR and functions as a primary coactivator in AHR-mediated gene transcription, i.e. its coactivator function is independent of the presence of p160 coactivators or any other coactivators. Endogenous GAC63 is recruited to the XRE region of an AHR-responsive gene and is important for optimal transcriptional activation by AHR. Plasmids—The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mouse AHR expression plasmid (pACTAG-2.mAHR) was the kind gift of Dr. Oliver Hankinson (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). pGudluc 6.1, encoding a CYP1A1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene, was obtained from Dr. Michael Denison (University of California, Davis). A cDNA fragment encoding full-length mouse AHR was inserted into pGEX-5X1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to express a fusion protein with N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli.

GST Pull-down Assay—[35S]Methionine-labeled full-length AHR, GAC63, and their fragments were synthesized in vitro by using TnT-Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (17Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol.

Endogenous Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Hepa1c1c7 cells, hereafter referred to as Hepa-1 cells, were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell lysates were cleared with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4°C. 2 μg of rabbit anti-GAC63 antibody (19Chen Y.H. Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5965-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. 30 μl of protein A/G beads were added and incubated for another 3 h. Beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with anti-AHR antibody (Affinity BioReagents). Transient Transfection Assay—Hepa-1 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of streptomycin and penicillin/ml. Typically, 500 ng of the CYP1A1 promoter-driven luciferase vector, pGudluc 6.1, was transfected alone or in combination with increasing amounts of pSG5.HA-GAC63 (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 μg) into 6-well plates using 15 μl of Superfect reagent (Qiagen) as per manufacturer's instructions. For synergy studies with GRIP1, cells were cotransfected with reporter and either 0.5 or 1.0μg of pCMX-GRIP1 alone, or 0.5 or 1.0 μg each of pCMXGRIP1 and pSG5.HA-GAC63. Final DNA concentration was equalized by the addition of empty plasmid vector. Three hours after transfection, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced. Cells were treated with either 5 nm TCDD or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and incubated for an additional 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 300 μl of 1× cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). The lysates were vortexed, and cellular debris was pelleted by high speed centrifugation in a table-top microcentrifuge. Twentyμl of supernatant was added to 100μlof luciferase assay substrate (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was determined using a TD-20e Luminometer (Turner Systems, Sunnyvale, CA). Each transfection was performed in duplicate, and the experiments were repeated two additional times. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed with Hepa-1 cells from one 15-cm dish treated with or without 10 nm TCDD for 60 min as described previously (17Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49842-49848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Chen Y.H. Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

Immunoprecipitated, purified, chromosomal DNA was used for PCR amplification, using the following primers: CYP1A1 (–1141/–784), 5′-CTATCTCTTAAACCCCACCCCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAAGTATGGTGGAGGAAAGGGTG-3′ (reverse); β-actin (–527 to –205), 5′-ATTGCTAGCAATTGCTAGCAAGGGGGAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAGAAAGCGAGATTGAGGAAGAGGATGA-3′ (reverse). Quantitative real time PCRs (QPCR) were performed with 2 μl (from a total of 50 μl) of immunoprecipitated chromosomal DNA with a Stratagene Mx3000P Instrument, using the same primers as for standard PCR. RNA Interference—RNA interference experiments were performed as described previously (17Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49842-49848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Chen Y.H. Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5965-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides for GAC63 and mismatch siRNA were synthesized by the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center Microchemical Core Laboratory and annealed to form duplexes. The following siRNA sequences were used: siGAC63, 5′-GCUCUUGCCAGAGAGAAAAdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUUUCUCUCUGGCAAGAGCdTdT-3′ (antisense). Mismatch siRNA, 5′-GGUCUUGUCAGACAGAAAAdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUUUCUGUCUGACAAGACCdTdT-3′ (antisense) (mismatched bases are underlined). Two days after siRNA transfection, Hepa-1 cells were treated with or without TCDD. Twenty-four hours after TCDD treatment, total Hepa-1 cell RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and subjected to reverse transcription by using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). 2 μl of reverse transcription product was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) analysis. The primers used were as follows: mouse GAC63, 5′-TGGTATCATGGAATCATGGG-3′ (forward), 5′-TGCTCCTTCAGACACCAAAG-3′ (reverse); mouse CYP1A1, 5′-GGCCAGACCTCTACAGCTTC-3′ (forward), 5′-CTCACGTGCTCCTCCAAGTA-3′ (reverse); mouse β-actin, 5′-AGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-3′ (forward), 5′-CTTGCTGATCCACATCTGCT-3′ (reverse). Cell extracts were also tested by immunoblotting using anti-GAC63 and anti-actin antibodies. Interaction of GAC63 with AHR—Because GAC63 interacts with the bHLH-PAS motif of GRIP1, and AHR also has the bHLH-PAS motif, GAC63 might also interact with AHR. To test this hypothesis, we performed GST pull-down assays. GST-GAC63 attached to glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads efficiently bound full-length AHR in the absence or presence of TCDD treatment, whereas GST attached to beads did not (Fig. 1A). Conversely, GST-AHR also specifically bound in vitro synthesized GAC63 with or without TCDD treatment (Fig. 1B). The interaction of AHR with GST-GAC63 was enhanced modestly by TCDD treatment (Fig. 1A), whereas the binding of GAC63 and GST-AHR was not affected (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that GAC63 binds directly to AHR in vitro, in the absence or presence of TCDD treatment. To test for binding in intact cells in culture, we performed endogenous coimmunoprecipitation assays using the mouse liver cell line Hepa1. Specific binding of GAC63 to AHR was detected without TCDD treatment when anti-GAC63 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C). No enhancement of binding was detected in the presence of TCDD (data not shown). These results suggest that GAC63 interacts with AHR in intact cells in culture. Determination of Interaction Domains of GAC63 and AHR—To determine the AHR interaction domain within GAC63, we performed GST pull-down assays. Among several GAC63 fragments synthesized in vitro, a fragment of the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–200) efficiently and specifically bound to GST-AHR, but fragments of the central region (amino acids 200–370) and the C-terminal region (amino acids 370–567) only had weak or no binding to GST-AHR (Fig. 2B). Thus, the N-terminal region of GAC63 is the major AHR interaction domain. We also tested the GAC63 interaction domain within AHR using GST pull-down assays. The N-terminal fragment of AHR (amino acids 1–374) specifically bound to GST-GAC63, whereas the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 375–805) only showed weak binding (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that the N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain of AHR is the major GAC63 interaction domain. GAC63 Functions as a Coactivator in AHR-mediated Transcription—GAC63 is a secondary coactivator in NR-mediated gene transcription. Although it can bind NR directly, its coactivator function depends on the presence of GRIP1. Moreover, GRIP1 has been reported to be a coactivator in AHR-dependent gene activation. To test whether GAC63 also functions as a coactivator in this pathway, we performed transient transfection assays in AHR/ARNT-positive Hepa-1 cells to study the effect of overexpression of GAC63 on AHR-mediated gene transcription. Hepa1 cells were transfected with a CYP1A1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid (pGudluc 6.1) and either empty vector or increasing amounts of GAC63 expression vector alone or in combination with GRIP1 expression vector, with or without TCDD treatment. TCDD treatment alone enhanced CYP1A1 promoter-driven luciferase activity ∼8-fold (Fig. 3, assay 1). As expected, overexpression of GRIP1 enhanced the ligand-dependent activity of AHR (Fig. 3, assays 6 and 7). Interestingly, unlike in NR-mediated transcription, overexpression of GAC63 enhanced AHR activity up to 7-fold in a ligand-dependent and dose-dependent manner, in the absence of GRIP1 (Fig. 3, assays 2–5). The combination of GAC63 and GRIP1 did not further enhance AHR activity (Fig. 3, assays 8 and 9). These data suggest that although GAC63 is a secondary coactivator in NR-mediated transcription, it functions as a primary coactivator in AHR-dependent gene activation. GAC63 Is Recruited to the XRE Region of the CYP1A1 Gene—GAC63 interacts with AHR (Fig. 1) and functions as a coactivator in AHR-mediated gene expression when GAC63 is overexpressed in transient transfection assays (Fig. 3). To test whether endogenous GAC63 is recruited to the XREs of known genes that are regulated by AHR, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to examine the XRE of CYP1A1 gene in mouse Hepa-1 cells. Hepa-1 cells were treated either with 10 nm TCDD in Me2SO or with Me2SO vehicle for 60 min. The cross-linked, sheared chromatin fractions were immunoprecipitated with various antibodies, and the precipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR amplification of the XRE region of the CYP1A1 gene. As expected, AHR was recruited to the XRE region after TCDD treatment. In addition, anti-GAC63 antibody efficiently immunoprecipitated this region in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Normal IgG served as a negative control, and the input chromatin levels from TCDD-treated or untreated cells were equivalent. The recruitment of AHR and GAC63 was specific for the XRE region of CYP1A1 gene, because PCRs with primers for the mouse β-actin promoter region failed to produce a signal from the same immunoprecipitated chromatin fractions. QPCR analysis confirmed the TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR and GAC63 to the native, chromosomally integrated XRE region of CYP1A1 gene (Fig. 4B). GAC63 Is Important for Efficient Transcriptional Activation by AHR—Overexpression of GAC63 enhances AHR-regulated reporter gene expression (Fig. 3). To test for a physiological role of endogenous GAC63 in the process of transcriptional activation by AHR, we performed siRNA experiments to decrease the expression of endogenous GAC63. The GAC63 siRNA specifically reduced the level of endogenous GAC63 mRNA (Fig. 5A, upper panel) and protein (Fig. 5B), whereas the mismatch siRNA did not. The expression of AHR-regulated CYP1A1 gene was inhibited by 40% in the presence of GAC63-directed siRNA but not affected by an equivalent amount of mismatch siRNA (Fig. 5A, lower panel). A similar result was obtained with another pair of siRNAs, one targeting a different region of GAC63 and the other a scrambled-sequence control (data not shown). The effect on CYP1A1 gene expression was specific, because the results shown are normalized to the level of β-actin transcripts. Thus, although GAC63 is only one of several known coactivators for AHR, endogenous GAC63 makes an important contribution to the efficient transcriptional activation of endogenous genes by AHR. Ligand-activated AHR/ARNT dimer binds to the XRE of AHR-responsive genes and transmits the activating signal through a variety of coactivator complexes (1Hankinson O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Each coactivator complex fulfills a specific task to help the transcriptional activation by AHR. For example, the SWI/SNF complex contributes to chromatin remodeling (12Wang S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11821-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the TRAP-DRIP-mediator complex helps to recruit and activate RNA polymerase II (13Wang S. Ge K. Roeder R.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13593-13600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that GAC63, a newly identified nuclear receptor coactivator, also functions as a coactivator in transcriptional activation by AHR. In our study, GAC63 interacts with AHR in a ligand-independent manner (Fig. 1). Several other transcription coactivators, such as p160 coactivators and CoCoA, have been shown to interact with AHR in a similar manner (14Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49842-49848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The human orthologue of GAC63, HUEL, has several potential nuclear localization signals and is primarily cytoplasmic in interphase cells, but it undergoes nuclear translocation during the S-phase of the cell cycle (20Sim D.L.C. Yeo W.M. Chow V.T.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 487-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because AHR undergoes nuclear translocation upon ligand binding, it is possible that GAC63 exists in a complex with unliganded AHR and travels with liganded AHR into nucleus. We also tested the interaction between GAC63 and ARNT in GST pull-down assays, and found that GAC63 also interacts with ARNT directly in vitro (data not shown). However, we failed to detect their interaction in intact cells in culture using coimmunoprecipitation assays. Whether GAC63 binds to ARNT within the context of the AHR/ARNT heterodimer bound to DNA will need to be determined. A previous study (19Chen Y.H. Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5965-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has shown that although GAC63 can interact with NR directly, its coactivator function in NR-mediated transcription depends on the presence of p160 coactivators. Interestingly, overexpression of GAC63 alone enhanced AHR activity in a ligand-dependent and dose-dependent manner, in the absence of GRIP1. When GAC63 was cotransfected with GRIP1, no synergy was observed (Fig. 3). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that GAC63 and GRIP1 may function synergistically as coactivators for AHR/ARNT under different conditions. Thus, GAC63 functions as a primary coactivator in AHR-mediated transcription, whereas it serves as a secondary coactivator in transactivation by NR. Endogenous GAC63 was recruited to the XRE region of the CYP1A1 gene in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4), and reduction of endogenous GAC63 by siRNA inhibited the expression of CYP1A1 gene by 40% (Fig. 5). This partial inhibition could be because of residual GAC63, or the compensatory effects by other transcription coactivators, such as p300/CBP, BRG-1, p160 coactivators, Med220, and CoCoA, which are also known to mediate AHR function. Thus, we conclude that GAC63 is important for optimal transcriptional activation by AHR and is a physiological part of AHR-mediated gene transcription. We also identified the domains within GAC63 and AHR required for their mutual interactions. The N-terminal and central regions of GAC63 have been reported to be responsible for interaction with GRIP1 (19Chen Y.H. Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5965-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, the N-terminal region of GAC63 is the major AHR interaction domain, and the central region also showed weak binding to AHR (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal region has a zinc finger-like motif, and the central region has two leucine zipper-like motifs (21Sim D.L.C. Chow V.T.K. Genomics. 1999; 59: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It remains to be tested whether these motifs might contribute to GAC63 interaction with AHR. We also found that the N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain of AHR is the major GAC63 interaction domain. Similarly, the N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain of GRIP1 has been shown to be the GAC63 interaction domain (19Chen Y.H. Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5965-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal and central regions of GAC63, especially the N-terminal region, may generally recognize and bind bHLH-PAS domains. AHR, ARNT, and p160 coactivators all belong to bHLH-PAS gene family (4Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 5Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that GAC63 might also interact with other members of bHLH-PAS gene family, and serve as a general coactivator for all the bHLH-PAS transcription factors. Future studies of the physical and functional interaction between GAC63 and other bHLH-PAS proteins will help us to understand the transactivation mechanisms of the bHLH-PAS gene family and their functions in regulating target gene expression. Furthermore, GAC63 might also function as a coactivator for transcription factors other than the bHLH-PAS transcription factors. The nature of the downstream targets and the specific components of the transcription machinery that are regulated by GAC63 are currently under investigation in our laboratory. AHR-mediated gene transcription proceeds in a manner similar to NR-mediated transcription (6Carlson D.B. Perdew G.H. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although AHR and NR have different ligands and target genes, they share a variety of transcriptional coactivators. For example, acetyltransferase p300/CBP, SWI/SNF ATPase subunit BRG-1, p160 coactivators, mediator subunit Med220, CoCoA, and TRIP230 are all involved in both AHR- and NR-mediated gene transcription (1Hankinson O.

GAC63 provides another example of a transcriptional coactivator that is involved in both signaling pathways. Furthermore, TCDD has been shown to antagonize functions of several nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptor (22Safe S. Wang F. Porter W. Duan R. McDougal A. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 102-103: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), androgen receptor (23Jana N.R. Sarkar S. Ishizuka M. Yonemoto J. Tohyama C. Sone H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Gonzalez F. Jefcoate C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antagonistic effect by TCDD could be due to competition for coregulators, in addition to other proposed mechanisms, such as enhanced ligand metabolism, down-regulation of nuclear receptor levels, transrepression, and altered hormone synthesis (6Carlson D.B.

https://openalex.org/W2075384032,"We developed a strategy for finding out the adapted variants of enzymes, and we applied it to an enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in terms of its catalytic activity so that we successfully obtained several hyperactive cysteine- and methionine-free variants of DHFR in which all five methionyl and two cysteinyl residues were replaced by other amino acid residues. Among them, a variant (M1A/M16N/M20L/M42Y/C85A/M92F/C152S), named as ANLYF, has an approximately seven times higher kcat value than wild type DHFR. Enzyme kinetics and crystal structures of the variant were investigated for elucidating the mechanism of the hyperactivity. Steady-state and transient binding kinetics of the variant indicated that the kinetic scheme of the catalytic cycle of ANLYF was essentially the same as that of wild type, showing that the hyperactivity was brought about by an increase of the dissociation rate constants of tetrahydrofolate from the enzyme-NADPH-tetrahydrofolate ternary complex. The crystal structure of the variant, solved and refined to an R factor of 0.205 at 1.9-Å resolution, indicated that an increased structural flexibility of the variant and an increased size of the N-(p-aminobenzoyl)-l-glutamate binding cleft induced the increase of the dissociation constant. This was consistent with a large compressibility (volume fluctuation) of the variant. A comparison of folding kinetics between wild type and the variant showed that the folding of these two enzymes was similar to each other, suggesting that the activity enhancement of the enzyme can be attained without drastic changes of the folding mechanism.

A comparison of folding kinetics between wild type and the variant showed that the folding of these two enzymes was similar to each other, suggesting that the activity enhancement of the enzyme can be attained without drastic changes of the folding mechanism. To freely design enzymes with desired properties is the ultimate dream for protein engineers. Because the “protein folding problem,” namely how an amino acid sequence determines its tertiary folded structure, has not completely been solved at atomic resolution, the rational design approach is still limited, even for improvement of enzymes from natural sources. Alternatively, protein design can be thought of as a process of “picking up” from all the possible amino acid sequences (i.e. sequence space) until a protein with the desired properties is found, because the structure and function of a protein is determined by its amino acid sequence (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5137) Google Scholar). When we set the goal of protein design “to create a protein of a desired property consisting of a given number of amino acid residues n,” the solution can be obtained by the complete search of all the possible amino acid sequences with “n” amino acid residues, the total number reaching 20n. Therefore, the protein design problem can be reduced to a searching problem in sequence space of polypeptides with n amino acid residues. The solution to this searching problem should include a reliable process that can be performed within a realistic time span, otherwise it is of no use in practical protein design. In this regard, the size of sequence space to be searched is a critical factor (2Joyce G.F. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The size of the sequence space of a polypeptide with amino acids even as small as 100 is 20100 (∼10130), a number that is unreachable even within an astronomical time span if one were to examine all the amino acid sequences. To avoid this problem, the evolutionary algorithm is a powerful and useful strategy that has been used in biotechnology to search amino acid sequence space for proteins with functional properties that are superior to the natural products (2Joyce G.F. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Patten P.A. Howard R.J. Stemmer W.P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Adaptive walking in the sequence space by DNA shuffling or by error-prone PCR has resulted in the significant improvement of naturally occurring enzymes, as demonstrated by Stemmer and co-workers (3Patten P.A. Howard R.J. Stemmer W.P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar), Chen and Arnold (5Chen K. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5618-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and others (6Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The keys for the success in these evolutionary algorithms are both how one can create a large mutant pool and how one can develop a powerful selection system of the target protein from the large mutant pool (2Joyce G.F. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The former limits the reproducibility and the latter limits the generalization. Here we propose a novel picking up process in the sense of protein design, a reproducible process that can be performed within a realistic time span by greatly reducing the number of mutant proteins to be tested, which is a useful strategy for improvement of naturally occurring proteins. The outline of the proposed process, “quasi-additive adaptive walking with mutant data base” (QAW), 3The abbreviations used are: QAW method, quasi-additive adaptive walking method with mutant data base; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DHF, dihydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; ANLYF, M1A/M16N/M20L/M42Y/C85A/M92F/C152S variant of DHFR; MTX, methotrexate; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviations; pABG, N-(p-aminobenzoyl)-l-glutamate; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: QAW method, quasi-additive adaptive walking method with mutant data base; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DHF, dihydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; ANLYF, M1A/M16N/M20L/M42Y/C85A/M92F/C152S variant of DHFR; MTX, methotrexate; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviations; pABG, N-(p-aminobenzoyl)-l-glutamate; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. is shown in Fig. 1 (see also under “Results”). To test the effectiveness of our proposed method, we applied it to an enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, EC 1.5.1.3) from Escherichia coli, to create a cysteineand methionine-free mutant DHFR while retaining an enzymatic activity as high as that of the wild type. In this study, we successfully obtained several hyperactive variants of DHFR in which all five methionyl and two cysteinyl residues were replaced by other amino acid residues. DHFR is a monomeric protein with two domains, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by using the reducing cofactor NADPH (8Blakley R.L. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pteridines. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1984: 191-253Google Scholar). DHFR is a clinically important enzyme not only as the target of a number of antifolate drugs, such as trimethoprim and methotrexate (8Blakley R.L. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pteridines. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1984: 191-253Google Scholar), but also as the enzyme to produce l-leucoverin, an anti-cancer drug, in a stereospecific manner (9Uwajima T. Oshiro T. Eguchi T. Kuge Y. Horiguchi A. Igarashi A. Mochida K. Iwakura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because overproduction of DHFR in cells makes E. coli trimethoprim-resistant (tmpR), DHFR has been used not only as a selectable genetic marker, tmpR (10Iwakura M. Tanaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but also as a handle protein (affinity handle) for the production of peptide (11Iwakura M. Furusawa K. Kokubu T. Ohashi S. Tanaka Y. Shimura Y. Tsuda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The catalytic reaction of the wild type DHFR has been reported to occur along a preferred reaction pathway with several intermediate states (12Fierke C.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), corresponding structures that were already related to ligand-bound forms by extensive crystallographic studies (13Bystroff C. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 14Bystroff C. Kraut J.

In the course of such studies of DHFR, a number of variants of DHFR with a point mutation(s) at a site(s) within or in the vicinity of the active site were constructed (17Chen J.T. Taira K. Tu C.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4093-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Murphy D.J. Benkovic S.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15671-15680Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Such mutational studies uncovered the roles of the residues around the active site. However, the role of residues outside the active site such as those located in the hydrophobic core of the molecule in the catalytic activity remains unclear. One of the hyperactive Met- and Cys-free variants obtained in this study (M1A/M16N/M20L/M42Y/C85A/M92F/C152S), named as ANLYF, provided a suitable example to consider the role of amino acid residues outside the active site, because the replaced residues (except for Met-20) have no or little direct contact(s) with the substrate or coenzymes in DHFR. It may also lead to understanding of the essence of the quasi-additivity of the recombination of the single mutation. Additive effects of single mutations on catalytic activity mean the independent effect of each single mutation on the catalytic activity, where analysis of the effects of each mutation would explain the total enhancement of the catalytic activity (24Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). On the contrary, quasi-additivity of the mutational effects means the mutual relationship between the mutated sites (25Perry K.M. Onuffer J.J. Gittelman M.S. Barmat L. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7961-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Green S.M. Shortle D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10131-10139Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, it is necessary to elucidate the enzymatic mechanisms not only in detail but also as a whole to reveal the essence of the quasi-additive effects on the catalytic activity. For that purpose, we also performed enzymatic kinetics and structural studies of ANLYF, which were compared with those of the wild type. Our results indicate that the increase of flexibility of the overall molecule as well as restriction of the available conformation induced by the mutations is important for the enhancement of the catalytic activity. Furthermore, we describe the structural formation of ANLYF from its urea-induced unfolded state, suggesting that the folding kinetics would be conserved despite the significant change of the catalytic activity. Materials—E. coli JM109 was used as the cloning and expression host. Methotrexate (MTX) affinity resin was purchased from Sigma. DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M was from Tosoh (Tokyo, Japan). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Taq polymerase, and Achromobacter protease I were purchased from Takara (Kyoto, Japan). DNA primers for mutagenesis were synthesized by JbioS Ltd. (Saitama, Japan). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—The genes for the wild type DHFR and a cysteine-free double mutant of DHFR (AS-DHFR) were from pTZwt1-3 and pDHFR20, respectively (27Iwakura M. Jones B.E. Luo J. Matthews C.R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Jennings P.A. Finn B.E. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3783-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The following two DNA primers were commonly used for amplifying an entire gene with a ribosome-binding site, overexpression promoter, and BamHI sites at the both ends: 5′-GCGGGGATCCTCTTGACAATTAGTTAACTATTTGTTATAATGTAT-3′ (P35-Bam) and 5′-GGGGGATCCTTAACGACGCTCGAGGATTTCGAA-3′ (DHFR-C). Site-directed random mutagenesis was carried out by a procedure similar to the one described previously (29Ohmae E. Ishimura K. Iwakura M. Gekko K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using appropriate mixed primers for the mutagenic PCR. The resulting genes were inserted into the BamHI site of a high copy vector, pUC18, which was used to transform E. coli JM109 cells to trimethoprim resistance. Recombinant plasmids were isolated from colonies on agar plates containing 200 μg ml-1 ampicillin and 10 μg ml-1 trimethoprim. DNA sequences of the BamHI insert of the isolated plasmids were determined, and the plasmids with mutant sequences were selected. The original colony with the selected plasmid was used to determine DHFR activity and was used for protein purification. The activity of the mutant proteins was estimated as follows: each E. coli transformant was grown in 2 ml of 2× YT medium containing 200 μg ml-1 ampicillin, at 37 °C, until the absorbance at 660 nm was ∼1.5. The cells from 1 ml of the culture were collected and suspended in 0.2 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA containing 1 mg ml-1 lysozyme. After gently mixing for 30 min, cells were disrupted by sonication for 10 s. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the resultant supernatant (1-10 μl) was used for the DHFR assay. To normalize activity to the numbers of cells used, the measured activity (ΔA340/min) was divided by the absorbance at 660 nm ((ΔA340/min)/A660). The enzyme activity relative to the wild type DHFR is defined as 100 × ((ΔA340/min)/A660 for the mutant protein)/((ΔA340/min)/A660 for the wild type DHFR). Purification of mutant DHFRs was carried out primarily by MTX affinity chromatography, taking advantage of adequate pre-purification steps from cell-free extracts (11Iwakura M. Furusawa K. Kokubu T. Ohashi S. Tanaka Y. Shimura Y. Tsuda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified protein was stored in a precipitated form in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and saturated ammonium sulfate. Protein concentrations of the wild type and AS-DHFR were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient (ϵ280 = 31,100 m-1 cm-1) (30Touchette N.A. Perry K.M. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5445-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) for the wild type DHFR. Protein concentration of the DHFRs was determined by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using wild type DHFR as the standard protein. Enzyme Assay and Steady-state Kinetic Parameters—The activity of DHFR was determined spectrophotometrically at 15 °C by following the disappearance of NADPH and DHF at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 11,800 m-1 cm-1) (32Hillcoat B.L. Nixon P.F. Blakley R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 21: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 50 μm DHF, 100 μm NADPH, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1× MTEN buffer (50 mm MES, 25 mm Tris, 25 mm ethanolamine, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) (33Morrison J.F. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5499-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the enzyme in a final volume of 2.0 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of DHF. Michaelis parameters (kcat and Km) were determined by measurements with various concentrations of DHF and nonlinear least squares fitting of the data. Crystallization and Data Collection—The crystallization of ANLYF was carried out as a folate complex. Folate at three times molar ratio was added to the sample and was concentrated to 20 mg ml-1 using centricut (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) with a centrifuge. The crystal was grown in drops of the sample, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 35% PEG 6000. The crystal was grown at 4 °C, and the size of the resulting crystal was 0.5 × 0.6 × 0.7 mm. Preliminary crystal data were determined using DIP2030 imaging plate diffractometer installed on an MX18HF rotating anode generator (MAC Science). Afterward, synchrotron radiation was used to confirm that the crystals belonged to the space group C2 with unit cell parameters a = 79.58 Å, b = 56.69 Å, c = 85.14 Å, and β = 106.81°. The resolution of the diffraction spot of synchrotron data is quite extended as compared with the rotating anode x-ray. Thus, the intensity data were collected using a Weissemberg camera for macromolecules, which was installed at the beam line BL18B in Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The camera radius was set at 430 mm. Diffraction patterns, recorded on an imaging plate (Fuji Film, Japan), were digitalized using the reading system for this beam line. The wavelength was fixed to 1.00 Å, and all data collections were carried out at 17 °C. To avoid the scattering of the diffracted beam by air, the helium gas was constantly flowed into a sealed area consisting of the collimator, the crystal, and the detector. The data processing was carried out using the program DENZO and SCALEPACK. The reflections with F > 1σ (F) were used for structural determinations, and the Rmerge based on the intensity was 0.030. The resolution for refinement was determined to be 1.9 Å. In total, 53,835 reflections observed were merged to 25,648 unique reflections with a degree of completeness of 90.4%. Structure Analysis—Initial phases for the structure factors were obtained using the molecular replacement method. The wild type and folate complex structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1DYI (15Reyes V.M. Sawaya M.R. Brown K.A. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2710-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) was used as a starting model for the molecular search. The model structure has two molecules per asymmetric unit, only one of which, molecule A, was employed as the starting model. The molecular replacement was performed using the program AMoRe, which is implemented in the CCP4 suite system. The resolutions of rotation and translation peaks were found, and the solution of the second molecule was also significant. The (2 |Fo|-|Fc|) difference Fourier maps showed continuous electron densities, and the boundary between the enzyme and the solvent regions was clear. Then the crystallographic refinement was performed using the program XPLOR. During the refinement, difference electron density maps and omit maps were checked using interactive display program XtalView. Finally, the crystallographic R-factor was converged to 0.205. Data collection and crystallographic refinement statistics for binary complexes of ANLYF are shown in the supplemental Table SI. In ANLYF, the three-dimensional structures of molecule A and B were almost identical to each other in contrast to those of the wild type that has a different structure of M20 loops (15Reyes V.M. Sawaya M.R. Brown K.A. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2710-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. between molecule A and B of ANLYF was 0.477 Å, whereas the r.m.s.d. between the wild type and ANLYF was 0.999 Å. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2D0K). Compressibility Measurements—The partial specific volume, ν¯o, and the adiabatic compressibility, β¯so, of ANLYF at infinite dilution were determined by the sound velocity and density measurements in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol at 15 °C. The apparatus and experimental procedures were essentially the same as those used previously (34Gekko K. Kamiyama T. Ohmae E. Katayanagi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Dissociation Constants—Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of ligands were determined from fluorescence emission spectra of enzyme-ligand complexes with an Aviv ATF 105 spectrofluorometer. The solution contained various concentrations of ligand (folate, DHF, THF, NADPH, and NADP+), 0.2 μm enzyme in MTEN buffer. The emission spectra were scanned from 500 to 300 nm at 25 °C, with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. The Kd values were determined by measurements with various concentrations of ligands and nonlinear least square fitting of the data. Transient Kinetics—Transient binding and pre-steady-state kinetics experiments were carried out on an Aviv 202 SF stopped-flow spectrometer in the fluorescence mode. The dead time of mixing was ∼10 ms in the absorbance mode, and this value was used for all the experiments in this study. Ligand association and dissociation rate constants were measured by monitoring either the quenching of the intrinsic enzyme fluorescence above 305 nm with a cut-off filter provided by Aviv instruments, or the enhancement of coenzyme fluorescence above 420 nm by energy transfer with a cut-off filter provided by Hoya (Japan) with the excitation wavelength of 290 nm in MTEN buffer at 25 °C. The final enzyme concentrations were 0.5-0.8 μm. Pre-steady-state rates were measured by monitoring coenzyme fluorescence above 420 nm with the cut-off filter with the excitation wavelength of 290 nm. The enzyme was pre-incubated with saturating concentrations of NADPH (70 μm) (35Penner M.H. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5366-5369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the reaction was initiated by mixing with various concentrations of DHF in MTEN buffer at 25 °C. The final enzyme concentration was 1 μm. Sample Preparation for Folding Measurement—Equilibrium and kinetic folding measurements were carried out at 15 °C and pH 7.8 in the presence of 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme solution also contained appropriate concentrations of urea as denaturant, or MTX, depending on the design of the experiments. Equilibrium Unfolding Transition—Far- and near-UV CD spectra were obtained with an Aviv 62 DS spectropolarimeter with a 30-s averaging time by scanning from 250 to 190 nm for a far-UV region and from 310 to 250 nm for a near-UV region, respectively. The path lengths of sample cells were 2.0 or 10.0 mm for the far- and near-UV regions, respectively. Enzyme concentrations were 1 and 55 μm for far- and near-UV CD measurements, respectively. The data obtained from the measurements were converted to mean residue ellipticity using the following equation: mean residue ellipticity = (Θ × 100)/(C × D × NA), where Θ is the ellipticity value in degrees; C is the molar protein concentration; D is the path length of the sample cell in cm; and NA is the number of residues in the enzyme. Equilibrium urea-induced unfolding transition was assessed by monitoring ellipticity at 220 nm with the above spectrophotometer or by scanning the fluorescence spectra from 500 to 300 nm with an Aviv spectrofluorometer ATF 105. The sample solutions were incubated at least 2 h before the data collection. Final enzyme concentrations were 1 μm for CD measurements and 5 μm for fluorescence measurements, respectively. The obtained data were analyzed based on the two-state approximation as described previously (27Iwakura M. Jones B.E. Luo J. Matthews C.R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Kinetic Folding Measurements—The slow steps in folding were monitored by the time-dependent change in ϵ293 using the manual mixing method on an Aviv model 14 NT absorbance spectrophotometer. The final enzyme concentration using the manual mixing method was 18 μm. For faster steps, kinetic folding measurements were performed with an Aviv 202 SF stopped-flow spectrometer in the CD, fluorescence, or absorbance mode. The path length of the cell was 1 mm for the CD and absorbance mode. On the CD measurements, the time-dependent ellipticity change was monitored at wavelength from 245 to 215 nm. On the fluorescence measurements, the time-dependent fluorescence intensity above 320 nm, obtained by a cut-off filter from Aviv instruments, was monitored with the excitation wavelength of 292 nm. Refolding experiments in the presence of MTX were carried out by monitoring the change in absorbance at 380 nm using the above stopped-flow spectrometer in the absorbance mode (28Jennings P.A. Finn B.E. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3783-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Touchette N.A. Perry K.M. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5445-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Upon binding to DHFR, the change in ϵ380 for MTX is -4,942 m-1 cm-1 (30Touchette N.A. Perry K.M. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5445-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This wavelength is well outside the absorbance region of the enzyme and allowed for the direct detection of the binding of inhibitor during folding. The final enzyme concentration was typically 10, 0.5, and 25 μm in the CD, fluorescence, and absorbance measurements, respectively. Sample Preparation for the Incubation in 0.1 m H2O2—The sample solution for the oxidization-resistance test contained appropriate concentrations of wild type or ANLYF, 0.1 m H2O2 in 10 mm potassium phosphate, and 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, for measuring the thermodynamic stability and MTEN buffer, pH 7.0, for the enzymatic assay. The resultant solutions were stored at 4 °C for 24 h. The activity assay and urea-induced unfolding measurements were carried out as described above. LC/MS Measurements—LC/MS measurements were performed as described previously (37Takenawa T. Oda Y. Ishihama Y. Iwakura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Separation of protein was carried out with an acetonitrile gradient from 35 to 55% containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on an L-column ODS (2.1 × 150 mm; Kagaku-hin Kensa Kyoukai, Tokyo) on a Shimadzu LC-10A high pressure liquid chromatography system. Other Methods—DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI PRIZM 310 genetic analyzer. N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by Edman degradation on a Beckman System Gold LF3000 protein sequencer equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer. Proposal of Novel Picking Up Process in the Sense of Protein Design—The outline of the QAW process is depicted in Fig. 1. For many proteins, local fitness landscapes are well described by a model of the Mt. Fuji-type landscape, which is proposed by Aita and Husimi (38Aita T. Husimi Y. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 182: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). They constructed the model landscape based on additivity of the free energy contributed by each residue on a biopolymer, introducing a substitution at each site to functional tolerant residues. The fitness spectrum among a random mutant population around a wild type sequence was theoretically obtained as the probability density distribution function of fitness. Statistical properties of real landscape for current proteins, including general shapes and the mean slope of a landscape (4Stemmer W.P.

Plakoglobin, which functions in both cell-cell adhesion and signal transduction, is modified by O-glycosylation; however, the significance is unknown. To investigate the functional consequence of plakoglobin O-glycosylation, we cloned and overexpressed in keratinocytes murine O-GlcNAc transferase (mOGT). Over expression of mOGT in murine keratinocytes resulted in (i) glycosylation of plakoglobin and (ii) increased levels of plakoglobin due to post-translational stabilization of plakoglobin.

To investigate the functional consequence of plakoglobin O-glycosylation, we cloned and expressed in murine keratinocytes the murine OGT. We demonstrate that increased O-glycosylation is associated with increased plakoglobin protein levels, increased post-translational stability of plakoglobin, and greater keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion. Greater cell-cell adhesion in OGT overexpressing keratinocytes is likely because of both the increased amounts of and enhanced cell membrane localization of cell-cell adhesion proteins. Generation of Murine OGT Expression Vectors—Oligonucleotide primers flanking the published coding region of the murine OGT cDNA (12Hanover J.A. Yu S. Lubas W.B. Shin S.H. Ragano-Caracciola M. Kochran J. Love D.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were employed in a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy to clone the full-length nucleocytoplasmic OGT cDNA from murine keratinocytes. The pCS2myc-mOGT expression vector was constructed by cloning the full-length mOGT into the expression vector pCS2 (13Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) with six tandem copies of the human myc epitope in-frame with the N terminus of mOGT (see Fig. 1A). The pTRE2myc-mOGT expression vector was constructed by subcloning myc-tagged mOGT from pCS2mycmOGT into the BamH1 and NotI sites of pTRE-2 (Clontech). Cell Culture and Transfection—The murine keratinocyte cell line PAM212 was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The pCS2myc-mOGT expression vector was transiently transfected into subconfluent PAM212 cells using Effectene (Qiagen, Inc.). Stably transfected inducible cultures were obtained by cotransfection of pTRE2myc-mOGT and pTet-on (Clontech) into PAM212 cells as above and selected with G418 (Invitrogen, Inc.) and hygromycin B (Roche Diagnostics). mOGT expression was induced in stably transfected cells with doxycycline (2 mg/ml) for 24h. Experiments described utilized the permanently transfected cells (referred to as OGT cells); however, similar increases in plakoglobin protein levels were obtained with multiple independent transient transfections. Antibodies—Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunostaining were performed with primary antibodies against plakoglobin, β-catenin, E-cadherin, desmoglein-1 (dsg1) (BD Biosciences, Inc.), α-catenin (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.), desmoplakin 1/2 (Abcam, Inc), plakophilin 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), O-GlcNAc (clone RL-2, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), O-GlcNAc (clone CTD110.6, Covance), lactate dehydrogenase V (Cortex Biochem, Inc.), actin (Calbiochem, Inc.), and myc (Clone 9B11, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibodies in PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratory, Inc.), washed, and mounted. Images were analyzed using a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope as previously described (14Berkowitz P. Hu P. Liu Z. Diaz L.A. Enghild J.J. Chua M.P. Rubenstein D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23778-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Monolayer cells grown to confluence were extracted in cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm E64, 100 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 1 h with rotating and then centrifuged at 13,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as detergent-soluble fractions. The pellets were washed twice with PBS, resuspended by incubation in urea lysis buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged as above; the supernatant was used as the detergent-insoluble fraction. Samples were equally loaded on and separated by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, detergent-soluble fractions were incubated with antibodies and recombinant protein G-Sepharose 4B conjugate beads (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) with rotating for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with PBS, denatured with SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed according to established protocols and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction (Amersham Biosciences). Signal intensity from the ECL reaction for each band was quantified with a GeneGnome scanner (Syngene Bio Imaging) using GeneSnap software. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Cell extracts (100 μg) were prepared and separated in the first dimension using 13-cm pH 3-10, non-linear IPGphor strips (Amersham Biosciences, Inc) and in the second dimension by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described (14Berkowitz P.

Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) Treatment—Cell extracts were prepared in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 60 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm E64, 100 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μm okadaic acid (okadaic acid was omitted from buffer for PP2A-treated extracts) by sonication for 5 s × 2 on ice, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and supernatants were collected in 500-μg protein aliquots. For samples treated with PP2A, 500-μg protein extracts were treated with 0.1 units PP2A (Upstate, Inc.) for 30 min at 30 °C. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, samples were desalted on Centricon 30 spin filters (Amicon Bioseparations, Inc.) and resuspended in 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm and IPG buffer (pH 4-7, linear, Amersham Biosciences) was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the samples were separated in the first dimension using 7-cm, pH 4-7, linear IPGphor strips (Amersham Biosciences, Inc) and in the second dimension by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described (14Berkowitz P.

Dispase-based Dissociation Assay—A dispase-based dissociation assay was performed as described (15Huen A.C. Park J.K. Godsel L.M. Chen X. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y. Mongiu A.K. Leigh I.M.

Briefly, cells grown to confluence in triplicate on 100-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS, incubated in 5 ml of dispase II (2.4 units/ml, Roche Diagnostics) at 37 °C for 1 h, and rocked back and forth 10 times on a ClayAdams nutator, and the number of fragments was counted. [3H]GlcNAc Radiolabeling—80% confluent cultures were incubated with d-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (Amersham Biosciences) at 1 μCi/ml in glucose-free RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum for 16 h at 37 °C, washed 3× in PBS, and extracted in cell lysis buffer as above. Soluble fractions containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the radioactive signal was visualized on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 phosphoimager. Galactosyltransferase Labeling—Galactosyltransferase labeling was as described (5Hatsell S. Medina L. Merola J. Haltiwanger R. Cowin P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37745-37752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Haltiwanger R.S. Philipsberg G.A. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1997; 272: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, plakoglobin immunoprecipitation reactions were washed 6 times in buffer A (15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer B (50 mm Hepes, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm galactose, 2% Triton X-100). The labeling reaction was initiated by adding 2.5 μCi of UDP-[6-3H]galactose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and 50 milliunits of galactosyltransferase (Sigma) and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with buffer A, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Plakoglobin Half-life—The plakoglobin half-life was measured by treating confluent cells with the 20 mg/ml protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Sigma Aldrich) for 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 h. Cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared as above. Soluble fractions containing equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with antibodies to plakoglobin and actin. Blots were developed by ECL and quantified as above using a GeneGnome scanner (Syngene Bio Imaging) and GeneSnap software. The Cloned cDNA Encodes mOGT and Is Catalytically Active—Myc tagged OGT (Fig. 1A) localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1B) as expected for the described distribution of this intracellular enzyme (11Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The expressed protein migrated on SDS-PAGE as a single band of 120,000 consistent with the predicted molecular weight for the full-length expressed OGT polypeptide fused to the 6-copy myc epitope tag (Fig. 1C). Increased reactivity with the GlcNAc-specific RL2 monoclonal antibody (18Snow C.M. Senior A. Gerace L. Journal of Cell Biology. 1987; 104: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) was detected by immunoblot of OGT cell extracts compared with control cells demonstrating that the expressed myctagged protein was catalytically active (Fig. 1, C and D). Plakoglobin Is a Substrate for mOGT—To demonstrate that the cloned cDNA encoded the enzyme that was in fact responsible for catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc to plakoglobin, plakoglobin was immunoprecipitated from control and OGT cell extracts, and the immunoprecipitation reactions were probed for plakoglobin and GlcNAc modification using anti-plakoglobin and anti-GlcNAc monoclonal antibodies, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Greater GlcNAc reactivity was detected in plakoglobin from the OGT cells using both the RL2 (Fig. 2A) and CTD110.6 (Fig. 2B) (19Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) GlcNAc-specific monoclonal antibodies. Quantitation of the signal intensity from replicates (n = 3) of the experiment shown in Fig. 2B demonstrated a 1.95 ± 0.03-fold increase in GlcNAc immunoreactivity and a 1.5 ± 0.16-fold increase in plakoglobin immunoreactivity in the plakoglobin immunoprecipitates from OGT versus control keratinocytes. Thus, the relative change in GlcNAc/plakoglobin between OGT and control cells was 1.3. The galactosyltransferase reaction catalyzes the transfer of [3H]galactose (Gal) from UDP-[3H]Gal to terminal non-reducing GlcNAc. Using galactosyltransferase, plakoglobin from both control and OGT cells was labeled with [3H]galactose; however, the signal was greater in OGT cells (Fig. 2C) compared with controls. As a further test, both control and OGT keratinocytes were incubated in the presence of [3H]glucosamine. More tritiated sugar was detected in plakoglobin immunoprecipitates from OGT cells relative to controls (Fig. 2C). When analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, OGT cell extracts had more positively charged isoforms compared with controls (Fig. 2D). Removal of phosphate by treating control and OGT cell extracts with PP2A shifted the migration of plakoglobin toward the cathode. This suggests that the more positively charged isoforms in OGT cells are from the loss of phosphate likely because of the presence of the GlcNAc. Increased Protein Levels of Plakoglobin Are Detected in OGT Cells—Interestingly, more plakoglobin was immunoprecipitated from OGT versus control cells, suggesting increased levels of plakoglobin in the OGT keratinocytes. This observation was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of plakoglobin in cell extracts; more plakoglobin was detected in OGT keratinocytes (Fig. 3A). Expression of OGT Increases the Half-life of Plakoglobin—Direct modification of plakoglobin by O-glycosylation and the increased levels of plakoglobin in OGT cells suggested that O-glycosylation of plakoglobin might function to increase the post-translational stability of plakoglobin. To investigate the effects of O-glycosylation on the half-life of plakoglobin, control and OGT cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and the levels of plakoglobin as a function of time determined by immunoblot of whole cell extracts (Fig. 3, B-D). At 10 h, plakoglobin levels decreased to 30 versus 80% of starting levels in control versus OGT cells indicating that O-glycosylation of plakoglobin extended its half-life 2.7-fold. This effect was not a general effect on protein stability, as the half-life of actin in control and OGT cells did not markedly differ. Cell-Cell Adhesion Is Increased in OGT Cells—Because plakoglobin functions in cell-cell adhesion as a component of both the keratinocyte adherens junction and desmosome, we next investigated whether OGT cells demonstrated greater cell-cell adhesion using the dispase assay (15Huen A.C. Park J.K. Godsel L.M. Chen X. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y. Mongiu A.K. Leigh I.M. Kelsell D.P. Gumbiner B.M. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this assay, cells are grown to confluence and floated off the plate as an intact sheet using dispase. The cell sheets are then rocked back and forth a set number of times on a nutator, which subjects the sheet to a shear stress. Greater cell-cell adhesion confers resistance to the shearing stress and results in decreased fragmentation of the cell sheet. The number of resulting fragments yields a quantitative measure of cell-cell adhesion. When subjected to this assay, OGT cells formed far fewer and larger fragments per dish (number of fragments/dish = 2.3 ± 0.6) than control cells (number of fragments/dish = 22.3 ± 1.5) consistent with greater cell-cell adhesion in OGT cells (Fig. 4). Plakoglobin Stabilization in OGT Cells Is Associated with Alterations in Adherens Junction and Desmosome Protein Localization—We next examined the distribution of E-cadherin and desmoglein-1 (dsg1) by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). In control cells, both punctuate cytoplasmic and membrane staining was observed for E-cadherin. Dsg1 staining in control cells was predominantly cytoplasmic, although a small amount of membrane staining could also be detected. In contrast, E-cadherin and dsg1 staining in OGT cells was predominantly localized to the cell membrane (Fig. 5A). Similarly, plakoglobin staining was both cytoplasmic and membrane in control keratinocytes, whereas greater plakoglobin membrane staining was observed in OGT cells. Furthermore, punctuate membrane staining for both plakoglobin and dsg1 was observed in the OGT cells, consistent with the staining pattern expected for desmosomes (Fig. 5B). OGT cells also demonstrated altered immunofluorescent staining for desmoplakin 1 and plakophilin 1, two additional desmosome components. Desmoplakin staining was punctuate and cytoplasmic in control cells; no membrane staining was observed. In contrast, membrane staining for desmoplakin was observed in OGT cells, although additional diffuse cytoplasmic staining was also present (Fig. 5C). Similarly, plakophilin staining in control cells was punctate and cytoplasmic, whereas punctate plakophilin membrane staining that colocalized with dsg1 was observed in OGT cells (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results suggest increased membrane localization of both adherens junction and desmosome proteins in OGT overexpressing keratinocytes. Increased Association of Plakoglobin with Both Adherens Junction and Desmosome Cadherins Is Observed in OGT Cells—We next examined the protein levels of adherens junction and desmosome components. Adherens junctions are soluble in non-ionic detergents such as Non-idet P-40, whereas desmosomes are insoluble in non-ionic detergents enabling us to use the detergent-insoluble fraction as a marker for desmosomes. Control and OGT cells were separated into detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions, and the fractions subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies to adherens junction and desmosome proteins (Fig. 6). Similar levels of the adherens junction proteins E-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin were detected in the detergent-soluble fraction of both control and OGT cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, more plakoglobin was observed in the detergent-soluble fraction of OGT cells compared with controls. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments from the detergent-soluble fraction were used to examine junctional protein-protein association. Equal amounts of E-cadherin were immunoprecipitated from the detergent-soluble fraction of control and OGT cells (Fig. 6B). No difference in the association of β-catenin with E-cadherin was identified, as similar amounts of β-catenin coimmunoprecipitated with E-cadherin from control and OGT cells. In contrast, more plakoglobin and α-catenin coimmunoprecipitated with E-cadherin from OGT cells. Next, detergent-soluble extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies to plakoglobin. As before, more plakoglobin was immunoprecipitated from the detergent-soluble fraction of OGT cells (Fig. 6C). More E-cadherin as well as the desmosome cadherin dsg1 coimmunoprecipitated with plakoglobin in OGT cells indicating that O-glycosylation was associated with increased formation of plakoglobin cadherin complexes. Both detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were probed by immunoblotting for desmosome proteins. Increased amounts of plakoglobin and dsg1 were observed in both the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fraction of OGT cells (Fig. 6D). The increased amount of the desmosome components plakoglobin and dsg1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction suggests increased desmosome assembly. Interestingly, similar increases in desmoplakin and plakophilin were not observed in the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions of OGT cells, despite the shift in the distribution of plakophilin and desmoplakin from cytoplasm to membrane observed by confocal immunofluorescence. These observations can be interpreted to suggest that although desmoplakin and plakophilin are moving toward the membrane, they have yet to be incorporated into fully formed desmosomes. Taken together, the above observations demonstrate that increased post-translational stability of plakoglobin is a functional consequence of plakoglobin O-glycosylation. β-Catenin and plakoglobin are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation; therefore, the observed increase in plakoglobin stability could be an indirect effect because O-glycosylation of the 26 S proteasome down-regulates proteasome-mediated protein degradation in rat kidney cells (20Zhang F. Su K. Yang X. Bowe D.B. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Because β-catenin is also targeted to and degraded by the proteasome, greater amounts of β-catenin would be expected if the observed effect were because of regulation of proteasome activity. However, no difference in the levels of β-catenin were observed between OGT and control cells indicating that the effect of O-glycosylation on the post-translational stability of plakoglobin was unlikely the result of global changes in proteasome activity. Direct modification of plakoglobin by O-glycosylation is likely responsible for increased stability to degradative pathways and therefore greater protein levels of plakoglobin in OGT cells. This interpretation is supported by several observations. Both plakoglobin O-glycosylation and plakoglobin levels were increased in OGT cells; however, the overall stoichiometry of plakoglobin O-glycosylation to plakoglobin was similar in OGT and control cells. Thus, each time a plakoglobin polypeptide is O-glycosylated, the amount of plakoglobin in the cell is increased by one molecule. Furthermore, the O-glycosylation site of plakoglobin has been mapped to threonine 14 (5Hatsell S. Medina L. Merola J. Haltiwanger R. Cowin P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37745-37752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in the glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation consensus site. Threonine 14 may be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 as part of the mechanism for targeting plakoglobin to the proteasome for degradation or alternatively O-glycosylated resulting in increased stability. O-Glycosylation and phosphorylation have been reported to alternately modify the same residue in other proteins (21Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Driving overexpression of OGT clearly results in the modification of numerous proteins as evidenced by the enhanced GlcNAc immunoreactivity observed on extracts separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. It may be premature to suggest that modification of plakoglobin is the driving force for the observed increase in cell-cell adhesion, because O-glycosylation may modify a variety of proteins involved in adhesion. For example, keratins have been shown to be modified by O-glycosylation (22Chou C.F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1992; 267: 3901-3906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and enhanced GlcNAc immunoreactivity was observed in the region of the two-dimensional gels to which keratins localize (Fig. 1D). Despite this, increased cell-cell adhesion resulted from driving overexpression of OGT in keratinocytes. Interestingly, although plakoglobin levels were increased, the levels of β-catenin, which also associates with E-cadherin and α-catenin, were not altered. Increased association of plakoglobin with E-cadherin and α-catenin was observed in OGT cells suggesting increased numbers of plakoglobin-based adherens junctions. Similarly, OGT cells demonstrated (i) increased association of plakoglobin with the desmosome cadherin dsg1 in plakoglobin immunoprecipitates from the detergent-soluble fraction, (ii) more plakoglobin and dsg1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction, and (iii) greater membrane localization of desmosome proteins plakoglobin, dsg1, desmoplakin, and plakophilin. Because both adherens junction formation and plakoglobin are important for nucleation of desmosome formation (1Lewis J.E. Jensen P.J. Wheelock M.J. Journal of Investigative Dermatology. 1994; 102: 870-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 2Lewis J.E. Wahl 3rd, J.K. Sass K.M. Jensen P.J. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Journal of Cell Biology. 1997; 136: 919-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), stabilization of plakoglobin by O-glycosylation may drive the formation of plakoglobin-based adherens junctions, which then nucleate formation of desmosomes, resulting in the observed increase in cell-cell adhesion. We thank Drs. Luis Diaz and Lowell Goldsmith for helpful suggestions."

Wnts are secreted glycoproteins involved in cell-cell communication in diverse settings. Over 90% of colorectal cancers are caused by mutations that activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Activation of this pathway is also observed in solid childhood tumors, gastric carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, hepatoma, medulloblastoma, and pancreatic tumors (reviewed Ref. 1Karim R. Tse G. Putti T. Scolyer R. Lee S. Pathology. 2004; 36: 120-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). During embryonic development, the Wnt pathway is required in dorsal axis specification, segmentation, neural crest formation, and organogenesis. Wnt signaling also regulates cell fate determination, cell adhesion and separation, cell movement, and cell polarity. During adult life, Wnts are essential in maintenance and differentiation of stem cells or early progenitor cells in skin, muscle, intestinal crypts, and hematopoietic tissues (reviewed in Ref. 2Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4276) Google Scholar). The Wnt/Frizzled cassette signals through several branches including the canonical Wnt/β-catenin, Wnt/Ca2+, and planar cell polarity (PCP) 4The abbreviations used are: PCP, planar cell polarity; Fz, Frizzled; Dsh, disheveled; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GRK, GPCR-associated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; CK, casein kinase; Dfz1, Drosophila Fz1. pathways (reviewed in Ref. 3Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The shared components of these branches so far identified are the receptors (Frizzleds), the phosphoprotein disheveled (Dsh), and in some cases the ligand (Wnts). wnt and frizzled genes are encoded by large multigene families, whereas the number of dsh genes is more limited. In mouse, there are 19 wnt genes, 10 frizzled genes, and three dsh genes. Frizzleds contain multiple hydrophobic domains predicted to form seven transmembrane helices. Conserved sequences are found in the extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD), the putative transmembrane domains, and parts of the intracellular loops (4Huang H.C. Klein P.S. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 234.231-234.236Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal tails are highly divergent. The mechanisms by which Frizzleds transduce signals remain unclear. The highly conserved juxtamembrane motif, KTXXXW, found in the membrane-proximal C-terminal region of all Frizzleds, is essential for canonical signaling (5Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been proposed to interact with Disheveled (6Cong F. Schweizer L. Varmus H.

Schweizer L. Varmus H. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The predicted topology of Frizzleds, with seven proposed transmembrane domains, is reminiscent of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and recent evidence supports a role for G-proteins in canonical and noncanonical Frizzled signaling (8Liu T.

Science. 2004; 306: 2257-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Early data suggested that canonical Wnt signaling is sensitive to pertussis toxin and that chimeric receptors incorporating adrenergic ligand binding domains with Frizzled-derived intracellular sequences could activate both canonical and Wnt/Ca2+ pathways when overexpressed in cultured cells and stimulated with adrenergic ligands. More recently, epistasis experiments in Drosophila suggested that Gαo is required downstream of frizzled and upstream of dsh for canonical Wnt and PCP signaling (10Katanaev V.L. Ponzielli R. Semeriva M. Tomlinson A. Cell. 2005; 120: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These observations strengthen the proposal that Frizzleds signal through G-proteins and suggest that Frizzleds may share other aspects of GPCR regulation. A common feature of GPCR regulation is the phosphorylation of the receptors by a family of GPCR-associated protein kinases (GRKs (12Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar)), which is associated with attenuation of signaling, receptor internalization, protein turnover, and, in some cases, novel signaling events (13Ferguson S.S.

In support of the parallel between Frizzleds and GPCRs, Frizzled-4 can be internalized in cultured cells in the presence of Wnt5A, Disheveled, and activated protein kinase C (PKC (15Chen W. ten Berge D.

Life Sci. 2004; 61: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have pointed out that consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and casein kinase II are commonly found in Frizzled C-terminal regions. Furthermore, Smoothened, a receptor for Hedgehog that also contains seven putative transmembrane domains and is distantly related to Frizzleds, is also phosphorylated and internalized (11Chen W.

In a recent publication, in vitro phosphorylation of a C-terminal fragment of Drosophila Frizzled-1 (Fz1) by PKC was reported (18Djiane A. Yogev S. Mlodzik M. Cell. 2005; 121: 621-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of intact Frizzleds in a cellular context has not been reported, however. Frizzled-3 (Fz3) has been studied extensively in different model systems. In Xenopus, Fz3 is required for neural crest induction (19Deardorff M.A. Tan C. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Klein P.S. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over-expression of Fz3 disrupts convergent extension movements during gastrulation in Xenopus embryos and can induce complete ectopic eyes (20Shi D.L. Goisset C. Boucaut J.C. Mech.

In mouse, Fz3 is required for the development of major axonal tracts in forebrain-derived structures and for axon guidance of commissural neurons within the spinal cord (22Wang Y. Thekdi N.

The DEP domain of Dsh is necessary and sufficient for this phosphorylation. Disheveled-dependent phosphorylation of Fz3 requires serine 576 in the C terminus. Mutation of serine 576 to alanine does not inhibit Fz3 activity, and rather appears to enhance the signaling activity of Fz3, suggesting that Frizzled signaling is down-regulated through phosphorylation, which is an additional parallel with GPCR regulation. Materials—frizzled-3 (fz3) and disheveled (dsh) cDNAs used in these studies were from Xenopus and were subcloned into pCS2, as described previously (19Deardorff M.A. Tan C. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Klein P.S. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sokol S.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1456-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Mutations in fz3 and dsh were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Fz338 is a chimeric construct that replaces the C-terminal tail of fz3 with that of Xenopus fz8. MycDshΔC and myc-DEP+ were from J. C. Smith (25Tada M. Smith J.C. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen, dialyzed fetal bovine serum was from Invitrogen, carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/ml) was from Amersham Biosciences (PBS13), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) was from New England Biolabs, and protein G-agarose was from Invitrogen. Phosphorylation of Fz3—Xenopus embryos were injected with mRNAs encoding wild-type fz3 or fz3 mutants (0.5 ng), dsh or dsh mutants (0.5 ng), and β-galactosidase with a nuclear localization signal (nβGal; 0.5 ng) into the animal pole at the one-cell stage, developed to the gastrula stage (stage 10.5, unless specified), lysed in embryo lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a premixed protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and analyzed by Western blot using a monoclonal anti-Fz3 antibody (26Tan C. Deardorff M.A. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Yang J. Arzoumanian A. Klein P.S. Development (Camb.). 2001; 28: 3665-3674Crossref Google Scholar). For in vitro dephosphorylation of Fz3, lysates from fz3 and dsh mRNA-injected embryos were treated with PP1 (for a 20-μl reaction: 10 μl of lysate, 2 μl of PP1 buffer, 2 μl of MnCl2 (10 mm), 1 μl (2.5 units) of PP1) in the presence or absence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin (1 μl, 0.5 mm) at 37 °C for 20 min and then analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of Fz3—HEK293T cells were plated at 10% confluence in 6-well plates and transfected with plasmids as indicated in Fig. 1B. Fresh medium was added after 24 h. After an additional 12 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mCi of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h. Cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in cold embryo lysis buffer (as described above). Lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C; supernatant was recovered, and anti-Fz3 antibody was added at a 1:100 dilution on ice. After 2 h, protein G-agarose beads were added, and suspension was incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 4 h. Protein G was centrifuged briefly to pellet beads, which were washed three times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitate was eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as well as Western blotting. Neural Crest Induction—Neural crest induction assays were performed in animal pole ectodermal explants as described previously (19Deardorff M.A. Tan C. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Klein P.S. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with Fz3wt and Fz3S576A mRNAs at the concentrations indicated in Figs. 6 and 7. Expression of the neural crest markers Slug and Twist, as well as the EF-1a loading control, was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR as described previously (19Deardorff M.A. Tan C. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Klein P.S. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 7Induction of neural crest markers by the phosphorylation-defective Fz37A mutant.

B and C, intensity of Twist (B) and Slug (C) induction at each concentration of Fz3 mRNA (from A) was measured on a Typhoon PhosphorImager, normalized to the level of EF-1α, and then plotted as -fold induction where expression in control explants (chordin without Fz3) was defined as 1.

Although Frizzled proteins have a predicted membrane topology similar to GPCRs and have been proposed to function through G-proteins, phosphorylation of Frizzled proteins has not been described (however, while this manuscript was in preparation, the in vitro phosphorylation of a C-terminal fragment of Drosophila Fz1 by PKC was reported (18Djiane A. Yogev S. Mlodzik M. Cell. 2005; 121: 621-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)). In the course of our studies on the regulation of Fz3 by downstream modulators, including Disheveled and the Fz3-binding protein Kermit/GIPC, we observed multiple immunoreactive species in Western blots for Fz3 (Fig. 1). In the absence of Dsh, a predominant doublet migrates at ∼63–66 kDa, and a faint, slower mobility species is present at 73 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1). However, when Fz3 is co-expressed with Dsh, the intensity of the 73-kDa species is markedly increased (Fig. 1A, lane 2), whereas the 66-kDa species is reduced to an almost undetectable level (the 63-kDa species is unchanged). This apparent shift in mobility from 66 to 73 kDa suggests a post-translational modification of Fz3, such as protein phosphorylation. We therefore tested whether the 73-kDa form is sensitive to protein phosphatase treatment. When cell lysates containing the 73-kDa form were treated with PP1, the 73-kDa band disappeared and the 66-kDa form reappeared (Fig. 1A, lane 3). This mobility shift is dependent on phosphatase activity per se, as it is blocked by inclusion of microcystin, a phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 1A lane 4). The observations that the 66-kDa form shifts almost completely to the 73-kDa form with Dsh, and the 73-kDa form is reduced completely to the 66-kDa mobility form with PP1 suggest that the phosphorylation is stoichiometric, with at least one phosphate added per molecule of the 66-kDa form of Fz3. The 63-kDa form did not change in mobility with expression of Dsh or after phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). These observations strongly suggest that Fz3 is phosphorylated in a Dsh-dependent manner. However, the sensitivity of an electrophoretic mobility shift to phosphatase treatment is an indirect measure of phosphorylation. To demonstrate phosphorylation of Fz3 directly, we labeled HEK293T cells metabolically with [32P]orthophosphate and immunoprecipitated Fz3. The cells had been transfected previously with Fz3 with or without Dsh. As shown in Fig. 1B (upper panel), Fz3 alone incorporates a low level of 32P, and this increases markedly upon co-expression of Dsh, accompanied by a shift in electrophoretic mobility to the 73-kDa species. PhosphorImager analysis of 32P-labeled proteins indicates an 8–10-fold increase in Fz3 phosphorylation (normalized to total Fz3 protein in the immunoprecipitated sample) when Dsh is co-expressed. Thus, phosphorylation of Fz3 is markedly enhanced in a Dsh-dependent manner in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos. To test whether the phosphorylation of Fz3 changes during embryonic development, we harvested embryos expressing Fz3 with or without Dsh at four stages. Fz3 phosphorylation was first detected weakly at the mid-blastula stage (stage 8.5) and increased significantly during gastrulation (stages 10 and 12; Fig. 1C). At later stages, the overall level of Fz3 expression declined. Fz3 did not undergo Dsh-dependent phosphorylation in oocytes, even after a 26-h incubation, indicating that the capacity to phosphorylate Fz3 is developmentally regulated (data not shown). Dsh is a downstream cytosolic component of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. Dsh contains at least three functional domains (the DIX domain, the central PDZ domain, and the C-terminal DEP domain (Fig. 2A)), which have been implicated in distinct pathways downstream of Frizzleds (27Rothbacher U. Laurent M.N. Deardorff M.A. Klein P.S. Cho K.W. Fraser S.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Mlodzik M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 564-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To test whether a specific domain of Dsh is required for Fz3 phosphorylation, we used Dsh deletion and point mutants. As shown in Fig. 2B, a deletion construct lacking the DEP domain (dshΔC) fails to induce the 73-kDa phosphorylated form of Fz3, whereas expression of a C-terminal fragment containing the DEP domain without the DIX or PDZ domains (dshDEP+) strongly enhances Fz3 phosphorylation. In addition, we tested a mutation (DshK441M) corresponding to the Drosophila mutant dsh1 (30Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), which disrupts PCP signaling and interferes with translocation of Dsh to the plasma membrane. DshK441M did not stimulate Fz3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), similar to dshΔC. This analysis shows that the DEP domain is necessary and sufficient for Dsh-stimulated Fz3 phosphorylation. Fz3 Mutations That Disrupt Phosphorylation—To identify potential phosphorylation sites in Fz3, we mutated all of the serines and threonines on the predicted cytoplasmic surface of Fz3 to alanine. This included each of the 41 serines and threonines in the C-terminal tail of Fz3 and two within the predicted intracellular loops. The C-terminal tail also contains several regions of multiple, adjacent serines, and several of these were also mutated as a group to alanines. Each of these mutants was expressed in Xenopus embryos with or without Dsh and examined by Western blot. A representative Western blot showing a subset of the Fz3 mutations analyzed is shown in Fig. 3A (additional point mutants are shown in Fig. 4). This analysis identified two point mutations, serine 576 to alanine (S576A) and S641A, that markedly reduced the Dsh-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift (Figs. 3A and 4). (The electrophoretic mobility shift of S579A was also modestly reduced). The reduction in the 73-kDa form of Fz3 could indicate that these serines are required for phosphorylation or, alternatively, that the mutation disrupts the folding and/or trafficking of Fz3 to the subcellular compartment where phosphorylation occurs, such as the plasma membrane. We therefore addressed whether the serine to alanine mutants were present on the plasma membrane by expressing each mutant and wild-type Fz3 in Xenopus embryos and performing immunohistochemical staining on ectodermal explants using the Fz3 antibody. We found that S576A is expressed predominantly on the plasma membrane, similar to wild-type Fz3, but S641A appears to accumulate within cells rather than at the cell surface (data not shown). We therefore did not pursue further analysis of the S641A mutant. Furthermore, the effect of the S579A mutation on electrophoretic mobility was modest (and did not appear to affect activity in the functional assays described below; data not shown); we therefore focused on the S576A mutation for further analysis.FIGURE 4Mutation of a conserved motif interferes with Fz3 phosphorylation. Mutation of the canonical KTXXXW motif (5Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and Ser641, in Fz3 interferes with phosphorylation of Fz3 and Dsh; mutation of Ser576 blocks Fz3 but not Dsh phosphorylation. mRNAs encoding Fz3wt and mutants were injected with Myc-Dsh as described for Fig. 3A and harvested at gastrula stage for Western blotting with anti-Fz3 (top and middle panels) or anti-Myc (bottom panel). The middle panel is a darker exposure of lanes 1–8, as the KTXXXW mutant proteins were consistently expressed at lower levels despite equal amounts of mRNA injected. Ab, antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that Ser576 is required for Fz3 phosphorylation, Fz3S576A was expressed in 293T cells that were then metabolically labeled with 32PO4, as described above for wild-type Fz3. In the absence of Dsh, Fz3S576A is 32P-labeled at a low level (Fig. 3B). However, Fz3S576A fails to shift to the 73-kDa form and shows markedly reduced incorporation of 32P when Dsh is co-expressed (Fig. 3B). These observations confirm that Ser576 is required for the Dsh-induced mobility shift and for maximal phosphorylation of Fz3. However, Fz3S576A can still be phosphorylated (∼2.5-fold increase) in the presence of Dsh, indicating that phosphorylation of additional sites can occur, although at a lower level and without a change in electrophoretic mobility. As pointed out by Wang and Malbon (16Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the C-terminal regions of Frizzleds contain consensus phosphorylation motifs; we therefore examined the Fz3 C terminus for addition potential phosphorylation sites. Analysis of the Fz3 sequence for known protein kinase recognition motifs using the Scansite algorithm at medium stringency identified seven consensus sequences for potential phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail: in addition to Ser576 the program identified Ser508, Thr541, Thr562, Ser587, Ser624 and Ser636. As discussed above, with the exception of Ser576, single point mutations in these sites did not affect the Dsh-induced mobility shift (Fig. 3A and data not shown). However, mutation of all seven sites to alanines (termed Fz37A) further attenuated with Dsh-induced phosphorylation compared Fz3wt and Fz3S576A (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, in the presence of Dsh, Fz3 appears to be phosphorylated at multiple sites in the C-terminal tail. Receptor phosphorylation is associated with either activation, as in the case of receptor tyrosine kinases and the Wnt co-receptor Arrow/LRP 5/6, or desensitization, as is typically observed with GPCRs. We have thus far not identified a Wnt that can induce Fz3 phosphorylation (data not shown). Therefore, to begin to test whether Frizzled activation may play a role in subsequent phosphorylation, we examined previously described inactive Fz3 mutants. Several mutations in frizzled genes have been described that interfere with Frizzled signaling, including mutations in the highly conserved KTXXXW motif (K501M, T502V, and W506G in Fz3) and mutation of a conserved arginine in the first intracellular loop (R229A in Fz3) (5Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cong F. Schweizer L. Varmus H. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) (all of these mutants are expressed on the plasma membrane (Ref. 5Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). We found that none of these signaling-defective forms of Fz3 demonstrates a Dsh-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 4). These data indicate that mutations that inactivate Fz3 also interfere with phosphorylation. This correlation could indicate that phosphorylation is either required for Frizzled signaling or is a consequence of Frizzled signaling. As a control for equal expression of Dsh, we assessed Dsh protein levels by Western blot (Fig. 4, bottom panel); aside from confirming equal expression of Dsh protein in each sample, these Western blots revealed an electrophoretic mobility shift in Dsh when Fz3wt was co-expressed (see also Fig. 5) consistent with prior publications demonstrating Dsh phosphorylation in response to Wnt/Frizzled signaling (31Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Brennan K.R. Castelo-Soccio L.A. Brown A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4757-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the R229A, K501M, T502V, and W506G forms of Fz3 failed to cause the electrophoretic mobility shift/phosphorylation in Dsh, as expected, because these mutated forms are defective in signaling. However, Fz3S576A, which is not phosphorylated itself, nevertheless induces a mobility shift/phosphorylation of Dsh (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting that this mutant could be active; if the S576A mutant is active, as addressed in more detail below; this would imply that Ser576 phosphorylation is not required for signaling. Phosphorylation of Fz3 Mutants—KTXXXW mutants and R229A cannot activate Wnt signaling (5Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cong F. Schweizer L. Varmus H. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For these mutants, it is possible that the failure to activate Dsh results in the deficiency in Fz3 phosphorylation. Alternatively, these mutations could alter Fz3 conformation in a manner that interferes with phosphorylation. To test whether the inactive Fz3 mutants can still be phosphorylated, we co-expressed inactive Fz3 mutants with an active form of Frizzled; because the antibody recognizes the C terminus of Fz3, we used an active chimera (Fz338) in which the Fz3 C-terminal tail was replaced with the C-terminal tail from Fz8, similar to frizzled chimeras described by others (32Boutros M. Mihaly J. Bouwmeester T. Mlodzik M. Science. 2000; 288: 1825-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Fz338 with Dsh and the inactive Fz3 mutants led to phosphorylation of K501M (Fig. 5, lane 8), T502V, W506G, and R229A (data not shown). These data show that the inactive Fz3 mutants are phosphorylated as long as an active Fz is present. In contrast, S576A is not phosphorylated under these conditions (Fig. 5, lane 12), indicating that Ser576 is required for Fz3 phosphorylation.

The biosynthesis of tyrosine is of critical importance for the growth and survival of enteric bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and plants. Like the other aromatic amino acids, tyrosine plays a dual role in the biochemistry of the organism, acting as both a product and a precursor. In the former case, tyrosine is required for protein synthesis, whereas, in the latter, it is a substrate for enzymes in downstream metabolic pathways.

PDHs exist as either monofunctional or bifunctional enzymes. The bifunctional enzymes are diverse, since the prephenate dehydrogenase domain is associated with other enzymes (16Song J. Bonner C.A.

Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Christendat D. Saridakis V.C. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15703-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Studies of the pH dependence for the kinetic parameters V and V/K, for example, indicated that a deprotonated group is required for catalysis, whereas a protonated residue is required for binding prephenate to the enzyme-NAD+ complex (18Christendat D. Saridakis V.C. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15703-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutagenesis of His197 from the PDH domain of CM-PDH revealed that this residue is critical for dehydrogenase activity and that it is one of the groups titrating in the pH rate profile (18Christendat D. Saridakis V.C. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15703-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results suggest that His197 facilitates hydride transfer from prephenate to NAD+ by hydrogen bonding to and polarizing the 4-hydroxyl group of prephenate (18Christendat D. Saridakis V.C. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15703-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additional mutagenesis studies of CM-PDH have also led to the identification of a key binding group, Arg294, which is important for positioning prephenate in the enzyme-NAD+ complex (17Christendat D. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further analyses of the activities of wild-type protein and site-directed mutants in the presence of a series of inhibitory substrate analogues have suggested that this arginine binds prephenate through the ring carboxylate. Although these residues are implicated in the PDH catalytic mechanism, their precise roles in substrate binding and catalysis and their positions in the active site are still tentative. Therefore, a crystal structure of PDH is essential in order to understand the kinetic mechanism of this enzyme. Here we present the first representative structure of an enzyme in the TyrA family. We have determined the crystal structure of a PDH enzyme from the hyperthermophile Aquifex aeolicus in complex with NAD+ and with prephenate modeled into the active site. Furthermore, the structure of the C-terminal domain from A. aeolicus PDH represents a novel fold. The structure reveals a shared active site in the dimer. Interestingly, we infer from the structure that access to the active site is regulated via a gated mechanism, which is modulated by an ionic network involving a conserved arginine. In addition, the crystal structure reveals for the first time the positions of a number of key catalytic residues and the identity of other active site residues that may participate in the reaction mechanism. This PDH structure will provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of substrate discrimination between the different classes of TyrA enzymes. The rational design of drugs and herbicides will also be facilitated by the structure of PDH. The requirement for tyrosine in protein translation and in the production of biologically important metabolites has made PDH a potential target for the development of novel drugs. The potential of such structure-based research can be gleaned from the success of the broad spectrum herbicide glyphosate, which targets the main trunk of aromatic biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway (19Dill G.M. Pest Manag. Sci. 2005; 61: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This herbicide, in addition to its role in weed management, has been shown to be an effective drug for targeting apicomplexan parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum for the treatment of malaria (20Roberts C.W. Roberts F. Lyons R.E. Kirisits M.J. Mui E.J. Finnerty J. Johnson J.J. Ferguson D.J. Coggins J.R. Krell T. Coombs G.H. Milhous W.K. Kyle D.E. Tzipori S. Barnwell J. Dame J.B. Carlton J. McLeod R. J.

Cloning—Gene sequences encoding the various constructs of A. aeolicus VF5 PDH (gi:15282445) were amplified by PCR from a pET15b plasmid containing the full-length (FL) PDH gene. The preparation of the FL PDH plasmid is described elsewhere. 6J. Turnbull, manuscript in preparation. For all constructs, the forward primers included an NdeI restriction site, whereas the reverse primer contained a BamHI site. Primer sequences for all constructs are summarized in Table 1. The PCR-amplified gene products were subsequently cloned into a pET15b vector (Novagen), which harbors a cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine tag.TABLE 1Primer sequencesConstructForward primerΔ19-PDHGCGGCGGCCCATATGAATATTATAAAAATTTTAAAATCTTTAAGΔ25-PDHGCGGCGGCCCATATGAAATCTTTAAGTATGCAAAACΔ28-PDHGCGGCGGCCCATATGAGTATGCAAAACGTCCTCΔ36-PDHGCGGCGGCCCATATGGGCGTGGGCTTTATGGΔ52-PDHGCGGCGGCCCATATGGGGTTTAAGGGAAAAATATACΔ55-PDHGCGGCGGCCCATATGGGAAAAATATACGGGTACPDH-revaThe reverse primer was used for each forward primer.GCGCGGATCCATCTATCTCCATTCTCTTAATCa The reverse primer was used for each forward primer. Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—All constructs of A. aeolicus VF5 PDH were expressed and purified as previously described (21Christendat D. Saridakis V. Dharamsi A.

Briefly, the expression plasmid for PDH was transformed into E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) (Stratagene), which harbors an extra plasmid (pMgk) encoding three rare tRNAs (AGG and AGA for Arg, ATA for Ile). These E. coli cells were then cultured in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until the culture reached an A600 of 0.6-0.8. At this point, the culture was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking and allowed to grow overnight at 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication, and the insoluble cellular material was removed by centrifugation. The PDH protein was purified from other contaminating proteins using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The protein was digested with 1 μg of thrombin/mg of purified protein for 16 h at 4 °C and then passed through a Ni-NTA column to remove the cleaved histidine tags. The protein was subsequently dialyzed, stored in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 500 mm NaCl, and quantified using an extinction coefficient of 25,900 m-1 cm-1. For the Δ19-PDH construct, selenomethionine protein was prepared as follows. Δ19-PDH was expressed in BL21 cells (described above) in M9 minimal medium (22Sambrook J.F.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 0.4% (w/v) glucose as a carbon source. Once the cells reached an A600 of 0.8, selenomethionine plus an amino acid mixture (60 mg of selenomethionine; 100 mg of lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine; and 50 mg of leucine, isoleucine, and valine) were added. The culture was induced 15 min later with 0.4 mm β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were allowed to grow as described above for the native protein. Cell lysis and protein purification were carried out exactly as described above for native protein but with the addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in all buffers. Limited Proteolysis of Full-length PDH, MALDI-TOF Analysis, and Construct Design—The expressed FL PDH protein rapidly degraded, and crystals obtained from this preparation were unstable. As a result, limited proteolysis was conducted on the FL PDH protein solution to remove protease-susceptible regions and to obtain a stable protein product. Briefly, the PDH protein was incubated with 40 ng of trypsin, 100 μl of 10 mg/ml PDH protein in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.5 and was analyzed at various time points (Fig. 1). The reaction was stopped by lowering the pH to 5.0 using HCl. The partially digested protein was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The band representing a stable protein product was excised from the gel, and in-gel tryptic digestion was subsequently conducted. The peptides resulting from digestion were extracted and then analyzed on a MALDI-TOF instrument (Bruker Autoflex) to identify N- and C-terminal peptides. Briefly, peptides eluted in 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid were mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in a 1:1 ratio in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluroacetic acid and spotted onto a target plate, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis was conducted. The Mascot data base was used to identify peptides that corresponded to the observed masses. Based on this analysis, constructs Δ19-PDH, Δ25-PDH, Δ28-PDH, Δ36-PDH, Δ52-PDH, and Δ55-PDH, which lack the first 19, 25, 28, 36, 52, and 55 residues, respectively, were designed. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration was performed with a Superdex 200 prep 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 500 mm NaCl using AKTA Explorer (GE Healthcare). The protein standards used were bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and cytochrome c. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Crystallization—The initial crystallization condition was determined with a sparse crystallization matrix (Hampton Research Crystal Screen I™) at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. The optimized crystallization condition consists of 12% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 3.2, and 200 mm lithium sulfate (2 μl of protein solution (15 mg/ml) plus 2 μl of the reservoir solution). Crystals selected for single wavelength anomalous dispersion data collection were flash-frozen in a 12.5% glycerol solution as a cryoprotectant. X-ray Diffraction and Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at a temperature of 100 K in a nitrogen stream on beamline 19ID at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories (Argonne, IL). The diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 suite of programs (DENZO/SCALEPACK) (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Initial phase information was obtained with SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), from which 28 selenium sites were identified using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method with the selenium peak diffraction data. Phase improvements were achieved by density modification and noncrystallographic symmetry averaging with RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Initial model building was done using RESOLVE followed by ARP/wARP (26Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), which built a total of 917 residues for the tetramer (79% of the complete model). The remainder of the model was manually built with O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and simulated annealing refinement was subsequently conducted with CNS (Crystallography and NMR System) (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) after every round of model building. A total of six rounds of model building with O and CNS refinement were conducted. All four molecules of PDH were rebuilt prior to every round of refinement, and noncrystallographic restraint was not applied during CNS refinement. The NAD+ molecules were fitted to the unaccounted electron density in each molecule in the tetramer after the second round of refinement. Subsequently, water molecules were added after the fourth round of refinement. Water molecules were initially picked using CNS and then manually verified in O using the following criteria: a peak of a least 2.5 σ in an FO - FC map, a peak of at least 1.0 σ ina2FO - FC map, and reasonable intermolecular interactions. NAD+ and prephenate Protein Data Bank codes, topology, and parameter files were obtained from the HIC-up server (available on the World Wide Web at x-ray.bmc.uu.se/hicup). Figures were produced with MolScript (29Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), PyMol (W. DeLano; DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA), and SPOCK (J. Christopher; Center for Macromolecular Design, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX). Multiple Sequence Alignment—Multiple sequence alignment was conducted with T-COFFEE (32Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar). Sequences from six monofunctional PDHs and from the PDH domains of eight bifunctional CM-PDHs and four bifunctional prephenate-3-phosphoskimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferases (PDH-3-PSKs) were used for alignment. Monofunctional PDHs were as follows: A. aeolicus NP_214202, Geobacter sulfurreducens AAR35979, Thermus thermophilus YP_144065, Campylobacter jejuni YP_178149, Neisseria meningitides CAB85263, and Deinococcus radiodurans NP_294846. CM-PDHs were as follows: E. coli NP_289153, Salmonella choleraesuis YP_217658, Erwinia carotovora CAG76249, Vibrio parahemeolyticus NP_796926, Blochmannia floridanus NP_878481, Pasteurella multocida AAK02748, Shewanella frigidimarina ZP_00640059, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, AAU37709, and Colwellia psychrerythraea YP_270611. PDH-3-PSKs were as follows: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus CAG69018, Pseudomonas syringae NP_791573, Pseudomonas fluorescens YP_261402, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NP_251854, and Pseudomonas putida NP_743926. Limited Proteolysis to Determine Constructs Suitable for Crystallization—The overexpression of the FL A. aeolicus PDH in E. coli resulted in two protein products, a 36-kDa species corresponding to the intact protein and a 32-kDa degradation product (Fig. 1). The Ni-NTA purification profile, as judged by SDS-PAGE, revealed that the majority of the smaller sized protein flowed through the Ni-NTA column, whereas a higher proportion of the FL protein was bound to the column; SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins indicated that roughly 80% of the total protein collected corresponds to the FL protein (Fig. 1). This result indicates that the low molecular weight species is a C-terminal fragment that lacks the N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Crystallization of this protein mixture resulted in crystals that were sensitive to physical perturbations in the crystallization environment, such as vibration or changes in temperature. SDS-PAGE analysis of these protein crystals revealed that the smaller protein fragment is the major species contributing to crystal growth. In order to improve the quality of the protein crystal, we designed a number of expression constructs. A limited tryptic digestion approach was applied to identify a protease-resistant fragment of PDH. Judging from the SDS-PAGE analysis, a stable fragment of ∼32 kDa resulted from partial digestion (Fig. 1, inset). The ability of this fragment to resist the tryptic digestion suggested that its protease recognition motifs are not easily accessible, which, in turn, indicated that this fragment is tightly folded. In-gel tryptic digestion followed by mass spectrometry resulted in about 60% peptide coverage. Peptides identified include a peptide starting at residue 58 and the C-terminal peptide as well as other peptides between the former and the latter. Since peptides representing the first 58 residues were not identified by mass spectrometry, we proposed that the protease-susceptible region lies N-terminal to residue 58. Therefore, six expression constructs of the PDH protein, Δ19-PDH, Δ25-PDH, Δ28-PDH, Δ36-PDH, Δ52-PDH, and Δ55-PDH, were prepared and expressed. These constructs lack the first 19, 25, 28, 36, 52, and 55 residues, respectively. Constructs Δ36-PDH, Δ52-PDH, and Δ55-PDH were unstable, whereas Δ19-PDH, Δ25-PDH, and Δ28-PDH produced stable and soluble proteins. The Δ19-PDH construct displays biophysical and kinetic properties similar to those of the FL PDH. 6J. Turnbull, manuscript in preparation. Crystallization of all soluble constructs was attempted, but only Δ19-PDH produced well ordered crystals. Crystals that diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution were obtained in an optimized crystallization solution containing 12% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 3.2 and 200 mm lithium sulfate. Structure Determination—Protein crystals of Δ19-PDH belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of 42.7 × 178.9 × 75.2 Å. There are four PDH monomers in the asymmetric unit, and the Matthews coefficient is 2.05 Å3/Da, which corresponds to an estimated solvent content of 40%. The final model of PDH consists of 1114 residues, four molecules of NAD+, and 500 water molecules. In general, the electron density for the model is well defined, but the following residues have been excluded in the model due to weak electron densities: residues 20-29, 249-251, and 311 in Chain A, residues 20-30 and 311 in Chain B, residues 20-29 and 308-311 in Chain C, and residues 20-29 and 308-311 in Chain D. The final energy minimization refinement of PDH yields a protein model that has an R value of 22.08 (Rfree of 26.30). The model displays excellent overall stereochemistry as judged by the Ramachandran plot, which shows that 99.8% of the residues are in the allowed regions.

Open table in a new tab Overview of the Structure—The PDH monomer consists of two domains, an N-terminal α/β dinucleotide-binding domain (residues 31-200) and a C-terminal α-helical domain (residues 202-310) (Fig. 2). The N- and C-terminal domains associate though interactions involving regions of α4, α5, α8, α10, α11, β6, β7, β8, and the coil region between β6 and α6. This interdomain interface consists predominantly of charged and polar residues. Some notable residues at this cleft include Arg250 and Arg102, which form ion pairs with Glu153 and Asp261, respectively. The N-terminal α/β domain is represented by a modified Rossmann fold. The core of this domain consists of a parallel, six-stranded β-sheet (β1-β6; β-strand order 3-2-1-4-5-6) that is sandwiched by two helices (α1 and α2) and a 310 helix (α6) on one face of the sheet, and by three helices (α3-α5) on the other face (Fig. 2). This portion of the N-terminal domain is similar to other dinucleotide folds seen in NAD(P)-binding oxidoreductases, but it does contain a few deviations. For example, in addition to this conserved nucleotide-binding element, a β-α-β motif (β7-α7-β8) is appended to the central β-sheet. This motif lies adjacent to β6 of the core β-sheet and is twisted 60° out of plane with respect to the central β-sheet (Fig. 2A). Also, a long loop (residues 140-166) that is disrupted by a 310 helix (α6) in the middle connects this β-α-β motif to the nucleotide-binding domain (Fig. 2). This connecting loop, found between β6 and β7, plays important functional roles in PDH. It adopts a “lasso” type conformation, which caps most of the PDH active site. Moreover, this loop is positioned adjacent to another loop (residues 240-247) formed by the second subunit of the dimer (Fig. 3A). Both loops participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with each other, and it is likely that these interactions could result in a gated mechanism allowing prephenate access to the active site. Residues from this functional loop also contribute to the active site architecture, since Glu153 and Asp247′ form an ionic network with Arg250 (Fig. 3A), a conserved residue that has been shown to be important for prephenate binding (17Christendat D. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain adopts a novel, entirely helical architecture and"

In contrast, elevated levels of fVIII are associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. fVIII is activated by thrombin to form a non-covalently linked A1/A2/A3-C1-C2 heterotrimer. At physiological concentrations, fVIIIa decays as a result of A2 subunit dissociation, which may help regulate the balance between hemostasis and thrombosis. A2 subunit dissociation is faster in human fVIIIa than in porcine fVIIIa, which may represent an evolutionary adaptation associated with the development of the upright posture and venous stasis in the lower extremities.

The kinetics of fVIIIa decay were measured and fit to a model describing a reversible bimolecular reaction in which the dissociation rate constant, k, and dissociation constant, Kd, were the fitted parameters. Substitution of the porcine A1 domain into human fVIIIa produced a dissociation rate constant indistinguishable from porcine fVIIIa. Subsequently, substitution of the second cupredoxin-like A1 subdomain resulted in a dissociation rate constant similar to porcine fVIIIa, whereas substitution of the first cupredoxin-like A1 subdomain resulted in a dissociation rate constant intermediate between human and porcine fVIIIa. We propose that cupredoxin-like A1 subdomains in fVIII contain inter-species differences that are a result of selective pressure on the dissociation rate constant.

As a result, a series of 160–300-kDa heterodimers are produced that contain a common ap-A3-C1-C2 light chain and A1-A2-B heavy chains in which the amount of B domain is variable. The B domain can be deleted with little or no change in the function of fVIII. fVIII circulates non-covalently bound to von Willebrand factor (vWf) and is proteolytically activated by thrombin, which catalyzes cleavages at Arg372 between the A1 and A2 domains, at Arg740 between the A2 and B domains, and at Arg1689 between the ap and A3 domains (2Eaton D.

Additionally, cleavage at Arg740 does not appear to be necessary for fVIII activation because site-directed mutagenesis of Arg740 inhibits cleavage at this site by thrombin but not functional activation (8Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Arg1689 is responsible for the dissociation of fVIII from vWf (11Lollar P.

However, in the absence of vWf, cleavage at Arg1689 is not required to produce a fVIIIa molecule with substantial activity (12Aly A.M. Hoyer L.W. J. Clin.

At the plasma concentration of fVIII (∼1 nm) at physiological pH, human fVIIIa activity spontaneously decays to undetectable levels with a half-life of 2 min at 23 °C (17Hultin M.B. Jesty J. Blood. 1981; 57: 476-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Blood. 1984; 63: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8056-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as a result of A2 subunit dissociation (4Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

A2 subunit dissociation is a reversible process, and active, heterotrimeric fVIIIa can be reconstituted using sufficiently high concentrations of purified A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (5Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for the binding of the A2 subunit to the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer is over 2 orders of magnitude greater than the plasma concentration of fVIII (21Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at physiological concentrations the equilibrium lies far toward the dissociated state. A2 subunit dissociation appears to be an important regulatory feature of the blood coagulation mechanism. Naturally occurring human mutations that increase the rate of A2 subunit dissociation produce hemophilia A (22Pipe S.W. Eickhorst A.N. McKinley S.H. Saenko E.L. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 176-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V, which is homologous to fVIII, also contains an A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 domain sequence but lacks a cleavage site between the A1 and A2 domains. As a result, factor Va is an A1-A2/A3-C1-C2 dimer (23Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 964-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for the binding of the subunits of factor Va is significantly below the plasma concentration of factor V (24Krishnaswamy S. Russell G.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3160-3168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that factor Va is stable at physiological concentrations. This suggests that the evolution of fVIII may have included the activation step at Arg372 to produce a dissociable A2 subunit to avoid a hypercoagulable state. The rate constant for A2 subunit dissociation of human fVIIIa is ∼3-fold greater than that of porcine fVIIIa at 23 °C (21Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may also represent an evolutionary adaptation. In this study, we have investigated the decay kinetics of recombinant hybrid human/porcine fVIIIa molecules.

B domain-deleted human fVIII, HP66, and HP68 underwent an additional mono S chromatography step. HP46 underwent an additional mono Q chromatography step. The concentrations of the purified constructs was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 260,000 m–1 cm–1, based on their predicted tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine compositions (35Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar), which did not differ substantially among the proteins. Measurement of the Kinetics of fVIIIa Decay—A chromogenic substrate assay for fVIIIa activity was used based on factor X activation by an enzymatic complex consisting of factor IXa, PCPS, calcium, and limiting amounts of fVIIIa as described previously (21Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of HP68, fVIII at a nominal concentration of 1, 20, 50, or 100 nm was reacted with 100 nm thrombin at 23 °C for 30 s in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4, followed by addition of desulfatohirudin (150 nm) to inhibit thrombin. HP68 was activated at nominal concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 20 nm because of the limited amount of protein. Under these conditions, there is complete cleavage of fVIII within 5 s as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. At various times, fVIII activation mixtures were diluted to a total fVIIIa concentration of 0.2 nm into 2 nm factor IXa/20 μm PCPS in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4. Factor X then was added immediately to a final concentration of 300 nm, and factor Xa formation was measured using the chromogenic substrate Spectrazyme Xa as described previously (36Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a SpectraMax Plus or VersaMax kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For studies of the temperature dependence of the rate of A2 subunit dissociation, fVIII (20 nm) was reacted with 100 nm thrombin at 23 °C for 15 s in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4. The resulting fVIIIa was diluted to 1 nm in the same buffer plus 8 nm hirudin equilibrated at 18, 23, 27, 32, or 37 °C at pH 7.4. Adjustment of the buffer pH was necessary because of the variation of the pKa of HEPES with temperature and was done using a Mettler Toledo InLab 409/120 pH electrode and a Corning 240 pH meter. The pH electrode, which has a potential that varies with temperature according to the Nernst equation, was calibrated at the fVIIIa decay temperatures using pH 4, 7, and 10 standard National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable buffers with known temperature-dependent pH variation (Fisher Scientific). At various times, activation mixtures were diluted to 0.2 nm fVIIIa and assayed as described above. Analysis of the Kinetics of fVIIIa Decay—Decay kinetics of fVIIIa were analyzed using a model describing reversible binding of the A2 subunit to the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer as described previously (21Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A1/A2/A3-C1-C2⇄k'kA1/A3-C1-C2+A2SCHEME 1 The dissociation and association rate constants, k and k′, respectively, are related by the dissociation constant, Kd = k/k′. The fraction of fVIIIa as a function of time is given as follows, f(t)=ao−a(t)aoEq. 1 where ao is the initial concentration of fVIIIa, and a(t) is the concentration of dissociated product at time t and is given as follows (37Moore J.W. Pearson R.G. Kinetics and Mechanism. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 284-333Google Scholar), a(t)=aoxe(eλ(t)−1)ao(eλ(t)+1)−xeEq. 2 where xe=−Kd+Kd2+4aoKd2Eq. 3 is the concentration of A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit at equilibrium and λ(t)=k(2ao−xe)txe.Eq. 4 Because fVIIIa activity is measured indirectly by measuring factor X activation, ao cannot be measured directly but rather was estimated by extrapolation to the ordinate of the line formed from plotting the logarithm of the initial velocity of factor X activation versus time for the 1- and 3-min points. At these early times, reassociation of the A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer is negligible, as judged by a lack of concentration dependence of extrapolated values. Values of f(t) as a function of ao and t were fitted by global, weighted nonlinear least-squares regression with k and Kd as the fitted parameters using the Marquardt algorithm (38Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 204-246Google Scholar). The quality of the least-squares regression fits was evaluated by calculating the reduced chi square variable, χ2ν, associated with the weighted squared residuals corresponding to m decay times and n initial concentrations, using, χν2=1ν∑i=1n∑j=1mWij(fij(t)−fij∗(t))2Eq. 5 where fij and f*ij are the measured and fitted fractions of fVIIIa remaining, respectively, wij is the statistical weight and ν = mn – 2 is the number of degrees of freedom for a two-parameter fit. Weights were assigned using the following, Wij=1sij2Eq. 6 where sij represents the standard deviation of fij(t). A preliminary set of replicate measurements indicated that sij was proportional to f(t) so that sij=βfij(t)+so,Eq. 7 where β is the coefficient of variation, and so is the estimated baseline standard deviation when no fVIIIa is present. An estimate of 0.005 was used for so based on 50 replicate measurements in the absence of added fVIII. A value of 0.07 was used for β to produce an average value of χ2ν of approximately one for the data sets. Intra-experimental 95% confidence limits for estimates of k and Kd were calculated using Student's t distribution with ν degrees of freedom and estimated standard deviations of the fitted parameters that were obtained by multiplying the square root of χ2ν by the diagonal elements of the least-squares error matrix (39Shoemaker D.P. Garland C.W. Nibler J.W. Experiments in Physical Chemistry. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 801-827Google Scholar). Decay Kinetics of Substituted A Domain Human/Porcine fVIIIa Hybrids—After rapid activation by thrombin, the kinetics of fVIIIa decay are governed by the dissociation rate constant, k, and the dissociation constant, Kd, for the interaction of the A2 subunit with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer as shown in Scheme I (21Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate constant for A2 subunit dissociation of human fVIIIa is 3-fold greater than that of porcine fVIIIa at 23 °C (21Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the difference between human and porcine fVIIIa was independent of interactions involving the C1 or C2 domains and constructed recombinant B domain-deleted human, porcine, or hybrid human/porcine fVIII cDNAs encoding all eight possible combinations of human and porcine A domains (Fig. 1). Proteins corresponding to the cDNAs were expressed from a baby hamster kidney-derived cell line and purified. The kinetics of fVIIIa decay were measured at 23 °C using a chromogenic substrate assay of the intrinsic fXase complex under conditions in which fVIIIa was the limiting function component as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fVIIIa decay kinetics of the constructs reveal that the activity at 1 nm, which corresponds to the plasma concentration of fVIII, approaches zero after 30 min (Fig. 3). At increasing nominal concentrations of fVIIIa, activity approaches non-zero values consistent with reversible binding. The decay of human fVIIIa is faster than porcine fVIIIa at all nominal concentrations (cf. Fig. 3, A and B). Qualitative inspection indicates that some hybrids behave like human fVIIIa, e.g. HP1, which contains a single porcine A2 domain substitution (Fig. 3C), whereas other hybrids behave like porcine fVIIIa, e.g. HP46, which contains a single porcine A1 domain substitution (Fig. 3G). These results indicate that the difference in A2 subunit dissociation between human and porcine fVIIIa is independent of the species composition of the C1 or C2 domain. The data were fit to a bimolecular equilibrium model represented by Scheme I using global, weighted nonlinear least square regression analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiment was performed twice for each construct, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 1. Reasonable fits to the model were obtained as judged by reduced χ2 values that in most cases fell within the 0.95 probability range (0.5–1.7, 22 degrees of freedom). Good reproducibility of the estimates of the dissociation rate constant, k, and dissociation constant, Kd, were obtained as judged by inter-experimental values that were within the 95% confidence limits obtained from intra-experimental regression analysis in most cases. The decay of porcine fVIIIa was ∼3-fold slower than human fVIIIa, which is consistent with earlier results using plasma-derived human and porcine fVIIIa (21Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs containing the porcine A1 domain, including HP46, which is entirely human except for the porcine A1 domain, exhibited decay rates similar to porcine fVIIIa. In contrast, substitution of only the porcine A2 domain (HP1) resulted in decay rates more similar to human fVIIIa than porcine fVIIIa. Thus, the relatively fast decay of human fVIIIa appears to be due entirely to A1 domain differences between human and porcine fVIII.TABLE 1Kinetic and equilibrium parameter estimates for dissociation of A domain hybrid fVIIIa molecules at 23 °CConstructA1A2A3aA domain composition: H, human; P, porcine.ExperimentkbParameter estimates and 95% confidence limits from nonlinear regression analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”KdbParameter estimates and 95% confidence limits from nonlinear regression analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”χν2cReduced χ2 variable.min-1nmHumanHHH10.288 ± 0.015149 ± 160.8320.284 ± 0.017175 ± 221.1PorcinePPP10.110 ± 0.00688 ± 120.6020.104 ± 0.00487 ± 100.38HP1HPH10.210 ± 0.017133 ± 231.820.220 ± 0.016191 ± 321.7HP22PPH10.132 ± 0.008188 ± 351.220.130 ± 0.009240 ± 521.4HP30HHP10.349 ± 0.021420 ± 681.520.369 ± 0.039400 ± 1124.6HP45HPP10.276 ± 0.006185 ± 80.4020.276 ± 0.012210 ± 200.61HP46PHH10.105 ± 0.004154 ± 200.4320.095 ± 0.007137 ± 361.5HP47PHP10.126 ± 0.00589 ± 100.4420.107 ± 0.00778 ± 151.00a A domain composition: H, human; P, porcine.b Parameter estimates and 95% confidence limits from nonlinear regression analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”c Reduced χ2 variable. Open table in a new tab Although the dissociation constant, Kd, ranged ∼4-fold between the constructs, there was not a consistent pattern with respect to A domain composition (cf. Fig. 4, A and B). Additionally, there was only a weak correlation between Kd and ln k (r2 = 0.53). If only the dissociation rate constant differed among the constructs, the variables would be related linearly by ln Kd = ln k – ln k′, where k′ is the association rate constant (Scheme I). Thus, the results indicate that porcine A domain substitutions produce variable changes in the association rate constant. Temperature-dependent Decay of Human and Porcine fVIIIa—The Arrhenius equation for the temperature dependence of a rate constant, k, is as follows, lnk=−EaRT+lnAEq. 8 where Ea is the activation energy, A is the frequency factor, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature (40Moore W.J. Physical Chemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs1972: 324-420Google Scholar). This equation predicts that there should be linear relationship between ln k and 1/T with a slope equal to –Ea/R and a common ordinate intercept at ln A if the difference in rate constant is due solely to a difference in activation energy. Dissociation rate constants for human and porcine fVIIIa were measured at temperatures ranging from 18 °C to 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrhenius plots for human and porcine fVIIIa both were reasonably linear in the 23 °C to 37 °C range (Fig. 5). The decay rates of human fVIIIa at 18 °C and 23 °C points were similar, producing a nonlinear plot below the latter temperature. Regression analysis yielded estimates and 95% confidence limits for Ea of 9.2 ± 4.5 and 13.7 ± 2.0 kcal/mol for human and porcine fVIIIa, respectively. The difference between human and porcine fVIIIa was statistically significant (Student's t test, p = 0.02). Additionally, there was a significant difference in the estimates of ln A for human and porcine fVIIIa, respectively (Student's t test, p = 0.03). The estimated values of k for human and porcine fVIIIa at 37 °C determined from six replicate measurements were 0.69 and 0.41 min–1, respectively, which were significantly different (p = 7 × 10–9, Student's t test). Decay Kinetics of Substituted A1 Subdomain Human/Porcine fVIIIa Hybrids—The three fVIII A domains each contain two ∼20-kDa cupredoxin-like subdomains. Additionally, the A1 domain contains a 37-residue COOH-terminal acidic region defined by residues Arg337–Arg372. Because a difference between the human and porcine A1 domain appears to be responsible for the relatively fast decay of human fVIIIa, a series of A1 subdomain hybrids were constructed as depicted in Fig. 2. The hybrids were purified following expression from the baby hamster kidney-derived cell line and the decay rates of the corresponding fVIIIa hybrids were analyzed. In the first experiment, decays were analyzed at several initial concentrations of fVIIIa as described above for the A domai"
https://openalex.org/W2032276513,"A heme domain of coral allene oxide synthase (cAOS) catalyzes the formation of allene oxide from fatty acid hydroperoxide. Although cAOS has a similar heme active site to that of catalase, cAOS is completely lacking in catalase activity. A close look at the hydrogen-bonding possibilities around the distal His in cAOS suggested that the imidazole ring is rotated by 180° relative to that of catalase because of the hydrogen bond between Thr-66 and the distal His-67. This could contribute to the functional differences between cAOS and catalase, and to examine this possibility, we mutated Thr-66 in cAOS to Val, the corresponding residue in catalase. In contrast to the complete absence of catalase activity in wild type (WT) cAOS, T66V had a modest catalase activity. On the other hand, the mutation suppressed the native enzymatic activity of the formation of allene oxide to 14% of that of WT cAOS. In the resonance Raman spectrum, whereas WT cAOS has only a 6-coordinate/high spin heme, T66V has a 5-coordinate/high spin heme as a minor species. Because catalase adopts a 5-coordinate/high spin structure, probably the 5-coordinate/high spin portion of T66V showed the catalase activity. Furthermore, in accord with the fact that the CN affinity of catalase is higher than that of WT cAOS, the CN affinity of T66V was 8-fold higher than that of WT cAOS, indicating that the mutation could mimic the heme active site in catalase. We, therefore, propose that the hydrogen bond between Thr-66 and distal His-67 could modulate the orientation of distal His, thereby regulating the enzymatic activity in cAOS.

Furthermore, in accord with the fact that the CN affinity of catalase is higher than that of WT cAOS, the CN affinity of T66V was 8-fold higher than that of WT cAOS, indicating that the mutation could mimic the heme active site in catalase. We, therefore, propose that the hydrogen bond between Thr-66 and distal His-67 could modulate the orientation of distal His, thereby regulating the enzymatic activity in cAOS. Allene oxides formed by the enzymatic dehydration of fatty acid hydroperoxides, the lipoxygenase (LOX) 4The abbreviations used are: LOX, lipoxygenase; AOS, allene oxide synthase; cAOS, AOS domain of coral AOS; 8R-HpETE, 8R-hydroperoxy-5Z, 9E, 11Z, 14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid; RR, resonance Raman; BLC, bovine liver catalase; HPII, E. coli hydroperoxidase II; WT, wild type. 4The abbreviations used are: LOX, lipoxygenase; AOS, allene oxide synthase; cAOS, AOS domain of coral AOS; 8R-HpETE, 8R-hydroperoxy-5Z, 9E, 11Z, 14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid; RR, resonance Raman; BLC, bovine liver catalase; HPII, E. coli hydroperoxidase II; WT, wild type. products of polyunsaturated fatty acids, are involved in biosynthetic pathways of plants and invertebrates. The main plant pathway leads to jasmonic acid, which seems to be a physiological signaling molecule for several wound- and pathogen-induced responses (1Farmer E.E. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7713-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The conversion from fatty acid hydroperoxide to allene oxide in plants is catalyzed by a heme containing enzyme called allene oxide synthase (AOS) (2Song W.C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 3Brash A.R. Song W.C. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plant AOS belongs to a subfamily of the fatty acid hydroperoxide metabolizing cytochrome P450s (P450s) designated as CYP74A (4Nelson D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 107: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nelson D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 6Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Despite significant sequence homology of plant AOS to those of other P450s, the reaction of plant AOS is different from those of typical P450s (7Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Chang M.S. Boeglin W.E. Guengerich F.P. Brash A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Plant AOS does not require the reductants and oxygen, and carries out the homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond in hydroperoxide, although typical P450s utilize two electrons and molecular oxygen for the hydroxylation of its substrate. Koljak et al. (1997) discovered and isolated a cDNA encoding a fusion protein of 8R-LOX and AOS from the Caribbean sea soft coral, Plexaura homomalla (9Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.H. Samel N. Brash A.R. Science. 1997; 277: 1994-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the first example of an AOS found in animals. The fusion protein consists of a C-terminal 8R-LOX domain (79 kDa) and N-terminal heme-containing AOS domain (43 kDa). As shown in Scheme 1, reaction (i), the 8R-LOX domain initially catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonic acid at the 8R position, yielding the 8R-hydroperoxide of arachidonic acid (8R-HpETE). Then, the AOS domain produces allene oxide from 8R-HpETE (Scheme 1, reaction (ii)). The truncated construct of the AOS domain (cAOS) can catalyze an identical reaction to the AOS domain in the native coral fusion protein (7Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite the functional similarity to plant AOS, cAOS does not exhibit sequence homology to plant AOS, but shows significant homology to catalase (∼11% of sequence identity) (9Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.H. Samel N. Brash A.R. Science. 1997; 277: 1994-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, cAOS cannot catalyze the dismutation of H2O2 to water and oxygen molecule, namely the catalase reaction (Scheme 2) (7Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.H. Samel N. Brash A.R. Science. 1997; 277: 1994-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas cAOS, like bovine liver catalase (BLC), reacts with peracetic acid to form a ferryl oxo species with a tyrosine radical followed by the formation of a ferryl oxo porphyrin π-cation radical (compound I) species (10Wu F. Katsir L.J. Seavy M. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6871-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Abraham B.D. Sono M. Boutaud O. Shriner A. Dawson J.H. Brash A.R. Gaffney B.J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As expected from the sequence homology, the spectroscopic data indicated that the heme active site structure in cAOS is quite similar to that of catalase (11Abraham B.D. Sono M. Boutaud O. Shriner A. Dawson J.H. Brash A.R. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Oldham M.L. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For example, Tyr is a heme ligand of cAOS as observed in catalase (11Abraham B.D. Sono M. Boutaud O. Shriner A. Dawson J.H. Brash A.R. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Oldham M.L. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the other hand, as compared with catalase, the recent crystal structure of cAOS showed the lack of hydrogen-bonding network involving the proximal tyrosinate ligand and also the remarkable planarity of the heme (12Oldham M.L. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Oldham et al. (12Oldham M.L. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) proposed that such structural properties would inhibit the reaction with H2O2, thereby showing no catalase activity in cAOS. In addition, the crystal structures also showed remarkable differences in the heme distal sites between cAOS and catalase as displayed in Fig. 1. Although residues responsible for the catalase reaction such as the distal His and Asn are conserved in cAOS, the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the distal His in cAOS is different from that of catalase (12Oldham M.L. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In catalase, the distal His (His-78) is hydrogen-bonded to an adjacent Ser residue (Ser-116), which is highly conserved in catalases (13Putnam C.D. Arvai A.S. Bourne Y. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 14Carpena X. Soriano M. Klotz M.G. Duckworth H.W. Donald L.J. Melik-Adamyan W. Fita I. Loewen P.C.

Biol. 1999; 286: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), and is fixed at an optimal orientation for the reaction with hydrogen peroxide. In cAOS, the distal His (His-67) is hydrogen-bonded to the distal Asn (Asn-137) and to Thr-66 (which is substituted to Val in catalase), whereas Ser-118 locates near to His-67 (12Oldham M.L. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of such different hydrogen bonding patterns, it can be inferred that the imidazole ring of the distal His-67 in cAOS is flipped relative to that of catalase. The Nϵ atom of distal His is believed to abstract a hydrogen atom from H2O2, which is crucial for the formation of compound I in heme proteins including catalase (18Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Shaw A. Brown K.A. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9798-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 19Matsui T. Ozaki S. Liong E. Phillips Jr., G.N. Watanabe Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 1981; 152: 465-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We can, therefore, speculate that such difference in orientation of the distal His are inherent to the functional difference between cAOS and catalase. In this study, to test our hypothesis that the lack of the catalase activity is caused by the flipped distal His in cAOS, we focused on the unique hydrogen-bonding pattern of His-67 in cAOS. Because only Thr-66 is not conserved between cAOS and catalase among the amino acid residues neighboring the distal His (12Oldham M.L. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it was of great interest to examine the consequence of mutating this residue. Accordingly, we prepared the Thr-66 to Val (T66V) mutant of cAOS, and examined the catalase activity as well as the AOS activity. Besides the functional properties, the structure of the heme environment in the T66V mutant was characterized by resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy and the CN affinity to elucidate the structure-function relationship in cAOS. On the basis of our current results, we will discuss why cAOS cannot show catalase activity. Sample Preparations—The N-terminal AOS domain of coral AOS with His4 tag, WT cAOS, was overexpressed in a strain of Escherichiacoli, BL21, and purified by the method of Boutaud and Brash (7Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of Thr-66 to Val in cAOS was carried out by the QuikChange™ Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the expression vector for WT cAOS as a template. Finally, purified cAOS gave a single band on SDS-PAGE, and the A406/A280 ratio was greater than 1.5 and 1.0 for wild type and the T66V mutant, respectively. The concentration of cAOS was estimated from the absorbance at 406 nm (ϵ = 100 mm-1 cm-1) (7Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The purified samples were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 100 mm NaCl, and stored at -80 °C. The expression and purification for the C-terminal LOX domain, 8R-LOX domain of coral AOS with His4 tag, were also carried out according to the method of Boutaud and Brash (7Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The purified sample was stored at -20 °C. Thymol-free BLC was purchased from Sigma. The purification of BLC was followed by the previous report (11Abraham B.D. Sono M. Boutaud O. Shriner A. Dawson J.H. Brash A.R. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The fractions bearing the A405/A280 ratio greater than 0.8 were employed in this study. The concentration of BLC was determined by using an extinction coefficient for heme at 405 nm of 100 mm-1cm-1 (22Browett W.R. Stillman M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 577: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The substrate for cAOS, 8R-HpETE, was enzymatically synthesized. Arachidonic acid (3 mg in 300 μl of ethanol) was added to 90 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 containing 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 with vigorous stirring. The purified 8R-LOX domain was immediately added to the solution containing arachidonic acid. The formation of 8R-HpETE was monitored in dilutions of small aliquots of the reaction by the increase in the absorbance at 235 nm. The reaction mixture was placed on ice, and acidified to pH 4.5 by the addition of 1 n HCl. The product was extracted with methylene chloride. The organic phase washed with water, and then the methylene chloride solution containing 8R-HpETE was dried under a strong stream of nitrogen gas at room temperature. Immediately upon drying, the 8R-HpETE was dissolved in ethanol, and stored under argon at -20 °C. H2O2 Consumption Rate—Catalase activities for WT cAOS and the T66V mutant were evaluated by the H2O2 consumption rate. The assay solution (500 μl) contained 1-50 mm H2O2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 100 mm NaCl. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 μm (final concentration) of the cAOS samples, and the H2O2 consumption rate was determined by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance at 240 nm at 20 °C with the spectrometer (Hitachi, U-3310). The concentration of H2O2 was determined by the absorbance at 240 nm (ϵ = 43.6 m-1 cm-1) (23Bielski B.H.J. Allen A.O. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 1048-1050Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). For comparison, the H2O2 consumption rates for BLC and hemin were also estimated. O2 Production Rate—Oxygen production upon mixing of cAOS with H2O2 was polarographically monitored with a Clark-type electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments, 5331). The assay solution (2 ml) containing 1-350 mm H2O2 and 100 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0 was kept at 20 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 nm (final concentration) of the cAOS samples or 0.1 nm (final concentration) of BLC. Stopped-flow Measurements—The spectral changes in the reaction of ferric cAOS with H2O2 were monitored by a rapid-scanning system equipped with a stopped-flow apparatus (Unisoku RSP-1000) at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 100 mm NaCl. The sample solution containing 5 μm cAOS was transferred to one of the stopped-flow reservoirs. The other reservoir was filled with the solution containing 500 μm H2O2. AOS Activity—The consumption of 8R-HpETE by cAOS was estimated by the decrease in absorbance at 235 nm of 8R-HpETE (ϵ = 23 mm-1 cm-1) using a Hitachi, U-3310 spectrometer at room temperature (7Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 nm (final concentration) cAOS to the assay solution (500 μl) containing 10 μm 8R-HpETE and 100 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—RR spectra for ferric cAOS and BLC were obtained with a charge-coupled device (CCD) (Roper Scientific, Spec10:400B/LN) attached to a single polychromator (Jobin Yvon, SPEX750M). The 413.1-nm line from a krypton laser (Spectra Physics, BeamLok 2060) and the 488.0-nm line from an argon laser (NEC, GLG 3200) were used for the excitation source. Typically, 100 μl of the solution containing ∼15-50 μm cAOS or BLC was transferred to the quartz Raman cell. All measurements were carried out at room temperature with the spinning cell (2,000 rpm) with a diameter of 8 mm. After the RR measurements, no denaturation upon the laser irradiation was confirmed with the absorption spectrum. The calibration of Raman lines was performed with indene, acetone, and carbon tetrachloride. CN Binding—UV/vis absorption spectra of the cAOS enzymes with various concentrations of potassium cyanide were recorded in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 100 mm NaCl at room temperature. The dissociation constants (Kd) were obtained by fitting the data using the following Equation 1 that assumes the reversible binding of CN to a single binding site (24Smith A.T. Sanders S.A. Thorneley R.N. Burke J.F. Bray R.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), Aobs=A0+(A∞-A0)Kd+[cAOS]+[CN]-(Kd+[cAOS]+[CN])2-4·[cAOS][CN]2[cAOS](Eq. 1) where Aobs denotes the observed absorbances at 406 nm during the titration, A0 and A∞ represent the absorbance at 406 nm for ligand-free and CN-ligated cAOS, respectively. [cAOS] and [CN] correspond to the total concentrations of cAOS and CN in the sample solution, respectively. Catalase Activity of the T66V cAOS Mutant—To examine the catalase activity of the T66V mutant, we evaluated the H2O2 consumption rate by monitoring the absorbance change of H2O2 after mixing 1 μm T66V mutant and 10 mm H2O2. Fig. 2A shows a time course for the decrease of the H2O2 absorption of 240 nm at 20 °C. The absorbance change of H2O2 upon the addition of 1 μm WT cAOS or free heme to the solution containing 10 mm H2O2 was negligible, which is consistent with the report by Boutaud and Brash (7Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to this, the decrease of the absorbance of H2O2 was observed with the initial velocity of 86 μm sec-1 in the T66V mutant (Fig. 2A, squares). Furthermore, we observed bubbles probably derived from the oxygen evolution in the reaction mixture only for the T66V mutant (data not shown). These results indicate that the T66V mutant has catalase activity. To further characterize the catalase reaction of the T66V mutant, we estimated the kinetic parameters of the reaction. The initial rates of the H2O2 consumption obtained from linear fits to data points for the decrease in absorption at 240 nm by the T66V mutant at the various concentrations (from 1 mm to 50 mm) of H2O2 are plotted as a function of the H2O2 concentration (Fig. 2B). The hyperbolic dependence of the initial rate of the H2O2 consumption on the H2O2 concentration in the T66V mutant allows us to determine the kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, by fitting the data using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The estimated Km and kcat values for the catalase reaction in the T66V mutant cAOS are summarized in Table 1 together with those of catalases (25Switala J. Loewen P.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and the other heme enzymes possessing catalase activity (26Hernandez-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N. Garcia-Canovas F. Acosta M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2834-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As seen in Table 1, the Km value for the T66V mutant is within the range of those of catalases. On the other hand, kcat in the T66V mutant is 2∼3 orders of magnitude lower than those of catalases.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the catalase reaction in the T66V mutant of cAOS, catalases and other heme enzymesProteinKmkcataH2O2 degraded per secondRef.mmsec-1T66V of cAOS (H2O2 consumption)28 ± 8312 ± 34This studyT66V of cAOS (O2 evolution)140 ± 1278 ± 2.8This studyBLC (H2O2 consumption)40 ± 1(7.23 ± 0.10) × 104This studyBLC (O2 evolution)160 ± 24(10.6 ± 0.70) × 104This studyBLC9321.2 × 104(25Switala J.

The initial rates of the oxygen evolution by wild type and the T66V mutant of cAOS are plotted against the H2O2 concentration in Fig. 3. Similar to the H2O2 consumption, the data in the T66V mutant can be fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Km and kcat values calculated from the oxygen evolution rate are summarized in Table 1. As seen in Table 1, Km from the oxygen evolution in the T66V mutant is 5-fold of that of the H2O2 consumption and a similar trend was observed in BLC. Although we have no satisfactory explanation for this, we note that on account of the UV saturation at 240 nm, measurements were made over different ranges of H2O2 concentration in the two methods, 0-50 mm for the UV assay, 0-400 mm for oxygen evolution. The kcat values are in reasonable agreement between the two assays in BLC, indicating that, for the T66V mutant, the 4-fold slower rate of the oxygen evolution (as H2O2 degraded) relative to the rate of the H2O2 consumption could truly reflect uncoupling between oxygen evolution and H2O2 consumption. Participation of the compound II pathway might explain the uncoupling between H2O2 consumption and oxygen evolution, because compound II can revert back to the resting ferric state without producing molecular oxygen (29Kirkman H.N. Rolfo M. Ferraris A.M. Gaetani G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13908-13914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Actually, the increase in the absorbance around 440 nm, which is characteristic of the formation of compound II (10Wu F. Katsir L.J. Seavy M. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6871-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), was observed after mixing of the T66V mutant with H2O2 (Fig. 4B), supporting the participation of the compound II pathway. Thus, although the T66V mutant can show the catalase reaction, its rate is considerably slower than that of catalase and more than one pathway may participate in H2O2 degradation.FIGURE 4Immediate time-dependent absorption spectral changes in WT (A) and the T66V mutant of cAOS (B) after addition of 100 eq of H2O2 at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl.

In the case of catalase, the formation of compound I upon mixing of H2O2 with the ferric enzyme is the first step in the decomposition of H2O2 as shown in Scheme 2. In WT cAOS, the addition of H2O2 induced no spectral changes, even though the amount of H2O2 corresponds to 100 eq. over the enzyme concentration (Fig. 4A). As expected from the result on the H2O2 consumption and the oxygen evolution of the T66V mutant; however, a remarkable decrease in the intensity of the Soret band was observed by the addition of 100 eq. of H2O2 to the T66V mutant (Fig. 4B), which is characteristic of the formation of compound I (30Kato S. Ueno T. Fukuzumi S. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52376-52381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To observe the compound I species, we examined the reaction between cAOS and peracetic acid. The use of peracetic acid instead of H2O2 should simplify the catalase reaction in the T66V mutant by inhibition of the reduction of compound I. In the T66V mutant, the addition of peracetic acid generated compound I (Fig. 4B, gray trace). Because the Soret absorption is decreased to less than half of that of the ferric state by the formation of compound I, the decrease in the intensity of the Soret band of the T66V mutant in the reaction with H2O2 is relatively small. Such a small spectral change upon mixing the T66V mutant with H2O2 can be attributed to the rapid reduction of compound I by H2O2 (Scheme 2, reaction (ii)). On the basis of the reactions with H2O2 and peracetic acid in the T66V mutant, we can conclude that the T66V mutant can decompose H2O2 through the compound I species as observed in catalase. AOS Activity of the T66V Mutant—We examined the effects of the T66V mutation on the inherent AOS enzymatic activity. Fig. 5 displays the time course of λmax of the substrate at 235 nm, following the addition of cAOS to the solution containing 8R-HpETE at room temperature. In the case of WT cAOS, an immediate decrease in the absorbance at 235 nm was observed with the initial rate of 0.083 ± 0.008 μm sec-1 (Fig. 5, circles). Whereas the T66V mutant also exhibits the consumption of 8R-HpETE (Fig. 5, squares), its initial rate (0.012 ± 0.002 μm sec-1) corresponds to ∼one-seventh that of WT cAOS. Therefore, the mutation of Thr-66 to Val suppresses the enzymatic activity of the allene oxide production. Resonance Raman Spectra of cAOS—Even though WT cAOS shows no catalase activity, the mutation of Thr-66 to Val in cAOS enables the enzyme to decompose H2O2 similar to catalase. On the other hand, the mutation decreases the AOS activity. To elucidate the origin of such drastic changes in the functional properties of cAOS by the mutation of Thr-66 to Val, the mutational effects on the heme active site st"
https://openalex.org/W2017988933,"Recently, poxviruses were found to encode a protein with signature motifs present in the RuvC family of Holliday junction (HJ) resolvases, which have a key role in homologous recombination in bacteria. The vaccinia virus homolog A22 specifically cleaved synthetic HJ DNA in vitro and was required for the in vivo resolution of viral DNA concatemers into unit-length genomes with hairpin telomeres. It was of interest to further characterize a poxvirus resolvase in view of the low sequence similarity with RuvC, the absence of virus-encoded RuvA and RuvB to interact with, and the different functions of the viral and bacterial resolvases. Because purified A22 aggregated severely, studies were carried out with maltose-binding protein fused to A22 as well as to RuvC. Using gel filtration, chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation, and light scattering, we demonstrated that A22 and RuvC are homodimers in solution. Furthermore, the dimeric form of the resolvase associated with HJ DNA, presumably facilitating the symmetrical cleavage of such structures. Like RuvC, A22 symmetrically cleaved fixed HJ junctions as well as junctions allowing strand mobility. Unlike RuvC and other members of the family, however, the poxvirus enzyme exhibited little cleavage sequence specificity. Structural and enzymatic similarities of poxvirus, bacterial, and fungal mitochondrial HJ resolvases are consistent with their predicted evolutionary relationship based on sequence analysis. The absence of a homologous resolvase in mammalian cells makes these microbial enzymes excellent potential therapeutic targets.

Poxviruses, of which vaccinia virus (VACV) 4The abbreviations used are: VACV, vaccinia virus; MBP, maltose-binding protein; HJ, Holliday junction; DTT, dithiothreitol; ORF, open reading frame; EGS, ethylene glyco bis(succinimidyl) succinate. 4The abbreviations used are: VACV, vaccinia virus; MBP, maltose-binding protein; HJ, Holliday junction; DTT, dithiothreitol; ORF, open reading frame; EGS, ethylene glyco bis(succinimidyl) succinate. is the prototype, replicate in the cytoplasm of cells and encode enzymes for DNA and RNA synthesis (1Moss B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Poxviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication, Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2637-2671Google Scholar). The genome of poxviruses consists of a linear double-stranded DNA molecule with the ends of each strand covalently linked to the other by incompletely base-paired hairpins, thus forming a continuous polynucleotide chain (2Baroudy B.M. Venkatesan S. Moss B. Cell. 1982; 28: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The hairpins form following DNA replication during the resolution of long concatemers into unit length genomes (3Moyer R.W. Graves R.L.

When transfected into infected cells, circular plasmids containing the concatemer junction are resolved into minigenomes with covalently closed hairpin ends by a conservative strand exchange mechanism (5Delange A.M. Reddy M. Scraba D. Upton C. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 249-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Merchlinsky M. Moss B. Cell. 1986; 45: 879-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Merchlinsky M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3437-3446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concatemer junction contains an inverted repetition, which in supercoiled plasmids can form a cruciform structure resembling a four-way Holliday junction (HJ) recombination intermediate (8Dickie P. Morgan A.R. McFadden G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Merchlinsky M. Garon C. Moss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HJ resolving enzymes have been isolated from many organisms and can be divided into two main functional groups (10Sharples G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Members of the first group, which have Escherichia coli RuvC as the prototype, have been isolated from bacteria, Archaea, and yeast. These endonucleases have high selectivity for the HJ, exhibit some sequence specificity for cleavage, and are thought to have roles in DNA recombination and repair. The second functional group, which are encoded by bacteriophages, cleave a variety of branched DNAs, exhibit low sequence specificity, and have roles in repairing double strand breaks, recombination, and processing of DNA before packaging. Studies with VACV mutants and cell extracts suggested that a virus-encoded late protein is required for resolution of concatemers (11DeLange A.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Merchlinsky M. Moss B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stuart D. Ellison K. Graham K. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1551-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and two candidate proteins have been considered. The VACV-encoded type 1 topoisomerase (14Shaffer R. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9309-9315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shuman S. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7478-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) cleaves and ligates a variety of DNA structures including a HJ (16Palaniyar N. Gerasimopoulos E. Evans D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Sekiguchi J. Seeman N.C. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, viral DNA concatemers are resolved into unit length genomes in cells infected with a VACV topoisomerase deletion mutant and a role for the enzyme in enhancing early gene expression within the confines of the virus core was suggested (18Da Fonseca F. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11291-11296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The other candidate resolving enzyme was identified by reiterative PSI-BLAST searches, which led to the finding of 5 motifs or structural elements that are critical for activity of E. coli RuvC in an open reading frame (ORF) that is conserved in all poxvirus genomes, a distantly related iridovirus, and yeast (19Garcia A.D. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Aravind L. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3417-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recombinant form of the poxvirus RuvC homolog encoded by the A22R ORF of VACV was shown to specifically bind and cleave a synthetic HJ to yield a nicked duplex molecule (19Garcia A.D. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mutation of either of two conserved acidic amino acids abrogated the catalytic activity of the viral protein without affecting HJ binding (19Garcia A.D. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a VACV-inducible A22 mutant was defective in processing concatemers into unit-length genomes with hairpin ends under non-permissive conditions (21Garcia A.D. Moss B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the HJ resolvase activity of the A22 protein is likely to be directly involved in concatemer resolution, though the enzyme may have additional roles in DNA replication and processing. Thus far, resolvase activity of RuvC homologs of other poxviruses or iridoviruses has not been confirmed, although the conservation of critical amino acid residues makes such activity likely. The presence of homologs of RuvC in bacteria, yeast, and poxviruses and their absence in mammals suggest that these enzymes are prime targets for antimicrobial therapy. E. coli RuvC has been extensively characterized with regard to both catalytic activity and atomic structure. The 19-kDa protein has been shown to be dimeric by gel filtration and x-ray crystallography (22Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Shiba T. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 23Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The binding of a RuvC dimer to a HJ ensures that nicks will be introduced symmetrically and simultaneously or nearly so into the two homologous strands. In addition, RuvC exhibits specificity for cleaving at specific nucleotide sequences (24Shah R. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Eggleston A.K. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26467-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that the VACV A22 protein is a dimer in solution and when bound to HJ structures. In addition, the sequence specificity of cleavage by A22 was investigated and found to differ from that of RuvC. Construction of Plasmids Encoding A22 and RuvC Fused to the C Terminus of the Maltose-binding Protein (MBP)—The A22R ORF was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGGCGATATCGAAACTTTAACCAGTTCGTCTCAATC and 5′-GGGGGGATCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCATTTTTTTTATGTAATTTCTAGATTTAC (EcoRV and BamHI sites underlined). The PCR product was purified and ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen) resulting in pCR2.1-A22R. An EcoRV-BamHI fragment was excised from pCR2.1-A22R, gel-purified, and ligated to XmnI and BamHI cut pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) creating pMAL-A22R. A similar PCR protocol was used to amplify the RuvC ORF using genomic DNA purified from E. coli strain DH5 lysate and oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGGCGGATATCGCTATTATTCTCGGCATTGATCCGGG and 5′GGGGGGATCCTTAACGCAGTCGCCCTCTCGCCAGGTTCAGCC (EcoRV and BamHI sites underlined). The PCR product was purified and inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO TA-cloning vector resulting in pCR2.1-RuvC. An EcoRV-BamHI fragment containing the RuvC ORF from pCR2.1-RuvC was cloned into pMAL-c2 vector, as described above, creating pMAL-RuvC. E. coli strain DH5 (New England Biolabs) was transformed for plasmid amplification. Expression of MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC—E. coli strain ER2508 (New England Biolabs), which is deficient in the lon protease and MBP, was transformed with pMAL-A22R and pMAL-RuvC to express MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC, respectively. Cells were typically grown to an A600 of 0.5 in 1 liter of LB-broth containing 0.2% (w/v) glucose and 100 μg of ampicillin per ml. Expression of fusion proteins was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. After 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was frozen and resuspended in MBP buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus Complete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by sonication (eight 15-s bursts on ice), and the lysate was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified bacterial extract (50 ml) was diluted by adding four volumes of MBP column buffer containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and passed through an amylose affinity column (New England Biolabs) previously equilibrated with MBP buffer. After the column was washed with 12-column volumes of MBP buffer, the recombinant protein was eluted with MBP buffer containing 10 mm maltose, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The peak protein fractions were pooled, 10% glycerol final concentration was added, and the protein concentration was determined. Gel Filtration—A HiPrep 16/60 S-300 Sephacryl HR column (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.2 m or 0.8 m NaCl. The column was calibrated with molecular weight (MW) standards (Amersham Biosciences) blue dextran 2000 (MW 2.0 × 106), ferritin (MW 440,000), aldolase (MW 158,000), bovine serum albumin (MW 67,000), and chymotrypsinogen A (MW 25,000). Affinity-purified MBP-A22 or MBP-RuvC (1 to 2 mg) was applied to the gel filtration column. Protein fractions were collected and analyzed on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected with silver staining reagents (Owl). Chemical Cross-linking—Affinity-purified MBP-A22 (1.5 mg) and MBP-RuvC (2.0 mg) were further purified by gel filtration on a HiPrep 16/60 S-300 Sephacryl HR column that had been equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm HEPES-HCl pH 7.5, 800 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA) and calibrated as described above. MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC peak fractions corresponding to ∼130,000 kDa were combined with various concentrations of EGS. A final concentration of ∼0.4 μg/μlof MBP-A22 or MBP-RuvC was incubated in 20-μl reactions at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 100 mm. Cross-linked products were analyzed by Western blotting. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted in an Optima XLI/A (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). From 350 to 400 μl of protein at concentrations of 50–400 μg/ml in buffered 0.8 m NaCl were filled in double sector centerpieces and interference fringe displacement data were acquired in time intervals of 100 s at a rotor speed of 50,000 rev/min and a temperature of 20 °C. Protein partial-specific volumes and buffer density and viscosity were estimated with the software SEDNTERP, kindly provided by Dr. J. Philo (Alliance Protein Laboratories, Thousand Oaks, CA). Data were analyzed by direct boundary modeling with the software SEDFIT, using the model for the continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s) with maximum entropy regularization (26Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar), combined with a discrete species describing the redistribution of unmatched buffer components and with algebraic elimination of the systematic noise components (27Schuck P. Demeler B. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2288-2296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After determining the best-fit weight-average frictional ratio of the protein components, the c(s) distribution was transformed into the corresponding molar mass distribution c(M) (28Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a boundary model with discrete Lamm equation solutions was fitted globally to data sets at different loading concentrations, using the software SEDPHAT. With both methods, the final root mean square errors of the fit were generally below 0.005 fringes. On-line Size Exclusion Chromatography Multi-angle Laser Light Scattering—An Amersham Biosciences Superdex HR200 column was used for the size exclusion separation of protein components. The flow rates used for MBP-RuvC were 0.65–0.7 ml/min, and 50–200 μl of 0.80 mg/ml protein were injected into the column. The flow rate for MBP-A22 was 0.35 ml/min, and 200 μl of 0.65 mg/ml was injected into the column. The eluant from the column entered the UV detector (Waters 2487) followed by the multi-angle light scattering detector (Wyatt Technology Dawn EOS). Wyatt Technology Astra software was used for the data analysis, and the molar mass was determined as described (29Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). A correction factor of 1.23 (based on the molar mass determination in phosphate-buffered saline relative to the resolvase buffer) was applied to correct for the high refractive index of the resolvase buffer. Mobility Shift Assay—DNA binding reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl containing rA22-his (19Garcia A.D. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or MBP-A22 (uncleaved or partially cleaved with Factor Xa protease), 0.01 pmol of 32P-labeled HJ-1, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. DNA binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Afterward, a loading dye solution was added to give the final concentrations of 20 mm HEPES-HCl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. Bound and unbound HJ probes were separated by electrophoresis through a 4% (30:1, acrylamide to bis acrylamide) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C at ∼150 volts until bromphenol blue migrated close to the bottom of the gel. The gel was dried on Whatman DE-81 paper, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. Factor Xa Protease Cleavage—Reactions contained 200 ng/μl of MBP-A22, 0.05 ng/μl of Factor Xa (New England Biolabs), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After 2–4 h at room temperature, the mixtures were kept on ice until used. HJ-1—The following oligonucleotides were annealed to make an HJ with a 2-bp region of homology (underlined nucleotides) as previously described (30Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K.

Oligonucleotides used to make HJ substrates were gel-purified by electrophoresis through a 12% (20:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 m urea in 1× TBE. Bands were visualized by UV illumination, excised, and oligonucleotides were extracted by soaking minced gel slices in 4 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) overnight at 37 °C with continuous shaking. Oligonucleotides were purified and concentrated using Sep-Pak® C18 cartridges (Waters), dried and resuspended in H20. Prior to annealing, oligonucleotides were 5′-32P end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 1 GBq). Kinase reactions were terminated by phenol/chloroform extraction and unincorporated radiolabel was removed by passing the aqueous phase through G-50 spin microcolumn (Amersham Biosciences). The final HJ product contained one 5′-32P-labeled strand and three unlabeled strands. For 5′-32P-labeled HJ-bm4 and HJ-X12 substrates, annealed products were purified by electrophoresis through a 6% (20:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE. Bands were excised and HJ substrates were extracted by electroelution following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Affinity-purified MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC were further purified by gel filtration as described above using buffer-A with 0.8 m NaCl, concentrated using Centricon plus-20 centrifugal filter units (Millipore), and quantified with the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Reaction mixtures of 20 μl contained ∼1 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled HJ, 10 pmol of MBP-A22, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm MgCl2 (determined to be optimal), 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl. Incubations were for 20 min at 37 °C. Cleavage reactions containing 10 pmol of MBP-RuvC were done identically except that 10 mm MgCl2 was used. Reactions were terminated by addition of a stop solution to give final concentrations of 0.2% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.6 μg/μl proteinase K. After incubating at 37 °C for 20 min, a sucrose loading dye solution was added to give final concentrations of 4% sucrose, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol FF. Cleavage products were evaluated by electrophoresis through a 10% (20:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. To map the positions of HJ cleavage, the products and sequencing ladders of HJ substrates that had been subjected to chemical cleavage (33Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cleavage products and sequencing ladders were then electrophoresed under denaturing conditions through a 12% (20:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 m urea in 1× TBE. Gels were then fixed, dried on Whatman 3M paper, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. A 1.5-base allowance was made to compensate for the nucleoside eliminated in the sequencing reaction. Gel Filtration of MBP-A22—We previously expressed a recombinant form of the A22 protein, with six histidine residues appended to the C terminus, in E. coli and purified the protein by metal affinity chromatography (19Garcia A.D. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the protein was enzymatically active, it was highly aggregated limiting its usefulness for further characterization. To improve its physical properties, A22 was expressed as a 65-kDa polypeptide fused to the C terminus of the MBP. Previous studies showed that similar fusions of MPB with RuvC and CCE1 had no discernible effect on DNA binding or enzymatic activity (34White M.F. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Shah R. Cosstick R. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we also made the corresponding RuvC fusion protein for comparative purposes. The A22 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on an amylose resin and analyzed by gel filtration on a S-300 Sephacryl HR column followed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The fusion protein was highly aggregated at 0.2 m NaCl and eluted in the void volume of the Sephacryl column (not shown). When the NaCl concentration was increased to 0.8 m, however, the protein disaggregated and eluted mostly between 67- and 158-kDa markers consistent with a dimer of 65-kDa polypeptides (Fig. 1A). As a control, we expressed and analyzed a 61-kDa MBP-RuvC fusion protein. The latter eluted from a S-300 Sephacryl column at approximately the same position as MBP-A22, except that some aggregated protein also eluted in the void volume at 0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 1B). The Stokes radii of MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC were calculated to be ∼42.3 Å (36Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of A22 Dimers—Evidence that MBP-A22 exists as a dimer was obtained by chemical cross-linking. Purified MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC were treated with increasing amounts of EGS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The untreated proteins migrated as expected for monomers in the presence of SDS. In contrast, the major cross-linked species of MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC migrated at positions expected for dimers (Fig. 2). The diminution in intensity of bands at high EGS concentrations can be explained by decreased reactivity to antibody. Sedimentation Velocity and Light Scattering of A22 and RuvC Dimers— Sedimentation velocity and light scattering were used to further investigate the association state of A22. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were attempted but aggregation occurred during the 2–3 days required for this procedure. Sedimentation velocity profiles for MBP-A22 in 0.8 m NaCl are shown in Fig. 3A. The data could be well modeled as a continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution as indicated by a plot of the residuals (Fig. 3B). A single peak at 5.77S was obtained, which corresponds to a molar mass distribution of 130 kDa (Fig. 3C, solid line). Sedimentation data from experiments using 0.9 and 6 μm MBP-A22 could be modeled well as discrete protein species of 115 kDa (not shown). These data indicate that MBP-A22 exists as a dimer with a shape that corresponds hydrodynamically to an ellipsoid with an axial ratio of ∼7:1. Similar results were obtained for MBP-RuvC. The molar mass distribution led to an estimate of 135 kDa for MBP-RuvC (Fig. 3C, dashed line) and sedimentation data acquired at loading concentrations of 0.8 and 5 μm could be globally modeled as discrete species of 138 kDa. This indicates that MBP-RuvC is also present in solution as a dimer with a hydrodynamic friction corresponding to an ellipsoid with an axial ratio of ∼8:1. The slightly higher molar mass estimates for RuvC compared with A22 was attributed to errors in the estimated buoyancy of the former protein due to preferential solvation. For multi-angle light scattering experiments, MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC were purified and stored in buffered 8% glycerol and 0.8 m NaCl to minimize aggregation. The size exclusion chromatography elution profile showed two very well resolved peaks, one corresponding to the dimer component and the other to aggregates (not shown). The light scattering molar mass determinations of MBP-RuvC and MBP-A22 are shown in Fig. 4, panels A and B, respectively. For MBP-A22, we observed a weight average molar mass of 132,700 compared with the theoretical dimer mass of 132,277. The weight-average molar mass of MBP-RuvC was 121,930 compared with the theoretical dimer mass of 122,400. In summary, the biophysical measurement unequivocally demonstrated both MBP-A22 and MBP-RuvC are dimeric in solution and have asymmetric shapes. A22 Binds to HJ DNA as a Dimer—We previously used a gel mobility shift assay to demonstrate that A22 can bind to a synthetic HJ (19Garcia A.D. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we took advantage of the presence of a protease cleavage site between the MBP and A22 domains of the fusion protein to determine whether A22 binds as a monomer or dimer. The method has been used for other HJ resolvases (34White M.F. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Shah R. Cosstick R. West S.C.

The bloodstream form, which causes sleeping sickness in human, is covered by variant surface glycoproteins (VSG), whereas the procyclic form, which resides in the tsetse fly, is covered by procyclins (reviewed in Refs. 1Cross G.A.

T. brucei escapes the immune response of the mammalian host by sequentially expressing structurally different forms of VSG (reviewed in Refs. 1Cross G.A.

Several lines of evidence indicate that VSG coat is critical even in culture. First, knock-out of TbGPI10 or TbGPI12 genes, which are required for the biosynthesis of GPI, can be achieved only when extra TbGPI10 or TbGPI12 genes, respectively, is introduced and those knock-out bloodstream forms cannot lose corresponding episomal genes (5Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T. Sutterlin C. Brun R. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Second, RNAi-mediated inhibition of the expression of the TbGPI8 gene, which encodes a component of GPI transamidase required for the attachment of GPI to VSG, results in cell death with a block in cytokinesis (7Lillico S. Field M.C. Blundell P. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, inhibition of VSG synthesis by RNAi triggers cell cycle checkpoint and causes blocking of cell division at a precytokinesis stage, indicating that VSG protein or transcript is monitored during cell cycle (8Sheader K. Vaughan S. Minchin J. Hughes K. Gull K. Rudenko G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8716-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the tsetse fly gut, procyclins are thought to protect the parasites from digestion (reviewed in Ref. 4Pays E. Nolan D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There are two classes of procyclins, glutamic acid-proline repeat (EP)-procyclins and pentapeptide repeat (GPEET)-procyclins. When EP-procyclin genes were knocked out, the ability of the procyclic form to establish a heavy infection in the tsetse fly was severely affected (9Ruepp S. Furger A. Kurath U. Renggli C.K. Hemphill A. Brun R. Roditi I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The infectivity to tsetse fly was almost completely lost when the TbGPI8 gene was disrupted (7Lillico S. Field M.C. Blundell P. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Nagamune K. Acosta-Serrano A. Uemura H. Brun R. Kunz-Renggli C. Maeda Y. Ferguson M.A. Kinoshita T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results indicate that procyclins are important during the infection of the tsetse fly. On the surface of procyclic forms, in which all procyclin genes or TbGPI8 gene are disrupted, free GPI molecules are expressed (7Lillico S. Field M.C. Blundell P. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Nagamune K. Acosta-Serrano A. Uemura H. Brun R. Kunz-Renggli C. Maeda Y. Ferguson M.A. Kinoshita T. J. Exp.

These free GPI molecules may be important for the viability of these knock-out strains in culture (7Lillico S. Field M.C. Blundell P. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Vassella E. Butikofer P. Engstler M. Jelk J. Roditi I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GPI-anchored proteins are important for the infection and survival of trypanosomes in both life cycle stages (5Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T.

The structures of GPI anchors are different between the bloodstream and procyclic forms (reviewed in Refs. 15Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 16Mehlert A. Zitzmann N. Richardson J.M. Treumann A. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). One prominent difference between the GPI structures of procyclins and VSG is that the inositol moiety of procyclin GPI is modified by a fatty acid, whereas inositol is not acylated in the VSG GPIs (17Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8392-8400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5324-5329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Treumann A. Zitzmann N. Hulsmeier A. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consistent with these structurally different GPIs, the GPI biosynthesis pathways in bloodstream and procyclic forms are different. In both stages, inositol can be acylated during GPI biosynthesis once the first mannose is attached. The inositol acylation is reversible such that the acylated and non-acylated GPI intermediates are in dynamic equilibrium and is a prerequisite for the addition of phosphoethanolamine to the third mannose (19Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Güther M.L. Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In the procyclic form, the inositol remains acylated down to PP1, the final precursor to be attached to proteins (see Fig. 1). In contrast, in the bloodstream form, inositol is acylated up to C′, but the fatty acid is then removed prior to the attachment of GPI to a VSG (19Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The significance of inositol acylation and deacylation during GPI biosynthesis and the physiological significance of the structural difference between procyclins and VSG are not well understood. A GPI inositol deacylase (GPIdeAc) gene has been cloned, and the enzyme activity of an affinity-purified recombinant GPIdeAc has been demonstrated (22Güther M.L. Leal S. Morrice N.A. Cross G.A. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4923-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GPIdeAc knock-out resulted in accumulation of inositol-acylated GPI biosynthetic intermediates. However, some GPI inositol deacylase activity remained in the knock-out mutant, suggesting that at least one other inositol deacylase is present (22Güther M.L. Leal S. Morrice N.A. Cross G.A. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4923-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Güther M.L. Prescott A.R. Ferguson M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14532-14540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a second T. brucei GPI inositol deacylase (GPIdeAc2) based on sequence homology to mammalian GPI inositol deacylase (PGAP1) (24Tanaka S. Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14256-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and shown that GPIdeAc2 is a major GPI inositol deacylase. Our data suggested that the regulation of GPIdeAc2 expression is critical in the life cycle of T. brucei. Cell Culture—Strain 427 procyclic and bloodstream clone 221a T. brucei were used. Single marker bloodstream-form cell (a gift from Dr. G. A. M. Cross, Rockefeller University) (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), co-expressing T7 polymerase, and the Tet repressor, were used for conditional expression of the GPIdeAc2 double-stranded RNA. Bloodstreamform and procyclic-form cells were cultured in HMI-9 medium and SDM-79 medium, respectively, with appropriate drug selection. RNAi and Transfection—To generate the plasmid p2T7TAblue/GPIdeAc2, a 536-bp fragment, corresponding to the C-terminal one-fifth of the GPIdeAc2 gene was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-GGATAATACCGGTCACTGTGTTTGG-3′ and 5′-CAGCACCCAAACAATACGAAAAGAC-3′ and cloned into Eam1105I site of the tetracycline-inducible RNAi vector p2T7TAblue (26Alibu V.P. Storm L. Haile S. Clayton C. Horn D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. D. Horn, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). The sequence of the 536-bp region had no significant homology with other sequences in T. brucei genome data base. For transfection into the bloodstream form via integration into an rDNA spacer region, 2 × 107 log phase cells were electroporated with 50 μg of NotI-linearized p2T7TAblue/GPIdeAc2 plasmid in a total volume of 0.4 ml of cytomix buffer (27Carruthers V.B. Cross G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8818-8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were then selected in a medium containing hygromycin (2.5 μg/ml) exactly following a published procedure (26Alibu V.P. Storm L. Haile S. Clayton C. Horn D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). RNAi was induced by incubation with doxycycline (1 μg/ml) for 48 h. To express GPIdeAc2 in the procyclic form, we cloned GPIdeAc2 into the HindIII- and BamHI-cut expression vector pPPMCS, which was constructed from pHD590 (28Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) by replacing its promoter and luciferase gene with the normal procyclic acidic repetitive protein promoter and the multiple cloning sites (10Nagamune K. Acosta-Serrano A. Uemura H. Brun R. Kunz-Renggli C. Maeda Y. Ferguson M.A. Kinoshita T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After transfection, transfectant cell line was obtained by serial dilution after selection with hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Northern Blot Analysis and Real Time PCR—For the Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Filters were hybridized with a probe corresponding to the 536-bp fragment used for the GPIdeAc2 RNAi construct. A fragment of the α-tubulin gene was used as a loading control. For real time PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen), reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen), and analyzed using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and ABI sequence detection systems (ABI PRISM 7000). GPI Biosynthesis Analysis—Hypotonic cell lysate was prepared as described previously, except that the tunicamycin treatment was omitted (29Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Frozen cell lysate was thawed and washed twice with 10 volumes of HKMTL buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin) by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The membrane pellet was suspended at 109 cell equivalents/ml with HKMTL buffer supplemented with 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.8 μg/ml tunicamycin. To radiolabel GPI mannose residues, the membranes were incubated with GDP-[3,4-3H]Man (DuPont, 20 μCi/ml) and 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc for 60 min at 37 °C (bloodstream form) or 27 °C (procyclic form). The reaction was terminated by adding CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) to give a final ratio of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v). The lipids were extracted for 1 h, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were dried under a stream of nitrogen and lipids were resuspended by adding 150 μl each of n-butanol-saturated water and water-saturated n-butanol. After centrifugation, the organic upper phase was saved, and the lower aqueous phase was re-extracted with 100 μl of water-saturated n-butanol. The combined butanol phase was back-extracted with 100 μl of n-butanol-saturated water, and the final butanol phase was then dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. Dried lipids were resuspended in 20 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v) for application to TLC on high performance TLC silica gel 60 (Merck). TLC plates were developed with the same solvent. For autoradiography, the plates were exposed to an image plate and developed by an image analyzer (BAS-2500, Fuji). Enzymatic Digestions—For GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) digestion, glycolipids were incubated overnight with 20 μl of human serum as the enzyme source, mixed with 150 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. For the PLA2 treatment, incubation was in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate containing 250 units/ml of Crotalus adamanteus PLA2 (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment was conducted in 25 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.2% Triton X-100 containing 2 units/ml of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC (Molecular Probes) for 4 h at 37 °C. For α-mannosidase treatment, incubations were performed in 25 μlof 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 0.1% taurodeoxycholate with 50 units/ml jack bean α-mannosidase (JBαM)(Sigma) overnight at 37 °C. After each treatment, lipids were extracted by n-butanol-water partition. Microscopy and Flow Cytometry—For Hoechst staining, 1 × 106 cells were fixed overnight in methanol at –20 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes). After centrifugation, cells were washed again with phosphate-buffered saline, placed on glass slides, and mounted with PermaFluor solution (Immunon, Pittsburg, PA). For cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining and FACS, we followed exactly the published method (30Hammarton T.C. Clark J. Douglas F. Boshart M. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22877-22886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). FACS analysis of EP-procyclins was also performed as described previously (5Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T. Sutterlin C. Brun R. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10336-10341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase Analysis of Procyclins—Procyclic cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and were resuspended at 108 cells/ml in SDM-79 without proline supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum. [14C]Proline (Amersham Biosciences) was added (10 μCi/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 27 °C. The chase was initiated by 10-fold dilution with prewarmed complete SDM-79 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and continued for 19 h. At each time point, 1.0 ml of culture was centrifuged, and the supernatant and the cell pellet were separated. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.2-μm pore membrane to eliminate residual parasites. Cell pellets were solubilized in 1.0 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (31Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These samples were precleared by mixing with 20 μl of 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose and gently rotating for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, EP procyclins were immunoprecipitated by incubating with 10 μg of anti-EP procyclin monoclonal antibody (Cedarlane Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) or an isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by mixing with 20 μl of a 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose and gently rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. EP procyclins were analyzed by 10–20% gradient gel SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Trans-sialidase Assay—Trans-sialidase activity was assessed by measuring hydrolysis of a fluorogenic substrate, 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma) (32Schenkman S. Pontes de Carvalho L. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In brief, the enzyme was incubated with 0.5 mm substrate in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) at 28 °C in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), and the fluorescence was measured with a Fluoroskan II microplate reader (Labsystems, Flow Laboratories Inc.). One unit of enzyme is defined as the activity to hydrolyze 1 μmolofthe substrate in 1 min. Cloning the GPIdeAc2 Gene Homologous to Mammalian GPI Inositol Deacylase—We used the amino acid sequence of rat PGAP1 to identify a gene encoding a GPI inositol deacylase in the T. brucei genome data base (BLAST). We found an open reading frame Tb927.3.2610 with BLAST search and amplified its homologue with 99% nucleotide sequence identity from T. brucei 427 genomic DNA. We named this gene GPIdeAc2 (DDBL/GenBank/EMBL accession number AB219559). The GPIdeAc2 open reading frame encoded a protein of 815 amino acids, which had an ∼50-amino-acid extension at the N terminus compared with PGAP1 (supplemental Fig. 1). The yeast PGAP1 homologue Bst1p had a similar N-terminal extension compared with PGAP1 (24Tanaka S. Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14256-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). There is a second methionine at position 35 within the extension in GPIdeAc2. We chose the first methionine rather than the second as the initiation site because the sequences of the extensions in GPIdeAc2 and Bst1p had some homology (sequence not shown). GPIdeAc2 had 20.3% amino acid identity to rat PGAP1 (supplemental Fig. 1) and 20.6% to Bst1p. An alignment of the PGAP1 and GPIdeAc2 sequences showed a conserved esterase/lipase/thioesterase motif with a catalytic serine (InterPro IPR00379) (supplemental Fig. 1). Hydropathy profiles of GPIdeAc2 and PGAP1 were similar, having a large hydrophilic region with the catalytic serine followed by multiple transmembrane regions (data not shown). Transcript Levels of GPIdeAc2 in Procyclic and Bloodstream Forms—We compared the mRNA levels of GPIdeAc2 in procyclic and blood-stream forms using Northern blots and real time PCR. A 2.4-kb transcript, which corresponded to the length of the GPIdeAc2 gene, was expressed at a six times higher level in the bloodstream form than in the procyclic form (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this result, the mRNA level of GPIdeAc2 determined using real time PCR was six times higher in the bloodstream form than in the procyclic form (Fig. 2B). The high expression of GPIdeAc2 mRNA in the bloodstream form coincides with the deacylated structure of VSG GPI in the bloodstream form, whereas the low expression of GPIdeAc2 mRNA in the procyclic form coincides with the usage of acylated inositol in procyclin GPI. Thus, the transcript profile of GPIdeAc2 is consistent with the inositol acylation and deacylation status of GPI. Acylated GPI Intermediates Accumulated in the Presence of GPIdeAc2 RNAi in the Bloodstream Form—To determine whether GPIdeAc2 mediates GPI inositol deacylation in the bloodstream form, we used RNAi to reduce the expression of GPIdeAc2. After induction of RNAi by doxycycline for 48 h, we examined the mRNA levels of GPIdeAc2 and α-tubulin (a loading control) by Northern blot analysis. The induction of RNAi caused a ∼70% decrease in the GPIdeAc2 mRNA level (Fig. 3A). Then, we examined whether the suppression of GPIdeAc2 affected the synthesis of GPI precursors. After induction of RNAi for 48 h, cell lysates were prepared and incubated with GDP-[3H]mannose to label GPI biosynthetic intermediates. Lipid extracts were treated with GPI-PLD and PI-PLC prior to TLC. GPI-PLD cleaves all GPI intermediates (data not shown). PI-PLC cleaves GPI intermediates without inositol acylation, whereas it does not cleave inositol-acylated GPI. One distinctive band was seen in GPIdeAc2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3B, lane 7, arrow) and its Rf value was consistent with glycolipid C′. This species was sensitive to GPI-PLD (lane 10) but resistant to PI-PLC (lane 8), indicating that it was inositol-acylated GPI. It was also resistant to JBαM digestion, indicating that the non-reducing terminal mannose was protected by an ethanolamine phosphate group (Fig. 3C, lanes 7 and 8, arrow). Based on these results, we concluded that the accumulated GPI was indeed glycolipid C′ (EtNP-Man3GlcN-(acyl)-PI) (see Fig. 1). Concomitant with glycolipid C′ accumulation, the amount of glycolipid A′ (EtNP-Man3GlcN-PI) decreased to ∼50% of control in the GPIdeAc2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3B, compare lane 5 with 7). Furthermore, the amount of glycolipid θ was also decreased, and the inositol-acylated form of θ (termed lyso-C′) (19Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Morita Y.S. Acosta-Serrano A. Buxbaum L.U. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14147-14154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) accumulated (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8, arrowhead). These results suggested that knockdown of GPIdeAc2 resulted in slower conversion of glycolipid C′ and lyso-C′ to A′ and θ, demonstrating that GPIdeAc2 is involved in GPI inositol deacylation in the bloodstream form. It was also noted that RNAi of GPIdeAc2 caused a nearly complete loss of one glycolipid (double asterisk) and a significant decrease of the other (asterisk) (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 5 versus 7). These fast moving glycolipids may be non-inositol-acylated GPI bearing three or two mannoses. GPIdeAc2 Is Important for the Surface Expression of VSG and Optimal Growth of the Bloodstream Form—We examined the expression of VSG on the surface of the GPIdeAc2 knockdown cells by flow cytometric analysis. Control cells (empty vector transfectants) maintained surface VSG expression after a 48-h induction, whereas GPIdeAc2 knockdown cells showed a 65 ± 15% decrease in the surface expression of VSG, indicating GPIdeAc2 is important for the efficient surface expression of VSG (Fig. 4A). We then examined the growth of the GPIdeAc2 knockdown cells. Cell growth was monitored in the absence or presence of doxycycline for 5 days. GPIdeAc2 knockdown caused a severe inhibition of cell growth, indicating that GPIdeAc2 was essential for optimal growth of the bloodstream form (Fig. 4B). Many morphologically abnormal cells were seen in the GPIdeAc2 knockdown population. They had multiple flagella and multiple nuclei (Fig. 4C). Cell cycle analysis showed that ∼60% of cells were at a stage of 6n or higher (Fig. 4D). Deacylated GPIs Were Produced in the GPIdeAc2 Overexpressing Procyclic Form—As shown in Fig. 2, the mRNA level of GPIdeAc2 was low in the procyclic form consistent with the structural characteristics of procyclin GPI anchors. We next asked whether maintenance of low GPIdeAc2 expression is required for inositol-acylated GPI anchors of procyclins. We stably overexpressed GPIdeAc2 in the procyclic form and examined GPI biosynthesis by incubating cell lysates with GDP-[3H]mannose. If overexpressed GPIdeAc2 mediates GPI inositol deacylation, then the presence of normally inositol-acylated GPI species would be decreased, and deacylated GPI species, such as A′- and θ-like intermediates, which are not usually seen in procyclic cells, would be generated. As expected, the concentration of PP3, which is a major acylated species, was greatly decreased (Fig. 5A, lane 1 versus 3). In addition, the accumulation of two slow migrating glycolipids was seen (Fig. 5A, lane 3, arrow and arrowhead). To characterize these glycolipids, we treated them with PI-PLC (Fig. 5A), PLA2 (Fig. 5B), JBαM (Fig. 5C), and GPI-PLD (Fig. 5D). Both were sensitive to PI-PLC, indicating that these glycolipids were indeed deacylated (Fig. 5A, lane 4). The upper glycolipid (arrow) was sensitive to PLA2 (Fig. 5B, lane 4) and GPI-PLD (Fig. 5D, lane 4) but not JBαM (Fig. 5C, lane 4), indicating that it is an A′-like glycolipid. The other glycolipid (arrowhead) was also sensitive to PI-PLC and GPI-PLD (Fig. 5, A and D, lane 4) but resistant to JBαM (Fig. 5C, lane 4) and PLA2 (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4, arrowhead). Therefore the lower glycolipid is θ-like. These results indicate that inositol deacylation occurred in the procyclic form overexpressing GPIdeAc2 and that maintaining a low expression level of GPIdeAc2 is required for inositol-acylated GPI in the procyclic form. Upon overexpression of GPIdeAc2, two fast migrating glycolipids also accumulated (Fig. 5A, lane 3, asterisk and double asterisk). They were sensitive to PI-PLC (Fig. 5A, lane 4) and JBαM (Fig. 5C, lane 4), indicating that these glycolipids were deacylated forms of early GPI intermediates, such as Man2GlcN-PI and Man3GlcN-PI. These results suggest that GPIdeAc2 can be involved in a dynamic equilibrium between inositol-acylated and non-acylated forms of mannosylated intermediates (Man1–3GlcN(acyl)-PI ⇆ Man1–3GlcN-PI) known to occur in the early steps of GPI biosynthesis (19Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Menon A.K. Schwarz R.T. Mayor S. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9033-9042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPI-anchored Proteins Were Released into the Medium from the GPIdeAc2 Overexpressing Procyclic Form—We examined whether the surface expression of procyclins is affected by overexpression of GPIdeAc2. If the GPI anchors, which contain only a single fatty acid (θ-like), are attached to procyclins such procyclins might be unstably anchored to the plasma membrane. If the GPI with only one fatty acid is not attached to procyclins, procyclins cannot be membrane-bound. Consistent with these possibilities, the surface EP-procyclin expression was significantly decreased in the GPIdeAc2 overexpressing procyclic form (Fig. 6A). To examine the fate of procyclins in the GPIdeAc2-overexpressing cells, EP-procyclins in empty vector or GPIdeAc2 transfectants were pulse-labeled with [14C]proline for 30 min and chased for various times up to 19 h. At each time point, we immunoprecipitated EP-procyclins from the cell lysates and the culture supernatants and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE. In the empty vector transfectant, radiolabeled EP-procyclins were efficiently chased into the mature 50-kDa band, and little was found in the culture supernatants (Fig. 6, B and D). In contrast, in the GPIdeAc2 overexpressing cells, more of the immature ER-form EP-procyclins were found in the cell lysates (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, EP-procyclins were released into the medium and degraded (Fig. 6E). These data together with flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 6A) suggested that the procyclic form lost cell surface EP-procyclins because of release into medium. The release was most likely due to an unstable association of the θ-like GPI anchor with the plasma membrane because EP-procyclins in the transfected cells matured at a similar rate to that of the non-transfected cells with only a minor accumulation of immature species. Taken together, overexpression of GPIdeAc2 is deleterious to the surface expression of EP-procyclins. To see whether the expression of other GPI-anchored proteins was affected by overexpression of GPIdeAc2, we measured the transsialidase activity in the cell lysates and the culture supernatants. A higher trans-sialidase activity was found in the culture supernatant of GPIdeAc2-overexpressing cells than in that of wild-type cells (Fig. 6F, right). The secreted level of the enzyme was comparable to that of TbGPI10 knock-out cells, which secrete non-GPI-anchored transsialidase because of the hydrolysis of its GPI attachment signal by transamidase (10Nagamune K. Acosta-Serrano A. Uemura H. Brun R. Kunz-Renggli C. Maeda Y. Ferguson M.A. Kinoshita T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). TbGPI8 knock-out cells that are defective in GPI transamidase did not secrete trans-sialidase, as expected (10Nagamune K. Acosta-Serrano A. Uemura H. Brun R. Kunz-Renggli C. Maeda Y. Ferguson M.A. Kinoshita T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the pulse-chase experiments showing that EP-procyclins are unstably associated with the membrane of the procyclic form when GPIdeAc2 is overexpressed. In the present study, we have identified a major GPI inositol deacylase, GPIdeAc2, in T. brucei. This finding enabled us to determine the roles of inositol acylation and deacylation in the trypanosome life cycle. Because the inositol-linked acyl chain is removed before fatty acid remodeling and attachment to VSG in bloodstream form, we knocked down GPIdeAc2 and analyzed its effect on the surface expression of VSG and growth of the parasite. The RNAi-mediated decrease of GPIdeAc2 mRNA by 70% caused accumulation of glycolipid C′ and lyso-C′ and concomitant decreases in glycolipids A′ and θ (deacylated intermediates downstream to C′ and lyso-C′), indicating that deacylation of inositol was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3, B and C). Under these conditions, the surface expression of VSG was severely decreased, and growth was nearly completely stopped (Fig. 4). RNAi with knockdown constructs corresponding to two other regions in GPIdeAc2 caused similar accumulation of glycolipid C′ (data not shown). It appeared that the inhibition of inositol deacylation resulted in decreased fatty acid-remodeled GPI that is competent for attachment to VSG and the decreased surface expression of VSG, which in turn caused cessation of growth. We, therefore, demonstrated that deacylation of inositol is critical for VSG-GPI anchor biosynthesis in the bloodstream form. The effect of GPIdeAc2 knockdown on cell cycle progression (Fig. 4, C and D) was similar to that of TbGPI8 knockdown (7Lillico S. Field M.C. Blundell P. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in that cells became multinuclear, multikinetoplast, and multiflagellar. These knockdown phenotypes suggest that the defects in GPI biosynthesis result in the inhibition of cytokinesis while allowing cell cycle progression. In a striking contrast, VSG knockdown triggered a specific cell cycle checkpoint at 2N2K stage resulting in blocking of cell division (8Sheader K. Vaughan S. Minchin J. Hughes K. Gull K. Rudenko G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8716-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In cells with defective GPI biosynthesis, transcription and translation of VSG continue and only post-translational modification by GPI is inhibited. It is, therefore, possible that monitoring system for VSG protein or transcript (8Sheader K. Vaughan S. Minchin J. Hughes K. Gull K. Rudenko G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8716-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) cannot detect the abnormality. In contrast to the bloodstream form, GPI anchors are inositol-acylated in the procyclic form (17Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8392-8400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5324-5329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA level of GPIdeAc2 in the procyclic form is only ∼15% of that in the bloodstream form (Fig. 2), suggesting that GPIdeAc2 is down-regulated during or after differentiation from the bloodstream form to the procyclic form. We forced the expression of GPIdeAc2 in the procyclic form by transfection and assessed its effect on the surface expression of EP-procyclins. Overexpression of GPIdeAc2 caused a nearly 90% decrease in the surface EP-procyclins because of secretion into culture medium (Fig. 6). It was reported that the lipophosphoglycans of Leishmania major, containing lyso-alkyl-PI, are released from the cell surface (35Proudfoot L. Schneider P. Ferguson M.A. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with our interpretation that the secretion of procyclins into the medium from the GPIdeAc2-overexpressing procyclic cells was because of an unstable association of procyclins bearing a single fatty acid chain. Therefore, down-regulation of GPIdeAc2 is critical for generation of the procyclin coat on the procyclic form. These findings together indicate that GPIdeAc2-mediated inositol deacylation must be tightly regulated in the trypanosome life cycle. It was reported that knock-out of another inositol deacylase GPIdeAc led to reduced inositol deacylase activity (22Güther M.L. Leal S. Morrice N.A. Cross G.A. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4923-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GPIdeAc consists of 558 amino acids, which is much smaller than GPIdeAc2 and PGAP1. GPIdeAc has an N-terminal signal peptide but no transmembrane domain, in contrast to GPIdeAc2 and PGAP1, which have multiple transmembrane domains. GPIdeAc is homologous to mammalian acyloxyacyl hydrolase that removes fatty acids from bacterial lipopolysaccharides. GPIdeAc has no significant sequence homology with GPIdeAc2 and PGAP1. GPIdeAc is a non-essential gene and partially accounts for inositol deacylase activity in T. brucei. If GPIdeAc also deacylates glycolipid C′, its activity alone is not sufficient to generate enough amount of glycolipid A′. Alternatively, GPIdeAc may act on other inositol-deacylation reactions. It was reported that there are two pools of glycolipid A, of which only one corresponding to 38% of total glycolipid A is competent for attachment to VSG. Disruption of the GPIdeAc gene resulted in the increase of the VSG-attachment competent pool to 75% of the total, suggesting the presence of complex regulation to VSG-anchor precursor (23Güther M.L. Prescott A.R. Ferguson M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14532-14540Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the GPI biosynthetic pathway of T. brucei, inositol acylation takes place only after the formation of mannosyl-glucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol. The inositol-linked acyl chain can be removed from and added again to any of the three mannosylated intermediates, that is, GPI intermediates bearing one to three mannoses are in dynamic equilibrium between inositol-acylated and -non-acylated species (19Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Güther M.L. Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Menon A.K. Schwarz R.T. Mayor S. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9033-9042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of GPIdeAc2 in the procyclic form caused accumulation of two non-acylated GPI forms bearing two and three mannoses (Fig. 5A, lane 3). Conversely, knockdown of GPIdeAc2 in the bloodstream form caused a decrease in these GPI species (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 7), indicating that these GPIs can be substrates of GPIdeAc2. It is suggested that GPIdeAc2 expressed at a low level in the procyclic form is involved in this equilibrium status. Although GPIdeAc2 is homologous to mammalian PGAP1 sharing the same lipase motif, these two enzymes act with different timing. In trypanosomes, inositol deacylation occurs before attachment to proteins, whereas in mammalian cells, the acyl chain is removed from inositol after attachment to proteins (2Ferguson M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Doerrler W.T. Ye J. Falck J.R. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27031-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As discussed above, GPIdeAc2 acts on various GPI intermediates, suggesting that the biggest structure it recognizes is mannosyl-glucosaminyl-(acyl)-phosphatidylinositol. Because PGAP1 does not deacylate free GPIs, it may additionally recognize the amide linkage between ethanolamine and the C-terminal amino acid. In agreement with this possibility of a structurally larger recognition motif, PGAP1 has a significantly bigger luminal catalytic domain than GPIdeAc2. In conclusion, the present study revealed critical roles of GPIdeAc2 in the life cycle of African trypanosomes and demonstrated that expression of GPIdeAc2 must be tightly regulated. We thank Dr. G.

https://openalex.org/W2071118880,"Good surveillance is key to responding to a bird flu pandemic. Jean-Paul Chretien, David L. Blazes and their colleagues propose a new network of labs modelled on existing military facilities. Avian flu has claimed close on a hundred human victims, mostly infected by contact with birds. If the virus adapts to person-to-person transmission, we could face a 1918-style pandemic. If that is to be avoided, outbreaks in birds and people must be rapidly identified and contained. Developing countries lacking the facilities for this task could be the weak link in our defences. But there is a model at hand that can solve this problem: the US military overseas research laboratories. These have shown their worth in tracking emerging infections, and with the support of donor countries and the World Health Organization, similar ‘field laboratories’ could provide the global surveillance that we need."
https://openalex.org/W2464386497,"The transfer of mannose from GDP-mannonse to exogenous glycopeptides and simple glycosides has been shown to be carried out by calf thyroid particles (Adamany, A. M., and Spiro, R. G. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2830-2841). The present investigation indicates that this mannosylation process is accomplished through two sequential enzymatic reactions. The first involves the transfer of mannose from the sugar nucleotide to an endogenous acceptor to form a compound which has the properties of dolichyl mannosyl phosphate, while in the properties of dolichyl mannosyl phosphate, while in the second reaction this mannolipid serves as the glycosyl donor to exogenous acceptors. The particle-bound enzyme which catalyzed the first reaction utilized GDP-mannose (Km = 0.29 microM) as the most effective mannosyl donor, required a divalent cation, preferably manganese or calcium, and acted optimally at pH 6.3. Mannolipid synthesis was reversed by addition of GDP and a ready exchange of the mannose moiety was observed between [14C]mannolipid and unlabeled GDP-mannose. Exogenously supplied dolichyl phosphate, and to a lesser extent ficaprenyl phosphate, served as acceptors for the transfer reaction. The 14C-labeled endogenous lipid had the same chromatographic behavior as synthetic dolichyl mannosyl phosphate and enzymatically mannosylated dolichyl phosphate. The mannose component in the endogenous lipid was not susceptible to reduction with sodium borohydride and was released by mild acid hydrolysis. Alkaline treatment of the mannolipid released a phosphorylated mannose with properties consistent with that of mannose 2-phosphate. The formation of this compound which can arise from a cyclic 1,2-phosphate indicated, on the basis of steric considerations, that the mannose is present in beta linkage to the phosphate of the lipid. An intermediate role of the mannolipid in the glycosylation of exogenous acceptors was suggested by the observation that addition of dolichyl phosphate to thyroid particles resulted in a marked enhancement of mannose transfer from GDP-mannose to methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside acceptor while the presence of the glycoside caused a decrease in the mannolipid level. The glycosyl donor function of the polyisoprenyl mannosyl phosphate in the second reaction of the mannosylation sequence could be directly demonstrated by the transfer of [14C]mannose from purified endogenous mannolipid to either methyl-alpha-D-mannoside or dinitrophenyl unit A glycopeptides by thyroid enzyme in the presence of Triton X-100. The mannosylation of the glycoside was not inhibited by EDTA whereas the transfer of mannose to glycopeptide was cation-dependent. While dolichyl [14C]mannosyl phosphate, prepared from exogenous dolichyl phosphate, served as a donor of mannose to exogenous acceptor, this function could not be fulfilled by ficaprenyl [14C]mannosyl phosphate. The two-step reaction sequence carried out by thyroid enzymes which leads to the formation of an alpha-D-manno-pyranosyl-D-mannose linkage in exogenous acceptors by transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose through a beta-linked intermediate appears to involve a double inversion of anomeric configuration of this sugar."
https://openalex.org/W2006182849,"Although the m-xylene-responsive σ54 promoter Pu of Pseudomonas putida mt-2, borne by the TOL plasmid pWWO, is one of the strongest known promoters in vivo, its base-line level in the absence of its aromatic inducer is below the limit of any detection procedure. This is unusual because regulatory networks (such as the one to which Pu belongs) can hardly escape the noise caused by intrinsic fluctuations in background transcription, including that transmitted from upstream promoters. This study provides genetic evidence that the upstream-activating sequences (UAS), which serve as the binding sites for the pWW0-encoded XylR protein (the m-xylene-responsive σ54-dependent activator of Pu), isolate expression of the upper TOL genes from any adventitious transcriptional flow originating further upstream. An in vivo test system was developed in which different segments of the Pu promoter were examined for the inhibition of incoming transcription products from an upstream promoter in P. putida and Escherichia coli. Minimal transcription filter ability was located within a 105-bp fragment encompassing the UAS of Pu. Although S1 nuclease assays showed that the UAS prevented the buildup of downstream transcripts, the mechanism seems to diverge from a typical termination system. This was shown by the fact that the UAS did not halt transcription in vitro and that the filter effect could not be relieved by the anti-termination system of λ phage. Because the Pu promoter lies adjacent to the edge of a transposon in pWW0, the preset transcriptional filter in the UAS may isolate the upper TOL operon from undue expression after random insertion of the mobile genetic element in a new replicon.

Although S1 nuclease assays showed that the UAS prevented the buildup of downstream transcripts, the mechanism seems to diverge from a typical termination system. This was shown by the fact that the UAS did not halt transcription in vitro and that the filter effect could not be relieved by the anti-termination system of λ phage. Because the Pu promoter lies adjacent to the edge of a transposon in pWW0, the preset transcriptional filter in the UAS may isolate the upper TOL operon from undue expression after random insertion of the mobile genetic element in a new replicon. Bacterial promoters form part of regulatory networks through which signals are propagated faithfully from one member to the next (1Hooshangi S. Thiberge S. Weiss R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 2Pedraza J.M. van Oudenaarden A. Science. 2005; 307: 1965-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This course of events is frequently affected by fluctuations brought about by variations in the pool of housekeeping regulatory proteins (the most common of which is RNAP 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; UAS, upstream-activating sequences; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; IHF, integration host factor; RT, reverse transcriptase; 3MBA, 3-methylbenzyl alcohol; nt, nucleotide. 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; UAS, upstream-activating sequences; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; IHF, integration host factor; RT, reverse transcriptase; 3MBA, 3-methylbenzyl alcohol; nt, nucleotide. and its σ factors) as well as by changes in environmental conditions (3Xia Y. Yu H. Jansen R. Seringhaus M. Baxter S. Greenbaum D. Zhao H. Gerstein M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1051-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Rao C.V. Wolf D.M. Arkin A.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 5Elowitz M.B. Levine A.J. Siggia E.D. Swain P.S. Science. 2002; 297: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Although noise is intrinsically associated with molecular events involving few components, how cells keep regulatory noise within limits is still unknown (4Rao C.V. Wolf D.M. Arkin A.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Although cells may occasionally gain from the biological consequences of random fluctuations in gene expression, noise may end up destroying biological circuits. However, bacteria appear to control noise in natural gene networks and thus avoid regulatory and metabolic chaos (1Hooshangi S. Thiberge S. Weiss R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 2Pedraza J.M. van Oudenaarden A. Science. 2005; 307: 1965-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Although some cellular mechanisms can tolerate transcriptional noise, the same may be detrimental in scenarios in which carefully coordinated gene community behavior is necessary. For example, regulatory circuits that control the expression of metabolic programs for the biodegradation of pollutants in soil bacteria require the suppression of transcriptional noise if these organisms are to survive initial exposure (6Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). How cells organize their transcriptional response can be examined by analyzing the biodegradation of m-xylene by Pseudomonas putida mt-2, a function encoded by the catabolic TOL plasmid pWW0 which it carries (7Ramos J.L. Marques S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Individual cells failing to demonstrate the required catabolic ability at any given time or location are surely displaced by fitter members of a community (8Delgado A. Duque E. Ramos J.L. Microb. Releases. 1992; 1: 23-28PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ramos J.L. Duque E. Ramos-Gonzalez M.I. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 260-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When P. putida mt-2 is challenged with m-xylene in the medium, much of the available transcriptional machinery is reassigned to allow the bacterium to endure this general stress (10Velazquez F. Parro V. de Lorenzo V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 57: 1557-1559Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 79Dominguez-Cuevas P. Gonzalez-Pastor J.E. Marques S. Ramos J.L. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 10.1074/jbc.m509848200PubMed Google Scholar). In theory this could reduce the availability of the RNAP and other transcription factors necessary for expression of the xyl genes borne by plasmid pWW0, thereby making the corresponding catabolic promoters more sensitive to cell-to-cell variations. However, this is not the case because TOL genes seem to be equally expressed in all cells under these conditions (11Moller S. Sternberg C. Andersen J.B. Christensen B.B. Ramos J.L. Givskov M. Molin S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 721-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These features of the TOL plasmid prompted us to examine in more detail the aspects of the catabolic promoters that might be related to noise suppression. A remarkable feature of this system is the blend of extraordinary transcriptional capacity with an extremely low basal expression of Pu, the main m-xylene-responsive promoter of pWW0 (Fig. 1). Although the output of β-galactosidase from a chromosomal Pu-lacZ fusion reaches 10,000-15,000 Miller units in P. putida cells exposed for a short time to m-xylene, promoter activity in noninduced cells is below the detection limits of this reporter (12Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Perez-Martin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pu belongs to the class of promoters that depends on the alternative σ factor, σ54, and is activated at a distance by the toluene-responsive activator XylR (13Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Devos D. Garmendia J. de Lorenzo V. Valencia A. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This involves the binding of the regulator to upstream-activating sequences (UAS) and the looping out of the complex into close proximity to the σ54-containing form of RNA polymerase bound to the -12/-24 region of the promoter. This event is assisted by the binding of the integration host factor (IHF) to the region between the UAS and the σ54 RNAP attachment site (Fig. 1). This facilitates contact between distant proteins and aids in the recruitment of σ54-RNAP to -12/-24 (15Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Macchi R. Montesissa L. Murakami K. Ishihama A. De Lorenzo V. Bertoni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27695-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, IHF enhances the specificity of Pu for its legitimate activator XylR (17Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7277-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). During the course of experiments on the expression of plasmid-encoded proteins in maxicells, it was noticed that the Pu promoter is endowed with the capacity to stop transcription that originated upstream (18Harayama S. Rekik M. Wubbolts M. Rose K. Leppik R.A. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5048-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At that time, however, the phenomenon was not understood, other than being a nuisance when trying to determine the gene content of different fragments of pWW0, and it was given no biological significance. In this work, we address in detail the ability of the Pu promoter to inhibit readthrough transcription from upstream promoters. The results show that this activity can be traced to an ∼100-bp DNA sequence that spans the binding site for the activator protein XylR. Moreover, the mechanism of inhibition is unlike a typical transcription termination event. It is also argued that such an effect is instrumental in protecting the regulatory sub-network of the TOL system from the transcriptional noise of the host. Strains, Plasmids, and General Methods—P. putida KT2442, a rifampicin-resistant derivative of the reference P. putida strain KT2440 (19Regenhardt D. Heuer H. Heim S. Fernandez D.U. Strompl C. Moore E.R. Timmis K.N. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was used as a host for the reporter DNA segments indicated in each case. Escherichia coli CC118 (Δara-leu araD lacX74 galE galK phoA thi1 rpsE rpoB argE-Am recA1; see Ref. 20de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6568-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) was employed as a genetically reliable host for in vivo transcription assays. Two derivatives of this strain were used for different purposes: E. coli CC118 Pu-lacZ, with its chromosomal insertion of mini-Tn5 Sm Pu-lacZ, was used to monitor the activity of the Pu promoter in single copy gene dosage by measuring the output of β-galactosidase (21de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and E. coli CC118 λpir (22de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) was used as a recipient for all mini-transposon delivery vectors with a π protein-dependent R6K origin of replication. The mobilizing strain E. coli S17-1 λpir (22de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) was used for conjugal transfer. This strain expresses the replication π protein as well as the tra genes of the broad host range plasmid RP4 (which encodes functions for conjugal transfer of plasmids endowed with an oriT sequence; see Ref. 22de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The plasmids used in this work were as follows: pUG11 (a kind gift of C. Kane), which consists of the N gene of the λ phage under the control of the left promoter (PLλ), cloned in vector pUC18; pCI857, a Kmr plasmid derived from pMC931 (i.e. it has a p15A origin of replication) in which the thermosensitive variant of the λ repressor is expressed through its own native promoter (23Remaut E. Tsao H. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 22: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar); and pFHR, a derivative of the Cmr monocopy vector pVDL8 (24Cebolla A. Guzman C. de Lorenzo V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 214-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has a 1.9-kb segment of the TOL plasmid spanning the xylR gene downstream of its native promoter Pr. Predictions of secondary mRNA structures were generated with the mfold program (25Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10151) Google Scholar). Assembly of Hybrid Mini-transposons—Recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described previously (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the DNA segments from Pu employed for the various constructs described below, all derived from pCG2Pu (27Carmona M. Fernandez S. Rodriguez M.J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 187: 125-134Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), an Apr ori ColE1 ori M13 phagemid derived from vector pCG2 containing an EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pEZ9 (21de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) spanning positions -211 to +107 of the promoter. The U-containing, single-stranded pCG2Pu DNA was employed as the substrate for the introduction of new EcoRI sites at locations -44 (pFH14), -106 (pFH15), and both -158 and -106 (pFH23) by using the method of Kunkel et al. (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). Digestion of these plasmids with EcoRI gave rise to the various Pu fragments shown in Fig. 1: UAS/IHF, UAS-DP, UAS-P, and UAS-D. Each of these was separately cloned at the single EcoRI site in the lacZ vector pUJ8 (20de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6568-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were then digested with NotI, which released fragments encompassing each of the Pu inserts followed by an intact trp::lacZ reporter and a T7 terminator. A hybrid Kmr mini-transposon delivery plasmid was then constructed based in vector pCNB5 (29de Lorenzo V. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In this plasmid the single NotI site is downstream of the strong hybrid trp/lac promoter, Ptrc, accompanied in cis by lacIq (thereby allowing the expression unit to be induced by IPTG), all assembled within the boundaries of a mini-Tn5. The NotI fragments from the pUJ8 derivatives described above were then inserted at the single NotI site in pCNB5, thereby generating a succession of functional elements as follows: lacIq/Ptrc → UAS → trp::lacZ → tT7. The designations of the resulting transposon delivery plasmids were pFH19C (control, pCNB5::Ptrc → lacZ), pFH19 (pCNB5::Ptrc → UAS/DP → lacZ), pFH36 (pCNB5::Ptrc → UAS-D → lacZ), and pFH37 (pCNB5::Ptrc → UAS-P → lacZ). At various stages of the process, automated DNA sequencing in an Applied Biosystems device verified the inclusion of the cloned inserts and DNA fragments. Mobilization and Transposition—To generate P. putida and E. coli strains carrying the reporter DNA segments specified in each case, each of the pCNB5 derivatives mentioned above was transformed into the mobilizing bacterial strain E. coli S17-1 λpir and then passed by conjugation into the target cells using a filter-mating technique (21de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After 8 h of incubation at 30 °C on LB plates, the cells were washed with 10 mm MgSO4 and plated on either M9 citrate medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin for Pseudomonas or LB with 50 μg/ml rifampicin and kanamycin for E. coli. Exconjugants were then screened for the lacZ+phenotype accompanied by the loss of the piperacillin/ampicillin marker to confirm the correct insertion of the reporter construct in the mini-transposon vector (21de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The result was the insertion of the mini-Tn5 vectors with the built in functional segments indicated in Fig. 2 (top) into the chromosome of either P. putida KT2442 or E. coli CC118. The designations of the resulting strains were as follows: P. putida 19C (control, KT2442::mini-Tn5 Km [lacIq Ptrc → lacZ]), P. putida 19 (KT2442::mini-Tn5 Km [lacIq Ptrc → UAS/DP → lacZ]), P. putida 36 (KT2442::mini-Tn5 Km [lacIq Ptrc → UAS-D → lacZ]), P. putida 37 (KT2442::mini-Tn5 Km [lacIq Ptrc → UAS-P → lacZ]). The corresponding insertions in E. coli CC118 originated strains CC118-19C, CC118-19, CC118-36, and CC118-37. The organization of such insertions (Figs. 2 and 3) shields the reporter cassettes from readthrough transcription from upstream and downstream host promoters, thus minimizing positional effects on the mobile element.FIGURE 3Inhibition of readthrough transcription by the UAS of Pu in the presence or absence of the cognate binding factor XylR. The E. coli CC118 derivatives employed in the experiments of (panels a-d) have chromosomal insertions of the hybrid mini-Tn5 Km transposon (top), which bear the UAS/DP segment (Fig. 1) containing the entire UAS between Ptrc and trp::lacZ (see “Materials and Methods”). In addition, the strains used in c and d were transformed with the single-copy xylR+ plasmid pFHR. Bacteria were grown at 30 °C in LB medium to an A600 of ∼0.5, at which point 1 mm IPTG was added. In panel d, 1 mm of 3MBA, an inducer of XylR, was also added. Accumulation of β-galactosidase was measured 4 h later. Panel e shows a control experiment in which E. coli CC118, Pu-lacZ transformed or not with pFHR, was grown and induced under the same conditions as represented in panels a-d. Note that in panels b-d, the reporter strain is insensitive to the presence of XylR and 3MBA, whereas Pu becomes strongly induced under the same conditions in E. coli CC118 Pu-lacZ (pFHR) in panel e. XylR is represented in the top diagram as a hexamer binding the UAS in the chromosome of the different strains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Construction of Plasmids for Anti-termination Assays—The test plasmids for examining N-mediated anti-termination were assembled in vector pVTR-A (30Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This is a single-copy Cmr plasmid in which a lacIq plus the hybrid trp/lac promoter, Ptrc, is followed by a multiple cloning site. pVTR-A was digested with BamHI and SalI and a BglII-SalI DNA fragment from pIZ820 (31Macian F. Perez-Roger I. Armengod M.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) containing the fusion galK::lacZ inserted as a reporter. This gave rise to the reference plasmid pK1 (lacIq Ptrc → galK::lacZ). A 180-bp segment of Pu spanning the UAS and the IHF site (Fig. 1) was then amplified by PCR using primers AUAS-L (5′-GCCCGGGTACCCGCGATGAACCTT-3′) and AUAS-R (5′-GCTTATACCGATC CCGGGTTTCA-3′) (restriction sites in bold). This added flanking KpnI and XmaI ends to the PCR fragment, which was then inserted at the corresponding sites of pK1, generating pL1. Alternatively, a synthetic TR2 λ phage terminator (32Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 33Wilson K.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) was produced by hybridizing oligonucleotides TER-A (5′-AATTCAATAACAGGCCTGCTGGTAATCGCAGGCCTTTTTATTTGGT-3′) and TER-B (5′-AATTACCAAATAAAAAGGCCTGCGATTACCAGCAGGCCTGTTATTG-3′). The resulting 46-bp linker contained the TR2 terminator sequence flanked by one downstream AATT overhang (compatible with EcoRI but unable to regenerate this restriction site upon ligation) and a genuine upstream EcoRI site. Subsequent cloning of this linker at the single EcoRI site of pL1 gave rise to pK2, which keeps a free EcoRI site between Ptrc and the TR2 terminator. The λ phage nut sequence (35Das A. Wolska K. Cell. 1984; 38: 165-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36DeVito J. Das A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8660-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was amplified with primers NutL (5′-GGAATTCCTAATAACCCCGCTCTTACA-3′) and NutR (5′-GGAATTCCTGGTTTAATTTGATGCCCT-3′) as a 69-bp EcoRI fragment (55 bp corresponding to nut). This fragment was subsequently cloned into pK2 and pL1, originating test plasmids pK3 (lacIq Ptrc → nut → λ-TR2 → galK::lacZ) and pL1N (lacIq Ptrc → nut → UAS/DP → galK::lacZ), respectively. Growth and Induction Conditions—Unless indicated, bacteria were cultured at 30 °C in rich LB medium supplemented, when required, with ampicillin (150 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), or kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Typical induction experiments consisted of growing the cells under study to an absorbance of 0.05-0.5 at 600 nm (A600). At this point, 0.1-1.0 mm IPTG was added, and when specified, the growth temperature was raised to 42 °C. Where indicated, 1 mm of the upper TOL pathway inducer 3-methylbenzyl alcohol (3MBA) was added to the cultures. Four hours after induction, P. putida and E. coli cells were collected, permeabilized with chloroform and SDS, and subjected to β-galactosidase assays (79Dominguez-Cuevas P. Gonzalez-Pastor J.E. Marques S. Ramos J.L. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 10.1074/jbc.m509848200PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the output of the lacZ fusions under the conditions mentioned in each case. The linearity of the assay within the range of cell densities and the development of the reaction with o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside were verified in all cases. The β-galactosidase activity values given throughout this paper are the mean of at least three independent experiments conducted in duplicate (deviations ≤15%). In Vitro Transcription Assays—The DNA fragments for transcription in vitro were generated by amplification of relevant portions of pFH19C (no UAS), pFH19 (UAS/DP), and pFH36 (UAS-D) with oligonucleotides TER2 (5′-CACTCCCGTTCTGGATAATG-3′) and TER3 (5′-CACGATGCGTCCGGCGTAGA-3′). These primers hybridized 51 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of the Ptrc promoter and immediately downstream of the BamHI, respectively, which precedes the reporter trp::lacZ gene (see above). The resulting fragments were purified and used as linear DNA templates at a concentration of 20 ng/ml in transcription reactions performed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 following a standard technique (37Meiklejohn A.L. Gralla J.D. Cell. 1985; 43: 769-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cold ATP, CTP, and GTP were added to the reaction mixture at a concentration of 10 mm; UTP was used at only 1 mm. The cold NTPs and the DNA were mixed in a volume of 25 μl, and 1 μl of RNasin (10 units/μl) and 1 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were added. Four units of E. coli RNA polymerase (a kind gift from F. Rojo) were then added, and the reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Heparin (10 μg/ml) was added and the incubation continued for 2 min to complete ongoing transcription rounds. Finally, the reactions were stopped with 25 μl of TE buffer, 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 1 μl of 10 μg/μl carrier tRNA. Samples were filtered through 1 ml of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with TE buffer and precipitated with ethanol. The sediment was resuspended in loading buffer with 90% formamide and electrophoresed in a denaturing 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel, and the transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. S1 Nuclease Assays—The method described by Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used for extracting total RNA from E. coli cells. The RNA was treated with DNase to eliminate any DNA contamination and further treated with phenol/chloroform treatment to eliminate residues of the enzyme. To produce the labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe used in the experiments, plasmid pK1 (see above) was cleaved with XmaI, hybridized with the oligonucleotide LacS1 (5′-GGTGTGAGTGGCAGGGTAGCC-3′) labeled at the 5′ end with 32P, and subjected to 30 cycles of linear amplification with Taq polymerase, similar to the procedure described by Ding et al. (38Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because the 5′ end of the labeled primer binds 63 nucleotides downstream of the galK::lacZ fusion, the ssDNA produced by the amplification spanned positions -245 (5′ end) to +63 (3′ end) of the galK::lacZ coding sequence. For the S1 nuclease protection assays, 50 μg of RNA from each sample were hybridized with an excess of the labeled ssDNA probe, digested with S1, and processed as described by Ausubel et al. (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Samples were loaded onto a DNA sequencing gel with 7 m urea, run at high voltage, and dried. Autoradiographic images were acquired on x-ray film. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Two micrograms of total RNA extracted from the E. coli cells under analysis were retrotranscribed using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). 10-Fold serial dilutions of the resulting product were used as templates for a standard PCR with primers PSREV (5′-ATGAGCTGTTGACAATTAATCATC-3′) and GALK (5′-CGGTGGCGGAGCGCAGCAGAGG-3′). These hybridize just downstream of the Ptrc promoter and the leading sequence of the reporter gene, respectively, thereby amplifying transcript segments from pK1 (147 bp), pK3 (262 bp), and pL1N (373 bp). The PCR was set at 30 cycles of 30 s at 90 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C followed by a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. The UAS of the Pu Promoter Inhibited Readthrough Transcription— Initial observations on the ability of the whole σ54 Pu promoter of the TOL plasmid, or parts of it, to impede the progress of upstream transcripts were made in maxicells (18Harayama S. Rekik M. Wubbolts M. Rose K. Leppik R.A. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5048-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these assays, DNA sequences downstream of the native SmaI site at -205 bp from the transcription initiation site of Pu (Fig. 1) altogether prevented the expression of genes from a PL promoter of λ phage artificially placed upstream. Although little importance was given at that time, this prompted us to re-examine the phenomenon from a fresh perspective. Experiments were therefore performed to confirm this fact and to trace its origin to a minimum of elements. For this, we created new EcoRI sites at several places in the DNA sequence encompassing the Pu promoter, from its SmaI site (-205) all the way down to the HaeIII site at + 93. This generated four main EcoRI segments designated UAS/IHF (167 bp, including the UAS for the cognate activator of Pu, the XylR protein, and the IHF site), UAS-DP (105 bp, containing both the distal UAS-D and the proximal UAS-P), UAS-P (52 bp, the proximal UAS only), and UAS-D (53 bp, the distal UAS-only). Each of these fragments was cloned in front of a promoterless lacZ gene and placed downstream of an IPTG/lacIq-controlled Ptrc promoter within a mini-Tn5 transposon vector. The resulting DNA segments gave rise to a reporter system (Fig. 2, top) consisting of the DNA under examination placed between a strong IPTG-inducible promoter and lacZ. As explained below, this provided a dependable genetic test for the inhibition of incoming transcription from Ptrc by DNA sequences located between the promoter and the β-galactosidase gene. By using these constructs, attempts were made to certify the expression inhibition phenomenon observed in P. putida and to verify its schoichiometry (single-copy gene dosage). Each of the hybrid mini-transposons bearing the Pu portions mentioned above were separately inserted into the chromosome of P. putida KT2442, along with a control devoid of Pu. The resulting strains were then subjected to β-"
