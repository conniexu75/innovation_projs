https://openalex.org/W1559975799,"A highly purified glycopeptide with potent phytohemagglutinin (PHA) receptor site activity has been isolated from human erythrocyte membranes. The glycopeptide was released from the membranes by trypsin, treated with alkaline borohydride, and purified by repeated gel filtration, further proteolytic digestion with Pronase, and diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography. It has a molecular weight of approximately 2000 and the following composition (in residues): sialic acid, 1; galactose, 2; mannose, 2; N-acetylglucosamine, 3; aspartic acid, 1.5; serine, 1; and threonine, 1. The sequence of the carbohydrate residues in the oligosaccharide chain was determined by sequential cleavage of the sugars from the nonreducing end with specific glycosidases. The glycopeptide has a single branched oligosaccharide chain containing two nonreducing termini, one with the composition galactose (β)/→ N-acetylglucosamine and the other with sialic acid → galactose (β)/→ N-acetylglucosamine. Each branch is connected to the inner core which contains 2 mannose and 1 N-acetylglucosamine residues. Since the oligosaccharide chain was not released from the trypsin fragment during the alkaline borohydride treatment, it is probably linked to the peptide backbone by an N-acetylglucosaminylasparagine linkage. Removal of the sialic acid residue does not affect PHA-inhibitory activity. When the galactose residues are removed, 90% of the PHA-inhibitory activity is lost. Model compounds having the terminal sequences galactose (β)/→ N-acetylglucosamine have very poor PHA-inhibitory activity unless they also have mannose residues in their interior, showing that the inner core sugars can influence PHA-inhibitory activity. The peptide backbone of the glycopeptide also affects the PHA-inhibitory activity of the oligosaccharide chain since higher molecular weight glycopeptides extracted from erythrocyte membranes with chloroform-methanol lose 90% of their PHA-inhibitory activity following proteolytic digestion with trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1557321909,"Abstract The effects of the water-miscible straight chain and branched alcohols and glycols on the native conformation of sperm whale myoglobin, cytochrome c, and α-chymotrypsinogen have been investigated by spectral, difference spectral, and optical rotatory dispersion methods. Based on the midpoints of the denaturation transitions, that is, the amount of alcohol or glycol required to produce 50% denaturation at 25°, it is concluded that the effectiveness of the alcohols as protein denaturants increases with increasing chain length or hydrocarbon content, in conformance of what is expected of the disorganization of the hydrophobic interior of these proteins revealed by their detailed three-dimensional x-ray structure. As a rule, branching of the hydrocarbon portion of the alcohols tends to reduce their effectiveness as protein denaturants. The glycols are found to be less effective than the corresponding alcohols, suggesting that increased polarity or hydrogen-bonding capacity is of secondary importance when compared with the effects of increasing hydrocarbon content. The theories of Peller and Flory, used to account for the effects of denaturants and salts on the temperature transition of proteins and polypeptides, were extended to the analysis of isothermal denaturation data, with appropriate binding and Setschenow parameters based on free energy of transfer data taken from the literature or calculated from N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester solubilities. The denaturation midpoints, Sm, based on the assumption of a hydrophobic mechanism of alcohol-protein side chain interactions, are found to be in satisfactory agreement with the experimentally obtained Sm values. Both the increased hydrophobicity with increasing chain length and the somewhat reduced effectiveness of the alcohols on branching are in most cases correctly predicted. For the straight chain alcohols, fairly satisfactory agreement with the experimental data is also obtained with binding constants based on estimates of free energies of hydrophobic bond formation, obtained by Scheraga and associates using the Nemethy and Scheraga theory of hydrophobic bonding."
https://openalex.org/W1650689982,"Abstract An enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylation of histone by ATP, and is activated by low concentrations of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, has been found in lobster muscle and partially purified. The guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase has been separated from an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase found in the same tissue. The rate of phosphorylation of histone, catalyzed by the guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, was increased about 5-fold by guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate at a concentration of 0.5 µm; the apparent Km of the enzyme was about 0.08 µm for guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate and about 4 µm for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. The apparent Km of the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase isolated from the same tissue was about 0.02 µm for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and about 1.2 µm for guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1562502749,"Abstract The alkaline pH range over which the double stranded circular DNA of the replicative form of the bacterial virus, ϕX174, is reversibly denatured has been determined in order to specify accurately the conditions for a preparative procedure for this DNA based on selective alkali denaturation. The denaturation remains entirely reversible to pH 12.6 at an ionic strength of about 0.25 over a range in which the sedimentation coefficient, after an initial drop, more than doubles. The sharp transition above pH 12.6 in which the denaturation becomes completely irreversible is accompanied by only a small further increase in sedimentation coefficient. Sedimentation-pH titration curves have been determined in detail for the replicative form of ϕX174 (molecular weight 3.4 x 106 daltons) and for the circular DNA of a penicillinase plasmid of Staphylococcus aureus (molecular weight 16.5 x 106 daltons). The latter curve is displaced to a lower pH and the two phase nature of the curve in the range of increasing sedimentation coefficient is markedly accentuated."

The humerus remains approximately perpendicular to the sagittal plane, but the femur is directed anterolaterally at angles from 35 degrees to 50 degrees . In addition to long-axis rotation, the femur elevates and depresses in an arc which usually varies between 40 degrees and 90 degrees . The femoral angle, the femoral elevation and depression, and the plantar contact of the manus beneath the glenoid are features found also in generalized therians."
https://openalex.org/W1574996564,"Abstract Labeled long chain acyl-CoA, aldehyde, and alcohol (16:0) were incubated in the peritoneal cavity of mice bearing Ehrlich ascites cells and the distribution of radioactivity in the acyl, alkyl, and alk-1-enyl moieties of various neutral lipid and phospholipid classes was compared. The results suggested the following metabolic relations. 1. Alkyl glyceryl ethers are precursors of alk-1-enyl glyceryl ethers. Alk-1-enyl acyl phosphoglycerides (plasmalogens) appear to be derived from intact alkyl acyl phosphoglycerides by biodehydrogenation. 2. Fatty acids are precursors of long chain alcohols that serve as precursors of alkyl glyceryl ethers. 3. Aldehydes are less effective precursors of plasmalogens than alcohols. They are oxidized primarily to acids and to a lesser extent are reduced to alcohols. 4. Fatty acids are elongated but the saturated acids are not desaturated to the corresponding monoenoic acids in this neoplasm. 5. Comparison of the data from the three labeled substrates suggests an interrelation that explains how each substrate was incorporated into glyceryl ethers."

https://openalex.org/W1550221562,"Abstract Spinach chloroplasts with intact outer envelopes (Class I) rapidly synthesize oleic and palmitic acids from 14C-acetate in the presence of coenzyme A, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium ion, and light. Light intensity studies reveal a 2-fold stimulation at 10 foot-candles and a 10-fold stimulation at 3000 foot-candles. Very low concentrations of detergents (Triton X-100 at 130 µm concentration) greatly stimulate 14C-acetate incorporation and markedly increase the oleic to palmitic ratio (from 1 to 1.5 to over 11). Low concentrations of ATP (2 mm) return the oleic to palmitic ratio to values of 1 to 1.5. Other nucleoside triphosphates are ineffective. Cyanide (0.1 mm) is only partially inhibitory for oleic acid synthesis. Action spectra studies indicate that 14C-acetate incorporation into fatty acids follows the absorption spectrum of chloroplasts."

https://openalex.org/W1581386753,"Abstract Isotope-exchange rates at chemical equilibrium were determined for the glycogen-α-d-glucopyranose 1-phosphate-Pi system in the presence of phosphorylase a. Exchange of 32P from α-d-glycopyranose 1-phosphate (glucose-1-P) into Pi and exchange of 14C from glucose-1-P into glycogen were followed simultaneously by the use of glucose-1-P containing both isotopes. Concentrations of glucose-1-P and Pi were varied together in their equilibrium ratio at constant glycogen concentration, and the concentration of glycogen was varied at fixed concentrations of phosphates. Exchange rates for the two isotopes were equal under all conditions (with the possible exception of measurements at the highest concentrations of the phosphates) and gave linear reciprocal plots. One exception was noted in which the reciprocal plot was concave upward at low concentrations of substrate, probably because of allosteric effects. The results support a rapid equilibrium mechanism. Initial velocity of the reaction in the absence of product was determined by the use of an isotopic assay. The results were characteristic of a sequential mechanism. Isotope-exchange rates were also determined under nonequilibrium conditions. Exchange of 32P from glucose-1-P into Pi was followed as a function of glycogen concentration at a fixed concentration of glucose-1-P and several fixed concentrations of Pi. The exchange was also followed as a function of glucose-1-P concentration at fixed glycogen concentration and several fixed Pi concentrations. Similar experiments were done while following the exchange from Pi into glucose-1-P. These experiments are equivalent to conventional product inhibition experiments. The results indicate that the two phosphates are noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to glycogen, but are competitive with respect to one another. Our conclusion is that phosphorylase a has a rapid equilibrium Random Bi-Bi mechanism involving binary complexes of enzyme with glycogen, glucose-1-P, and Pi, and ternary complexes of enzyme with glycogen and glucose-1-P and with glycogen and Pi."

From a homogenate of rat liver incubated with dl-mevalonic acid-2-14C-5-3H, squalene, lanosterol, 4,4,14α-trimethyl-5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol, 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol, and cholesterol have been isolated. It is concluded from measurements of the 3H:14C ratios found in these various compounds that the 4α-methyl group of lanosterol is removed before the 4β-methyl group and that the 4α-methyl group of 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol originates as the 4β-methyl group of lanosterol."

https://openalex.org/W1493689585,"Abstract Treatment of adrenal iron-sulfur protein (adrenodoxin) with urea and guanidine HCl results in a deterioration reaction that proceeds through at least two intermediate stages yielding the completely denaturated, colorless protein. The first transient state exhibits a circular dichroism maximum at 470 mµ which is shifted to a longer wave length than that of the native protein (440 mµ); at 470 mµ it has a much smaller ellipticity than the original protein at 440 mµ. The absorption spectrum of this first intermediate is almost identical with the native protein. The second transient state displays no Cotton effect and the optical absorption spectrum is similar to the native protein; the extinction coefficient at 414 mµ is about half that of the untreated protein. The deterioration process of spinach ferredoxin in the presence of urea and guanidine HCl resembles that of adrenal iron-sulfur protein. The reaction also proceeds through an intermediate state, giving rise to a circular dichroism maximum at 470 mµ. The results show that different kinetic profiles of optical activity and optical absorption are involved in the deterioration process of the chromophore in iron-sulfur proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1483367144,"Abstract Particulate enzyme preparations of brain from rats greater than 11 days of age catalyze the synthesis of digalactosyl diglyceride from two common precursors, UDP-galactose and diglyceride. Monogalactosyl diglyceride has been implicated as an intermediate in the reaction. Sodium deoxycholate at optimum concentrations is required for the incorporation of UDP-14C-galactose (uniformly labeled) but not for the incorporation of diglyceride-[1,3-14C-glycerol] or exogenous monogalactosyl diglyceride (uniformly labeled 14C-galactose) into digalactosyl diglyceride. Five structurally related bile salts and a variety of other types of detergents do not effectively substitute for deoxycholate. Sodium deoxycholate, which does not serve as a substrate in this reaction, appears to function as a surface-active adjuvant that promotes an interaction between UDP-galactose, enzyme, and an endogenous monogalactosyl diglyceride. Of seven diglycerides tested some preference is shown for dipalmitin as a substrate. Experiments carried out with specific α- and β-galactosidases suggest that the anomeric carbon atom of the galactose to galactose bond of the galactolipid is of the α-configuration. This α-galactosidic bond appears to be unique to the glycolipids thus far characterized and isolated from the central nervous system. The activity of the biosynthetic enzyme is dependent on the age of the rat from which the brain was taken; it is low or nonexistent before about 11 days, but increases sharply after this time until reaching a peak at 16 to 18 days postpartum. Since the age of most active myelination (about 10 to 20 days) in the rat is coincident with the age of highest enzyme activity, a role in the process of myelination is suggested for the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of digalactosyl diglyceride."
https://openalex.org/W1589744045,"Abstract Modified trinucleotides, 3MeU-A-G+, 3MeU-A-A, 5MeU-A-G, 5MeU-A-A, BrU-A-G, hU-A-G, and U-A-I (see J. Biol. Chem., 241, 527 (1966)), were synthesized by a combination of organic and enzymatic methods. The activity of each trinucleotide as a template for peptide chain termination was determined. The attachment of a methyl group to the N3 position of uracil eliminates the template activity of terminator codons corresponding to release Factors 1 or 2. The attachment of methyl or bromo groups to the C5 position of uracil has little or no effect on the template activity of terminator codons. The trinucleotide U-A-I is an active template with release Factor 1 but not 2. hU-A-G is inactive in the presence of release Factor 1. The data suggest that the N3 proton and the C4 carboxyl moieties are essential for translation of terminator codons, whereas substituents attached to the C5 position are not essential."

https://openalex.org/W1500975862,"Abstract A comparison was made of the kinetic properties of the aminotransferase derived from two his mutants and coded for by the C gene of the histidine operon. The data presented show that, in addition to imidazoleacetol phosphate and l-histidinol phosphate, l-histidine is an effective substrate for the enzyme. One of the mutants, hisEIFAHB612 produces wild type enzyme, the other, hisHB22, produces a protein which is indistinguishable from wild type on the basis of kinetic studies. Since hisHB22 produces extracts of lower specific activity compared to either wild type strains or to other his mutants not defective in C gene function as a result of polar mutations in the operon or to other mutational effects bearing directly on the C gene, we conclude that the different behavior in this strain is related to the number of catalytically active molecules synthesized or maintained."

https://openalex.org/W1517960008,"Abstract Myosin can be labeled with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in frog muscle. The incorporation into myosin is decreased during isotonic contraction. In contrast no difference is found in the incorporation into the sarcoplasmic proteins of contracting and resting muscle. Myosin also reacts with iodoacetate in frog muscle. However, this reaction does not depend on the functional state of the muscle. The reactivity of myosin in contracting muscle follows a similar pattern in model systems. The dinitrophenyl content of myosin isolated from myofibrils dinitrophenylated in the relaxed state is higher than that of myosin from myofibrils dinitrophenylated while contracting. Incorporation of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene into pure frog myosin is greatly increased in the presence of additions which relax myofibrils as compared to the additions which contract the fibrils. With the same additions, frog actin, or myosin-free myofibrillar residues show no change in the dinitrophenylation. Furthermore, the reactivity of contracting and relaxed myofibrils remains the same when 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is substituted by iodoacetate. These data show that 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is a valuable probe to differentiate the functional states of myosin in myofibrils and living muscle."
