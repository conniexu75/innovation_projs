https://openalex.org/W2948426560,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides reveal the electronic phases that emerge when a bulk crystal is reduced to a monolayer1–4. Transition-metal oxide perovskites host a variety of correlated electronic phases5–12, so similar behaviour in monolayer materials based on transition-metal oxide perovskites would open the door to a rich spectrum of exotic 2D correlated phases that have not yet been explored. Here we report the fabrication of freestanding perovskite films with high crystalline quality almost down to a single unit cell. Using a recently developed method based on water-soluble Sr3Al2O6 as the sacrificial buffer layer13,14 we synthesize freestanding SrTiO3 and BiFeO3 ultrathin films by reactive molecular beam epitaxy and transfer them to diverse substrates, in particular crystalline silicon wafers and holey carbon films. We find that freestanding BiFeO3 films exhibit unexpected and giant tetragonality and polarization when approaching the 2D limit. Our results demonstrate the absence of a critical thickness for stabilizing the crystalline order in the freestanding ultrathin oxide films. The ability to synthesize and transfer crystalline freestanding perovskite films without any thickness limitation onto any desired substrate creates opportunities for research into 2D correlated phases and interfacial phenomena that have not previously been technically possible. Ultrathin freestanding crystalline films of transition-metal oxide perovskites are fabricated and transferred to various substrates, proving their potential for exploring emergent 2D correlated phases."
https://openalex.org/W2962116204,"Graphene Oxide (GO) has recently attracted substantial attention in biomedical field as an effective platform for biological sensing, tissue scaffolds and in vitro fluorescence imaging. However, the targeting modality and the capability of its in vivo detection have not been explored. To enhance the functionality of GO, we combine it with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) serving as a biocompatible magnetic drug delivery addends and magnetic resonance contrast agent for MRI. Synthesized GO-Fe3O4 conjugates have an average size of 260 nm and show low cytotoxicity comparable to that of GO. Fe3O4 nanoparticles provide superparamagnetic properties for magnetic targeted drug delivery allowing simple manipulation by the magnetic field and magnetic resonance imaging with high r2/r1 relaxivity ratios of ~10.7. GO-Fe3O4 retains pH-sensing capabilities of GO used in this work to detect cancer versus healthy environments in vitro and exhibits fluorescence in the visible for bioimaging. As a drug delivery platform GO-Fe3O4 shows successful fluorescence-tracked transport of hydrophobic doxorubicin non-covalently conjugated to GO with substantial loading and 2.5-fold improved efficacy. As a result, we propose GO-Fe3O4 nanoparticles as a novel multifunctional magnetic targeted platform for high efficacy drug delivery traced in vitro by GO fluorescence and in vivo via MRI capable of optical cancer detection."
https://openalex.org/W2978793169,"Our current challenge in the management of prosthetic joint infection is the eradication of biofilms which has driven the need for improved antimicrobial agents and regimens. In this study, the antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were investigated for their antimicrobial efficacies against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a microorganism commonly implicated in biofilm-related infections. These antimicrobials were compared to conventional antibiotics and combination treatments with rifampin. Using a Centers for Disease Control reactor, 24 h S. aureus biofilms were formed on cobalt-chromium discs and the anti-biofilm activity was determined by quantifying the amount of colony forming units following treatments. We found that LL-37 was the most efficacious antimicrobial agent with a more than 4 log reduction in colony counts. In comparison, silver nanoparticles and conventional antibiotics were not as efficacious, with a less than 1 log reduction in colony counts. Antimicrobial combination treatments with rifampin significantly increased the log reduction for AgNPs and gentamicin, although still significantly less than LL-37 in isolation. Furthermore, kinetic studies revealed the rapid elimination of S. aureus biofilm with LL-37. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrated that LL-37 was an effective agent against S. aureus biofilms and may have potential clinical applications in the eradication of biofilms and treatment of prosthetic joint infection."
https://openalex.org/W2948596301,"Post-operative surgical site infections (SSI) present a serious threat and may lead to complications. Currently available dressings for SSI lack mucoadhesion, safety, efficacy and most importantly patient compliance. We aimed to address these concerns by developing a bioactive thiolated chitosan-alginate bandage embedded with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) for localized topical treatment of SSI. The FTIR, XRD, DSC and TGA of bandage confirmed the compatibility of ingredients and modifications made. The porosity, swelling index and lysozyme degradation showed good properties for wound healing and biodegradation. Moreover, in-vitro antibacterial activity showed higher bactericidal effect as compared to ZnO-NPs free bandage. In-vivo wound healing in murine model showed significant improved tissue generation and speedy wound healing as compared to positive and negative controls. Over all, thiolated bandage showed potential as an advanced therapeutic agent for treating surgical site infections, meeting the required features of an ideal surgical dressing."
https://openalex.org/W2948846868,"Social Networking Sites (SNS) such as Facebook and Instagram have relocated a large portion of people’s social lives online, but can be intrusive and create social disturbances. Many people therefore consider taking an “SNS vacation.” We investigated the effects of a one-week vacation from both Facebook and Instagram on subjective well-being, and whether this would vary for passive or active SNS users. Usage amount was measured objectively, using RescueTime software, to circumvent issues of self-report. Usage style was identified at pre-test, and SNS users with a more active or more passive usage style were assigned in equal numbers to the conditions of one-week SNS vacation (n = 40) or no SNS vacation (n = 38). Subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect) was measured before and after the vacation period. At pre-test, more active SNS use was found to correlate positively with life satisfaction and positive affect, whereas more passive SNS use correlated positively with life satisfaction, but not positive affect. Surprisingly, at post-test the SNS vacation resulted in lower positive affect for active users and had no significant effects for passive users. This result is contrary to popular expectation, and indicates that SNS usage can be beneficial for active users. We suggest that SNS users should be educated in the benefits of an active usage style and that future research should consider the possibility of SNS addiction among more active users."
https://openalex.org/W2985745974,"To determine if there is an association between sarcopenia, physical function and self-reported fatigue in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).A cross-sectional analysis of measurements from a cohort of 157 participants with OA or RA was performed. The relationship between muscle mass (appendicular muscle index (AMI)), physical function (timed up and go, 30-seconds sit-to-stand test, 40-meter fast-paced walk test and grip-strength) and two fatigue measures (Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) and a fatigue Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)) was explored using hierarchical linear regression or logistic regression with established AMI cut-offs for sarcopenia.There were no significant differences for perceived fatigue-related variables between OA or RA sarcopenic or non-sarcopenic participants. Participants with OA had worse physical function (TUG; P = 0.029, STS; P = 0.004, WS; P = 0.003), but participants with RA had lower grip strength (P<0.001). The RA group had higher CRP (P = 0.006), were more likely to receive glucocorticoids (P<0.001), and experienced worse fatigue (P = 0.050). The hierarchical multiple regression showed that self-reported fatigue (VAS/MAF-distress) had a significant but weak association with AMI in RA. Participants with higher percentage body fat had a significantly stronger association with sarcopenia in both OA and RA.Sarcopenia, when assessed by AMI, does not appear to be strongly associated with self-reported fatigue or physical function in participants with either OA or RA. Higher body fat had a moderately strong association with sarcopenia in this cross-sectional study, suggesting that body composition may be an important factor in the health of patients with longstanding OA or RA."
https://openalex.org/W2956033587,"Animal source foods (ASF) such as dairy, eggs, fish and meat are an important source of high-quality nutrients. Lack of ASF in diets can result in developmental disorders including stunting, anemia, poor cognitive and motor development. ASF are more effective in preventing stunting than other foods and promoting ASF consumption in low- and middle-income countries could help improve health, particularly among pregnant women and young children. Production and consumption of ASF are, however, also associated with potential food safety risks. Strengthening of food control systems, informed by quantitative assessments of the disease burden associated with ASF is necessary to meet global nutrition goals. We present the human disease burden associated with 13 pathogens (bacteria and parasites) in ASF, based on an analysis of global burden of foodborne disease (FBD) estimates of the WHO Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG). The FBD burden of these pathogens was combined with estimates of the proportion of disease transmitted by eight main groups of ASF. Uncertainty in all estimates was accounted for by Monte Carlo simulation. In 2010, the global burden of ASF was 168 (95% uncertainty interval (UI 137–219) Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 population, which is approximately 35% of the estimated total burden of FBD. Main pathogens contributing to this burden included non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Taenia solium, and Campylobacter spp. The proportion of FBD burden associated with ASF varied considerably between subregions and between countries within subregions. Likewise, the contribution of different pathogens and ASF groups varied strongly between subregions. Pathogens with a localized distribution included T. solium and fishborne trematodes. Pathogens with a global distribution included non-typhoidal S. enterica, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium bovis. Control methods exist for many hazards associated with ASF, and their implementation is linked to economic development and effective food safety systems."
https://openalex.org/W2985465240,"Objective Assessing the epidemiological association between herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) infections in the United States, and characterizing the trends in the standardized HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibody prevalences (seroprevalences), 1999–2016. Methods Source of data was the cross-sectional and nationally-representative biennial surveys of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All nine NHANES rounds for 1999–2016 were included in analysis. Datasets of these rounds were combined and analyzed accounting for survey design and applying weighting procedures. Logistic regressions were used to identify associations with seropositivity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results Odds of HSV-1 infection declined by 2.84% (95% CI: 1.70%-4.00%) annually among men, and by 2.22% (95% CI: 1.23%-3.21%) among women. Declines were highest at younger ages. Odds of HSV-2 infection declined by 2.23% (95% CI: 0.71%-3.82%) annually among men, and by 2.89% (95% CI: 1.57%-4.28%) among women. Odds ratio of the association between HSV-2 and HSV-1 seropositivity was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60–0.84) for men and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72–0.91) for women, after adjustment for age, ethnicity, and year. Conclusion HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalences showed a strong declining trend for at least two decades, for both sexes and for the different ethnicities, possibly reflecting improvements in hygiene and living conditions (for HSV-1), and safer sexual behavior (for HSV-2). HSV-1 seroprevalence declines are most pronounced among young individuals. There is evidence for cross protection between the two infections, suggestive of HSV-1 seropositivity being partially protective against HSV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2952039705,"Chronic inflammation is a typical characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α plays an important role. We investigated whether anti-TNF-α therapy can alleviate the core phenotypes of PCOS. In pubertal female Wistar rats, release pellets of letrozole (LET) were administered continuously for 90 days to induce PCOS-like phenotypes, followed by treatment with etanercept (ETA), a TNF-α inhibitor. ETA significantly inhibited increases in body weight and androgen, TNF-α, and MCP-1 levels, excessive recruitment of lipid droplets, altered levels of pre-adipose differentiation markers, and abnormal development of follicles. In addition, TNF-α and testosterone (T) levels in the rat sera were significantly positively correlated. Further experiments were performed to investigate the relationship between TNF-α and androgen. Persistent exposure of the RAW 264.7 cell line to low doses of testosterone significantly enhanced TNF-α expression and activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, which were blocked by ETA. Furthermore, treatment with TNF-α promoted the production of testosterone in KGN granulosa cells by reducing CYP19A1 expression, whereas ETA treatment blocked this process. In conclusion, anti-TNF-α therapy with ETA may be an efficient method to alleviate PCOS, whose underlying mechanism may be associated with its ability to reduce excessive androgen levels."
https://openalex.org/W2954339481,"Drought substantially limits seed yield of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in the tropics. Understanding the interaction of drought on yield and the nutrient concentration of the seed is vital in order to supply nutrition to the millions of consumers who rely on common bean as a staple crop. Nevertheless, the impact of drought on common bean for both yield and nutrient concentration has not yet been concurrently investigated in a field environment. Using 10 bred lines developed by CIAT and its partners for their improved adaptation to drought and phosphorus deficiency, this study characterised the impact of drought on yield and nutrient concentration for leaf and seed tissue of common bean grown in the field. Drought significantly reduced leaf area (by ~50%), harvest index (by ~60%), yield (by ~70%), seed weight (by ~25%) and enriched carbon isotope abundance (δ13C) in the seed. Within the soluble leaf fraction, drought significantly decreased the concentration of mineral nutrients and amino acids, whereas no negative effect on the concentration of nutrients and amino acids was detected within the seed. Genotypic variation in nutrient concentration in both the leaf and seed tissue was identified and should be explored further to identify traits that may confer tolerance to abiotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2980888803,"Most clinically used opioids are thought to induce analgesia through activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR). However, disparities have been observed between the efficacy of opioids in activating the MOR in vitro and in inducing analgesia in vivo. In addition, some clinically used opioids do not produce cross-tolerance with each other, and desensitization produced in vitro does not match tolerance produced in vivo. These disparities suggest that some opioids could be acting through other targets in vivo, but this has not been comprehensively tested. We thus screened 9 clinically relevant opioids (buprenorphine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, O-desmethyl-tramadol, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tapentadol, tramadol) against 9 pain-related receptor targets (MOR, delta opioid receptor [DOR], kappa opioid receptor [KOR], nociceptin receptor [NOP], cannabinoid receptor type 1 [CB1], sigma-1 receptor [σ1R], and the monoamine transporters [NET/SERT/DAT]) expressed in cells using radioligand binding and functional activity assays. We found several novel interactions, including monoamine transporter activation by buprenorphine and σ1R binding by hydrocodone and tapentadol. Tail flick anti-nociception experiments with CD-1 mice demonstrated that the monoamine transporter inhibitor duloxetine selectively promoted buprenorphine anti-nociception while producing no effects by itself or in combination with the most MOR-selective drug oxymorphone, providing evidence that these novel interactions could be relevant in vivo. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the receptor interaction profiles of clinically relevant opioids, which has not previously been performed. Our findings also suggest novel receptor interactions for future investigation that could explain some of the disparities observed between opioid performance in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2961360315,"The purpose of the current study was to assess the inter-trial reliability and construct validity (talented juniors vs. international adult players) of four wheelchair tennis field tests using inertial measurement units (IMUs). Twenty-one elite wheelchair tennis players completed four tests, which evaluate the sprinting and manoeuvrability abilities in wheelchair tennis. During all tests 3 IMUs were attached to both wheels and the frame of the athlete’s wheelchair. The IMUs enabled analysis of individual test dynamic characteristics, i.e. the linear/rotational velocity and acceleration data, as well as detected pushes. All tests showed high ICCs (0.95–0.99) for the inter-trial reliability for the IMU-based end times and also the construct validity was good, i.e. talented juniors could be discriminated from international adults. Also, velocities and accelerations during the tests could be consistently visualized, meaning that differences in test performance among participants could be designated. Within the experimental context, the field tests could be regarded as reliable and valid. With the use of IMUs it is possible to verify more detailed performance characteristics, visualize the test execution, as well as differentiate between a talented junior and international adult group and within individuals over time."
https://openalex.org/W3023308531,"Background A new contraceptive microarray patch (MAP) for women is in development. Input on this method from potential end-users early in the product development process is important to guide design decisions. This paper presents the qualitative component of a broader study exploring initial acceptability of the MAP and selected product features. The qualitative research was intended to identify product features that are most salient to end-users and to contextualize preferences around them with subsequent research planned to assess quantitatively the relative importance of those features. Methods We conducted 16 focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews with women and 20 IDIs with family planning providers in New Delhi, India, and Ibadan, Nigeria. Input from the MAP developer served to identify plausible features of the MAP to include in the focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed into English, coded, and analyzed to examine key dimensions of MAP features. Results Many participants viewed the MAP as potentially easy to use. Interest in self-application after learning correct use was high, especially in India. Participants favored formulations affording protection from pregnancy for three or six months, if not longer. Interest in a shorter-acting MAP was particularly low in Nigeria. Non-desirable MAP features included a potential localized skin rash and pain at application. Views on patch size and location of application were related to the potential for rash and pain, with a desire to permit discreet use and minimize pain. Results indicate that the side effect profile, effectiveness, and pricing are also important factors for acceptability and uptake of a future product. Conclusion Study findings indicate that a contraceptive MAP is of potential interest to women and that specific MAP attributes will be important to acceptability."
https://openalex.org/W4231403277,"Reptiles are declining worldwide yet our understanding of their immune function lags far behind other taxa. The innate immune system is the primary mode of defense in reptiles, and the serum complement cascade is its major component. We assessed serum complement activity of plasma in two closely related aquatic turtle species, the common snapping turtle (CST; Chelydra serpentina) and alligator snapping turtle (AST; Macrochelys temminckii). We used a sheep red blood cell (SRBC) hemolysis assay to assess serum complement activity. Although the antibacterial activities of the plasma of these turtle species are similar, the hemolytic activity was much stronger in CST than AST. Treatment with inhibitors of the serum complement cascade indicated differences in the mechanisms of complement activation between the turtle species. We subjected plasma from both turtle species to mannan affinity chromatography and analyzed the eluate with SDS-PAGE, which revealed that plasma from the CSTs contained only small amounts of one C-type lectin protein while the AST plasma contained high concentrations of two C-type lectins (31.0 and 35.9 kDa). Edman degradation analyses confirmed that the two AST proteins contained identical N-terminal sequences. Thus, the CST appears to rely more heavily on the alternative mechanism of serum complement activation, while the AST appears to rely more on the lectin-mediated pathway, which is a pattern recognition response to prokaryotes not activated by the SRBCs. These results are unique in that the use of serum complement pathways are generally assumed to be conserved within clades."
https://openalex.org/W2953888004,"Fecal pollution management remains one of the biggest challenges for water quality authorities worldwide. Advanced fecal pollution source identification technologies are now available that can provide quantitative information from many animal groups. As public interest in these methodologies grows, it is vital to use standardized procedures with clearly defined data acceptance metrics and conduct field studies demonstrating the use of these techniques to help resolve real-world water quality challenges. Here we apply recently standardized human-associated qPCR methods with custom data acceptance metrics (HF183/BacR287 and HumM2), along with established procedures for ruminant (Rum2Bac), cattle (CowM2 and CowM3), canine (DG3 and DG37), and avian (GFD) fecal pollution sources to (i) demonstrate the feasibility of implementing standardized qPCR procedures in a large-scale field study, and (ii) characterize trends in fecal pollution sources in the research area. A total of 602 water samples were collected over a one-year period at 29 sites along the Trask, Kilchis, and Tillamook rivers and tributaries in the Tillamook Bay Watershed (OR, USA). Host-associated qPCR results were combined with high-resolution geographic information system (GIS) land use and general indicator bacteria (E. coli) measurements to elucidate water quality fecal pollution trends. Results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing standardized fecal source identification qPCR methods with established data acceptance metrics in a large-scale field study leading to new investigative leads suggesting that elevated E. coli levels may be linked to specific pollution sources and land use activities in the Tillamook Bay Watershed."
https://openalex.org/W2969360893,"This study describes the muscle transcriptome profile of Bandur breed, a consumer favoured, meat type sheep of India. The transcriptome was compared to the less desirable, unregistered local sheep population, in order to understand the molecular factors related to muscle traits in Indian sheep breeds. Bandur sheep have tender muscles and higher backfat thickness than local sheep. The longissimus thoracis transcriptome profiles of Bandur and local sheep were obtained using RNA sequencing (RNA Seq). The animals were male, non-castrated, with uniform age and reared under similar environment, as well as management conditions. We could identify 568 significantly up-regulated and 538 significantly down-regulated genes in Bandur sheep (p≤0.05). Among these, 181 up-regulated and 142 down-regulated genes in Bandur sheep, with a fold change ≥1.5, were considered for further analysis. Significant Gene Ontology terms for the up-regulated dataset in Bandur sheep included transporter activity, substrate specific transmembrane, lipid and fatty acid binding. The down-regulated activities in Bandur sheep were mainly related to RNA degradation, regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascades and innate immune response. The MAPK signaling pathway, Adipocytokine signaling pathway and PPAR signaling pathway were enriched for Bandur sheep. The highly connected genes identified by network analysis were CNOT2, CNOT6, HSPB1, HSPA6, MAP3K14 and PPARD, which may be important regulators of energy metabolism, cellular stress and fatty acid metabolism in the skeletal muscles. These key genes affect the CCR4-NOT complex, PPAR and MAPK signaling pathways. The highly connected genes identified in this study, form interesting candidates for further research on muscle traits in Bandur sheep."
https://openalex.org/W2889573943,"Social networks influence health-related behaviors, such as obesity and smoking. While researchers have studied social networks as a driver for diffusion of influences and behaviors, it is less understood how the structure or topology of the network, in itself, impacts an individual's health behaviors and wellness state. In this paper, we investigate whether the structure or topology of a social network offers additional insight and predictability on an individual's health and wellness. We develop a model called the Network-Driven health predictor (NetCARE) that leverages features representative of social network structure. Using a large longitudinal data set of students enrolled in the NetHealth study at the University of Notre Dame, we show that the NetCARE model improves the overall prediction performance over the baseline models -- that use demographics and physical attributes -- by 38%, 65%, 55%, and 54% for the wellness states -- stress, happiness, positive attitude, and self-assessed health -- considered in this paper."
https://openalex.org/W2948324446,"This study collected 183 Hemerocallis varieties to conduct numerical classification of flower color and provide valuable baseline data and foundational theory for normalization and precision of Hemerocallis. The color CIELab phenotypes were collected via colorimeter (CR-10 Plus), which separately measured three sepal and petal parts (throat, eye and limb). The colors of experimental samples were artificially named by the Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart (RHSCC). All the data were analyzed using R software. The results showed that the throat was predominantly green-yellow, light yellow and yellow; green-yellow accounted for the largest proportion of sepals (67.76%) and petals (69.40%). The eye was more abundant, and there were significant differences between sepals and petals. The limb was clustered into five color groups (orange, yellow, pink, red and purple); the yellow group had the most varieties for both sepals and petals, containing 57.38% and 55.74%, respectively. Both sepals and petals had significant differences (p<0.0001) in color (△E), redness (a*) and color angle (h) for the throat, eye and limb. However, the difference in CIELab phenotypes between the eye and limb were not significant. According to “Dual Classification”, the color classification standard was proposed as a 3-level standard. The color of sepal and petal consistency served as the first standard, and the color of limb was the second standard. The color pattern types of pure, gradual change, watermark and eye spot, served as the third standard. It has been proposed that all the 183 experimental varieties were divided into two categories, five groups and finally four types. This study provides a classification basis and reference for numeric and standardized color phenotype description for Hemerocallis."

https://openalex.org/W2984613499,"Background Gender-based violence (GBV) is a crucial global health problem among all age groups, including adolescents. This study describes incidences of GBV, as well as factors associated with sexual assault, among female adolescents in class six living in urban informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods Study participants were interviewed using a structured survey instrument focusing on experiences of GBV, including emotional, physical, and sexual violence, and corresponding perpetrators, as well as gender attitudes, alcohol use, self-efficacy, and previous sexual experiences. Summary statistics and clustered bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated for social behaviors and violence rates. Stepwise logistic regression identified variables associated with an adolescent’s experience of sexual assault. Findings In this population 7·2% of adolescent girls reported being raped in the prior twelve months, with 11·1% of these rape victims reporting over five experiences. Among the 21·3% who report having had a boyfriend, 38·1% reported emotional, physical, and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV). Boyfriends were identified most often as perpetrators, accounting for 46·3% of reported lifetime rapes. Previous experience of physical (p = <0·001) or emotional (p<0·001) IPV and home violence (p<0·001) were risk factors for being raped, while high self-efficacy (p<0·001) was a protective factor. Interpretation Sexual assault and GBV are major challenges in this highly-disadvantaged population. Novel prevention efforts are needed for this age group, as prevention is often targeted at older adolescents. Prevention efforts should focus on assaults by perpetrators known to adolescents, especially boyfriends, and may need to account for the adolescents’ previous experience of, and exposure to, violence."
https://openalex.org/W3012269829,"Fetal development is thought to proceed in a sterile environment. Recent reports of the presence of bacterial DNA in human placenta, the transfer of live bacteria from mother to fetus after hypoxia in the pregnant sheep, and the presence of bacteria in the meconium of newborn infants have suggested that the fetus might be exposed to bacteria in utero. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that small numbers of bacteria introduced into the maternal bloodstream (too few to induce fever or changes in maternal food consumption), can be found in the fetus days later. We injected 100 colony forming units of green-, red- and far red- fluorescent protein (GFP, RFP, FRFP) expressing S. aureus into late-gestation pregnant sheep intravenously. Five to 7 days later, the animals were euthanized and tissues collected for analysis of GFP. The inoculations did not cause any fever or other measurable behavioral response in the ewes, but did result in the appearance of GFP DNA, and protein in various tissues within the fetuses. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals GFP protein-containing bacteria that appear to be mostly contained within other cells. We were unable to recover any live GFP-expressing bacteria from the fetal tissues. We conclude that S. aureus, and perhaps other bacteria, gain access to the fetus, although it is not clear from these experiments that they survive in the fetus. It is possible that these low inocula and their progeny were effectively cleared by the fetal immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2954149174,"The implementation of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy caused a significant decrease in HIV-associated mortality worldwide. Nevertheless, mortality is still high among people living with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). ARV-naïve HIV patients coinfected with tuberculosis (TB) have more options to treat both diseases concomitantly. Nevertheless, some TB-HIV patients undertaking ARVs (ARV-experienced) are already failing the first line efavirenz-based regimen and seem to display different response to second line ARV therapy and exhibit other predictors of mortality.We performed a retrospective cohort study including 273 patients diagnosed with TB-HIV and treated at a referral center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 2008 and 2016. Multivariate analysis and Cox regression models were used to evaluate the effectiveness of ARV therapy regimens (viral load [VL] <80 copies from the 4th to 10th months after TB therapy introduction) and to identify predictors of early mortality (100 days after TB therapy initiation) considering ARV-naïve and ARV-experienced patients adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical and therapeutic covariates.Survival analysis included 273 patients, out of whom 154 (56.4%) were ARV-naïve and 119 (43.6%) were ARV-experienced. Seven deaths occurred within 6 months of anti-TB treatment, 4 in ARV-naïve and 3 in ARV-experienced patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that in ARV-naïve patients, the chance of death was substantially higher in patients who developed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome during the study follow up (HR = 40.6, p<0.01). For ARV-experienced patients, similar analyses failed to identify factors significantly associated with mortality. Variables independently associated with treatment failure for the ARV-naïve group were previous TB (adjusted OR [aOR] = 6.1 p = 0.03) and alcohol abuse (aOR = 3.7 p = 0.01). For ARV-experienced patients, a ritonavir boosted. Protease Inhibitor-based regimen resulted in a 2.6 times higher risk of treatment failure compared to the use of efavirenz based ARV regimens (p = 0.03) and High baseline HIV VL (p = 0.03) were predictors of treatment failure.Risk factors for mortality and ARV failure were different for ARV-naïve and ARV-experienced patients. The latter patient group should be targeted for trials with less toxic and rifampicin-compatible drugs to improve TB-HIV treatment outcomes and prevent death."
https://openalex.org/W2980340843,"Background 
Drug resistant-tuberculosis is a growing burden on the South African health care budget. In response the National Department of Health implemented two important strategies in 2011; universal access to drug-sensitivity testing for rifampicin with Xpert MTB/RIF as the first-line diagnostic test for TB; and decentralization of treatment for RR/MDR-TB to improve access and reduce costs of treatment.


Objective 
Estimate the costs by treatment outcome of decentralized care for rifampicin and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis under routine conditions. The study was set at an outpatient drug resistant-tuberculosis treatment facility at a public academic hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. During the study period 18–24 month long course treatment was offered for rifampicin-resistant and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.


Methods 
Data are from a prospective observational cohort study. Costs of treatment were estimated from the provider perspective using bottom-up micro-costing. Costs were estimated as patient-level resource use multiplied by the unit cost of the resource. Clinic visits, drugs, laboratory tests, and total days hospitalized were collected from patients’ medical records. Staff time was estimated through a time and motion study. A successful treatment outcome was defined as cure or completion of the regimen.


Results 
We enrolled 124 patients with 52% having a successful outcome. The average total cost/patient for all patients was $3,430 and $4,530 for successfully treated patients. The largest contributors to total cost across all outcomes were drugs (43%) and staff (28%). The average cost to achieve a successful outcome including all patients who started treatment (“production cost”) in the cohort is $6,684.


Conclusions 
Decentralized, outpatient RR/MDR-TB care under South Africa’s 2011 strategy costs 74% less per patient than the previous strategy of inpatient care. The treatment cost of RR/MDR-TB is primarily driven by drug and staff costs, which are in turn dependant on treatment length."
https://openalex.org/W3020964770,"To describe the epidemiology of holoprosencephaly (HPE) in China with special reference to prevalence and associated anomalies.Data were abstracted from the Chinese Birth Defects Monitoring Network for the period 2007-2014. Birth prevalence of HPE were assessed by birth year, fetal/infant sex, maternal age, and maternal residential area. Poisson regressions were used to calculate the crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% confidence intervals, and linear chi-square test was used to explore time trend for the prevalence of HPE.A total of 1222 HPE cases were identified in 13,284,142 births, yielding an overall prevalence of 0.92 per 10,000 births. The annual prevalence of HPE presented an upward trend (P<0.001), from 0.54 per 10,000 births in 2007 to 1.21 per 10,000 births in 2014. Higher prevalence was found in older maternal-age groups (30-34 years, adjusted PR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.40; ≥35 years, adjusted PR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.26-1.86) in comparison with the maternal-age group of 25 to 29 years. Higher prevalence was also found in infants born to mothers resided in urban areas (adjusted PR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.39) and female infants (adjusted PR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.15-1.47).HPE is an important perinatal health issue because of its poor prognosis. This is the first study depicting a picture of epidemiological characteristics of HPE in China, which can provide useful references for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2948452292,"Angiogenesis depends on VEGF-mediated signaling. However, the regulatory mechanisms and functions of individual VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) phosphorylation sites remain unclear. Here, we report that synaptic adhesion-like molecule 4 (SALM4) regulates a specific VEGFR2 phosphorylation site. SALM4 silencing in HUVECs and Salm4 knockout (KO) in lung endothelial cells (ECs) of Salm4−/− mice suppressed phosphorylation of VEGFR2 tyrosine (Y) 1175 (Y1173 in mice) and downstream signaling upon VEGF-A stimulation. However, VEGFR2 phosphorylation at Y951 (Y949 in mice) and Y1214 (Y1212 in mice) remained unchanged. Knockdown and KO of SALM4 inhibited VEGF-A-induced angiogenic functions of ECs. SALM4 depletion reduced endothelial leakage, sprouting, and migratory activities. Furthermore, in an ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) model, brain injury was attenuated in Salm4−/− mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In brain lysates after I/R, VEGFR2 phosphorylation at Y949, Y1173, and Y1212 were induced in WT brains, but only Y1173 phosphorylation of VEGFR2 was reduced in Salm4−/− brains. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SALM4 specifically regulates VEGFR2 phosphorylation at Y1175 (Y1173 in mice), thereby fine-tuning VEGF signaling in ECs.—Kim, D. Y., Park, J.

https://openalex.org/W2967528510,"The N-formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) have been identified within neuronal tissues and may serve as yet undetermined functions within the nervous system. The FPRs have been implicated in the progression and invasiveness of neuroblastoma and other cancers. In this study the effects of the synthetic FPR agonist FPRa14, FPR antagonists and FPR knockdown using siRNA on mouse neuroblastoma neuro2a (N2a) cell differentiation plus toxicity were examined. The FPRa14 (1–10μM) was found to induce a significant dose-dependent differentiation response in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. Interestingly, three distinct differentiated morphologies were observed, with two non-archetypal forms observed at the higher FPRa14 concentrations. These three forms were also observed in the human neuroblastoma cell-lines IMR-32 and SH-SY5Y when exposed to 100μM FPRa14. In N2a cells combined knockdown of FPR1 and FPR2 using siRNA inhibited the differentiation response to FPRa14, suggesting involvement of both receptor subtypes. Pre-incubating N2a cultures with the FPR1 antagonists Boc-MLF and cyclosporin H significantly reduced FPRa14-induced differentiation to near baseline levels. Meanwhile, the FPR2 antagonist WRW4 had no significant effect on FPRa14-induced N2a differentiation. These results suggest that the N2a differentiation response observed has an FPR1-dependent component. Toxicity of FPRa14 was only observed at higher concentrations. All three antagonists used blocked FPRa14-induced toxicity, whilst only siRNA knockdown of FPR2 reduced toxicity. This suggests that the toxicity and differentiation involve different mechanisms. The demonstration of neuronal differentiation mediated via FPRs in this study represents a significant finding and suggests a role for FPRs in the CNS. This finding could potentially lead to novel therapies for a range of neurological conditions including neuroblastoma, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and neuropathic pain. Furthermore, this could represent a potential avenue for neuronal regeneration therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2973300891,"This study aimed to investigate the hypothesized negative association between duration of work time spent at a high relative aerobic workload and leisure time movement behaviours among blue-collar workers.This was a cross-sectional study based on heart rate and accelerometer data from 803 blue-collar workers (447 men and 356 women). Relative aerobic workload was measured as percentage of heart rate reserve during work (%HRR). Leisure time movement behaviours were expressed in terms of leisure time spent in sedentary and active behaviours in uninterrupted bouts (i.e. <10 min, ≥10-30 min and >30 min). Compositional regression and isotemporal substitution models were used to assess the association between the predominance of work time spent at ≥40%HRR and leisure time spent in sedentary and active bouts. All analyses were stratified by sex.For men, there was no statistically significant association between the predominance of work time spent at ≥40%HRR and leisure time movement behaviours. Among women, the predominance of ≥40%HRR at work was negatively associated with relative leisure time spent in ≥10 min bouts of active behaviour ([Formula: see text] = -0.21, p = 0.02) and a theoretical 15 min reallocation of work time from <40%HRR to ≥40%HRR was estimated to decrease active behaviour by 6 min during leisure time.Our result highlights the need for considering work-related barriers for an active leisure time in high-risk populations. Longitudinal studies are warranted to disentangle the relationship between physically demanding work characteristics and leisure time movement behaviours in such populations."
https://openalex.org/W3022354430,"The ability to efficiently perform actions immediately following instructions and without prior practice has previously been termed Rapid Instructed Task Learning (RITL). In addition, it was found that instructions are so powerful that they can produce automatic effects, reflected in activation of the instructions in an inappropriate task context. RITL is hypothesized to rely on limited working memory (WM) resources for holding not-yet implemented task rules. Similarly, automatic effects of instructions presumably reflect the operation of task rules kept in WM. Therefore, both were predicted to be influenced by WM load. However, while the involvement of WM in RITL is implicated from prior studies, evidence regarding WM involvement in instructions-based automaticity is mixed. In the current study, we manipulated WM load by increasing the number of novel task rules to be held in WM towards performance in the NEXT paradigm. In this task, participants performed a series of novel tasks presented in mini-blocks, each comprising a) instructions of novel task rules; b) a NEXT phase measuring the automatic activation of these instructed rules, in which participants advance the screen using a key-press; and c) a GO phase in which the new rules are first implemented and RITL is measured. In three experiments, we show a dissociation: While RITL (rule implementation) was impaired by increased WM load, the automatic effects of instructions were not robustly influenced by WM load. Theoretical implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2948754830,"Purpose To test the accuracy, validity, reliability and sensitivity of an alternative method for the measure of TMS-assessed voluntary activation (VATMS) in the knee extensors. Methods Ten healthy males (24 ± 5 years) completed a neuromuscular assessment protocol before and after a fatiguing isometric exercise: two sets of five contractions (50%, 62.5%, 75%, 87.5%, 100% Maximal Voluntary Contraction; MVC) with superimposed TMS-evoked twitches for calculation of VATMS using either the first 5 stimulations (1x5C) or all 10 (2x5C). This was performed on two separate occasions (between-day reliability). Accuracy and validity were compared with a routinely used protocol [i.e. 50%, 75%, and 100% of MVC (1x3C) performed three times (3x3C)]. Results 95% confidence interval for estimated resting twitch, a key determinant of VATMS, was similar between 1x5C, 2x5C, and 3x3C but improved by six-fold when compared to 1x3C (P<0.05). In a fresh state, potentiated twitch force was unchanged following 1x5C but decreased following 2x5C (P<0.05). A recovery was found post-exercise but was smaller for 1x5C compared to 2x5C (P<0.05), with no difference between the latter two (P>0.05). Absolute reliability was strong enough for both 1x5C and 2x5C to depict a true detectable change in the sample’s VATMS following the fatiguing exercise (TEM < 3% at rest, <9% post-exercise) but 2x5C was marginally more sensitive to individual’s changes from baseline. Conclusion Both 1x5C and 2x5C provide reliable measures of VATMS. However, 1x5C may hold stronger internal validity. Both protocols allow detection of ‘true’ changes in sample’s means but not individual scores following a fatiguing isometric exercise."

An in-depth understanding of knowledge, attitudes and practices of young people towards TB is required to implement meaningful interventions. We analysed young men and women (18–24 years)’s TB knowledge including TB/HIV coinfections, testing rates and factors associated with them. A cross sectional cluster-based household survey was conducted in two provinces. Participants completed computer-assisted self-interviews on TB knowledge, testing history and TB/HIV coinfections. A participant was regarded as knowledgeable of TB if s/he correctly answered the WHO-adopted TB knowledge questions. We built three multivariate regression models in Stata 13.0 to assess factors associated with knowing TB alone, testing alone and both knowing and testing for TB. 1955 participants were interviewed (89.9% response rate). Their median age was 20 years (IQR19-22). Sixteen percent (16.2%) of the participants were social grant recipients, 55% were enrolled in a school/college and 5% lived in substandard houses. A total of 72% had knowledge of TB, 21% underwent screening tests for TB and 14.7% knew and tested for TB. Factors associated with TB knowledge were being female, younger, a student, social grant recipient, not transacting sex and having positive attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLWH). Factors associated with TB testing were being a student, receiving a social grant, living in OR Tambo district, HIV knowledge and having a family member with TB history. Factors associated with both TB knowledge and testing were being female, a student, using the print media, living in OR Tambo district and having a family member with a TB history. The study demonstrates the importance of demographic factors (gender, economic status, family TB history, and location) and HIV factors in explaining TB knowledge and testing. We recommend extending community TB testing services to increase testing."
https://openalex.org/W2990697595,"Clara cells are the main airway secretory cells able to regenerate epithelium in the distal airways through transdifferentiating into goblet cells, a process under negative regulation of the Notch pathway. Pneumocystis is a highly prevalent fungus in humans occurring between 2 and 5 months of age, a period when airways are still developing and respiratory morbidity typically increases. Pneumocystis induces mucus hyperproduction in immunocompetent host airways and whether it can stimulate Clara cells is unknown. Markers of Clara cell secretion and Notch1 activation were investigated in lungs of immunocompetent rats at 40, 60, and 80 days of age during Pneumocystis primary infection with and without Valproic acid (VPA), a Notch inducer. The proportion of rats expressing mucin increased in Pneumocystis-infected rats respect to controls at 60 and 80 days of age. Frequency of distal airways Clara cells was maintained while mRNA levels for the mucin-encoding genes Muc5B and Muc5ac in lung homogenates increased 1.9 and 3.9 times at 60 days of infection (P. = 0.1609 and P. = 0.0001, respectively) and protein levels of the Clara cell marker CC10 decreased in the Pneumocystis-infected rats at 60 and 80 days of age (P. = 0.0118 & P. = 0.0388). CC10 and Muc5b co-localized in distal airway epithelium of Pneumocystis-infected rats at day 60. Co-localization of Muc5b and Ki67 as marker of mitosis in distal airways was not observed suggesting that Muc5b production by Clara cells was independent of mitosis. Notch levels remained similar and no transnucleation of activated Notch associated to Pneumocystis infection was detected. Unexpectedly, mucus was greatly increased at day 80 in Pneumocystis-infected rats receiving VPA suggesting that a Notch-independent mechanism was triggered. Overall, data suggests a Clara to goblet cell transdifferentiation mechanism induced by Pneumocystis and independent of Notch."
https://openalex.org/W3017354603,"Insect herbivores and their hostplants constitute much of Earth’s described biological diversity, but how these often-specialized associations diversify is not fully understood. We combined detailed hostplant data and comparative phylogenetic analyses of the lepidopteran family Momphidae to explore how shifts in the use of hostplant resources, not just hostplant taxon, contribute to the diversification of a phytophagous insect lineage. We inferred two phylogenetic hypotheses emphasizing relationships among species in the nominate genus, Mompha Hübner. A six-gene phylogeny was constructed with reared exemplars and collections from hostplants in the family Onagraceae from western and southwestern USA, and a cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) phylogeny was inferred from collections and publicly available accessions in the Barcode of Life Data System. Species delimitation analyses combined with morphological data revealed ca. 56 undescribed species-level taxa, many of which are hostplant specialists on Onagraceae in the southwestern USA. Our phylogenetic reconstructions divided Momphidae into six major clades: 1) an Onagraceae flower- and fruit-boring clade, 2) a Melastomataceae-galling clade, 3) a leafmining clade A, 4) a leafmining clade B, 5) a Zapyrastra Meyrick clade, and 6) a monobasic lineage represented by Mompha eloisella (Clemens). Ancestral trait reconstructions using the COI phylogeny identified leafmining on Onagraceae as the ancestral state for Momphidae. Our study finds that shifts along three hostplant resource axes (plant taxon, plant tissue type, and larval feeding mode) have contributed to the evolutionary success and diversification of momphids."
https://openalex.org/W2952196622,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is well recognized as one of the major threats to children’s health globally. The increasing complexity of the etiology of HFMD still challenges disease control in China. There is little surveillance of the molecular epidemiological characteristics of the enteroviruses (EVs) that cause HFMD in Neijiang city or the Sichuan Basin area in Southwest China. In this study, demographic and epidemiological information for 14,928 probable HFMD cases was extracted and analyzed to describe the epidemic features of HFMD in Neijiang city from Jan 2010 to Dec 2017. The swab samples of select probable HFMD cases from 2012 to 2017 were tested by reverse transcription (RT) real-time PCR to identify the serotype distribution of EVs, and 110 randomly selected RT-real-time PCR positive samples were then amplified and analyzed for the VP1 or VP4 regions of EVs to further analyze the phylogenetic characteristics of the circulating strains in this area. The eight-year average annual incidence was 49.82 per 100,000 in Neijiang. The incidence rates varied between 19.51 and 70.73 per 100,000, demonstrating peaks of incidence in even-number years (2012, 2014 and 2016). The median age of the probable cases was 27 months and the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile) of ages for the probable HFMD cases was between 14 and 42 months. The male-to-female ratio of the probable HFMD cases was 1.47:1, and scattered children were the major population classification (81.7%). Two epidemic peaks were observed: one major peak between April and July and the other lesser peak between October and December. Of 6513 probable cases tested with RT-real-time PCR, 4015 (61.6%) were positive for enterovirus with the serotype distribution as follows: EV71+, 30.1% (n = 1210); CV-A16+, 28.7% (n = 1154) and a sole pan-enterovirus+, 41.1% (n = 1651). A total of 91 cases (82.7%, 91/110) were successfully amplified and underwent phylogenetic analysis: all EV71+ cases were C4a serotype (n = 23/30); all CV-A16+ cases were B2b serotype (n = 24/30); of 42 sole pan-enterovirus+ samples, 20 were CV-A6, 14 were CV-A10 and the rest within this group were CV-A4 (n = 4), CV-A8 (n = 2), CV-A9 (n = 1) and CV-B3 (n = 1). Our findings provide important evidence that aids the improvement of strategies for vaccination against HFMD and comprehensive disease control in China."
https://openalex.org/W3012195987,"Background Prescription of guideline-recommended medicines after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been suboptimal. Tools for improving the use of medications have been developed, but they mainly targeted physicians. Objective We evaluated the effects of reinforcement of patient and family education on the usage of guideline-recommended secondary prevention medications. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected registry of patients with ACS who were admitted to a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan between February 2015 and April 2017. The control group included 76 patients discharged before implementing the electronic-based patient and family education (PFE) system. The intervention group included 206 patients discharged after implementation. The primary outcome was the prescription rate of all four guideline-recommended drugs. Predictors of adherence were also evaluated. Results The study cohort included 282 ACS patients (188 men and 94 women) with a mean age of 68.5 years (standard deviation, 14.2). The intervention group patients were younger, had more family history of premature cardiovascular disease, more dyslipidemia, and underwent more reperfusion therapy. The intervention group was prescribed more guideline-recommended drugs than the control group: dual antiplatelet agents, 79.61% vs. 47.37% (p<0.001); statins, 74.76% vs. 34.21% (p<0.001); beta-blockers, 81.07% vs. 46.05% (p<0.001); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, 62.62% vs. 38.16% (p<0.001); and a combination of all four medications, 39.32% vs. 14.47% (p<0.001). After adjusting baseline variables, the PFE system remained a significant contributor to adherence to these drugs use (P = 0.02). Conclusions Reinforcement of patient education was associated with significant improvements in physicians’ adherence to guideline-recommended medical therapy after acute coronary syndrome."

Intravenous delivery of Ad.scIL-23 did not accelerate the onset of hyperglycemia but instead resulted in the development of psoriatic arthritis. Ad.scIL-23-treated mice developed erythema, scales, and thickening of the skin, as well as intervertebral disc degeneration and extensive synovial hypertrophy and loss of articular cartilage in the knees. Immunological analysis revealed activation of conventional T helper type 17 cells and IL-17-producing γδ T cells along with a significant depletion and suppression of T cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes. Furthermore, treatment with anti-IL-17 antibody reduced joint and skin psoriatic arthritis pathologies.

https://openalex.org/W2963925451,"This goal of this study was to highlight the importance of minerals in the diet of fish for meeting micronutrient requirements in the human diet. First arsenic, calcium, cadmium, copper, iron, molybdenum, magnesium, manganese, sodium, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, and zinc concentrations of twelve commercially available tilapia samples were measured. The nutritional value of fillets in regard to their mineral content were assessed to establish potential health benefits or risks for consumers. The health benefit value of selenium was also calculated. Positive health benefit values indicate that tilapia fillets in the United States marketplace of this study do not pose health risks associated with mercury exposures. Selenium was the trace mineral of interest. After the market study, a seven-week fish feeding trial was conducted to study the influence of organic versus inorganic dietary selenium on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish were fed two different diets enriched with the same concentration (0.01g kg-1) of selenium in form of inorganic (sodium selenite) or organic (seleno-L-methionine) selenium in triplicate groups. There were no significant differences between growth and biometrics of fish fed different diets (p>0.05). At the end of trial twelve fish from each treatment were collected. Fillets of fish fed organic selenium had selenium concentrations of 0.55 ± 0.01 μg g-1 which were significantly (p<0.05) higher than fish fed inorganic selenium at levels of 0.22 ± 0.008 μg g-1 or fish samples from the marketplace with a selenium level of 0.2 ± 0.03 μg g-1. Fish fed organic selenium also had significantly higher (p<0.05) plasma and kidney selenium in comparison to fish fed inorganic selenium. No significant differences (p>0.05) were observed in glutathione peroxidase activities in either the plasma or liver of Nile tilapia in the different treatment groups. This study shows that organic selenium is a better option for production of Nile tilapia fillets rich in selenium."

https://openalex.org/W2995684893,"The Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is an inherited disease that is controlled by multiple genes and has a complicated genetic mechanism. HSCR patients suffer from various extents of constipation due to dysplasia of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which can be so severe as to cause complete intestinal obstruction. Many genes have been identified as playing causative roles in ENS dysplasia and HSCR, among them the endothelin receptor type B gene (Ednrb) has been identified to play an important role. Mutation of Ednrb causes a series of symptoms that include deafness, pigmentary abnormalities, and aganglionosis. In our previous studies of three rat models carrying the same spotting lethal (sl) mutation on Ednrb, the haplotype of a region on chromosome (Chr) 2 was found to be responsible for the differing severities of the HSCR-like symptoms. To confirm that the haplotype of the responsible region on Chr 2 modifies the severity of aganglionosis caused by Ednrb mutation and to recreate a rat model with severe symptoms, we selected the GK inbred strain, whose haplotype in the responsible region on Chr 2 resembles that of the rat strain in which severe symptoms accompany the Ednrbsl mutation. An Ednrb mutation was introduced into the GK rat by crossing with F344-Ednrbsl and by genome editing. The null mutation of Ednrb was found to cause embryonic death in F2 progeny possessing the GK haplotype in the responsible region on Chr 2.

https://openalex.org/W2976395385,"In 2008, the NIH launched an undiagnosed diseases program to investigate difficult to diagnose, and typically, multi-system diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of psychiatric symptoms or psychiatric diagnoses in a cohort of patients seeking care at the Emory Special Diagnostic Service clinic. We hypothesized that psychiatric symptoms would be prevalent and associated with trauma exposure, and a decreased quality of life and functioning. This is a cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of 247 patients seen between February 7, 2014 and May 31, 2017. The sources for data included the Emory Health History Questionnaire (HHQ) that had the work and social adjustment and quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire–short form (QLSQ) embedded in it; medical records, and the comprehensive standardized special diagnostic clinic forms. Primary outcomes were presence of any psychiatric symptom, based on report of the symptom on the HHQ or medical record, or presence of a confirmed preexisting psychiatric disorder. Seventy-two percent of patients had at least one psychiatric symptom while 24.3% of patients had a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. Patients with any psychiatric symptom had significantly diminished Q-LES-Q scores (45.27 ± 18.63) versus patients with no psychiatric symptoms (62.01 ± 21.57, t = 5.60, df = 225, p<0.0001) and they had significantly greater functional disability. Patients with a psychiatric disorder also had significantly diminished Q-LES-Q scores (45.16 ± 17.28) versus those without a psychiatric diagnosis (51.85 ± 21.54, t = 2.11, df = 225, p = 0.036) but did not have significantly increased functional impairment. Both patients with psychiatric symptoms and ones with psychiatric disorders had an increased prevalence of trauma. Psychiatric symptoms are prevalent in patients evaluated for undiagnosed disorders. The presence of any psychiatric symptom, with or without a formal psychiatric diagnosis, significantly decreases quality of life and functioning. This suggests that assessment for psychiatric symptoms should be part of the evaluation of individuals with undiagnosed disorders and may have important diagnostic and treatment implications."

Materials and methods A micro-costing study was conducted at Coptic Hope Center for Infectious Diseases and Kenyatta National Hospital from July 1-October 31, 2014. Interviews were conducted with 54 patients and 23 staff. Direct medical, non-medical (e.g., overhead), and indirect (e.g., time) costs were calculated for colposcopy, cryotherapy, Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP), and treatment of cancer. All costs are reported in 2017 US dollars. Results Patients had a mean age of 41 and daily earnings of $6; travel time to the facility averaged 2.8 hours. From the modified societal perspective, per-procedure costs of colposcopy were $41 (integrated) vs. $91 (non-integrated). Per-procedure costs of cryotherapy were $22 (integrated) vs. $46 (non-integrated), whereas costs of LEEP were $50 (integrated) and $99 (non-integrated). This represents cost savings of $25 for cryotherapy and $50 for colposcopy and LEEP when provided on the same day as an HIV-care visit. Treatment for cervical cancer cost $1,345-$6,514, depending on stage. Facility-based palliative care cost $59/day. Conclusions Integrating treatment of pre-cancerous lesions into HIV care is estimated to be cost-saving from a modified societal perspective.

Underreporting of HBV and HCV infections has long been identified as a problem. Few reports have described the accuracy of state surveillance case registries for recording clinically-confirmed cases of HBV and HCV infections, or the characteristics of populations associated with lower rates of reporting.The primary objective of the current study is to estimate the proportion of HBV and HCV infections that went unreported to the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDoH), among patients in the Geisinger Health System of Pennsylvania. As a secondary objective, we study the association between underreporting of HBV and HCV infections to PDoH, and the select patient characteristics of interest: sex, age group, race/ethnicity, rural status, and year of initial diagnosis.Per medical record review, the study population was limited to Geisinger Health System patients, residing in Pennsylvania, who were diagnosed with a chronic HBV and/or HCV infection, between 2001 and 2015. Geisinger Health System patient medical records were matched to surveillance records of confirmed cases reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDoH). To quantify the extent that underreporting occurred among the Geisinger Health System study participants, we calculated the proportion of study participants that were not reported to PDoH as confirmed cases of HBV or HCV infections. An analysis of adjusted prevalence ratio estimates was conducted to study the association between underreporting of HBV and HCV infections to PDoH, and the select patient characteristics of interest.Geisinger Health System patients living with HBV were reported to PDoH 88.4% (152 of 172) of the time; patients living with HCV were reported to PDoH 94.6% (2,257 of 2,386) of the time; and patients who were co-infected with both viruses were reported to PDoH 72.0% (18 of 25) of the time. Patients living with HCV had an increased likelihood of being reported if they were: less than or equal to age 30 vs ages 65+ {PR = 1.2, [95%CI, (1.1, 1.3)]}, and if they received their initial diagnosis of HCV during the 2010-2015 time period vs the 1990-1999 time period {PR = 1.08, [95%CI, (1.05, 1.12)]}.The findings in this study are promising, and suggests that PDoH has largely been successful with tracking and monitoring viral hepatitis B and C infections, among persons that were tested for HBV and/or HCV. Additional efforts should be placed on decreasing underreporting rates of HCV infections among seniors (ages 65 and over), and persons who are co-infected with HBV and HCV."
https://openalex.org/W2972682937,"Wall shear stress (WSS), the frictional force exerted on endothelial cells by blood flow, is hypothesised to influence atherosclerotic plaque growth and composition. We developed a methodology for image registration of MR and histology images of advanced human carotid plaques and corresponding WSS data, obtained by MRI and computational fluid dynamics. The image registration method requires four types of input images, in vivo MRI, ex vivo MRI, photographs of transversally sectioned plaque tissue and histology images. These images are transformed to a shared 3D image domain by applying a combination of rigid and non-rigid registration algorithms. Transformation matrices obtained from registration of these images are used to transform subject-specific WSS data to the shared 3D image domain as well. WSS values originating from the 3D WSS map are visualised in 2D on the corresponding lumen locations in the histological sections and divided into eight radial segments. In each radial segment, the correlation between WSS values and plaque composition based on histological parameters can be assessed. The registration method was successfully applied to two carotid endarterectomy specimens. The resulting matched contours from the imaging modalities had Hausdorff distances between 0.57 and 0.70 mm, which is in the order of magnitude of the in vivo MRI resolution. We simulated the effect of a mismatch in the rigid registration of imaging modalities on WSS results by relocating the WSS data with respect to the stack of histology images. A 0.6 mm relocation altered the mean WSS values projected on radial bins on average by 0.59 Pa, compared to the output of original registration. This mismatch of one image slice did not change the correlation between WSS and plaque thickness. In conclusion, we created a method to investigate correlations between WSS and plaque composition."
https://openalex.org/W2950475044,"Pharmacological efficacy is based on the drug concentration in target tissues, which usually cannot be represented by the plasma concentration. The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic characteristics of gemifloxacin in plasma and skeletal muscle and evaluate its tissue penetration in both healthy and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)-infected rats. A microdialysis (MD) combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated to determine free gemifloxacin concentrations in rat plasma and skeletal muscle simultaneously. The in vivo recoveries of MD were 23.21% ± 3.42% for skeletal muscle and 20.62% ± 3.19% for plasma, and were concentration independent. We provided evidence that the method developed here meets FDA requirements. Additionally, this method was successfully applied to the determination of free gemifloxacin in rats. Muscle and blood dialysates were collected after an 18 mg/kg intravenous bolus dose. The mean areas under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) from 0 to 9 h for skeletal muscle and plasma were 3641.50 ± 915.65 h*ng/mL and 7068.32 ± 1964.19 h*ng/mL in MRSA-infected rats and 3774.72 ± 700.36 h*ng/mL and 6927.49 ± 1714.86 h*ng/mL in healthy rats, respectively. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in gemifloxacin exposure between healthy rats and MRSA-infected rats for plasma or muscle. The low ratio of AUC0-9 muscle to AUC0-9 plasma suggested lower drug exposure in skeletal muscle than in plasma for both healthy and MRSA-infected rats. Our study suggested that the administration of gemifloxacin according to drug levels in plasma to treat local infection is unreasonable and might result in an inadequate dose regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2969495510,"To evaluate the effectiveness of high-flow nasal humidified oxygen (HFNHO) therapy in patients with mild hypoxemia after extubation. This study included 316 patients with mild hypoxemia after extubation from May 2016 to May 2018 from two intensive care units in China. Compare the effects of the Venturi Mask and High-Flow Nasal Humidified Oxygen (HFNHO) therapy on Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RR), Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Oxygen Partial Pressure (PO2), Partial Pressure Of Carbon Dioxide (PCO2), Oxygenation Index (PO2/FiO2) after extubation, the use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation and tracheal intubation after treatment failure were observed and recorded. Patients have both lower HR and RR than those who received mask treatment (75.4±18.5 vs. 83.0±20.4, p = 0.0004; 18±6.5 vs. 23.6±10.3, p<0.001, respectively). There was significant difference between those who had HFNHO and mask administration’s SpO2 and PO2 (94.1±6.4 vs. 87.5±1.5, p<0.001; 88.16±2.9 vs. 77.3±2.3, p<0.001, respectively). For the HFNHO group, patients had lower PCO2 with the mask group. (41.3±0.99 vs 42.2±1.2, p<0.001). On the other hand, the levels of PO2/FiO2 was significantly higher in the HFNHO Group, (181.0±8.3 vs. 157.2±4.9, p<0.05). We concluded HFNHO therapy could significantly relieve the symptoms of dyspnea, improve oxygenation, reduce the use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation and reduce the rate of secondary tracheal intubation in patients with mild hypoxemia after extubation."
https://openalex.org/W2995524724,"To evaluate the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of axial length measurement, achieved using IOLMaster, on prediction of target refraction.A total of 131 eyes of 131 patients who underwent phacoemulsification with posterior chamber lens implantation were enrolled. Preoperative axial length measurements were performed with the IOLMaster 500 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany); preoperative SNR values were used to divide the eyes into three groups (Group 1; SNR <10, Group 2; 10 ≤ SNR <50, Group 3; 50 ≤ SNR <100). One month and 6 months after cataract surgery, the manifest refraction spherical equivalents (MRSE) were measured. The mean numeric errors (MNE), the mean of the difference between postoperative MRSE, and preoperative target refraction, using the various intraocular lens (IOL) formulas, were calculated and compared among the three groups.One month after cataract surgery, postoperative MRSE was more hyperopic than preoperative target refraction, calculated by the Haigis formula in group 1, and by the SRK/T formula in group 2. After 6 months, for all formulas in group 1, there were significantly hyperopic results (approximately 0.35 diopter). Upon comparison of MNE among the three groups, group 1 was statistically significantly different from the other groups by Haigis formula.When the SNR values in biometry, using IOLMaster, are <10, careful attention should be given to determining IOL power, as postoperative spherical equivalents are more hyperopic than preoperative target refraction by IOL formula."
https://openalex.org/W3010357975,"Clustering large and complex data sets whose partitions may adopt arbitrary shapes remains a difficult challenge. Part of this challenge comes from the difficulty in defining a similarity measure between the data points that captures the underlying geometry of those data points. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, DCG++ that generates such a similarity measure that is data-driven and ultrametric. DCG++ uses Markov Chain Random Walks to capture the intrinsic geometry of data, scans possible scales, and combines all this information using a simple procedure that is shown to generate an ultrametric. We validate the effectiveness of this similarity measure within the context of clustering on synthetic data with complex geometry, on a real-world data set containing segmented audio records of frog calls described by mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, as well as on an image segmentation problem. The experimental results show a significant improvement on performance with the DCG-based ultrametric compared to using an empirical distance measure."

CA and EA with BMD were calculated for all isolates and compared to the subset of 68 unique isolates.CA ranges were 79.4% to 94.1% for the unique isolateq panel and 89.9% to 96.1% for all tested isolates. EA ranges were 64.7% to 86.8% and 67.4% to 91.0%, respectively. In both panels, EA for all GD assays was lower than 90%. Both lower and higher EA values ranging from-18.3% (MTS on BD agar) to + 6.3% (AD, Vitek 2) were observed in the full one-year sample. Acquisition of colistin resistance under therapy was observed for 3 patients.i) Repeat testing and local spread of clonal strains can positively or negatively affect CA and EA, ii) CA is more robust towards local influences than EA, iii) EA of GD and AD methods for COL with the reference BMD method is insufficient."
https://openalex.org/W3009006557,"Unless the targeted mesh is developable, metric distortion is inevitable during the process of surface mesh parameterization, thus one important objective of all involved parametric studies is to reduce the metric distortion. In order to further reduce area and angle distortion, a novel method of boundary-free mesh parameterization is presented in the paper. Firstly, the initial boundary-fixed conformal parameterization from 3D surface mesh patch to a plane is performed in the method. Then, based on the initial parameterization, the iterations of boundary-free quasi-harmonic parameterization are developed, where the tensor field is updated in each iterative step and the principal curvature direction is utilized to terminate the iteration. The solution of the novel method is convenient to calculate since it involves a series of linear systems. In our novel parameterization method, lower metric distortion and considerable efficiency have been obtained in experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3020889268,"Previous studies have shown that self-esteem modulates attentional responses to emotional stimuli. However, it is well known that emotional stimuli can vary in intensity. The main objective of the present study was to further investigate self-esteem related emotional intensity processing in happy and anger faces. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while 27 high-esteem versus 27 low self-esteem participants carried out a visual oddball task, with neutral faces as the standard stimuli and deviant stimuli varying on valence (happy and anger) and intensity (40%, 70%, and 100% emotive) dimensions. The results showed only high self-esteem people, instead of those with low self-esteem, displayed significant emotion intensity effects for 100% than for 70% happy faces in P3 component. On the other hand, only people with low self-esteem exhibited pronounced intensity effects for anger faces in P3 amplitudes. Moreover, only people with low self-esteem displayed significant intensity effects for 100% compared to both 70% and 40% anger stimuli in N2 amplitudes at central sites. These findings indicate that high self-esteem individuals were typically more susceptible to highly as well as mildly positive stimuli yet less reactive to negative stimuli compared with people with low self-esteem."
