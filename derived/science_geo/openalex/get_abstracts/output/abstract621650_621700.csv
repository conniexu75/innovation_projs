Here, we identify imidazole propionate as a microbially produced histidine-derived metabolite that is present at higher concentrations in subjects with versus without type 2 diabetes. We show that imidazole propionate is produced from histidine in a gut simulator at higher concentrations when using fecal microbiota from subjects with versus without type 2 diabetes and that it impairs glucose tolerance when administered to mice. We further show that imidazole propionate impairs insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate through the activation of p38γ MAPK, which promotes p62 phosphorylation and, subsequently, activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We also demonstrate increased activation of p62 and mTORC1 in liver from subjects with type 2 diabetes.

Metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are associated with altered gut microbiota structure and function (Cotillard et al., 2013Cotillard A. Kennedy S.P. Kong L.C.

Studies assessing the effect of diet interventions on the microbiota have mostly focused on dietary fibers, which are precursors for bacterial fermentation, resulting in metabolites (short-chain fatty acids) that are associated with improved metabolism (Koh et al., 2016Koh A.

Of note, a recent study identified a gut bacterial pathway that can metabolize aromatic amino acids into bioactive compounds (Dodd et al., 2017Dodd D. Spitzer M.H. Van Treuren W. Merrill B.D. Hryckowian A.J. Higginbottom S.K. Le A. Cowan T.M. Nolan G.P. Fischbach M.A. Sonnenburg J.L. A gut bacterial pathway metabolizes aromatic amino acids into nine circulating metabolites.Nature. 2017; 551: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, there is little mechanistic insight into how amino acid-derived metabolites contribute to disease. Here, we identify imidazole propionate as a microbially produced amino acid-derived metabolite that is present at higher concentrations in the portal and peripheral blood of subjects with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we identify bacteria that can produce imidazole propionate from urocanate. Furthermore, we show that imidazole propionate can worsen glucose tolerance when administered to mice and impairs insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate (IRS). Finally, we characterize the underlying signaling pathways. Bacterial metabolites produced in the gut reach the liver through the portal vein and then enter the systemic circulation. To identify amino acid-derived microbial metabolites that may contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we first performed untargeted metabolomics on plasma obtained from portal blood of 5 obese subjects (body mass index [BMI] > 40) with type 2 diabetes and 10 BMI-matched subjects without type 2 diabetes (Table S1). Only four amino acid-derived metabolites (dopamine sulfate, glutamate, imidazole propionate, and N-acetylputrescine) were significantly higher [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1] in the portal plasma of subjects with type 2 diabetes (Table S2). To focus on microbial metabolites only, we then investigated levels of these four metabolites in the global metabolomics profile of plasma from C57BL/6J germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CONVR) mice. We showed that imidazole propionate but not glutamate was present at higher levels both in the portal vein and vena cava plasma from the CONVR mice (Figure 1A); dopamine sulfate and N-acetylputrescine were not detected. We next developed a targeted method for imidazole propionate measurements and verified that the peak in the mice plasma has the same retention time and fragmentation pattern as those of a synthetic reference substance (Figure S1A). Using this analytical protocol, we also showed that antibiotic treatment of the CONVR mice reduced circulating imidazole propionate levels without significantly affecting body weight (Figures S1B and S1C), confirming the role of the microbiota in production of imidazole propionate. Targeted measurements of imidazole propionate in plasma obtained from portal and peripheral blood from the initial human cohort: (1) confirmed that concentrations of imidazole propionate were higher in the portal plasma of subjects with type 2 diabetes, and (2) showed that concentrations of imidazole propionate were also higher in the peripheral plasma of subjects with type 2 diabetes compared with those without type 2 diabetes (Figure 1B).Figure S1Verification of Imidazole Propionate with Reference Substance and as a Microbiota-Dependent Metabolite, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Extracted ion chromatogram and fragmentation pattern of the imidazole propionate reference substance (CAS 1074-59-5, Santa Cruz; upper panel) and imidazole propionate (ImP) in a plasma sample from mice (lower panel).(B) Peripheral plasma levels of ImP or urocanate in CONVR mice administered with vehicle (Veh, drinking water, n = 5) or an antibiotic cocktail (Abx, n = 5) for 10 days.

To validate our observation of increased concentrations of imidazole propionate in the peripheral blood of those with type 2 diabetes, we recruited 649 middle-aged individuals from the Swedish population and divided them into four groups according to their level of glucose tolerance (Table S3). We observed significantly higher levels of imidazole propionate across the groups (p < 0.0001) and those with treatment-naive type 2 diabetes had higher levels of imidazole propionate compared with those with normal glucose tolerance after correcting for the potential confounding factors BMI, sex, and age (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1C). By contrast, the levels of its precursor, urocanate (Figure 1D), did not differ between the groups (Figure 1C). To directly address if imidazole propionate is a microbially produced metabolite, we monitored the kinetics of imidazole propionate production in an in vitro gut simulator (a continuously fed stabilized microbial community maintained in an anaerobic, reducing environment mimicking that of the gut). After 1 week stabilization of the microbial communities from obese subjects with or without type 2 diabetes from the first cohort (n = 2 per group), we challenged the communities with 10 mM histidine and measured the levels of imidazole propionate for 7 hr. The bacterial communities from subjects without type 2 diabetes barely produced imidazole propionate at any time point whereas the bacterial communities from subjects with type 2 diabetes produced imidazole propionate after 1.5 hr and continued to produce imidazole propionate at the 7 hr time point (Figure 2A). To validate these findings, we performed batch culture and compared imidazole propionate production from histidine in bacterial communities from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes (n = 5 per group from the first cohort and n = 3 per group from the second cohort). End-point measurements showed that higher concentrations of imidazole propionate were produced in the presence of the type 2 diabetes-associated microbiota (Figures 2B and 2C). These observations suggest that type 2 diabetes-associated microbiota shunts urocanate to a lesser-known pathway to produce imidazole propionate (Figure 1D). To identify bacteria that can produce imidazole propionate from urocanate, we performed large-scale screening for potential urocanate reductases (UrdAs) based on FAD-binding domains in the active sites (Figure S2A). We identified 812 UrdA homologs in bacterial genomes: 639 with conserved “H” and 173 without “H” (replaced with “Y” or “M”) (Figure S2B; Table S4). We showed that bacteria with “Y”- or “M”-UrdA homologs but not those with “H”-UrdA homologs produced imidazole propionate from urocanate (Figure 2D); thus bacteria with “Y”- or “M”-UrdA homologs are authentic UrdA. Using a previously published metagenomics dataset that included subjects with treatment-naive type 2 diabetes and subjects with normal glucose tolerance (Karlsson et al., 2013Karlsson F.H. Tremaroli V. Nookaew I. Bergström G. Behre C.J. Fagerberg B. Nielsen J. Bäckhed F. Gut metagenome in European women with normal, impaired and diabetic glucose control.Nature. 2013; 498: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar), we identified 42 bacterial strains with authentic UrdA, 28 (67%) of which were more abundant in subjects with type 2 diabetes (Figure 2E). We noted, for example, that Streptococcus mutans and Eggerthella lenta (at the strain level), which we verified as imidazole propionate producers in vitro (Figure 2D), were more abundant in subjects with type 2 diabetes (Figure 2E), supporting an association between imidazole propionate production and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. To directly test whether imidazole propionate could affect glucose metabolism, we injected vehicle or imidazole propionate intraperitoneally into GF mice for 3 days. We observed that this treatment increased circulating concentrations of imidazole propionate from 1.4 nM to around 13 nM without affecting urocanate concentrations (Figure 3A) and increased imidazole propionate levels in the liver (Figure S3A). The presence of low concentrations of imidazole propionate in vehicle-injected GF mice is likely explained by the fact that the chow diet fed to the mice contained imidazole propionate (Figure S3B). Importantly, glucose intolerance was induced in imidazole propionate-injected GF mice (Figure 3B), supporting a role for imidazole propionate as a plausible contributor to impaired glucose metabolism in vivo. However, insulin levels were not affected by imidazole propionate (Figure S3C). We also observed that hepatic expression of G6pase and Pepck, genes for key rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes, was significantly increased in imidazole propionate-injected GF mice compared with controls (Figure 3C). However, imidazole propionate did not affect hepatic expression of Srebp1c and Fasn, key lipogenic genes (Figure 3C).Figure S3Effects of Imidazole Propionate in Mice, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Levels of imidazole propionate (ImP) in the liver of GF mice after intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (Veh, 1% DMSO in water; n = 4) or ImP (500 μg; n = 4) twice per day for 3 days.(B) Levels of ImP and urocanate in chow diet (CD) and autoclaved CD.(C) Serum insulin levels during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test in GF mice injected with vehicle or ImP for 3 days.(D) Levels of ImP in the liver of CONVR mice after intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (n = 4) or ImP (100 μg; n = 4) twice per day for 3 days.(E–H) Effects of ImP on (E), body weight, (F), organ weights (liver and WAT), (G), food intake, and (H), insulin levels after 3-day treatment with vehicle or ImP (100 μg twice per day) in CONVR mice (n = 4).(I–K) Energy expenditure (I), average energy expenditure (J), and total locomotor activity (K) of CONVR mice injected with vehicle or ImP (100 μg twice per day) for 3 days (n = 4).(L–O) Effects of long-term ImP on (L), body weight, (M), liver and WAT weights, (N), insulin levels, and (O), circulating levels of ImP 14 days after implanting placebo or ImP pellets.(P) mRNA levels of Irs-1 and Irs-2 in the liver of GF mice after intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (n = 4) or ImP (500 μg; n = 5) twice per day for 3 days.(Q) Immunoblot of liver, soleus muscle, and WAT lysates from CONVR mice showing effect of 3-day treatment with vehicle or ImP (100 μg twice per day) on IRS (n = 3).(R) Immunoblot of liver, soleus muscle, and WAT lysates from CONVR mice showing effect of 14-day treatment with placebo or ImP (350 μg per day) on IRS (n = 3).Data in A-H, L-O are presented as boxplots and show minimum, 25% quartile, median, 75% quartile, and maximum.

We also showed that 3-day injections of imidazole propionate in CONVR mice increased concentrations of imidazole propionate in the circulation and in the liver (Figures 3D and S3D). Of note, imidazole propionate treatment impaired glucose tolerance (Figure 3E) without any significant effect on body weight, liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, food intake, or insulin levels (Figures S3E–S3H). Energy expenditure in the early dark phase was significantly reduced by imidazole propionate; however, total locomotor activity was not significantly reduced by imidazole propionate treatment (Figures S3I–S3K). By implanting slow-releasing pellets containing either placebo or imidazole propionate in CONVR mice, we showed that long-term treatment (14 days) with imidazole propionate caused significant impairment of glucose tolerance (Figure 3F) without affecting body weight, liver and WAT weight, or insulin levels (Figures S3L–S3O). We next investigated the effect of imidazole propionate injections on key proteins involved in insulin signaling in mice. We found that 3-day injections of imidazole propionate in GF mice did not affect hepatic levels of the insulin receptor (IR) or basal Akt phosphorylation (S473) but reduced hepatic levels of IRS1 and IRS2 (Figure 3G). These reductions occurred post-transcriptionally because there were no significant changes in hepatic Irs1 and Irs2 mRNA levels (Figure S3P). We also showed a reduction of IRS2 (but not IRS1) in muscle (Figure 3H) and of IRS1 (but not IRS2) in WAT (Figure 3I). Imidazole propionate treatment for 3 days did not affect IRS protein levels in CONVR mice (Figure S3Q). However, 14-day treatment with imidazole propionate reduced IRS2 levels in liver and muscle of CONVR mice without reducing IRS1 levels; a trend toward a reduction in IRS1 was observed in WAT, but IRS2 was not detected (Figure S3R). Previous reports have shown that insulin has different effects on IRS1 or IRS2 reduction depending on the cell type and even on the differentiation status of the same cell type (Rui et al., 2001Rui L. Fisher T.L. Thomas J. White M.F. Regulation of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling by proteasome-mediated degradation of insulin receptor substrate-2.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40362-40367Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of imidazole propionate on insulin signaling, we used primary hepatocytes. Incubation with imidazole propionate for 8 hr did not affect IRS1 levels but significantly blunted insulin-induced IRS1 Y612 phosphorylation (Figure 3J), which is required for insulin-stimulated activation of IRS1-associated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and downstream Akt (Esposito et al., 2001Esposito D.L. Li Y. Cama A. Quon M.J. Tyr(612) and Tyr(632) in human insulin receptor substrate-1 are important for full activation of insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and translocation of GLUT4 in adipose cells.Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that 20 hr incubation of hepatocytes with imidazole propionate reduced IRS1 and IRS2 levels (Figure 3K) and significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (Figure 3L). We also noted that IRS1 levels were reduced by 8 hr treatment of imidazole propionate in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (Figure 3M), indicating that imidazole propionate acts through a pathway that is conserved across cell types (although its effect was more rapidly induced in HEK293 cells than in primary hepatocytes). In addition, we showed that the imidazole propionate-induced reduction in IRS levels in HEK293 cells was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 3M), suggesting the involvement of a proteasome-dependent pathway. Together, these data show that imidazole propionate has negative impacts on insulin signaling at the level of IRS (i.e., inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation or reducing protein levels). We speculated that imidazole propionate inhibits insulin signaling through mTORC1, which is known to induce IRS serine phosphorylation leading to inhibition of IRS tyrosine phosphorylation and/or proteasomal degradation of IRS (Harrington et al., 2004Harrington L.S.

In agreement with our hypothesis, we showed that: (1) imidazole propionate as well as leucine, a well-known mTORC1 activator, increased phosphorylation of S6K1 (a marker of mTORC1 activation) in primary hepatocytes; and (2) rapamycin and torin 1 (inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC1/2, respectively) inhibited the imidazole propionate-induced increase in S6K1 phosphorylation and reduction in IRS levels (Figures 4A, S4A, and S4B).Figure S4Effects of Imidazole Propionate on mTORC1, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Imidazole propionate (ImP) as well as leucine induced mTORC1 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2899339826,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal RNA modification on mammalian messenger RNAs, regulates the fates and functions of modified transcripts through m6A-specific binding proteins1–5. In the nervous system, m6A is abundant and modulates various neural functions6–11. Whereas m6A marks groups of mRNAs for coordinated degradation in various physiological processes12–15, the relevance of m6A for mRNA translation in vivo remains largely unknown. Here we show that, through its binding protein YTHDF1, m6A promotes protein translation of target transcripts in response to neuronal stimuli in the adult mouse hippocampus, thereby facilitating learning and memory. Mice with genetic deletion of Ythdf1 show learning and memory defects as well as impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation. Re-expression of YTHDF1 in the hippocampus of adult Ythdf1-knockout mice rescues the behavioural and synaptic defects, whereas hippocampus-specific acute knockdown of Ythdf1 or Mettl3, which encodes the catalytic component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, recapitulates the hippocampal deficiency. Transcriptome-wide mapping of YTHDF1-binding sites and m6A sites on hippocampal mRNAs identified key neuronal genes. Nascent protein labelling and tether reporter assays in hippocampal neurons showed that YTHDF1 enhances protein synthesis in a neuronal-stimulus-dependent manner. In summary, YTHDF1 facilitates translation of m6A-methylated neuronal mRNAs in response to neuronal stimulation, and this process contributes to learning and memory. Neuronal stimulation induces protein translation of m6A-methylated neuronal mRNAs facilitated by YTHDF1, and this process contributes to learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2898732256,"Skeletal stem cells regulate bone growth and homeostasis by generating diverse cell types, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts and marrow stromal cells. The emerging concept postulates that there exists a distinct type of skeletal stem cell that is closely associated with the growth plate1-4, which is a type of cartilaginous tissue that has critical roles in bone elongation5. The resting zone maintains the growth plate by expressing parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which interacts with Indian hedgehog (Ihh) that is released from the hypertrophic zone6-10, and provides a source of other chondrocytes11. However, the identity of skeletal stem cells and how they are maintained in the growth plate are unknown. Here we show, in a mouse model, that skeletal stem cells are formed among PTHrP-positive chondrocytes within the resting zone of the postnatal growth plate. PTHrP-positive chondrocytes expressed a panel of markers for skeletal stem and progenitor cells, and uniquely possessed the properties of skeletal stem cells in cultured conditions. Cell-lineage analysis revealed that PTHrP-positive chondrocytes in the resting zone continued to form columnar chondrocytes in the long term; these chondrocytes underwent hypertrophy, and became osteoblasts and marrow stromal cells beneath the growth plate. Transit-amplifying chondrocytes in the proliferating zone-which was concertedly maintained by a forward signal from undifferentiated cells (PTHrP) and a reverse signal from hypertrophic cells (Ihh)-provided instructive cues to maintain the cell fates of PTHrP-positive chondrocytes in the resting zone. Our findings unravel a type of somatic stem cell that is initially unipotent and acquires multipotency at the post-mitotic stage, underscoring the malleable nature of the skeletal cell lineage. This system provides a model in which functionally dedicated stem cells and their niches are specified postnatally, and maintained throughout tissue growth by a tight feedback regulation system."
https://openalex.org/W2899148412,"Fundamental biological processes are carried out by curved epithelial sheets that enclose a pressurized lumen. How these sheets develop and withstand three-dimensional deformations has remained unclear. Here we combine measurements of epithelial tension and shape with theoretical modelling to show that epithelial sheets are active superelastic materials. We produce arrays of epithelial domes with controlled geometry. Quantification of luminal pressure and epithelial tension reveals a tensional plateau over several-fold areal strains. These extreme strains in the tissue are accommodated by highly heterogeneous strains at a cellular level, in seeming contradiction to the measured tensional uniformity. This phenomenon is reminiscent of superelasticity, a behaviour that is generally attributed to microscopic material instabilities in metal alloys. We show that in epithelial cells this instability is triggered by a stretch-induced dilution of the actin cortex, and is rescued by the intermediate filament network. Our study reveals a type of mechanical behaviour-which we term active superelasticity-that enables epithelial sheets to sustain extreme stretching under constant tension."
https://openalex.org/W2898723593,"Inactivation of ARID1A and other components of the nuclear SWI/SNF protein complex occurs at very high frequencies in a variety of human malignancies, suggesting a widespread role for the SWI/SNF complex in tumour suppression1. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF complex (ARID1A-SWI/SNF) operates as an inhibitor of the pro-oncogenic transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ2. Using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches in several cellular contexts, we show that YAP/TAZ are necessary to induce the effects of the inactivation of the SWI/SNF complex, such as cell proliferation, acquisition of stem cell-like traits and liver tumorigenesis. We found that YAP/TAZ form a complex with SWI/SNF; this interaction is mediated by ARID1A and is alternative to the association of YAP/TAZ with the DNA-binding platform TEAD. Cellular mechanotransduction regulates the association between ARID1A-SWI/SNF and YAP/TAZ. The inhibitory interaction of ARID1A-SWI/SNF and YAP/TAZ is predominant in cells that experience low mechanical signalling, in which loss of ARID1A rescues the association between YAP/TAZ and TEAD. At high mechanical stress, nuclear F-actin binds to ARID1A-SWI/SNF, thereby preventing the formation of the ARID1A-SWI/SNF-YAP/TAZ complex, in favour of an association between TEAD and YAP/TAZ. We propose that a dual requirement must be met to fully enable the YAP/TAZ responses: promotion of nuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ, for example, by loss of Hippo signalling, and inhibition of ARID1A-SWI/SNF, which can occur either through genetic inactivation or because of increased cell mechanics. This study offers a molecular framework in which mechanical signals that emerge at the tissue level together with genetic lesions activate YAP/TAZ to induce cell plasticity and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2898892095,"The serotonin 5-HT3 receptor is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC). It belongs to a large family of receptors that function as allosteric signal transducers across the plasma membrane1,2; upon binding of neurotransmitter molecules to extracellular sites, the receptors undergo complex conformational transitions that result in transient opening of a pore permeable to ions. 5-HT3 receptors are therapeutic targets for emesis and nausea, irritable bowel syndrome and depression3. In spite of several reported pLGIC structures4-8, no clear unifying view has emerged on the conformational transitions involved in channel gating. Here we report four cryo-electron microscopy structures of the full-length mouse 5-HT3 receptor in complex with the anti-emetic drug tropisetron, with serotonin, and with serotonin and a positive allosteric modulator, at resolutions ranging from 3.2 Å to 4.5 Å. The tropisetron-bound structure resembles those obtained with an inhibitory nanobody5 or without ligand9. The other structures include an 'open' state and two ligand-bound states. We present computational insights into the dynamics of the structures, their pore hydration and free-energy profiles, and characterize movements at the gate level and cation accessibility in the pore. Together, these data deepen our understanding of the gating mechanism of pLGICs and capture ligand binding in unprecedented detail."
https://openalex.org/W2898290173,"Understanding general principles that safeguard cellular identity should reveal critical insights into common mechanisms underlying specification of varied cell types. Here, we show that SUMO modification acts to stabilize cell fate in a variety of contexts. Hyposumoylation enhances pluripotency reprogramming in vitro and in vivo, increases lineage transdifferentiation, and facilitates leukemic cell differentiation. Suppressing sumoylation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) promotes their conversion into 2-cell-embryo-like (2C-like) cells. During reprogramming to pluripotency, SUMO functions on fibroblastic enhancers to retain somatic transcription factors together with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, thus impeding somatic enhancer inactivation. In contrast, in ESCs, SUMO functions on heterochromatin to silence the 2C program, maintaining both proper H3K9me3 levels genome-wide and repression of the Dux locus by triggering recruitment of the sumoylated PRC1.6 and Kap/Setdb1 repressive complexes. Together, these studies show that SUMO acts on chromatin as a glue to stabilize key determinants of somatic and pluripotent states."
https://openalex.org/W2899135228,"The 5-HT3A serotonin receptor1, a cationic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC), is the clinical target for management of nausea and vomiting associated with radiation and chemotherapies2. Upon binding, serotonin induces a global conformational change that encompasses the ligand-binding extracellular domain (ECD), the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the intracellular domain (ICD), the molecular details of which are unclear. Here we present two serotonin-bound structures of the full-length 5-HT3A receptor in distinct conformations at 3.32 A and 3.89 A resolution that reveal the mechanism underlying channel activation. In comparison to the apo 5-HT3A receptor, serotonin-bound states underwent a large twisting motion in the ECD and TMD, leading to the opening of a 165 A permeation pathway. Notably, this motion results in the creation of lateral portals for ion permeation at the interface of the TMD and ICD. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations, these structures provide novel insights into conformational coupling across domains and functional modulation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the serotonin-bound 5-HT3A serotonin receptor show the receptor populating two distinct states, characterized by twisting in the extracellular and transmembrane domains relative to the apo state, which creates pathways for ion permeation."
https://openalex.org/W2900248599,"Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been identified as a key regulator of tissue homeostasis. However, the precise role and regulatory mechanism of YAP in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. Here we report that the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of YAP repressed cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties, including tumorsphere-forming potential, cell motility, and chemoresistance in vitro, and was sufficient to attenuate tumor growth and CSC marker expression in ESCC xenografts. Mechanistically, YAP transcriptionally activated its downstream target SOX9 via TEAD1-mediated binding. We also observed a positive correlation between YAP signaling and SOX9 expression in two independent clinical cohorts. Intriguingly, YAP-targeting microRNAs, including miR-506-3p, which were induced by SOX9, post-transcriptionally repressed YAP expression, contributing to a negative feedback mechanism. Dual inhibition of YAP and SOX9 robustly suppressed malignant phenotypes. Notably, ESCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset had frequent (44%) instances of YAP gene amplification and genetic inactivation of Hippo pathway regulators. Nuclear YAP expression was elevated in 197 ESCC tissues from a Chinese cohort. Together, our findings provide evidence that genetic hyperactivation of YAP unbalances the YAP–SOX9 feedback loop and confers CSC-like features in ESCC, suggesting that this YAP–SOX9 circuit represents a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2900339210,"Introduction Over the past few decades, the total population of Nepal has increased substantially with rapid urbanization, changing lifestyle and disease patterns. There is anecdotal evidence that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and associated risk factors are becoming key public health challenges. Using nationally representative survey data, we estimated the prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity among Nepalese adults and explored socio-demographic factors associated with these conditions. Materials and methods We used the Nepal Demographic Health Survey 2016 data. Sample selection was based on stratified two-stage cluster sampling in rural areas and three stages in urban areas. Weight and height were measured in all adult women and men. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using Asian specific BMI cut-points. Results A total of 13,542 adults aged 18 years and above (women 58.19%) had their weight and height measured. The mean (±SD) age was 40.63±16.82 years (men 42.75±17.27, women 39.15±16.34); 41.13% had no formal education and 60.97% lived in urban areas. Overall, 17.27% (95% CI: 16.64–17.91) were underweight; 31.16% (95% CI: 30.38–31.94) overweight/obese. The prevalence of both underweight (women 18.30% and men 15.83%, p<0.001) and overweight/obesity (women 32.87% and men 28.77%, p<0.001) was higher among women. The older adults (≥65 years) (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.92–2.99, p<0.001) and the adults of poorest wealth quintile (aOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.62–2.59, p<0.001) were more likely to be underweight. The younger age adults (36–45 years) (aOR: 3.05, 95% CI: 2.61–3.57, p<0.001) and women (aOR: 1.53, 95% CI 1.39–1.68, p<0.001) were more likely to be overweight or obese. Also, all adults were twice likely to overweight/obese (p<0.001). No significant difference was observed for overweight/obesity by ecological regions and place of residence (urban vs. rural). Conclusion These findings confirm co-existence of double burden of underweight and overweight/obesity among Nepalese adults. These conditions are associated with increased risk of developing NCDs. Therefore, effective public health intervention approaches emphasizing improved primary health care systems for NCDs prevention and care and using multi-sectoral approach, is essential."
https://openalex.org/W2900108620,"Many of the Somali women who have immigrated to other countries, including Canada, have experienced Female Genital Circumcision/ Mutilation/ Cutting (FGC). While there is literature on the medical aspects of FGC, we were interested in understanding the daily life experiences and bodily sensations of Somali-Canadian women in the context of FGC. Fourteen women living in the Greater Toronto Area were interviewed. Interview data were analyzed using a phenomenological approach. We found that the memory of the ceremonial cutting was vivid but was frequently described with acceptance and resignation–as something that just is; that was normal given the particular context, familial and cultural, and their young age. Most of the women recounted experiencing pain and discomfort throughout their adult lives but were intent on not noticing or giving the pain any power; they considered themselves healthy. The following themes emerged from our interviews: Every Body Had It: Discussing FGC, I’m Normal Aren’t I?, and Feeling in My Body–all themes that work at normalizing their bodies in a society that they know views them as different. They dealt with both pain and pleasure in the context of their busy lives suggesting resilience in spite of the day-to-day difficulties of daily life."
https://openalex.org/W2900274977,"The neonatal brain undergoes rapid maturational changes that facilitate the normal development of the nervous system and also affect the pathological response to brain injury. Electroencephalography (EEG) and analysis of sleep-wake vigilance states provide important insights into the function of the normal and diseased immature brain. While developmental changes in EEG and vigilance states are well-described in people, less is known about the normal maturational properties of rodent EEG, including the emergence and evolution of sleep-awake vigilance states. In particular, a number of developmental EEG studies have been performed in rats, but there is limited comparable research in neonatal mice, especially as it pertains to longitudinal EEG studies performed within the same mouse. In this study, we have attempted to provide a relatively comprehensive assessment of developmental changes in EEG background activity and vigilance states in wild-type mice from postnatal days 9–21. A novel EEG and EMG method allowed serial recording from the same mouse pups. EEG continuity and power and vigilance states were analyzed by quantitative assessment and fast Fourier transforms. During this developmental period, we demonstrate the timing of maturational changes in EEG background continuity, frequencies, and power and the emergence of identifiable wake, NREM, and REM sleep states. These results should serve as important control data for physiological studies of mouse models of normal brain development and neurological disease."
https://openalex.org/W2899904163,"Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular cancer in children. While the primary tumor can often be treated by local or systemic chemotherapy, metastatic dissemination is generally resistant to therapy and remains a leading cause of pediatric cancer death in much of the world. In order to identify new therapeutic targets in aggressive tumors, we sequenced RNA transcripts in five snap frozen retinoblastomas which invaded the optic nerve and five which did not. A three-fold increase was noted in mRNA levels of ACVR1C/ALK7, a type I receptor of the TGF-β family, in invasive retinoblastomas, while downregulation of DACT2 and LEFTY2, negative modulators of the ACVR1C signaling, was observed in most invasive tumors. A two- to three-fold increase in ACVR1C mRNA was also found in invasive WERI Rb1 and Y79 cells as compared to non-invasive cells in vitro. Transcripts of ACVR1C receptor and its ligands (Nodal, Activin A/B, and GDF3) were expressed in six retinoblastoma lines, and evidence of downstream SMAD2 signaling was present in all these lines. Pharmacological inhibition of ACVR1C signaling using SB505124, or genetic downregulation of the receptor using shRNA potently suppressed invasion, growth, survival, and reduced the protein levels of the mesenchymal markers ZEB1 and Snail. The inhibitory effects on invasion, growth, and proliferation were recapitulated by knocking down SMAD2, but not SMAD3. Finally, in an orthotopic zebrafish model of retinoblastoma, a 55% decrease in tumor spread was noted (p = 0.0026) when larvae were treated with 3 µM of SB505124, as compared to DMSO. Similarly, knockdown of ACVR1C in injected tumor cells using shRNA also resulted in a 54% reduction in tumor dissemination in the zebrafish eye as compared to scrambled shRNA control (p = 0.0005). Our data support a role for the ACVR1C/SMAD2 pathway in promoting invasion and growth of retinoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2899802502,"Background Mitogen activated-protein kinase pathway inhibitors (MAPKis) improve treatment outcome in patients with disseminated BRAFV600 mutant cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) but responses are of limited duration due to emerging resistance. Although extensive research in mechanisms of resistance is being performed, predictive biomarkers for durable responses are still lacking. We used miRNA qPCR to investigate if different levels of extracellular microvesicle microRNA (EV miRNA) in matched plasma samples collected from patients with metastatic IV BRAFV600 mutated CMM before, during and after therapy with MAPKis could serve as predictive biomarkers. Materials and methods EV miRNAs were extracted from plasma samples from 28 patients collected before and during therapy, measured by quantitative PCR-array and correlated to therapy outcome. Results Increased levels of EV let-7g-5p during treatment compared to before treatment (EV let-7g-5p_delta) were associated with better disease control with MAPKis (odds ratio 8568.4, 95% CI = 4.8–1.5e+07, P = 0.000036). Elevated levels of EV miR-497-5p during therapy were associated with prolonged progression free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.13–0.52, P <0.000061). Conclusions EV miRNAs let-7g-5p and miR-497-5p were identified as putative novel predictive biomarkers of MAPKi treatment benefit in metastatic CMM patients highlighting the potential relevance of assessing EV miRNA during and after treatment to unravel novel mechanisms of resistance."

This study aimed to evaluate whether an HIIRT session causes muscle and kidney damage.Fifty-eight healthy volunteers (median age 24 years, 50% women) participated in this study and performed a HIIRT session. The Borg CR10 scale for pain (CR10P) and blood and urine samples were collected before (baseline) and 2 and 24 hours after the HIIRT session. Blood samples were analyzed for serum creatinine (SCr), creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin. Urine samples were assessed for creatinine, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, interleukin 18, calbindin, microalbuminuria, trefoil factor-3 and β-2 microglobulin.CR10P had a significant increase at 2 and 24 hours post-workout, and CK increased significantly at 2 hours and increased further at 24 hours. Myoglobin increased significantly at 2 hours and remained elevated at 24 hours. SCr increased modestly but significantly at 24 hours only in men. Three men met the KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury. The urinary kidney injury biomarkers increased significantly at 2 hours and returned to the baseline values 24 hours after HIIRT.A single HIIRT session caused early and significant elevations in CK, myoglobin, SCr, microalbuminuria and urinary biomarkers indicative of kidney tubular injury, suggesting the occurrence of muscle and kidney damage."
https://openalex.org/W2900057207,"Background and objectives People with personality disorders are prevalent in emergency and inpatient mental health services. We examined whether implementing a stepped care model of psychological therapy reduces demand on hospital units by people with personality disorder, in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Method A total of 642 inpatients (average age 36.8, 50.5% female) with a primary ICD-10 personality disorder were recruited during 18 months baseline, then monitored during an 18 month active trial phase. In the active trial phase two equivalent sites were randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU), or a whole of service intervention that diverted people away from hospital and into stepped care psychological therapy clinics. The study design was cost neutral, with no additional staff or resources deployed between sites. A linear mixed models analysis evaluated outcomes. Results As predicted, demand on hospital services reduced significantly in the intervention compared to TAU site. The intervention site evidenced shorter bed days, from an average of 13.46 days at baseline to 4.28 days per admission, and patients were 1.3 times less likely to re-present to the emergency department compared to TAU. Direct cost savings for implementing the approach was estimated at USD$2,720 per patient per year. Limitations included not directly comparing individual symptom changes. Conclusions Using a whole of service stepped care model of treatment for personality disorder significantly reduced demand on hospital services."
https://openalex.org/W2899801449,"The mechanisms leading to self-assembly of misfolded proteins into amyloid aggregates have been studied extensively in the test tube under well-controlled conditions. However, to what extent these processes are representative of those in the cellular environment remains unclear. Using super-resolution imaging of live cells, we show here that an amyloidogenic polyglutamine-containing protein first forms small, amorphous aggregate clusters in the cytosol, chiefly by diffusion. Dynamic interactions among these clusters limited their elongation and led to structures with a branched morphology, differing from the predominantly linear fibrils observed in vitro Some of these clusters then assembled via active transport at the microtubule-organizing center and thereby initiated the formation of perinuclear aggresomes. Although it is widely believed that aggresome formation is entirely governed by active transport along microtubules, here we demonstrate, using a combined approach of advanced imaging and mathematical modeling, that diffusion is the principal mechanism driving aggresome expansion. We found that the increasing surface area of the expanding aggresome increases the rate of accretion caused by diffusion of cytosolic aggregates and that this pathway soon dominates aggresome assembly. Our findings lead to a different view of aggresome formation than that proposed previously. We also show that aggresomes mature over time, becoming more compacted as the structure grows. The presence of large perinuclear aggregates profoundly affects the behavior and health of the cell, and our super-resolution imaging results indicate that aggresome formation and development are governed by highly dynamic processes that could be important for the design of potential therapeutic strategies."

These restrictions are poorly suited for monitoring the development of living elasmobranchs inside their egg cases. There are two major aims of this study. The first was to observe elasmobranch embryonic development non-invasively and produce a non-invasive developmental key for identifying the life stages for an elasmobranch inside the egg case. To this end, 7 key developmental stages were identified for the greater spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus stellaris, and are provided here with diagrams from multiple perspectives to demonstrate the key features of each stage. The physiological and ecological relevance of each stage are discussed in terms of structure and function for embryonic survival in the harsh intertidal zone. Also discussed is the importance of the egg case membrane and the protective embryonic jelly. The second aim of the study was to understand the applicability of the 7 developmental stages from S. stellaris to other oviparous elasmobranchs. Thus, changes in embryonic body size and egg yolk volume at each stage were measured and compared with those of the closely related, lesser spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus canicula. We find nearly identical growth patterns and yolk consumption patterns in both species across the 7 developmental stages. Thus, although the 7 developmental stages have been constructed in reference to the greater spotted catshark, we suggest that it can be applied to other oviparous elasmobranch species with only minor modification."

The project´s main goal was to describe differential use of available crossing structures (wildlife underpasses and culverts) by mammals present along this highway. We set 28 camera traps along the 54km stretch of the highway covering wildlife underpasses (10), and culverts such as box culverts (9) and pipes (9) from September 2016 until March 2017. A total of 24 jaguar crossings have been recorded exclusively using wildlife underpasses, including four males and two females. At least 18 other mammal species including five of the target priority species (protected by Mexican law) were documented, all of which were native except for two invasive species. In terms of species using the crossing structures, we identified 13 species using wildlife underpasses, nine using concrete box culverts and 10 using concrete pipes. Wildlife underpasses show higher diversity values (Shannon´s exponential index = 5.8 and Inverse Simpson´s index = 4.66) compared to culverts because they allow bigger species to cross. We recommend more highways along the jaguar´s distribution should develop mitigation measures to allow for wildlife connectivity. Wildlife underpasses, along with retrofitted culverts, could help secure not only the permanence of this species by facilitating the functional connectivity between populations but have positive impacts on other neotropical mammalian fauna as well."
https://openalex.org/W2899958799,"The clinically approved drug metformin has been shown to selectively kill persister cancer cells through mechanisms that are not fully understood. To provide further mechanistic insights, we developed a drug surrogate that phenocopies metformin and can be labeled in situ by means of click chemistry. Firstly, we found this molecule to be more potent than metformin in several cancer cell models. Secondly, this technology enabled us to provide visual evidence of mitochondrial targeting with this class of drugs. A combination of fluorescence microscopy and cyclic voltammetry indicated that metformin targets mitochondrial copper, inducing the production of reactive oxygen species in this organelle, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Importantly, this study revealed that mitochondrial copper is required for the maintenance of a mesenchymal state of human cancer cells, and that metformin can block the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a biological process that normally accounts for the genesis of persister cancer cells, through direct copper targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2899769766,"Leishmaniasis is amongst the most important neglected diseases, afflicting more than 12 million people in 88 countries. There is an urgent need for safe orally bioavailable and cost-effective drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis. It has recently been shown that Leishmania activates host macrophage serine/threonine kinase Akt, to promote survival of both parasites and infected cells. Here, we sought to evaluate a compound, Miransertib (ARQ 092), an orally bioavailable and selective allosteric Akt inhibitor currently in clinical trials for patients with PI3K/Akt-driven tumors or Proteus syndrome. Miransertib was tested against Leishmania donovani and Leishmania amazonensis, causative agents of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. Cultured promastigotes were susceptible to Miransertib. In addition, Miransertib was markedly effective against intracellular amastigotes of L. donovani or L. amazonensis-infected macrophages. Miransertib also enhanced mTOR dependent autophagy in Leishmania-infected macrophages, which may represent one mechanism of Miransertib-mediated killing of intracellular Leishmania. Whereas parasite clearance in the spleen of mice infected with L. donovani and treated with Miransertib was comparable to that when treated with miltefosine, Miransertib caused a greater reduction in the parasite load in the liver. In the cutaneous leishmaniasis infection model, lesions were reduced by 40% as compared to mock treated mice. Together, these results provide direct evidence to support the conclusion that Miransertib is an excellent lead compound for the development of a new oral drug therapy for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis."

Cells were pelleted as co- or monocell spheroids and placed within 1-mm-drill defects in the mid-diaphysis of E18 chick femurs and cultured organotypically for 10 d. Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed significantly ( P = 0.0001) increased levels of bone volume (BV) and BV/tissue volume ratio in all cell-pellet groups compared with the sham defect group. The highest increase was seen in BV in femurs containing the HUVEC and HBMSC monocell constructs. Type II collagen expression was particularly pronounced within the cell spheres containing HBMSCs and HUVECs, and CD31-positive cell clusters were prominent within HUVEC-implanted defects.

https://openalex.org/W2900167232,"Immunotherapy approaches stand out as innovative strategies to eradicate tumor cells. Among them, PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy is considered one of the most successful advances in the history of cancer immunotherapy. We used our technology of Polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins (PPRHs) for silencing both genes with the aim to provoke the elimination of tumor cells by macrophages in co-culture experiments. Incubation of PPRHs against PD-1 and PD-L1 decreased the levels of mRNA and protein in THP-1 monocytes and PC3 prostate cancer cells, respectively. Viability of THP-1 cells and macrophages obtained by PMA-differentiation of THP-1 cells was not affected upon incubation with the different PPRHs. On the other hand, PC3 cell survival was partially decreased by PPRHs against PD-L1. The greatest effect in decreasing cell viability was obtained in macrophages/PC3 co-culture experiments by combining PPRHs against PD-1 and PD-L1. This effect was also observed in other cancer cell lines: HeLa, SKBR3 and to a minor extent in M21. Apoptosis was not detected when macrophages were treated with the different PPRHs. However, co-cultures of macrophages with the four cancer cell lines treated with PPRHs showed an increase in apoptosis. The order of fold-increase in apoptosis was HeLa > PC3 > SKBR3 > M21. This study demonstrates that PPRHs could be powerful pharmacological agents to use in immunotherapy approaches for the inhibition of PD-1 and PD-L1."
https://openalex.org/W2900270862,"This study aimed at developing a revised validated version of the Young Parenting Inventory (YPI) known as YPI-R2 that had 17 theoretical subscales. Using separate ratings for fathers and mothers samples from Singapore (n = 582, 617), Manila (n = 520, 538), Jakarta (n = 366, 383), and the USA (n = 204, 214), exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted. This resulted in five subscales for fathers and six for mothers. The 17 theoretical subscales were not supported. Construct, convergent, and divergent validity of this new revised alternative YPI-R2 were also demonstrated. The stringent incremental validity test showed that the YPI-R2 accounted for additional statistically significant variance over and above that contributed by gender and three other established parenting instruments in predicting clinically relevant outcomes. Partial invariance of its factor structure was demonstrated through multigroup CFA using Eastern and Western samples. Finally, significant correlations with the 18 Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMSs) supported a central tenet of schema therapy that these are associated with early negative parenting patterns. Parenting norms in both Eastern and Western cultures that were associated with ill-being were also discussed thus showing the cross-cultural relevance of the YPI-R2."
https://openalex.org/W2899816729,"Background There was no available data concerning the clinical differentiation between the updated definition of early chronic pancreatitis (ECP) and anti-acid therapy-resistant functional dyspepsia (RFD). Aims We aimed to determine whether clinical symptoms, gastric motility, psychogenic factors and fat intake can help distinguish early chronic pancreatitis (ECP) from anti-acid therapy-resistant functional dyspepsia patients with pancreatic enzyme abnormalities (RFD-P) and anti-acid therapy-resistant functional dyspepsia (RFD) patients using endosonography. Methods We enrolled 102 consecutive patients presenting with typical symptoms of RFD patients (n = 52), ECP patients (n = 25) and RFD-P patients (n = 25). ECP patients were diagnosed based on the criteria recommended by the Japan Pancreatic Association. Gastric motility was evaluated by 13C-acetate breath tests. Severity of duodenal inflammation was examined. Results 24.5% of RFD patients were determined as ECP using endosonography. Abdominal pain score in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) in the patients with ECP was significantly lower compared to that in the patients with RFD-P. There were no significant differences in State-Trait Inventory (STAI)-state/-trait scores, Self-Rating Questionnaire for Depression (SRQ-D) scores and clinical symptoms for fat intake among three groups. The early phase of gastric emptying (AUC5; AUC15) in ECP and RFD-P patients were significantly disturbed compared to those in RFD patients. Conclusions Evaluation of severity of abdominal pain and measurement of the early phase of gastric emptying will be useful tools to distinguish ECP patients from RFD patients. Accurate diagnosis of ECP patients may contribute to the prevention from advancing of chronic pancreatitis."

To further assess the biological role of MET in prostate cancer progression, we bred H11Met/+/PtenLoxP/LoxP:PBCre4 compound mice, in which transgenic Met expression and deletion of the tumor suppressor gene Pten occurred simultaneously only in prostatic epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2900040327,"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia type 1 (CPVT1) predisposes to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) during high heart rates due to physical or psychological stress. The essential role of catecholaminergic effects on ventricular cardiomyocytes in this situation is well documented, but the importance of heart rate per se for arrhythmia initiation in CPVT1 is largely unexplored.Sixteen CPVT1 patients performed a bicycle stress-test. Occurrence of VT triggers, i.e. premature ventricular complexes (PVC), depended on high heart rate, with individual thresholds. Atrial pacing above the individual PVC threshold in three patients did not induce PVCs. The underlying mechanism for the clinical observation was explored using cardiomyocytes from mice with the RyR2-R2474S (RyR2-RS) mutation, which exhibit exercise-induced VTs. While rapid pacing increased the number of Ca2+ waves in both RyR2-RS and wild-type (p<0.05), β-adrenoceptor (βAR) stimulation induced more Ca2+ waves in RyR2-RS (p<0.05). Notably, Ca2+ waves occurred despite decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content in RyR2-RS (p<0.05), suggesting increased cytosolic RyR2 Ca2+ sensitivity. A computational model of mouse ventricular cardiomyocyte electrophysiology reproduced the cellular CPVT1 phenotype when RyR2 Ca2+ sensitivity was increased. Importantly, diastolic fluctuations in phosphorylation of RyR2 and SR Ca2+ content determined Ca2+ wave initiation. These factors were modulated towards increased propensity for arrhythmia initiation by increased pacing rates, but even more by βAR stimulation.In CPVT1, VT propensity depends on individual heart rate thresholds for PVCs. Through converging data from clinical exercise stress-testing, cellular studies and computational modelling, we confirm the heart rate-independent pro-arrhythmic effects of βAR stimulation in CPVT1, but also identify an independent and synergistic contribution from effects of high heart rate."

In the last two decades, the hand-rearing of penguin chicks that were abandoned by their parents due to oil spills or other circumstances has become a valuable conservation tool to limit mortality and to bolster the population at specific colonies. We summarize and evaluate the techniques employed by the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) to incubate and hand-rear African penguin eggs and chicks. From 2012 to 2016, a total of 694 eggs and 2819 chicks were received by SANCCOB’s Chick Rearing Unit. It was estimated that 13% of the eggs were infertile, and 81% of the fertile eggs hatched successfully. The overall release rate for chicks was 77%, with a higher release rate for chicks that were pre-emptively removed (93%) followed by chicks that had been abandoned by their parents (78%), chicks admitted due to avian pox lesions (61%), chicks that hatched from artificially-incubated eggs (57%), and chicks admitted due to injuries or deformities (25%). Rescuing and hand-rearing eggs and chicks has been a successful strategy for African penguins, and might be also applicable for the conservation of other threatened seabird species whose population are critically low or during natural or anthropogenic events that could have disastrous population impacts (e.g. oil spills, disease outbreaks, catastrophic weather events, strong El Niño years, etc.)."

However, It can hardly to generatea truerandom key by using the existing technologies and methods, and it is also difficult to issue and store the random keywhich is at least as long as the plaintext. Therefore, we pay more attention to the logical operation used in the encryption and decryption but not to how to generate the random key. The calculator, a three-dimensional DNA self-assembly pyramid structure, is designed to construct four common logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) by programming DNA interactions. And two novel one-time-pad cryptography schemes, a single-bit one-time-pad algorithm and improved double-bit one-time-pad algorithm, are proposed based on the calculator. The security fragments, used to construct the three-dimensional DNA self-assembly pyramid structure, are intercepted from a reference chain which is selected from the DNA database. All of the interception parameters are transmitted to recipient by hiding in DNA sequences. Only the authorized user can get all secret parameters to reconstruct the structure. The secret random key sequences for the two one-time-pad cryptography algorithms are generated by using logistic map. It only needs to share two parameters and thresholding function in sender and recipient without code books. The simulation results and security analysis show that the encryption algorithms are effective and can provide higher computational complexity as well as a reduced cracking probability except for the difficult of biological experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2899781427,"Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a fatty acid ethanolamide (FAE), is a lipid mediator that controls food intake and lipid metabolism. Accumulating data imply the importance of intestinal OEA in controlling satiety in addition to gastrointestinal peptide hormones. Although the biochemical pathway of FAE production has been illustrated, the enzymes responsible for the cleavage of OEA from its precursor N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) must be identified among reported candidates in the gut. In this study, we assessed the involvement of NAPE-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), which can directly release FAEs from NAPE, in intestinal OEA synthesis and lipid metabolism. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPER-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated deletion of the NAPE-PLD gene in intestinal epithelial-like Caco-2 cells reduced OEA levels, regardless of their differentiation states. Transcriptome analysis revealed that deletion of NAPE-PLD activates a transcriptional program for nutrient transportation, including lipids and lipoproteins, and inactivates cell-cycle or mitosis-related genes in Caco-2 cells. In addition, the basolateral secretion of lipoproteins was increased in NAPE-PLD-deleted cells although lipoprotein size was not affected. By contrast, cellular lipid levels were reduced in NAPE-PLD-deleted cells. Overall, these results indicate that NAPE-PLD plays important roles in OEA synthesis and fat absorption by regulating lipoprotein production in the intestinal epithelial cells.-Igarashi, M., Watanabe, K., Tsuduki, T., Kimura, I., Kubota, N.

https://openalex.org/W2900168875,"The QT interval is an important diagnostic feature on surface electrocardiograms because it reflects the duration of the ventricular action potential. A previous genome-wide association study has reported a significant linkage between a single-nucleotide polymorphism ∼11.7 kb downstream of the gene encoding the RING finger ubiquitin ligase rififylin (RFFL) and variability in the QT interval. This, along with results in animal studies, suggests that RFFL may have effects on cardiac repolarization. Here, we sought to determine the role of RFFL in cardiac electrophysiology. Adult rabbit cardiomyocytes with adenovirus-expressed RFFL exhibited reduced rapid delayed rectifier current (IKr). Neonatal rabbit cardiomyocytes transduced with RFFL-expressing adenovirus exhibited reduced total expression of the potassium channel ether-a-go-go-related gene (rbERG). Using transfections of 293A cells and Western blotting experiments, we observed that RFFL and the core-glycosylated form of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel interact. Furthermore, RFFL overexpression led to increased polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of hERG protein and to an almost complete disappearance of IKr, which depended on the intact RING domain of RFFL. Blocking the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway with a dominant-negative form of the ERAD core component, valosin-containing protein (VCP), in 293A cells partially abolished RFFL-mediated hERG degradation. We further substantiated the link between RFFL and ERAD by showing an interaction between RFFL and VCP in vitro. We conclude that RFFL is an important regulator of voltage-gated hERG potassium channel activity and therefore cardiac repolarization and that this ubiquitination-mediated regulation requires parts of the ERAD pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2900292681,"Cyanuric acid is a common environmental contaminant and a metabolic intermediate in the catabolism of s-triazine compounds, including atrazine and other herbicides. Cyanuric acid is catabolized via a number of bacterial pathways, including one first identified in Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, which is encoded by a single, five-gene operon (atzDGEHF) found on a self-transmissible plasmid. The discovery of two of the five genes (atzG and atzH) was reported in 2018 and although the function of atzG was determined, the role of atzH was unclear. Here, we present the first in vitro reconstruction of the complete, five-protein cyanuric acid catabolism pathway, which indicates that AtzH may be an amidase responsible for converting 1,3-dicarboxyurea (the AtzE product) to allophanate (the AtzF substrate). We have solved the AtzH structure (a DUF3225 protein from the NTF2 superfamily) and used it to predict the substrate-binding pocket. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that two residues (Tyr22 and Arg46) are needed for catalysis. We also show that atzH homologs are commonly found in Proteobacteria associated with homologs of the atzG and atzE genes. The genetic context of these atzG-atzE-atzH clusters imply that they have a role in the catabolism of nitrogenous compounds. Moreover, their presence in many genomes in the absence of homologs of atzD and atzF suggests that the atzG-atzE-atzH cluster may pre-date the evolution of the cyanuric acid catabolism operon."
https://openalex.org/W2900391797,"Whiteflies are among the world’s most significant agricultural pests and chemical insecticides are extensively used to reduce crop damage to acceptable levels. However, nearly all insecticides pose a threat to the environment and alternative control methods, such as breeding of crop varieties that are inherently insect-resistant, are needed. Previously, a strong source of plant-age dependent resistance to the cabbage whitefly (Aleyrodes proletella) has been identified in the modern white cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) variety Rivera. However, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms or the genes involved in this resistance. In the present study, a multidisciplinary approach combining transcriptome and metabolome profiling with genetic mapping was used to identify the molecular players of whitefly resistance in cabbage. Transcriptome profiles of young (susceptible) and older (resistant) Rivera plants were analyzed using RNA sequencing. While many genes involved in general processes were differentially expressed between both ages, several defense-related processes were overrepresented in the transcriptome profile of older plants. Hormone measurements revealed that jasmonic acid (JA) levels decreased upon whitefly infestation at both plant ages. Interestingly, abscisic acid (ABA) levels showed contrasting effects in response to whitefly infestation: ABA levels were reduced in young plants but induced in older plants upon whitefly feeding. Auxin levels were significantly lower in older plants compared with young plants, independent of whitefly presence, while glucosinolate levels were higher. Additionally, whitefly performance was monitored in an F2 population derived from a cross between Rivera and the susceptible white cabbage variety Christmas Drumhead. Significant QTL intervals were mapped on chromosome 2 and 9 for oviposition rate and whitefly adult survival, respectively. Several genes that were higher expressed in older plants and located in the identified QTL intervals were orthologous to Arabidopsis genes that have been related to ABA signaling, suggesting a role for ABA in the regulation of resistance towards whiteflies. Our results show that combining different omics approaches is a useful strategy to identify candidate genes underlying insect resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2900420975,"Cerebral injury after cardiac arrest (CA)/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been implicated in the poor prognosis of CA survivors. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of melatonin on postresuscitation neurological outcomes and to explore the underlying mechanism. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham group, CPR group, melatonin pretreatment group (Pre-M) and posttreatment group (Post-M). For the last 2 groups, daily melatonin gavage was performed for 12 consecutive days before or 24 hours after rat survival from CA/CPR. No statistical differences were observed in heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) at baseline and after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) among groups. However, melatonin pretreatment or posttreatment significantly improved neurological deficit score and memory and spatial learning ability after CA/CPR. Further studies demonstrated that the complex I- and complex-II supported mitochondrial respiration were greatly increased under melatonin treatment. In addition, melatonin treatment preserved the mitochondrial-binding hexokinase II (HKII) and ATP levels and suppressed the upregulated protein lysine acetylation in hippocampus after CA/CPR. In conclusion, using a rat asphyxial CA model we have demonstrated that treatment with melatonin either before or after CA/CPR provides a promising neuroprotective effect, and this protection was mediated by increasing mitochondrial HKII expression, suppressing protein acetylation and improving mitochondrial function in hippocampus."

We indicated that PTL was suppressed in Cx3cr1-/- mice and immunoneutralization of CX3CL1 in WT mice. From immunohistochemical and the gene expression analyses, the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis has detrimental roles in PTL through intrauterine recruitment of macrophages and the enhancement of macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators. Thus, the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis may be a good molecular target for preventing PTL."

Prior research has demonstrated the impact of social network characteristics on health facility delivery in sub-Saharan Africa. However, in-depth examination of the function of all members in a woman’s network, in providing various types of support for the woman’s pregnancy and related care, is limited. We qualitatively explore how women’s network social support influences facility delivery. Qualitative data came from a mixed methods evaluation of a Maternal and Newborn Health Referral project in Ghana. In 2015 we conducted in-depth interviews with mothers (n = 40) and husbands (n = 20), and 4 focus group interviews with mothers-in-law. Data were analyzed using narrative summaries and thematic coding procedures to first examine women’s network composition during their pregnancy and childbirth experiences. We then compared those who had homebirths versus facility births on how network social support influenced their place of childbirth. Various network members were involved in providing women with social support. We found differences in how informational and instrumental support impacted women’s place of childbirth. Network members of women who had facility delivery mobilized resources to support women’s facility delivery. Among women who had homebirth but their network members advocated for them to have facility delivery, members delayed making arrangements for the women’s facility delivery. Women who had homebirth, and their network members advocated homebirth, received support to give birth at home. Network support for women’s pregnancy-related care affects their place of childbirth. Hence, maternal health interventions must develop strategies to prioritize informational and instrumental support for facility-based pregnancy and delivery care."
https://openalex.org/W2950852199,"Quantification of interictal spikes in EEG may provide insight on epilepsy disease burden, but manual quantification of spikes is time-consuming and subject to bias. We present a probability-based, automated method for the classification and quantification of interictal events, using EEG data from kainate- and saline-injected mice (C57BL/6J background) several weeks post-treatment. We first detected high-amplitude events, then projected event waveforms into Principal Components space and identified clusters of spike morphologies using a Gaussian Mixture Model. We calculated the odds-ratio of events from kainate- versus saline-treated mice within each cluster, converted these values to probability scores, P(kainate), and calculated an Hourly Epilepsy Index for each animal by summing the probabilities for events where the cluster P(kainate) > 0.5 and dividing the resultant sum by the record duration. This Index is predictive of whether an animal received an epileptogenic treatment (i.e., kainate), even if a seizure was never observed. We applied this method to an out-of-sample dataset to assess epileptiform spike morphologies in five kainate mice monitored for ~1 month. The magnitude of the Index increased over time in a subset of animals and revealed changes in the prevalence of epileptiform (P(kainate) > 0.5) spike morphologies. Importantly, in both data sets, animals that had electrographic seizures also had a high Index. This analysis is fast, unbiased, and provides information regarding the salience of spike morphologies for disease progression. Future refinement will allow a better understanding of the definition of interictal spikes in quantitative and unambiguous terms."

We are the first who studied the influence of homo-repeats with lengths larger than four amino acid residues on the aggregation properties of 1449683 proteins across 122 eukaryotic and bacterial proteomes. Only 15% of proteins (215481) include homo-repeats of such length. We demonstrated that RNA-binding proteins with a prion-like domain are enriched with homo-repeats in comparison with other non-redundant protein sequences and those in the PDB. We performed a bioinformatics analysis for these proteins and found that proteins with homo-repeats are on average two times longer than those in the whole database. Moreover, we are first to discover that as a rule, homo-repeats appear in proteins not alone but in pairs: hydrophobic and aromatic homo-repeats appear with similar ones, while homo-repeats with small, polar and charged amino acids appear together with different preferences. We elaborated a new complementary approach to demonstrate the influence of homo-repeats on their host protein aggregation properties. We have shown that addition of artificial homo-repeats to natural and random proteins results in intensification of aggregation properties of the proteins. The maximal effect is observed for the insertion of artificial homo-repeats with 5–6 residues, which is consistent with the minimal length of an amyloidogenic region. We have also demonstrated that the ability of proteins with homo-repeats to aggregate cannot be explained only by the presence of long homo-repeats in them. There should be other characteristics of proteins intensifying the aggregation property including such as the appearance of homo-repeats in pairs in the same protein. We are the first who elaborated a new approach to study the influence of homo-repeats present in proteins on their aggregation properties and performed an appropriate analysis of the large number of proteomes and proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2899788780,"The pathways for biosynthesis of glycogen in bacteria and starch in plants are evolutionarily and biochemically related. They are regulated primarily by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, which evolved to satisfy metabolic requirements of a particular organism. Despite the importance of these two pathways, little is known about the mechanism that controls pyrophosphorylase activity or the location of its allosteric sites. Here, we report pyruvate-bound crystal structures of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, identifying a previously elusive activator site for the enzyme. We found that the tetrameric enzyme binds two molecules of pyruvate in a planar conformation. Each binding site is located in a crevice between the C-terminal domains of two subunits where they stack via a distinct β-helix region. Pyruvate interacts with the side chain of Lys-43 and with the peptide backbone of Ser-328 and Gly-329 from both subunits. These structural insights led to the design of two variants with altered regulatory properties. In one variant (K43A), the allosteric effect was absent, whereas in the other (G329D), the introduced Asp mimicked the presence of pyruvate. The latter generated an enzyme that was preactivated and insensitive to further activation by pyruvate. Our study furnishes a deeper understanding of how glycogen biosynthesis is regulated in bacteria and the mechanism by which transgenic plants increased their starch production. These insights will facilitate rational approaches to enzyme engineering for starch production in crops of agricultural interest and will promote further study of allosteric signal transmission and molecular evolution in this important enzyme family."
https://openalex.org/W2900123722,"Introduction Placebo effects can be very effective in certain pain conditions, but their use is still highly controversial. Several studies show that patients would accept a placebo treatment under certain circumstances, particularly when they are informed prior to the treatment or when there are no effective treatment alternatives. This study examines the question, which factors influence the degree of acceptability of a hypothetical placebo application. Methods Patients filled in a questionnaire dealing with placebo applications. Moreover general data, diagnosis, duration of pain, pain ratings and anxiety/depression/stress scores, sleep disorders and opioid intake were collected from the patients` charts. 129 patients (44 men / 85 women, mean age 51.5 years, 18.0–80.9 years) entered the study. All patients had chronic pain syndromes and were treated in an universitary academic interdisciplinary pain center. Mean duration of pain was 14.7 years. Results The study did not show significant differences in placebo acceptability among patients with different pain diagnoses or accompanying psychological diagnoses or disorders. Hidden placebo application was considered much more unacceptable for the patients than the enhanced placebo or the open placebo application. An improved condition was associated with less feeling of deception, more trust and less negative mood than an unchanged or worsened condition. Conclusion Acceptance of placebo as pain therapy is much more dependent on the way of application (hidden or open) or on the resulting condition (improved, unchanged or worsened) than on factors inherent in the individual patients."

These actions will be taken to approximate conditions in the coastal wetlands and bay that existed prior to construction of canals and water control structures. An increase in pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) density to ≥ 2 individuals m-2 during the wet season (i.e., August-October) along the mainland shoreline was previously proposed as an indication of BBCW success. This study examined pre-BBCW baseline densities and compared them with the proposed target. Densities were monitored by seasonal (wet, dry) throw-trapping (1 m2 replicated in triplicate) at 47 sites along ~22 km of the southwestern Biscayne Bay coastline over 10 years (2007–2016). Densities varied across years and were most often higher in dry seasons. Quantile regression revealed density limitation by four habitat attributes: water temperature (°C), depth (m), salinity (ppt), and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV: % cover). Procrustean analyses that tested for concordance between the spatial and temporal distributions of shrimp densities and habitat metrics found that water temperature, water depth, and salinity explained ~ 28%, 28%, and 22% of density variability, respectively. No significant relationship with SAV was observed. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify spatially and temporally similar groupings of pink shrimp densities by sites or season-years. Significant groupings were then investigated with respect to potentially limiting habitat attributes. Six site and four year-season clusters were identified. Although habitat attributes significantly differed among spatial clusters, within-cluster median pink shrimp densities did not correlate with within-cluster minima, maxima, medians, or standard deviations of habitat attributes. Overall, pink shrimp density ( = 0.86, SD = 1.32 shrimp m-2) was significantly lower (t(α = 0.10,2),939 = -26.53, P <0.0001) than the 2 shrimp m-2 CERP Interim Goal target. Pink shrimp density corresponded significantly with salinity and appeared limited to density < 2 shrimp m-2 by salinity < ~18 ppt. Salinity is an environmental attribute that will be directly influenced by CERP implementation."

https://openalex.org/W2899625407,"Background Dark pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa can represent a major diagnostic challenge. A biopsy is usually required to determine the nature of such intraoral discolorations. This study investigates the potential use of infrared spectroscopy for differential diagnosis of amalgam tattoos versus benign or malignant melanocytic neoplasms. Materials and methods For this retrospective study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) specimens of dark pigmented lesions concerning the oral mucosa or the lip were investigated using mid infrared spectroscopy. The samples were chosen from patients who had undergone a mucosal biopsy at the University Hospital Innsbruck (Austria) between the years 2000 and 2017. Principal component analysis was used for data exploration. Evaluation was based on the superimposition of the recorded spectra and the corresponding histologic slides. Results In total, 22 FFPE specimens were analyzed. Clear differences were found between amalgam and non-amalgam samples. A general weakening of the penetrating infrared radiation allowed for unspecific discrimination between these two classes. An overall accuracy in predicting the correct class of 95.24% was achieved. Conclusion Infrared spectroscopy appears to be a suitable technique to differentiate between amalgam tattoos and melanocytic lesions in FFPE samples. It could potentially be applied in vivo, too, serving as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for intraoral dark pigmented lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2900263908,"The aim of this study was to assess the concurrent validity of the IsoKai isokinetic lift test peak force (IsoKaiPeak) in comparison to a submaximal 5-10RM deadlift test (5-10RMDL), and to develop an equation for converting the IsoKaiPeak in Newton (N) to an estimated 1RM (1RMest) deadlift load in kilograms (kg). The participants included 28 males and 16 female employees in the Swedish Armed Forces (20-59 years). Each participant conducted the IsoKai lift test, followed by the 5-10RMDL test at one occasion. The Pearson's correlation coefficient, with a 95% confidence interval was calculated to evaluate the validity between the IsoKaiPeak and the 1RMest deadlift load derived from the 5-10RMDL test. Univariate and multivariable linear regressions were used to derive the equation for calculating the 1RMest deadlift load based on the IsoKaiPeak. The IsoKaiPeak showed good- to-excellent correlation with the 1RMest deadlift weight with a correlation coefficient of 0.84 (0.72-0.91) for the total sample, and 0.65 (0.37-0.83) and 0.81 (0.53-0.93) in males and females, respectively. The final equation, 1RMest deadlift weight (kg) = -51.63 + (0.08 x IsoKaiPeak) + (2.28 x BMI), explained 72% (adjusted R2 = 0.72) of the total variance in the 1RMest, and had a standard error of the estimate (SEE) of 16.57 kg. In conclusion, the IsoKai isokinetic lift test could be considered a highly valid measure of maximal dynamic muscular strength in comparison to the 5-10RMDL. The equation can be used to convert the IsoKai lift test (N) results to an 1RMest deadlift load (kg), but with consideration of the relative large SEE."
https://openalex.org/W2899933741,"Gap junctions are intercellular conduits that permit the passage of ions, small metabolites, and signaling molecules between cells. Connexin32 (Cx32) is a major gap junction protein in the liver and brain. Phosphorylation is integral to regulating connexin assembly, degradation, and electrical and metabolic coupling, as well as to interactions with molecular partners. Cx32 contains two intracellular tyrosine residues, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx32 has been detected after activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor; however, the specific tyrosine residue and the functional implication of this phosphorylation remain unknown. To address the limited available information on Cx32 regulation by tyrosine kinases, here we used the Cx32 C-terminal (CT) domain in an in vitro kinase-screening assay, which identified ephrin (Eph) receptor family members as tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate Cx32. We found that EphB1 and EphA1 phosphorylate the Cx32CT domain residue Tyr243. Unlike for Cx43, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cx32CT increased gap junction intercellular communication. We also demonstrated that T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylates pTyr243. The data presented above along with additional examples throughout the literature of gap junction regulation by kinases, indicate that one cannot extrapolate the effect of a kinase on one connexin to another."
https://openalex.org/W2899710024,"Background To evaluate the additional discriminatory performance of adiponectin, leptin, and their ratio in the identification of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in men and women without diabetes on top of conventional risk factors. Methods & results A total of 698 subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) and adipocytokine measurements. A comprehensive stepwise selection procedure was performed, followed by c-statistics and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis. In males, adiponectin levels were significantly lower in the IGT group compared to the non-IGT group (Whitney U test, p < 10–4), whereas leptin levels were significantly higher (p = 0.009) in IGT group. In females, adiponectin and leptin levels were not significantly different between groups (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.073 and p = 0.08, respectively). Adjusting for the most informative, sex-specific, clinical and biochemical factors, adiponectin, leptin and their ratio were not found to be significant predictors of the response to the glucose load, when modelled as continuous terms or tertiles. In males, the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for adiponectin was estimated at 0.620 (95% CI: 0.558–0.682) and the addition of adiponectin into the basic model provided a ΔAUC benefit of 0.004, showing no additional discriminatory benefit on top of conventional risk factors (IDI p-value: 0.27), nor did the addition of leptin or their ratio. The results were similar in females. Conclusions In Chinese individuals without diabetes, no significant evidence for the potential discriminatory value of adiponectin, leptin or their ratio in the identification of IGT on top of conventional risk factors was observed."
