https://openalex.org/W2141373630,"The crystallographic structure of a recombinant hirudin-thrombin complex has been solved at 2.3 angstrom (A) resolution. Hirudin consists of an NH2-terminal globular domain and a long (39 A) COOH-terminal extended domain. Residues Ile1 to Tyr3 of hirudin form a parallel beta-strand with Ser214 to Glu217 of thrombin with the nitrogen atom of Ile1 making a hydrogen bond with Ser195 O gamma atom of the catalytic site, but the specificity pocket of thrombin is not involved in the interaction. The COOH-terminal segment makes numerous electrostatic interactions with an anion-binding exosite of thrombin, whereas the last five residues are in a helical loop that forms many hydrophobic contacts. In all, 27 of the 65 residues of hirudin have contacts less than 4.0 A with thrombin (10 ion pairs and 23 hydrogen bonds). Such abundant interactions may account for the high affinity and specificity of hirudin."

The three-dimensional structure of a cellulase, the enzymatic core of CBHII from the fungus Trichoderma reesei reveals an α-β protein with a fold similar to but different from the widely occurring barrel topology first observed in triose phosphate isomerase. The active site of CBHII is located at the carboxyl-terminal end of a parallel β barrel, in an enclosed tunnel through which the cellulose threads. Two aspartic acid residues, located in the center of the tunnel are the probable catalytic residues."

https://openalex.org/W2028514452,"Expression of the polyoma virus middle T (mT) oncogene in vivo is associated with a profound subversion of normal vascular development, which results in the formation of endothelial tumors (hemangiomas). In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, we have investigated, in an in vitro system, the morphogenetic properties of endothelial cells expressing this oncogene. mT-expressing endothelioma (End) cells grown within fibrin gels formed large hemangioma-like cystic structures. All End cell lines examined expressed high levels of fibrinolytic activity resulting from increased production of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and decreased production of plasminogen activator inhibitors. Neutralization of excess proteolytic activity by exogenously added serine protease inhibitors corrected the aberrant in vitro behavior of End cells and allowed the formation of capillary-like tubules. These results suggest that tightly controlled proteolytic activity is essential for vascular morphogenesis and that physiological protease inhibitors play an important regulatory role in angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094909133,"Using Xenopus egg extracts arrested in interphase or mitosis, we directly observed differences in microtubule dynamics at different stages of the cell cycle. Interphase extracts were prepared from eggs in the first interphase after meiosis. Mitotic extracts were prepared by addition of purified cyclin to interphase extracts. Microtubules were nucleated by the addition of centrosomes and visualized by fluorescence video-microscopy in extracts to which rhodamine-labeled tubulin had been added. We found a striking difference in microtubule dynamics in mitotic versus interphase extracts. Quantitative analysis revealed that the rates of polymerization and depolymerization are similar in interphase and mitosis and that within the spatial and temporal resolution of our experiments the difference in dynamics is due almost entirely to an increase in the frequency of transition from growing to shrinking (catastrophe frequency) in the mitotic extracts."

https://openalex.org/W1578820077,"A new apolipoprotein, termed apolipoprotein J (apoJ), was purified from human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography. ApoJ is a glycoprotein consisting of disulfide-linked subunits of 34-36 and 36-39 kDa. Each subunit is glycosylated and has a pI range of 4.9-5.4. ApoJ exists in the plasma associated with high density lipoproteins (HDL) and specifically with subclasses of HDL which also contain apoAI and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity. Immunoaffinity purified apoJ-HDL subclasses have apparent molecular masses of 80, 160, 240, 340, and 520 kDa, as determined by gradient gel electrophoresis. By negative staining electron microscopy, apoJ-HDL range in diameter from 5 to 16 nm. Fractionation of plasma by vertical gradient density centrifugation revealed apoJ-HDL in HDL2 (d 1.063-1.125 g/ml) with the majority overlapping HDL3 (d 1.125-1.21 g/ml) and very high density lipoprotein (d 1.21-1.25 g/ml). The bimodal density distribution of apoJ-HDL suggests that these subclasses have a unique metabolic relationship and may play a role in the transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver."

https://openalex.org/W2018322294,"The gamma delta T cell receptor (TCR) derived from the mouse KN6 T cell hybridoma recognizes an autologous determinant encoded by a broadly expressed gene mapping in the TL region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We have cloned the gene and demonstrated that it is a novel class I gene (designated 27b) belonging to a hitherto undescribed TL region gene cluster in strain C57BL/6. The BALB/c allele of 27b, gene T17c, is defective because it lacks an appropriate splice acceptor site, which explains the lack of recognition of BALB/c stimulator cells by the KN6 cells. We propose that gamma delta TCR and nonclassical MHC and MHC-related class I molecules have coevolved to recognize a conserved set of endogenous and foreign determinants."

https://openalex.org/W1514266791,"The largest subunit of mammalian RNA polymerase II contains at its C terminus an unusual domain consisting of multiple tandem repeats of the seven-amino acid consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. This domain is unphosphorylated in RNA polymerase IIA and extensively phosphorylated in RNA polymerase IIO. To investigate the role of the C-terminal domain and the functional significance of its phosphorylation, changes in the level of phosphorylation were followed as a function of the position of RNA polymerase II in the transcription cycle. Complexes were formed with 32P-labeled RNA polymerase IIA and separated from the free polymerase by gel filtration. The phosphorylation state of the RNA polymerase II largest subunit was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results indicate that RNA polymerase IIA interacts with the template-committed complex to form a stable preinitiation complex. RNA polymerase IIA associated with such complexes is converted to RNA polymerase IIO in the presence of ATP prior to the formation of the first phosphodiester bond. Furthermore, the observation that purified preinitiation complexes can catalyze the conversion of RNA polymerase IIA to IIO indicates that the protein kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain is a component of such complexes. The concentration of ATP required for the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II associated with the preinitiation complex is two to three orders of magnitude lower than that required for the conversion of RNA polymerase IIA to IIO free in solution. These results support the idea that phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase subunit IIa occurs subsequent to the association of enzyme with the promoter and prior to the initiation of transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1567637492,"The mitochondrial membrane potential in isolated hepatocytes was measured using the distribution of the lipophilic cation triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP+) with appropriate corrections for plasma membrane potential, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial binding of TPMP+, and other factors. The relationship between mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration rate in hepatocytes was examined as the respiratory chain was titrated with myxothiazol in the presence of oligomycin. This relationship was nonproportional and similar to results with isolated mitochondria respiring on succinate. This shows that there is an increased proton conductance of the mitochondrial inner membrane in situ at high values of membrane potential. From the respiration rate and mitochondrial membrane potential of hepatocytes in the absence of oligomycin, we estimate that the passive proton permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane accounts for 20-40% of the basal respiration rate of hepatocytes. The relationship between log[TPMP+]tot/[TPMP+]e and respiration rate in thymocytes was also nonproportional suggesting that the phenomenon is not peculiar to hepatocytes. There is less mitochondrial proton leak in hepatocytes from hypothyroid rats. A large proportion of the difference in basal respiration rate between hepatocytes from normal and hypothyroid rats can be accounted for by differences in the proton permeability characteristics of the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1587924678,"Southern blot analysis was performed with genomic DNAs from 86 human subjects using the 32P-labeled cDNA for polymorphic arylamine N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) in human liver recently cloned in our laboratory. Three types of N-acetyltransferase gene were identified. Gene 1 contains a 5.5-kilobase (kb) KpnI fragment with a BamHI site; gene 2 contains a 5.5-kb KpnI fragment without a BamHI site; and gene 3 contains a 5.0-kb KpnI fragment with a BamHI site. The combination of these three genes generated five genotypes. Acetylator phenotypes were determined in 29 healthy volunteers by isoniazid loading tests, and they were classified as rapid (10 subjects), intermediate (16 subjects), or slow (3 subjects) acetylators. Rapid acetylators were homozygotes of gene 1. Intermediate acetylators were heterozygotes of either genes 1 and 2 or genes 1 and 3. There were two exceptional cases who were classified as intermediate acetylators but were homozygotes of gene 1. Slow acetylators were either heterozygote of genes 2 and 3 or homozygotes of gene 3. These results indicate that gene 1 corresponds to high N-acetyltransferase activity, while gene 2 and gene 3 give rise to low N-acetyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2012709757,Epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells elicited a redistribution of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1) from a predominantly cytosolic localization to membrane fractions. The temporal coincidence of this redistribution with EGF stimulation of inositol phosphate formation and EGF increased phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 suggests that the membrane association of PLC-gamma 1 is a significant event in second messenger transduction.
https://openalex.org/W1992914288,"The major autophosphorylation sites of the rat beta II isozyme of protein kinase C were identified. The modified threonine and serine residues were found in the amino-terminal peptide, the carboxyl-terminal tail, and the hinge region between the regulatory lipid-binding domain and the catalytic kinase domain. Because this autophosphorylation follows an intrapeptide mechanism, extraordinary flexibility of the protein is necessary to phosphorylate the three regions. Comparison of the sequences surrounding the modified residues showed no obvious recognition motif nor any similarity to substrate phosphorylation sites, suggesting that proximity to the active site may be the primary criterion for their phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1606868561,"To describe phenotypic changes of human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs), proportion of smooth muscle and nonmuscle variants of actin, myosin heavy chains (MHCs), vinculin, and caldesmon, during prenatal and several months of postnatal development was determined. In aortic SMCs from 9-10-week-old fetus, both nonmuscle and smooth muscle-specific variants of all four proteins were present, however, the nonmuscle forms were more abundant. During development, a shift towards the expression of muscle-specific variants was observed, although the time course of changes in protein variant content was not similar for all the proteins studied. By the 24th week of gestation, fractional content of alpha-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle MHCs was rather close to that in the mature SMCs, and comprised approximately 80 and 90%, respectively, of the levels characteristic of SMCs from adult aortic media. On the contrary, fractional ratio of meta-vinculin and 150-kDa caldesmon was still rather low in the aorta from the 24-week-old fetus, did not increase in a 2-month-old child aorta, and did not reach the level characteristic of mature SMCs even in the 6-month-old child aorta. Thus changes in alpha-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle MHC fractional content occur mainly during the prenatal period of development, before the 24th week of gestation; while meta-vinculin and the 150-kDa caldesmon proportion increases mainly in the postnatal period, during several months after birth. In the Discussion, phenotypes of SMCs from developing aorta were compared to those from different layers of the adult aortic wall."
https://openalex.org/W2053988383,"Myosin filaments, which are responsible for a large repertoire of motile activities in muscle and nonmuscle cells, can translocate actin filaments both toward and away from their central bare zone. This bidirectional movement suggests that there is enough flexibility in the head portion of the tightly packed myosin molecules in the native myosin filaments to move actin filaments not only in the expected direction, but also in the direction opposite to that predicted by the regular structure of muscle--away from the center of the myosin filament."
https://openalex.org/W1602639752,"The 3500-base pair region located immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site of the human pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene contains all the sequences necessary for cell-specific transcription. In transient expression assays, the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen promoter directed the production of high levels of bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in collagen-producing human fetal fibroblasts. Enzyme activity, on the other hand, was nearly undetectable in extracts from collagen-nonproducing immortalized lymphoblasts. Deletion experiments narrowed the active segment of the human promoter to a phylogenetically conserved sequence comprised between nucleotides-376 and -108, relative to the initiation site of transcription. In similar analyses, the pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene failed to direct cell-specific transcription. As part of this study, the controversial issue surrounding the putative enhancer element in the first intron of the human pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene also has been reconsidered. Accordingly, we now propose a more restricted definition of this cis-acting DNA element since its action is exerted in an orientation-preferred manner and with a strong specificity for its own promoter. Moreover, stimulation does not appear to be tissue-specific. Finally, evidence is presented supporting the notion that although structurally different and distinctly arranged, the regulatory sequences of the type I collagen genes may bind similar trans-acting factors."

https://openalex.org/W1989295141,The 70-residue carboxyl-terminal domain of the muscle contractile protein troponin-C contains two helix-loop-helix calcium (Ca)-binding sites that are related to each other by approximate twofold rotational symmetry. Hydrophobic residues from the helices and a short three residue β sheet at the interface of the two sites act to stabilize the protein domain in the presence of Ca. A synthetic 34-residue peptide representing one of these sites (site III) has been synthesized and studied by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In solution this peptide undergoes a Ca-induced conformational change to form the helix-loop-helix Ca-binding motif. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectra have provided evidence for the formation of a β sheet and interactions between several hydrophobic residues from opposing helices as found in troponin-C. It is proposed that a symmetric two-site dimer similar in tertiary structure to the carboxyl-terminal domain of troponin-C forms from the assembly of two site III peptides in the Ca-bound form.
https://openalex.org/W1528921211,"Detergent-solubilized and partially purified soybean peroxygenase was shown to actively catalyze, in the presence of alkylhydroperoxides as co-substrates, the epoxidation of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acids. Octadecenoic acids were found to be better substrates than shorter mono-unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1 or C14:1), but the position of their double bond (at positions 6, 9, or 11) had little effect on the rates of epoxidation. The peroxygenase exhibits a strong stereospecificity since octadecenoic acids with double bonds in trans-configuration were not epoxidized at detectable rates. Oxidation of linoleic acid yielded the two positional monoepoxide isomers and, as the minor product, the diepoxide. An important regioselectivity was, however, observed in this case; i.e. the unsaturation at position 9,10 was epoxidized preferentially to that at 12, 13. Oxidation of oleic acid in the presence of 18O-labeled hydroperoxy-linoleic acid revealed an incorporation of about 80% of the label into the epoxide ring. Products similar to those formed by the peroxygenase by epoxidation of unsaturated free fatty acids such as linoleic acid have been described as important metabolites (leukotoxins) in the defense of plants, e.g. in fungal agressions. This aspect underlines the physiological relevance of this new and potent catalytic activity of the peroxygenase."

https://openalex.org/W1521601065,"A series of murine thymic lymphoma cell sublines was selected in vitro for resistance to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP). The level of CDDP resistance correlated with reduced drug accumulation in these cells. A rabbit antiserum was raised against the plasma membrane of a CDDP-resistant subline and used in Western blot analyses. Increased expression of a surface antigen of approximately 200 kDa was observed and found to correlate with the degree of resistance. Further biochemical and immunological studies demonstrated that this is a plasma membrane glycoprotein. However, it is different from the multidrug resistance-associated P-glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 170,000. We have called this unique CDDP resistance-associated membrane protein CPR-200."
https://openalex.org/W1525853704,"The effect of the 5'-untranslated region of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA and of spermidine on the translation of ODC mRNA was studied in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. The ODC mRNAs, possessing different sizes of the 5'-untranslated region and named mODC241, mODC188, mODC85, and mODC24 according to the number of nucleotides in the 5'-untranslated region, were synthesized by in vitro transcription techniques through the use of plasmids containing various sizes of mouse ODC cDNA. As the size of the 5'-untranslated region of ODC mRNA increased, the efficiency of the translation decreased and the degree of stimulation of the translation by 0.2 mM spermidine increased. The inhibition of ODC mRNA translation by high concentrations of spermidine (0.6-1 mM) also increased with an increase in the size of the 5'-untranslated region. The spermidine effects were increased greatly when the size of the 5'-untranslated region of ODC mRNA was increased from 85 to 188 nucleotides. These results suggest that the nucleotides 70-220 upstream from the initiator AUG are involved in the decrease in translational efficiency. In addition, at least the nucleotides in the 70-170 region upstream from the initiator AUG are important in the strong stimulation of ODC synthesis by low spermidine concentrations and in the inhibition of ODC synthesis at high spermidine concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1673005671,"Human plasma carboxypeptidase N is a 280-kDa tetramer with two high molecular mass (83-kDa) glycosylated subunits which protect the two 50-kDa catalytic subunits and keep them in the circulation. An initial clone for the 83-kDa subunit was obtained by screening two lambda gt11 human liver cDNA expression libraries with antiserum specific for carboxypeptidase N or the 83-kDa subunit. The libraries were rescreened with the labeled cloned cDNA, and the largest clone obtained (2536-base pair insert) was completely sequenced. The deduced protein sequence matched the sequence of several tryptic peptides from the 83-kDa subunit but did not contain the NH2-terminal sequence. The remaining portion of the protein coding sequence was synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. The composite cDNA sequence is 2870 base pairs long with an open reading frame of 1608 base pair coding for a protein of 536 amino acids (Mr = 58,762). The protein sequence contains seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a threonine/serine-rich region which is a potential site for attachment of O-linked carbohydrate. The most striking feature is a region (residues 68-355) containing 12 leucine-rich tandem repeats of 24 residues with the following consensus sequence: P-X-X-alpha-F-X-X-L-X-X-L-X-X-L-X-L-X-X-N-X-L-X-X-L (X = any amino acid and alpha = aliphatic amino acids, I, L, or V). This repeating pattern is found in the leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein and in other proteins where it might mediate interactions with macromolecules. This region also contains five sequences with heptad repeating leucine residues comprising a leucine zipper motif. The leucine-rich domain likely constitutes an important structural or functional element in the interactions of the 83- and 50-kDa subunits to form the active tetramer of carboxypeptidase N."
https://openalex.org/W2091521538,"Angiotensin II (AII) stimulates rapid increases in the concentration of cytosolic calcium in follicular oocytes from Xenopus laevis. This calcium response was not present in denuded oocytes, indicating that it is mediated by AII receptors on the adherent follicular cells. The endogenous AII receptors differed in their binding properties from mammalian AII receptors expressed on the oocyte surface after injection of rat adrenal messenger RNA. Also, the calcium responses to activation of the amphibian AII receptor, but not the expressed mammalian AII receptor, were blocked reversibly by octanol and intracellular acidification, treatments that inhibit cell coupling through gap junctions. In addition, AII increased the rate of progesterone-induced maturation. Thus, an AII-induced calcium-mobilizing signal is transferred from follicle cells to the oocyte through gap junctions and may play a physiological role in oocyte maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2159801053,"Addition of fatty acids to isolated hepatocytes raised respiration rate by 92% and raised mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) in situ from 155 to 162 mV suggesting that the increased fuel supply had a greater effect on respiration rate than any increases in processes that consumed mitochondrial protonmotive force (delta p). The relationship between delta psi m and respiration rate was changed by addition of fatty acids or lactate, showing that there was also stimulation of delta p-consuming reactions. In the presence of oligomycin the relationship between delta psi m and respiration rate was unaffected by substrate addition, showing that the kinetics of delta p consumption by the H+ leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane were unchanged. The stimulation of delta p consumers by fatty acids therefore must be in the pathways of ATP synthesis and turnover. Inhibition of several candidate ATP-consuming reactions had little effect on basal or fatty acid-stimulated respiration, and the nature of the ATP turnover reactions in hepatocytes remains speculative. We conclude that fatty acids (and other substrates) stimulate respiration in hepatocytes in two distinct ways. They provide substrate for the electron transport chain, raising delta p and increasing the non-ohmic proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the rate of oxygen consumption. They also directly stimulate an unidentified delta p-consuming reaction in the cytoplasm. They do not work by uncoupling or by stimulation of intramitochondrial ATP-turnover reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1556012991,"We have used DNA sequence affinity chromatography previously to purify a murine erythroid cell nuclear factor termed alpha-CP1. This promoter selective transcription factor is a heterotypic CCAAT factor composed of at least seven polypeptides with Mr values that range from 27,000 to 38,000. Peptide mapping experiments reported here show that these seven polypeptides fall into three distinct classes (alpha, beta, and gamma). In addition chemical cross-linking, sedimentation, and gel filtration studies suggest that alpha-CP1 is a heterotrimeric factor composed of one polypeptide from each class. A core component of the factor (alpha beta) is stable at moderately high ionic strengths, whereas the gamma polypeptides are more weakly associated with the particle. The native factor binds tightly to the alpha-globin CCAAT box (Kd = 5.71 x 10(-11 M), and mutational studies show that the DNA recognition site resides in a sequence decamer. DNA binding is significantly stabilized, however, by apparently nonspecific sequences 3' of the CCAAT recognition motif. Finally, the DNA binding domain of purified alpha-CP1 is moderately stable to protease digestion, a feature characteristic of heterotypic CCAAT factors. The proteolyzed factor has a slightly higher affinity for the CCAAT box (Kd = 2.8 x 10(-11) M), and its footprint cannot be distinguished from that of the intact factor. In contrast protease treatment abolishes the ability of alpha-CP1 to activate alpha-globin gene transcription in vitro. These latter results show that the DNA binding domain of alpha-CP1 is readily distinguished from the domains required to mediate activation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1569101805,"Steroid hormone receptors contain a conserved sequence of amino acids within the steroid binding domain, and we have previously speculated that this conserved region is the site of interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with hsp90 (Danielsen, M., Northrop, J. P., and Ringold, G. M. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 2513-2522; Pratt, W. B., Jolly, D. J., Pratt, D. V., Hollenberg, S. M., Giguere, V., Cadepond, F. M., Schweizer-Groyer, G., Catelli, M.-G., Evans, R. M., and Baulieu, E.-E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 267-273). In this work, we transfect COS-7 cells with three mutants of the mouse glucocorticoid receptor deleted for all or part of this conserved region. The mutant receptor missing the entire conserved region is very unstable and is found predominantly as cleavage products. Approximately one-third of the cleavage products have lost most or all of the steroid binding domain. This mutant receptor has a constitutive activity that is about one-third that of the steroid-bound wild type receptor in stimulating transcription from a reporter gene. We propose that the partial constitutive activity results from proteolytic cleavage of the steroid binding domain from the rest of the receptor, thus removing the functional repression determined by this domain. This mutant receptor is associated with hsp90 in cytosols prepared in the presence of molybdate but, when molybdate is not present, the receptor is unstable and there is very little receptor-associated hsp90. This observation is consistent with the proposal that binding of hsp90 helps to stabilize the glucocorticoid receptor against proteolysis, and it demonstrates that the site of molybdate interaction with the receptor lies outside of the conserved sequence. Our data are interpreted according to a two-site model in which hsp90 interacts with the steroid binding domain at two sites. One site is in the conserved sequence, and the other is at a transition metal oxyanion binding site, located between the conserved sequence and the COOH terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1577897019,"Human placental lactogen (hPL) and growth hormone (hGH) are thought to be derived from a common ancestral gene and have similar nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Although the genes are similar in structure, they are expressed in different tissues. A transcriptional enhancer has been found 2.2 kilobases 3' of the hPL3 gene at the distal extreme of the hPL/hGH gene cluster. This enhancer is at least 20-fold more active in hPL-producing human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells than in non-hPL-producing cells. The enhancer is active when linked to either the hPL3 or SV40 promoter. We have localized the hPL enhancer to a 138-base pair (bp) region that retains tissue specificity in transient transfection assays. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the hPL enhancer interacted specifically with nuclear proteins from JEG-3 cells and placental tissue. Within the 138-bp enhancer, a 22-bp region overlapping a TEF-1 binding site was shown to be protected from DNase I digestion by placental and HeLa nuclear extracts. Placental protein(s) binding this region may be instrumental in tissue-specific activity of the hPL enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1607929058,"Adducin is a 200-kDa heterodimeric protein associated with the erythrocyte membrane skeleton which binds to Ca2+/calmodulin, promotes binding of spectrin to actin, and is a substrate for protein kinases C and A. Adducin polypeptides can be structurally and functionally divided into two distinct regions. The amino-terminal 39-kDa domain of each subunit is more basic and resistant to proteases than the C-terminal 60-64-kDa domain, which is very sensitive to proteolytic degradation. Two-dimensional peptide map analysis revealed that the 39-kDa protease-resistant domains represent a portion of adducin which is highly conserved between the alpha and beta subunits whereas the protease-sensitive regions are different in each subunit. Comparison of the structural and functional properties of purified 39-kDa domains with intact adducin showed that the 39-kDa domains were not phosphorylated by protein kinases C or A and did not bind to Ca2+/calmodulin or interact with spectrin and actin. This suggests that the protease-sensitive domains may perform the various functions of adducin since these activities were all lacking from the protease-resistant domains. It is also possible that the conserved and variable domains are both required for one or more activities of adducin or that the 39-kDa domains play a role in maintaining the oligomeric state of adducin necessary for interaction of the variable domains with spectrin-actin complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1529729633,"Two nuclear phosphoproteins, pp35 and pp32, were purified from A20 cells, a murine B-lymphoblastoid cell line. Initially detected by cross-reactivity with antibodies to human erythrocyte protein 4.1, the 35- and 32-kDa proteins were purified by sequential fractionation of non-ionic detergent cell lysates on DEAE-cellulose, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-anion-exchange chromatography, and HPLC hydroxylapatite chromatography. By two-dimensional peptide mapping, pp35 and pp32 are related but do not appear to represent sequential proteolytic products. Both pp35 and pp32 appear to be associated with cell proliferation. Antibodies specific for pp35 and pp32 show prominent intranuclear staining in A20 cells but only focal staining in normal murine lymphoid tissues. Quantitative immunoblotting showed that both pp35 and pp32 are, respectively, expressed at 5.9 x 10(4) and 7.0 x 10(4) copies/cell in small, dense resting B lymphocytes, increasing approximately 12- and 7-fold after polyclonal stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. When normalized to total cell protein, this represents specific inductions of approximately 4- and 2-fold. Expression of both pp35 and pp32 is constitutively high in populations of neoplastic B cell lines; moreover, both are expressed in the nuclei of intestinal crypt epithelial cells but not in other epithelial compartments in the same sections, suggesting that forms of pp35 and pp32 may be expressed in additional tissues and associated with proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1812309617,"A previous paper reported the purification (from mouse cell extracts) and some of the properties of a protein, alpha accessory factor (AAF), that specifically stimulates DNA polymerase alpha/primase (1). We describe here studies on the mechanism of action of AAF. In the presence of AAF and a large excess of single-stranded circular DNA template, a molecule of DNA polymerase alpha/primase interacts with a single template DNA molecule priming and synthesizing multiple short DNA fragments covering thousands of nucleotides without detaching from the template, and, by many-fold repetition of the process, accomplishes serial replication of the population of DNA molecules. In contrast, without AAF the reaction involves the whole population of DNA molecules in parallel and with a very large number of binding events between DNA polymerase alpha/primase and DNA [corrected] template. The profound [corrected] increase in affinity of DNA polymerase alpha/primase for the DNA template that characterizes the mechanism suggests a functional identification of AAF as a template affinity protein. The resulting greater efficiency accounts for the ability of AAF to stimulate both the primase and polymerase activities of DNA polymerase alpha/primase. AAF also increases the processivity of DNA polymerase alpha/primase from approximately 15 to approximately 115 nucleotides, a size similar to that of mammalian Okazaki fragments, and it appears to allow DNA polymerase alpha/primase to traverse double-stranded regions of a DNA template. These features of the mechanism of AAF suggest that it may have a role in assisting DNA polymerase alpha/primase in synthesis of the lagging strand of a replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1497779350,"We describe the isolation and characterization of a chloroplast ribosomal protein and a clone of its cDNA. This protein has no homology to any Escherichia coli ribosomal protein or to any known proteins. Due to this novel finding we propose it be called PSrp-1, i.e. a plastid-specific ribosomal protein. The precursor form of PSrp-1, deduced from the cDNA sequence, is 302-amino acid residues long. The mature PSrp-1, identified by amino-terminal sequencing, is a protein of 236 residues. The NH2-terminal 66 amino acids form the transit peptide that targets PSrp-1 into the chloroplast. We show that PSrp-1 is a protein of the chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunit by Western blotting and sequencing the excised protein after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The possible evolutionary origin of PSrp-1 from the nucleated host cell of the endosymbiont theory is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488959508,"Cis-acting sequences involved in the expression of the human neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene were identified by transient expression and in vitro transcription assays using the Lan-5 cell system. Sequences between -63 and -51 were necessary for NPY gene expression. Gel retardation analyses utilizing this region indicate that a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein interacts with the sequence CCCCTCC. An in vitro nuclear transcription system was prepared from Lan-5 cell nuclei in order to determine a functional correlation between the CCCCTCC-binding protein and promoter activity. The NPY promoter was accurately transcribed in this system; furthermore, the data obtained from the in vitro transcription experiments were similar to those obtained from the in vivo transfection studies. Competition experiments in which an oligonucleotide containing either CCCCTCC or Sp1 (GGCGGG) sequences was added in excess to the transcription extracts demonstrated the functional importance of an Sp1-like protein in NPY gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1579709565,"Photolysis of adenosylcobalamin leads to homolytic cleavage, similar to many of the B12-dependent enzyme reactions. Therefore, we have used photolysis to study the structure and lability of the cobalt-carbon bond. The nanosecond quantum yield for adenosylcobalamin is 0.23 +/- 0.04, higher than reported previously. The acidified form of adenosylcobalamin, so called base-off B12, has a much lower quantum yield at 0.045 +/- 0.015, demonstrating an inverse correlation between cobalt-carbon bond strength and quantum yield. Investigation of the wavelength dependence of the quantum yield shows that there is a highly efficient transmission of energy from the corrin ring to the cobalt-carbon bond. A comparison of nanosecond transient and static spectra showed small spectral differences. Therefore, any spectral relaxation of a sterically distorted corrin ring may be detectable only at sub-nanosecond timescales. Spectral analysis also provides data on the kinetics of recombination. In the absence of enzyme, geminate rebinding must be substantial, since the rate of Co(II) and deoxyadenosyl radical recombination is near the diffusion controlled limit. Therefore, it is likely that the enzyme functions to pull the geminate partners apart, perhaps as suggested previously, through a conformational change. The importance of geminate recombination in the mechanism of homolytic cleavage is further supported by a comparison of our results with picosecond transient absorption studies."
https://openalex.org/W1485657360,"Hemin at greater than 1 microM concentrations inhibits the interaction of the iron responsive element (IRE) and the iron responsive element binding protein (IRE-BP) as measured by gel retardation and UV cross-linking. Heme has recently been proposed to inhibit the repression of translation of an IRE-containing mRNA (Lin, J. J., Daniels-McQueen, S., Patino, M. M., Gaffield, L., Walden, W. E., and Thach, R. E., (1990) Science 247, 74-76). Our binding inhibition provides structural support for these observations. The action of hemin, however, does not mimic the physiologically demonstrated inhibition of high affinity binding of the IRE to IRE-BP by the oxidation of a sulfhydryl of the IRE-BP. In addition to this effect, hemin also inhibits a wide variety of RNA and DNA binding proteins, restriction endonucleases, and nucleases. Therefore, in vitro, the inhibitory effects of hemin are not limited to the interaction of the IRE-BP and the IRE, but are nonspecific and affect a wide variety of nucleic acid-protein interactions. Any hypothesis on the effects on protein-nucleic acid interactions employing greater than 1 microM concentrations of hemin should be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W1614752436,"Exposure of skate erythrocytes to hypotonic medium stimulates a rapid increase in levels of 1,2-diacylglycerol. Other treatments which produce cell swelling such as replacement of a portion of medium NaCl with the permeant solutes ethylene glycol or ammonium chloride also stimulate increases in diacylglycerol. Whereas the reduction of medium osmolarity to 460 mosm (from 940) stimulated a persistent diacylglycerol increase, the increase after reduction to 660 mosm was transient, peaking at 2.5 min and then slowly declining. This decline could be prevented by preincubation with the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor R59022. To investigate the source of the increased diacylglycerol, the rate of incorporation of [32P]PO4 into each major phospholipid was measured. Reduction of osmolarity to 660 mosm stimulated the incorporation of phosphate into phosphatidylcholine markedly, with a smaller increase observed into phosphatidylinositol. To demonstrate phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, erythrocytes were prelabeled with [32P]PO4. Subsequent exposure to hypotonic (660 mosm) medium stimulated a decrease in radioactivity in phosphatidylcholine and a large increase in radioactivity in phosphatidic acid. When stimulated in the presence of ethanol, 32PO4-labeled phosphatidylethanol was formed, suggesting activation of phospholipase D. In addition, the initial formation of 32PO4-labeled phosphatidic acid was not sensitive to inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase, supporting the role of direct activation of phospholipase D. These results indicate that hypotonicity and the accompanying cell swelling induce cell membrane phospholipid turnover, predominantly phosphatidylcholine, and production of the protein kinase C activator, diacylglycerol, which appears to occur via activation of phospholipase D."
https://openalex.org/W1598988156,"Methods have been devised to examine the spectral properties and state of reduction of the pterin ring of molybdopterin (MPT) in milk xanthine oxidase and the Mo-containing domain of rat liver sulfite oxidase. The absorption spectrum of the native pterin was visualized by difference spectroscopy of each protein, denatured anaerobically in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), versus a sample containing the respective apoprotein and other necessary components. The state of reduction of MPT was also probed using 2,6-dichlorobenzenoneindophenol (DCIP) to measure reducing equivalents/MPT, after anaerobic denaturation of the protein in GdnHCl in the presence or absence of Hg2+. In the case of xanthine oxidase the data indicate that the terminal sulfide ligand of Mo causes the reduction of a native dihydro form of MPT to the tetrahydro level. This reduction does not occur if Hg2+ is added prior to denaturation of the protein. Based on its observed behavior, the native MPT in the Mo cofactor of xanthine oxidase is postulated to exist as a quinonoid dihydropterin. Quantitation of DCIP reduction by MPT of Mo fragment of sulfite oxidase showed a two-electron oxidation of MPT, even when the Mo fragment was denatured in the presence of Hg2+ to prevent internal reduction reactions due to sulfhydryls or sulfide. Difference spectra of DCIP-treated versus untreated Mo fragment showed that MPT had been fully oxidized. These data indicate that the native MPT in sulfite oxidase must be a dihydro isomer different from that in xanthine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1483694031,"Transferrin (TF) is a plasma protein that transports and is regulated by iron. The aim of this study was to characterize human TF gene sequences that respond in vivo to cellular signals affecting expression in various tissues and to iron administration. Chimeric genes were constructed containing 152, 622, and 1152 base pairs (bp) of the human TF5'-flanking region with the coding region of a reporter gene, CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase), and introduced into the germ line of mice. Transgenes containing TF 5'-flanking sequences to -152 bp were expressed poorly in all tissues examined. In contrast, transgenes containing TF sequences to -622 or -1152 bp were expressed at high levels in brain and liver, greater than or equal to 1000-fold higher than tissues such as heart and testes. Liver and brain are major sites of endogenous TF mRNA synthesis, but liver mRNA levels are 10-fold higher than brain. A significant diminution of CAT enzymatic activity in liver accompanied iron administration in both TF(0.67) and TF(1.2)CAT transgenic mice, mimicking the decrease of transferrin in humans following iron overload. Levels of endogenous plasma transferrin also decreased in iron-treated transgenic mice. Transgenic mouse lines carrying human TF chimeric genes will be useful models for analyzing the regulation of human transferrin by iron and for determining the molecular basis of transferrin regulation throughout mammalian development into the aging process."

https://openalex.org/W1914848347,"Two distinct types of cDNA clones encoding for the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1 beta subunit were isolated from a human liver lambda gt11 cDNA library and characterized. These cDNA clones have identical nucleotide sequences for PDH E1 beta protein coding region but differ in their lengths and in the sequences of their 3'-untranslated regions. The smaller cDNA had an unusual polyadenylation signal within its protein coding region. The cDNA-deduced protein of PDH E1 beta subunit revealed a precursor protein of 359 amino acid residues (Mr 39,223) and a mature protein of 329 residues (Mr 35,894), respectively. Both cDNAs shared high amino acid sequence similarity with that isolated from human foreskin (Koike, K.K., Ohta, S., Urata, Y., Kagawa, Y., and Koike, M. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 41-45) except for three regions of frameshift mutation. These changes led to dramatic alterations in the local net charges and predicted protein conformation. One of the different sequences in the protein coding region of liver cDNA (nucleotide position 452-752) reported here was confirmed by sequencing the region after amplification of cDNA prepared from human skin fibroblasts by the polymerase chain reaction. Southern blot analysis verified simple patterns of hybridization with E1 beta cDNA, indicating that the PDH E1 beta subunit gene is not a member of a multigene family. The mechanisms of differential expression of the PDH E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits were also studied in established fibroblast cell lines obtained from patients with Leigh's syndrome and other forms of congenital lactic acidosis. In Northern blot analyses for PDH E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits, no apparent differences were observed between two Leigh's syndrome and the control fibroblasts studied: one species of PDH E1 alpha mRNA and three species of E1 beta mRNA were observed in all the cell lines examined. However, in one tricarboxylic acid cycle deficient fibroblast cell line, which has one-tenth of the normal enzyme activity, the levels of immunoreactive PDH E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits were markedly decreased as assessed by immunoblot analyses. These data indicated a regulatory mutation caused by either inefficient translation of E1 alpha and E1 beta mRNAs into protein or rapid degradation of both subunits upon translation. In contrast, the PDH E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits in two fibroblast cell lines from Leigh's syndrome patients appeared to be normal as judged by 1) enzyme activity, 2) mRNA Northern blot, 3) genomic DNA Southern blot, and 4) immunoblot analyses indicating that the lactic acidosis seen in these patients did not result from a single defect in either of these E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits of the PDH complex."
https://openalex.org/W1554929323,"As a step toward understanding the metabolic consequences of the cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation, we have examined the kinetics of 36Cl efflux in cells cultured from sweat glands, a tissue that is affected in the disease. Epithelial cells, derived from the secretory coil of sweat glands of and control individuals, were cultured in serum-free medium, and primary cultures used for efflux experiments. Cell layers were equilibrated with Na36Cl in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-buffered balanced salt solution for 45 min at 37 degrees C, washed in 0.25 M sucrose, and incubated in nonradioactive buffer for measurement of 36Cl efflux. Efflux from and control cells followed biphasic kinetics and was described by the equation Y = Ae-kat + Be-kbt. All efflux was inhibited at 6 degrees C. The fast component of efflux, Ae-kat, of both control and cells was inhibited by the anion channel blockers 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbene disulfonic acid, 9-anthracene carboxylate, and diphenylamine 2-carboxylate, implicating release through chloride channels. At 23 degrees C, the kinetics of 36Cl efflux from and control cells were indistinguishable, but efflux from control cells could be accelerated by cAMP analogs and isoproterenol. At 37 degrees C, 36Cl efflux was more rapid from control cells than from cells, but could not be stimulated further by beta-adrenergic agents. In both cases, the increased rate of efflux was due to a severalfold increase in the A parameter of the fast component. These differential responses constitute a CF phenotype of secretory sweat gland cells in culture that may be useful for further investigation of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis."
