Limited empirical research has used a gender-based lens to evaluate the mental health impacts of the pandemic, overlooking the impact of public health measures on marginalized groups, such as women, and the gender diverse community. This study used a gender-based analysis to determine the prevalence of psychosocial symptoms and substance use (alcohol and cannabis use in particular) by age, ethnicity, income, rurality, education level, Indigenous status, and sexual orientation. Methods Participants in the study were recruited from previously established cohorts as a part of the COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Study of a Provincial Population-Based Cohort for Gender and Sex (RESPPONSE) study. Those who agreed to participate were asked to self-report symptoms of depression, anxiety, pandemic stress, loneliness, alcohol use, and cannabis use across five phases of the pandemic as well as retrospectively before the pandemic. Results For all psychosocial outcomes, there was a significant effect of time with all five phases of the pandemic being associated with more symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness relative to pre-COVID levels ( p &lt; .0001). Gender was significantly associated with all outcomes ( p &lt; .0001) with men exhibiting lower scores (i.e., fewer symptoms) than women and gender diverse participants, and women exhibiting lower scores than the gender diverse group. Other significant predictors were age (younger populations experiencing more symptoms, p &lt; .0001), ethnicity (Chinese/Taiwanese individuals experiencing fewer symptoms, p = .005), and Indigenous status (Indigenous individuals experiencing more symptoms, p &lt; .0001). Alcohol use and cannabis use increased relative to pre-pandemic levels, and women reported a greater increase in cannabis use than men ( p &lt; .0001). Conclusions Our findings highlight the need for policy makers and leaders to prioritize women, gender-diverse individuals, and young people when tailoring public health measures for future pandemics."

During this photoacclimation process, photosystem II (PSII), the water:plastoquinone photooxidoreductase involved in oxygenic photosynthesis, is modified. The resulting FRL-PSII is comprised of FRL-specific core subunits and binds chlorophyll (Chl) d and Chl f molecules in place of several of the Chl a molecules found when cells are grown in visible light. These new Chls effectively lower the energy canonically thought to define the ""red limit"" for light required to drive photochemical catalysis of water oxidation. Changes to the architecture of FRL-PSII were previously unknown, and the positions of Chl d and Chl f molecules had only been proposed from indirect evidence. Here, we describe the 2.25 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of a monomeric FRL-PSII core complex from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7335 cells that were acclimated to FRL. We identify one Chl d molecule in the ChlD1 position of the electron transfer chain and four Chl f molecules in the core antenna. We also make observations that enhance our understanding of PSII biogenesis, especially on the acceptor side of the complex where a bicarbonate molecule is replaced by a glutamate side chain in the absence of the assembly factor Psb28. In conclusion, these results provide a structural basis for the lower energy limit required to drive water oxidation, which is the gateway for most solar energy utilization on earth."

Previous studies have proved that melatonin could protect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) injury in non-diabetic stroke models; however, its roles and the underlying mechanisms against CIR injury in diabetic mice remain unknown. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and high-glucose-cultured HT22 cells were exposed to melatonin, with or without administration of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and the specifically silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor EX527, and then subjected to CIR or oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion operation. We found that diabetic mice showed aggravated brain damage, increased apoptosis and oxidative stress, and deficient autophagy following CIR compared with non-diabetic counterparts. Melatonin treatment exhibited improved histological damage, neurological outcomes, and cerebral infarct size. Intriguingly, melatonin markedly increased cell survival, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptosis effects, and significantly enhanced autophagy. However, these effects were largely attenuated by 3-MA or EX527. Additionally, our cellular experiments demonstrated that melatonin increased the SIRT1-BMAL1 pathway-related proteins' expression in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these results indicate that melatonin treatment can protect against CIR-induced brain damage in diabetic mice, which may be achieved by the autophagy enhancement mediated by the SIRT1-BMAL1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3212877620,"Phthalate, a plasticizer, endocrine disruptor, and potential carcinogen, is degraded by a variety of bacteria. This degradation is initiated by phthalate dioxygenase (PDO), a Rieske oxygenase (RO) that catalyzes the dihydroxylation of phthalate to a dihydrodiol. PDO has long served as a model for understanding ROs despite a lack of structural data. Here we purified PDOKF1 from Comamonas testosteroni KF1 and found that it had an apparent kcat/Km for phthalate of 0.58 ± 0.09 μM-1s-1, over 25-fold greater than for terephthalate. The crystal structure of the enzyme at 2.1 Å resolution revealed that it is a hexamer comprising two stacked α3 trimers, a configuration not previously observed in RO crystal structures. We show that within each trimer, the protomers adopt a head-to-tail configuration typical of ROs. The stacking of the trimers is stabilized by two extended helices, which make the catalytic domain of PDOKF1 larger than that of other characterized ROs. Complexes of PDOKF1 with phthalate and terephthalate revealed that Arg207 and Arg244, two residues on one face of the active site, position these substrates for regiospecific hydroxylation. Consistent with their roles as determinants of substrate specificity, substitution of either residue with alanine yielded variants that did not detectably turnover phthalate. Together, these results provide critical insights into a pollutant-degrading enzyme that has served as a paradigm for ROs and facilitate the engineering of this enzyme for bioremediation and biocatalytic applications."

https://openalex.org/W3116662049,"In the heart, fatty acid is a major energy substrate to fuel contraction under aerobic conditions. Ischemia downregulates fatty acid metabolism to adapt to the limited oxygen supply, making glucose the preferred substrate. However, the mechanism underlying the myocardial metabolic shift during ischemia remains unknown. Here, we show that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in cardiomyocytes, a principal enzyme that converts triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol, increases during myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiomyocyte-specific LPL deficiency enhanced cardiac dysfunction and apoptosis following MI. Deficiency of aquaporin 7 (AQP7), a glycerol channel in cardiomyocytes, increased the myocardial infarct size and apoptosis in response to ischemia. Ischemic conditions activated glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GPD2), which converts glycerol-3-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate to facilitate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis from glycerol. Conversely, GPD2 deficiency exacerbated cardiac dysfunction after acute MI. Moreover, cardiomyocyte-specific LPL deficiency suppressed the effectiveness of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist treatment for MI-induced cardiac dysfunction. These results suggest that LPL/AQP7/GPD2-mediated glycerol metabolism plays an important role in preventing myocardial ischemia-related damage."
https://openalex.org/W3213933564,"Bacterial fatty acid synthesis in Escherichia coli is initiated by the condensation of an acetyl-CoA with a malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) by the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III enzyme, FabH. E. coli ΔfabH knockout strains are viable because of the yiiD gene that allows FabH-independent fatty acid synthesis initiation. However, the molecular function of the yiiD gene product is not known. Here, we show the yiiD gene product is a malonyl-ACP decarboxylase (MadA). MadA has two independently folded domains: an amino-terminal N-acetyl transferase (GNAT) domain (MadAN) and a carboxy-terminal hot dog dimerization domain (MadAC) that encodes the malonyl-ACP decarboxylase function. Members of the proteobacterial Mad protein family are either two domain MadA (GNAT-hot dog) or standalone MadB (hot dog) decarboxylases. Using structure-guided, site-directed mutagenesis of MadB from Shewanella oneidensis, we identified Asn45 on a conserved catalytic loop as critical for decarboxylase activity. We also found that MadA, MadAC, or MadB expression all restored normal cell size and growth rates to an E. coli ΔfabH strain, whereas the expression of MadAN did not. Finally, we verified that GlmU, a bifunctional glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyl transferase/N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase that synthesizes the key intermediate UDP-GlcNAc, is an ACP binding protein. Acetyl-ACP is the preferred glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyl transferase/N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase substrate, in addition to being the substrate for the elongation-condensing enzymes FabB and FabF. Thus, we conclude that the Mad family of malonyl-ACP decarboxylases supplies acetyl-ACP to support the initiation of fatty acid, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and enterobacterial common antigen biosynthesis in Proteobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3216224801,"Eye movements measured by high precision eye-tracking technology represent a sensitive, objective, and non-invasive method to probe functional neural pathways. Oculomotor tests (e.g., saccades and smooth pursuit), tests that involve cognitive processing (e.g., antisaccade and predictive saccade), and reaction time tests have increasingly been showing utility in the diagnosis and monitoring of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in research settings. Currently, the adoption of these tests into clinical practice is hampered by a lack of a normative data set. The goal of this study was to construct a normative database to be used as a reference for comparing patients' results. Oculomotor, cognitive, and reaction time tests were administered to male and female volunteers, aged 18-45, who were free of any neurological, vestibular disorders, or other head injuries. Tests were delivered using either a rotatory chair equipped with video-oculography goggles (VOG) or a portable virtual reality-like VOG goggle device with incorporated infrared eye-tracking technology. Statistical analysis revealed no effects of age on test metrics when participant data were divided into pediatric (i.e.,18-21 years, following FDA criteria) and adult (i.e., 21-45 years) groups. Gender (self-reported) had an effect on auditory reaction time, with males being faster than females. Pooled data were used to construct a normative database using 95% reference intervals (RI) with 90% confidence intervals on the upper and lower limits of the RI. The availability of these RIs readily allows clinicians to identify specific metrics that are deficient, therefore aiding in rapid triage, informing and monitoring treatment and/or rehabilitation protocols, and aiding in the return to duty/activity decision. This database is FDA cleared for use in clinical practice (K192186)."
https://openalex.org/W3213904362,"Calcium signaling is essential for regulating many biological processes. Endoplasmic reticulum inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) are key proteins that regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation activates Ca2+-sensitive dehydrogenases of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that maintain the biosynthetic and bioenergetic needs of both normal and cancer cells. However, the interplay between calcium signaling and metabolism is not well understood. In this study, we used human cancer cell lines (HEK293 and HeLa) with stable KOs of all three IP3R isoforms (triple KO [TKO]) or MCU to examine metabolic and bioenergetic responses to the chronic loss of cytosolic and/or mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling. Our results show that TKO cells (exhibiting total loss of Ca2+ signaling) are viable, displaying a lower proliferation and oxygen consumption rate, with no significant changes in ATP levels, even when made to rely solely on the TCA cycle for energy production. MCU KO cells also maintained normal ATP levels but showed increased proliferation, oxygen consumption, and metabolism of both glucose and glutamine. However, MCU KO cells were unable to maintain ATP levels and died when relying solely on the TCA cycle for energy. We conclude that constitutive Ca2+ signaling is dispensable for the bioenergetic needs of both IP3R TKO and MCU KO human cancer cells, likely because of adequate basal glycolytic and TCA cycle flux. However, in MCU KO cells, the higher energy expenditure associated with increased proliferation and oxygen consumption makes these cells more prone to bioenergetic failure under conditions of metabolic stress. Calcium signaling is essential for regulating many biological processes. Endoplasmic reticulum inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) are key proteins that regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

Ca2+ signaling plays an important role in regulating many diverse biological processes ranging from cell proliferation, secretion, motility, metabolism, and cell death (1Berridge M.J. Inositol trisphosphate and calcium signalling.Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6128) Google Scholar). A key event that initiates Ca2+ signaling is the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by the three isoforms of inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) channels (2Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Inositol trisphosphate receptor Ca2+ release channels.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The depletion of internal Ca2+ stores secondarily stimulates Ca2+ entry via Orai channels in the plasma membrane. Thus, loss of IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling would block both the intracellular and extracellular components of agonist-mediated Ca2+ signaling. An increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in the environment of the mitochondria facilitates Ca2+ uptake into the matrix by a complex of inner membrane proteins of which the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) is the pore-forming constituent (3Mammucari C. Gherardi G. Rizzuto R. Structure, activity regulation, and role of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter in health and disease.Front. Oncol. 2017; 7: 139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The elevations of Ca2+ in the cytosol and mitochondrial compartments act on multiple effector proteins to alter cell function (1Berridge M.J.

In the mitochondrial matrix, Ca2+ stimulates the activity of three dehydrogenases of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (5Denton R.M. Regulation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases by calcium ions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), respiratory complexes (6Murphy A.N. Kelleher J.K.

Higher matrix Ca2+ accumulation can open the permeability transition pore and cause cell death (8Giorgio V. Guo L. Bassot C. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Calcium and regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition.Cell Calcium. 2018; 70: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Inactivating the function of all three IP3R isoforms or MCU channels would therefore be expected to have wide-ranging effects, including compromising the metabolic and bioenergetic status of the cells. Global and conditional KO mouse models of individual IP3R isoforms have provided valuable information on the role of Ca2+ signaling in regulating organ function (9Matsumoto M. Nakagawa T. Inoue T.

Overall, it is clear that the metabolic phenotype of the MCU KO cells is dependent on the cell type being investigated. To obtain a clearer picture of the metabolic consequences of disrupting either ER or mitochondrial Ca2+, we have carried out the present study in which IP3Rs or MCU have been knocked out in the same human cancer cell lines. Our studies show that the IP3R TKO cells have adapted to the total loss of Ca2+ signaling with a lower proliferation and oxygen consumption rate (OCR), but no significant changes in adenine nucleotides, even when artificially made to rely entirely on the TCA cycle for their bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs. By contrast, the loss of MCU is associated with an increased proliferation and OCR, increased metabolism of glucose and glutamine, a higher level of basal AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK), and bioenergetic failure when made to rely solely on the TCA cycle. We conclude that baseline rates of aerobic glycolysis and the TCA cycle are sufficient to make constitutive ER/mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling dispensable for the growth and function of both IP3R TKO and MCU KO cancer cells. However, in MCU KO cells, the higher energy expenditure associated with increased proliferation and oxygen consumption make these cells more prone to bioenergetic failure under conditions of metabolic stress. We initially characterized cytosolic Ca2+ signals in the IP3R and MCU KO HEK293 cell models incubated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. As expected, the loss of all three IP3R isoforms prevented any cytosolic Ca2+ changes induced by carbachol (Cch) stimulation of endogenous muscarinic receptors (Fig. 1, A and B). MCU deletion was carried out in the variant HEK293T cell line (48Sancak Y. Markhard A.L. Kitami T. Kovacs-Bogdan E. Kamer K.J. Udeshi N.D. Carr S.A. Chaudhuri D. Clapham D.E. Li A.A. Calvo S.E.

The cytosolic Ca2+ responses of WT HEK293 and HEK293T cells were not significantly different (Fig. 1A), and this also proved to be the case for several other parameters measured in this study. This includes cell growth (Fig. 2A), glucose utilization (Fig. S1A), glutamine consumption (Fig. S1B), total NAD+ and NADH (Fig. S1, C and D), lactate accumulation (Fig. S1E), ATP levels (Fig. S1F), phosphorylated AMPK levels (Fig. S1G), and phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase (p-PDH) levels (Fig. S1H). Hence, only the WT HEK293 cells are represented as controls in most of the remaining figures.Figure 2Growth, glycolysis, and pyridine nucleotide levels in WT, IP3R TKO, and MCU-KO HEK293T cells.

Both WT and IP3R TKO cells had comparable rates of mitochondrial uptake and (carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone) (FCCP)-induced release compared with the negligible rates for both processes seen in the MCU KO cells. The MCU KO–permeabilized cells consistently showed an elevated steady state [Ca2+] in the medium prior to Ca2+ pulse addition. This may reflect the failure of the cells to sequester the endogenous contaminating Ca2+ into the mitochondria before the initiation of the experiment. The mitochondrial Ca2+ content in intact cells was estimated using the ratiometric, high-affinity, genetically encoded, fluorescent probe GEM-GECO (Kd ∼340 nM; (49Zhao Y. Araki S. Wu J. Teramoto T.

The baseline signal in all three cell lines was not significantly decreased by chelation of extracellular Ca2+ or by depolarization with FCCP/oligomycin, indicating that there is very little Ca2+ in the mitochondria under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 1, E and F). The measured basal content was only marginally lower (∼20%) in IP3R TKO and MCU KO cells (Fig. 1F). It should be noted that a variable lowering of mitochondrial Ca2+ content has been reported in mouse MCU KO models (50Pan X. Liu J. Nguyen T. Liu C. Sun J. Teng Y. Fergusson M.M. Rovira I.I. Allen M.

Pathophysiological mechanisms indicate a link with oral health including periodontitis (PD), but supporting data are scarce. The aim was to investigate the link between features of oral health and the prevalence of AF.This cross-sectional analysis of the Hamburg City Health Study included 5,634 participants with complete data on their PD and AF status. AF was assessed via self-reported questionnaire or medically diagnosed by standard 12-lead resting ECG. The oral health examination included full-mouth measurements of the dental plaque index (PI), the clinical attachment loss (CAL) at 6 sites per tooth, the bleeding on probing (BOP) and the decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index. Descriptive analyses for all variables stratified by the status of PD were performed. To test for an association between prevalent PD and prevalent AF, multivariable logistic regression models were used. Mediation analysis was used to test if interleukin-6 (IL-6) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) mediated the association between PD and AF.Atrial fibrillation (prevalence: 5.6%) and the severity of PD (prevalence: moderate: 57.7%, severe: 18.9%) increased with age in men and women. Prevalent severe PD, CAL ≥3 mm, PI, and BOP were all associated with prevalent AF in unadjusted regression analysis. However, no association except for PI (odds ratio (OR): 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.35, p<0.001) could be observed after adjusting for age, sex, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), body mass index, diabetes, smoking, and educational level. Participants brushing their teeth at least twice daily had a lower AF prevalence compared with those brushing only once daily. Hs-CRP, IL-6, and the odds of AF increased as a function of PD severity grades in unadjusted analysis. However, neither the DMFT index nor IL-6 or CRP was associated with AF after adjusting for age and sex. Mediation analyses could not provide support for the hypothesis that IL-6 or CRP acted as mediator of the association between prevalent PD and prevalent AF.The study shows an association between prevalent AF and increased dental plaque levels indicated by a higher PI. In contrast, an association of prevalent PD with prevalent AF after adjustments for several confounders could not be demonstrated. Further studies are necessary to investigate the mechanisms underlying poor oral hygiene and AF as well as the influence of improved oral hygiene on AF onset."
https://openalex.org/W3217585246,"Chromosome 8q gain is associated with poor clinical outcomes in prostate cancer, but the underlying biological mechanisms remain to be clarified. CSN5, a putative androgen receptor (AR) partner that is located on chromosome 8q, is the key subunit of the COP9 signalosome, which deactivates ubiquitin ligases. Deregulation of CSN5 could affect diverse cellular functions that contribute to tumor development, but there has been no comprehensive study of its function in prostate cancer. The clinical significance of CSN5 amplification/overexpression was evaluated in 16 prostate cancer clinical cohorts. Its oncogenic activity was assessed by genetic and pharmacologic perturbations of CSN5 activity in prostate cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanisms of CSN5 function were assessed, as was the efficacy of the CSN5 inhibitor CSN5i-3 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the transcription cofactor activity of CSN5 in prostate cancer cells was determined. The prognostic significance of CSN5 amplification and overexpression in prostate cancer was independent of MYC amplification. Inhibition of CSN5 inhibited its oncogenic function by targeting AR signaling, DNA repair, multiple oncogenic pathways, and spliceosome regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of CSN5 repressed metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AR-negative prostate cancer cells. Targeting CSN5 with CSN5i-3 showed potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, CSN5i-3 synergizes with PARP inhibitors to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. CSN5 functions as a transcription cofactor to cooperate with multiple transcription factors in prostate cancer. Inhibiting CSN5 strongly attenuates prostate cancer progression and could enhance PARP inhibition efficacy in the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3212682327,"Naturally occurring missense variants of G protein-coupled receptors with loss of function have been linked to metabolic disease in case studies and in animal experiments. The glucagon receptor, one such G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in maintaining blood glucose and amino acid homeostasis; however, loss-of-function mutations of this receptor have not been systematically characterized. Here, we observed fewer glucagon receptor missense variants than expected, as well as lower allele diversity and fewer variants with trait associations as compared with other class B1 receptors. We performed molecular pharmacological phenotyping of 38 missense variants located in the receptor extracellular domain, at the glucagon interface, or with previously suggested clinical implications. These variants were characterized in terms of cAMP accumulation to assess glucagon-induced Gαs coupling, and of recruitment of β-arrestin-1/2. Fifteen variants were impaired in at least one of these downstream functions, with six variants affected in both cAMP accumulation and β-arrestin-1/2 recruitment. For the eight variants with decreased Gαs signaling (D63ECDN, P86ECDS, V96ECDE, G125ECDC, R2253.30H, R3085.40W, V3686.59M, and R3787.35C) binding experiments revealed preserved glucagon affinity, although with significantly reduced binding capacity. Finally, using the UK Biobank, we found that variants with wildtype-like Gαs signaling did not associate with metabolic phenotypes, whereas carriers of cAMP accumulation-impairing variants displayed a tendency toward increased risk of obesity and increased body mass and blood pressure. These observations are in line with the essential role of the glucagon system in metabolism and support that Gαs is the main signaling pathway effecting the physiological roles of the glucagon receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3215286497,"Most transcription in Trypanosoma brucei is constitutive and polycistronic. Consequently, the parasite relies on post-transcriptional mechanisms, especially affecting translation initiation and mRNA decay, to control gene expression both at steady-state and for adaptation to different environments. The parasite has six isoforms of the cap-binding protein EIF4E as well as five EIF4Gs. EIF4E1 does not bind to any EIF4G, instead being associated with a 4E-binding protein, 4EIP. 4EIP represses translation and reduces the stability of a reporter mRNA when artificially tethered to the 3'-UTR, whether or not EIF4E1 is present. 4EIP is essential during the transition from the mammalian bloodstream form to the procyclic form that lives in the Tsetse vector. In contrast, EIF4E1 is dispensable during differentiation, but is required for establishment of growing procyclic forms. In Leishmania, there is some evidence that EIF4E1 might be active in translation initiation, via direct recruitment of EIF3. However in T. brucei, EIF4E1 showed no detectable association with other translation initiation factors, even in the complete absence of 4EIP. There was some evidence for interactions with NOT complex components, but if these occur they must be weak and transient. We found that EIF4E1is less abundant in the absence of 4EIP, and RNA pull-down results suggested this might occur through co-translational complex assembly. We also report that 4EIP directly recruits the cytosolic terminal uridylyl transferase TUT3 to EIF4E1/4EIP complexes. There was, however, no evidence that TUT3 is essential for 4EIP function."
https://openalex.org/W3211813232,"Noncovalent complexes of transforming growth factor-β family growth/differentiation factors with their prodomains are classified as latent or active, depending on whether the complexes can bind their respective receptors. For the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), the hormone-prodomain complex is active, and the prodomain is displaced upon binding to its type II receptor, AMH receptor type-2 (AMHR2), on the cell surface. However, the mechanism by which this displacement occurs is unclear. Here, we used ELISA assays to measure the dependence of prodomain displacement on AMH concentration and analyzed results with respect to the behavior expected for reversible binding in combination with ligand-induced receptor dimerization. We found that, in solution, the prodomain has a high affinity for the growth factor (GF) (Kd = 0.4 pM). Binding of the AMH complex to a single AMHR2 molecule does not affect this Kd and does not induce prodomain displacement, indicating that the receptor binding site in the AMH complex is fully accessible to AMHR2. However, recruitment of a second AMHR2 molecule to bind the ligand bivalently leads to a 1000-fold increase in the Kd for the AMH complex, resulting in rapid release of the prodomain. Displacement occurs only if the AMHR2 is presented on a surface, indicating that prodomain displacement is caused by a conformational change in the GF induced by bivalent binding to AMHR2. In addition, we demonstrate that the bone morphogenetic protein 7 prodomain is displaced from the complex with its GF by a similar process, suggesting that this may represent a general mechanism for receptor-mediated prodomain displacement in this ligand family."
https://openalex.org/W3213481188,"Insulin resistance impairs postprandial glucose uptake through glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and is the primary defect preceding type 2 diabetes. We previously generated an insulin-resistant mouse model with human GLUT4 promoter-driven insulin receptor knockout (GIRKO) in the muscle, adipose, and neuronal subpopulations. However, the rate of diabetes in GIRKO mice remained low prior to 6 months of age on normal chow diet (NCD), suggesting that additional factors/mechanisms are responsible for adverse metabolic effects driving the ultimate progression of overt diabetes. In this study, we characterized the metabolic phenotypes of the adult GIRKO mice acutely switched to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in order to identify additional metabolic challenges required for disease progression. Distinct from other diet-induced obesity (DIO) and genetic models (e.g., db/db mice), GIRKO mice remained leaner on HFD feeding, but developed other cardinal features of insulin resistance syndrome. GIRKO mice rapidly developed hyperglycemia despite compensatory increases in β-cell mass and hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, GIRKO mice also had impaired oral glucose tolerance and a limited glucose-lowering benefit from exendin-4, suggesting that the blunted incretin effect contributed to hyperglycemia. Secondly, GIRKO mice manifested severe dyslipidemia while on HFD due to elevated hepatic lipid secretion, serum triglyceride concentration, and lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes. Thirdly, GIRKO mice on HFD had increased inflammatory cues in the gut, which were associated with the HFD-induced microbiome alterations and increased serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In conclusion, our studies identified important gene/diet interactions contributing to diabetes progression, which might be leveraged to develop more efficacious therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3214801735,"The Greater Everglades Region of South Florida is one of the largest natural wetlands and the only subtropical ecosystem found in the continental United States. Mosquitoes are seasonally abundant in the Everglades where several potentially pathogenic mosquito-borne arboviruses are maintained in natural transmission cycles involving vector-competent mosquitoes and reservoir-competent vertebrate hosts. The fragile nature of this ecosystem is vulnerable to many sources of environmental change, including a wetlands restoration project, climate change, invasive species and residential development. In this study, we obtained baseline data on the distribution and abundance of both mosquitos and arboviruses occurring in the southern Everglades region during the summer months of 2013, when water levels were high, and in 2014, when water levels were low. A total of 367,060 mosquitoes were collected with CO2-baited CDC light traps at 105 collection sites stratified among the major landscape features found in Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, Fakahatchee State Park Preserve and Picayune State Forest, an area already undergoing restoration. A total of 2,010 pools of taxonomically identified mosquitoes were cultured for arbovirus isolation and identification. Seven vertebrate arboviruses were isolated: Everglades virus, Tensaw virus, Shark River virus, Gumbo Limbo virus, Mahogany Hammock virus, Keystone virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Except for Tensaw virus, which was absent in 2013, the remaining viruses were found to be most prevalent in hardwood hammocks and in Fakahatchee, less prevalent in mangroves and pinelands, and absent in cypress and sawgrass. In contrast, in the summer of 2014 when water levels were lower, these arboviruses were far less prevalent and only found in hardwood hammocks, but Tensaw virus was present in cypress, sawgrass, pinelands, and a recently burned site. Major environmental changes are anticipated in the Everglades, many of which will result in increased water levels. How these might lead to the emergence of arboviruses potentially pathogenic to both humans and wildlife is discussed."

The variance of the ordinary least squared estimator become unstable in such situation. In order to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity, Liu regression is widely used as a biased method of estimation with shrinkage parameter 'd'. The optimal value of shrinkage parameter plays a vital role in bias-variance trade-off.Several estimators are available in literature for the estimation of shrinkage parameter. But the existing estimators do not perform well in terms of smaller mean squared error when the problem of multicollinearity is high or severe.In this paper, some new estimators for the shrinkage parameter are proposed. The proposed estimators are the class of estimators that are based on quantile of the regression coefficients. The performance of the new estimators is compared with the existing estimators through Monte Carlo simulation. Mean squared error and mean absolute error is considered as evaluation criteria of the estimators. Tobacco dataset is used as an application to illustrate the benefits of the new estimators and support the simulation results.The new estimators outperform the existing estimators in most of the considered scenarios including high and severe cases of multicollinearity. 95% mean prediction interval of all the estimators is also computed for the Tobacco data. The new estimators give the best mean prediction interval among all other estimators.We recommend the use of new estimators to practitioners when the problem of high to severe multicollinearity exists among the predictor variables."
https://openalex.org/W3213223993,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in the F-box only protein 7 gene (Fbxo7) have been reported to cause an autosomal recessive form of early-onset familial PD. FBXO7 is a part of the SKP1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates ubiquitination of numerous substrates. FBXO7 also regulates mitophagy, cell growth, and proteasome activity. A member of the FOXO family, the transcription factor FOXO4, is also known to modulate several cellular responses, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis; however, the relationship between FBXO7 and FOXO4 has not been investigated. In this study, we determined that FBXO7 binds to FOXO4 and negatively regulates intracellular FOXO4 levels. Interestingly, we also found that FBXO7-mediated degradation of FOXO4 did not occur through either of two major proteolysis systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system or the lysosome-autophagy pathway, although it was blocked by a caspase 8-specific inhibitor and caspase 8-knockdown. Moreover, intracellular FOXO4 levels were greatly reduced in dopaminergic MN9D cells following treatment with neurotoxic 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), which was produced upon FBXO7-mediated and caspase 8-mediated proteolysis. Taken together, these results suggest that FOXO4 is negatively regulated in FBXO7-linked PD through caspase 8 activation, suppressing the cytoprotective effect of FOXO4 during 6-OHDA-induced neuronal cell death."
https://openalex.org/W3214824591,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact people worldwide-steadily depleting scarce resources in healthcare. Medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a much-needed relief but only if the technology gets adopted at scale. The present research investigates people's intention to adopt medical AI as well as the drivers of this adoption in a representative study of two European countries (Denmark and France, N = 1068) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results reveal AI aversion; only 1 of 10 individuals choose medical AI over human physicians in a hypothetical triage-phase of COVID-19 pre-hospital entrance. Key predictors of medical AI adoption are people's trust in medical AI and, to a lesser extent, the trait of open-mindedness. More importantly, our results reveal that mistrust and perceived uniqueness neglect from human physicians, as well as a lack of social belonging significantly increase people's medical AI adoption. These results suggest that for medical AI to be widely adopted, people may need to express less confidence in human physicians and to even feel disconnected from humanity. We discuss the social implications of these findings and propose that successful medical AI adoption policy should focus on trust building measures-without eroding trust in human physicians."
https://openalex.org/W3217702085,"Dehydration can have negative effects on animal physiological performance, growth, reproduction, and survival, and most animals seek to minimize these effects by reducing water losses or seeking water sources. Much-but not all-of the research on animal water balance comes from dryland ecosystems. However, animals inhabiting mesic regions may also experience desiccating conditions, for example within urban heat islands or during heatwaves and droughts. Here we examined how spatial variation in impervious surface and spatial and temporal variation in microclimate impact water demand behavior of terrestrial arthropods and mollusks in three areas of mesic Northwest Ohio, with analysis of taxa that exhibited the greatest water demand behavior. Water demand behavior was measured as the frequency that individuals were observed at an artificial water source (a moistened pouch), relative to the frequency at a control (a dry pouch). Overall, terrestrial arthropods and mollusks were found about twice as often at the water source than at the control (equivalent to 86 more observations on the wet pouch than on dry at each site, on average), with ants accounting for over 50% of the overall response in urban areas. Daily fluctuations in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) best predicted daily variation in water demand behavior, with increased demand at higher VPD. Mean VPD was generally highest near urbanized areas, but effects of VPD on water demand behavior were generally lower in urbanized areas (possibly related to reductions in overall abundance reducing the potential response). On certain days, VPD was high in natural areas and greenspaces, and this coincided with the highest arthropod water demand behavior observed. Our results suggest that terrestrial arthropod communities do experience periods of water demand within mesic regions, including in greenspaces outside cities, where they appear to respond strongly to short periods of dry conditions-an observation with potential relevance for understanding the effects of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4225476173,"Hexosaminidase A (HexA), a heterodimer consisting of HEXA and HEXB, converts the ganglioside sphingolipid GM2 to GM3 by removing a terminal N-acetyl-d-galactosamine. HexA enzyme deficiency in humans leads to GM2 accumulation in cells, particularly in neurons, and is associated with neurodegeneration. While HexA and sphingolipid metabolism have been extensively investigated in the context of neuronal lipid metabolism, little is known about the metabolic impact of HexA and ganglioside degradation in other tissues. Here, we focussed on the role of HexA in the liver, which is a major regulator of systemic lipid metabolism. We find that hepatic Hexa expression is induced by lipid availability and increased in the presence of hepatic steatosis, which is associated with increased hepatic GM3 content. To assess the impact of HEXA on hepatic lipid metabolism, we used an adeno-associated virus to overexpress HEXA in the livers of high-fat diet fed mice. HEXA overexpression was associated with increased hepatic GM3 content and increased expression of enzymes involved in the degradation of glycated sphingolipids, ultimately driving sphingomyelin accumulation in the liver. In addition, HEXA overexpression led to substantial proteome remodeling in cell surface lipid rafts, which was associated with increased VLDL processing and secretion, hypertriglyceridemia and ectopic lipid accumulation in peripheral tissues. This study established an important role of HEXA in modulating hepatic sphingolipid and lipoprotein metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3212364793,"The two-pore channels (TPCs) are voltage-gated cation channels consisting of single polypeptides with two repeats of a canonical 6-transmembrane unit. TPCs are known to be regulated by various physiological signals such as membrane voltage and phosphoinositide (PI). The fourth helix in the second repeat (second S4) plays a major role in detecting membrane voltage, whereas the first repeat contains a PI binding site. Therefore, each of these stimuli is detected by a unique repeat to regulate the gating of the TPC central pore. How these various stimuli regulate the dynamic structural rearrangement of the TPC molecule remain unknown. Here, we found that PI binding to the first repeat in TPC3 regulates the movement of the distally located second S4 helix, showing that the PI-binding signal is not confined to the pore gate but also transmitted to the voltage sensor. Using voltage clamp fluorometry, measurement of gating charges, and Cys-accessibility analysis, we observed that PI binding significantly potentiates the voltage dependence of the movement of the second S4 helix. Notably, voltage clamp fluorometry analysis revealed that the voltage-dependent movement of the second S4 helix occurred in two phases, of which the second phase corresponds to the transfer of the gating charges. This movement was observed in the voltage range where gate-opening occurs and was potentiated by PI. In conclusion, this regulation of the second S4 helix by PI indicates a tight inter-repeat coupling within TPC3, a feature which might be conserved among TPC family members to integrate various physiological signals."
https://openalex.org/W3215962202,"Node counting on a graph is subject to some fundamental theoretical limitations, yet a solution to such problems is necessary in many applications of graph theory to real-world systems, such as collective robotics and distributed sensor networks. Thus several stochastic and naïve deterministic algorithms for distributed graph size estimation or calculation have been provided. Here we present a deterministic and distributed algorithm that allows every node of a connected graph to determine the graph size in finite time, if an upper bound on the graph size is provided. The algorithm consists in the iterative aggregation of information in local hubs which then broadcast it throughout the whole graph. The proposed node-counting algorithm is on average more efficient in terms of node memory and communication cost than its previous deterministic counterpart for node counting, and appears comparable or more efficient in terms of average-case time complexity. As well as node counting, the algorithm is more broadly applicable to problems such as summation over graphs, quorum sensing, and spontaneous hierarchy creation."
https://openalex.org/W3216473896,"DNA molecular combing is a technique that stretches thousands of long individual DNA molecules (up to 10 Mbp) into a parallel configuration on surface. It has previously been proposed to sequence these molecules by synthesis. However, this approach poses two critical challenges: 1-Combed DNA molecules are overstretched and therefore a nonoptimal substrate for polymerase extension. 2-The combing surface sterically impedes full enzymatic access to the DNA backbone. Here, we introduce a novel approach that attaches thousands of molecules to a removable surface, with a tunable stretching factor. Next, we dissolve portions of the surface, leaving the DNA molecules suspended as 'bridges'. We demonstrate that the suspended molecules are enzymatically accessible, and we have used an enzyme to incorporate labeled nucleotides, as predicted by the specific molecular sequence. Our results suggest that this novel platform is a promising candidate to achieve high-throughput sequencing of Mbp-long molecules, which could have additional genomic applications, such as the study of other protein-DNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3214762265,"Grain shape strongly influences the economic value and grain yield of rice. Thus, identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain shape has been a longstanding goal in rice genetic research and breeding programs. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are ubiquitous in the rice genome and are more abundant and evenly distributed on the 12 rice chromosomes than traditional markers. An F2 population was genotyped using the RICE6K SNP array to elucidate the mechanisms governing grain shape. Thirty-five QTLs for grain shape were detected on 11 of 12 chromosomes over 2 years. The major QTL cluster qGS7 was detected in both years and displayed strong genetic effects on grain length and width, showing consistency with GL7/GW7. Some minor QTLs were also detected, and the effects of four QTLs on seed size were then validated using BC1F6 populations with residual heterozygous lines in each QTL region. Our findings provide insights into the molecular basis of grain shape as well as additional resources and approaches for producing hybrid high-yield rice varieties."
https://openalex.org/W3215478744,"The protein aggregation is one of the major challenges of the biotechnological industry, especially in the areas of development and commercialization of successful protein-based drug products. The inherent high aggregation tendency of proteins during various manufacturing processes, storage, and administration has significant impact upon the product quality, safety and efficacy. We have developed an interesting protein purification approach that separates the functionally active protein from inactive aggregates using a detergent concentration gradient. The C-terminally His tagged nucleocapsid protein of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) has high aggregation tendency and rapidly precipitates upon purification by NiNTA chromatography. Using the new purification approach reported here, the freshly purified protein by NiNTA chromatography was further processed using a detergent gradient. In this new purification approach the active protein is retained in the low detergent concentration zone while the inactive aggregates are promptly removed by their rapid migration to the high detergent concentration zone. The method prevented further aggregation and retained the RNA binding activity in the native protein despite numerous freeze thaw cycles. This simple approach prevents protein aggregation by rapidly separating the preformed early aggregates and creating the appropriate microenvironment for correctly folded proteins to retain their biological activity. It will be of potential importance to the biotechnological industry and other fields of protein biochemistry that routinely face the challenges of protein aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W3215804052,"Background Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2 Group F (Nr2f) orphan nuclear hormone transcription factors (TFs) are fundamental regulators of many developmental processes in invertebrates and vertebrates. Despite the importance of these TFs throughout metazoan development, previous work has not clearly outlined their evolutionary history. Results We integrated molecular phylogeny with comparisons of intron/exon structure, domain architecture, and syntenic conservation to define critical evolutionary events that distinguish the Nr2f gene family in Metazoa. Our data indicate that a single ancestral eumetazoan Nr2f gene predated six main Bilateria subfamilies, which include single Nr2f homologs, here referred to as Nr2f1/2/5/6 , that are present in invertebrate protostomes and deuterostomes, Nr2f1/2 homologs in agnathans, and Nr2f1 , Nr2f2 , Nr2f5 , and Nr2f6 orthologs that are found in gnathostomes. Four cnidarian Nr2f1/2/5/6 and three agnathan Nr2f1/2 members are each due to independent expansions, while the vertebrate Nr2f1 / Nr2f2 and Nr2f5 / Nr2f6 members each form paralogous groups that arose from the established series of whole-genome duplications (WGDs). Nr2f6 members are the most divergent Nr2f subfamily in gnathostomes. Interestingly, in contrast to the other gnathostome Nr2f subfamilies, Nr2f5 has been independently lost in numerous vertebrate lineages. Furthermore, our analysis shows there are differential expansions and losses of Nr2f genes in teleosts following their additional rounds of WGDs. Conclusion Overall, our analysis of Nr2f gene evolution helps to reveal the origins and previously unrecognized relationships of this ancient TF family, which may allow for greater insights into the conservation of Nr2f functions that shape Metazoan body plans."

In the age of eHealth and data-driven medicine, publicly available symptom tracking tools offer efficient and scalable means of collecting and analyzing large amounts of data. As a result, information gains can be communicated to front-line providers. We have developed such an application in less than a month and reached more than 500 thousand users within 48 hours. The dataset contains information on basic epidemiological parameters, symptoms, risk factors and details on previous exposure to a COVID-19 patient. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed different symptoms reported by users with confirmed contacts vs. no confirmed contacts. The symptom combination of anosmia, cough and fatigue was the most important feature to differentiate the groups, while single symptoms such as anosmia, cough or fatigue alone were not sufficient. A linear regression model from the literature using the same symptom combination as features was applied on all data. Predictions matched the regional distribution of confirmed cases closely across Germany, while also indicating that the number of cases in northern federal states might be higher than officially reported. In conclusion, we report that symptom combinations anosmia, fatigue and cough are most likely to indicate an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3212101209,"CNKSR2 is a synaptic scaffolding molecule that is encoded by the CNKSR2 gene located on the X chromosome. Heterozygous mutations to CNKSR2 in humans are associated with intellectual disability and epileptic seizures, yet the cellular and molecular roles for CNKSR2 in nervous system development and disease remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify a molecular complex comprising CNKSR2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF small GTPases, CYTH2, that is necessary for the proper development of granule neurons in the mouse hippocampus. Notably, we show that CYTH2 binding prevents proteasomal degradation of CNKSR2. Furthermore, to explore the functional significance of coexpression of CNKSR2 and CYTH2 in the soma of granule cells within the hippocampal dentate gyrus, we transduced mouse granule cell precursors in vivo with small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to silence CNKSR2 or CYTH2 expression. We found that such manipulations resulted in the abnormal localization of transduced cells at the boundary between the granule cell layer and the hilus. In both cases, CNKSR2-knockdown and CYTH2-knockdown cells exhibited characteristics of immature granule cells, consistent with their putative roles in neuron differentiation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CNKSR2 and its molecular interaction partner CYTH2 are necessary for the proper development of dentate granule cells within the hippocampus through a mechanism that involves the stabilization of a complex comprising these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3212547737,"Pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) is a glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) that converts pyruvate and coenzyme A into acetyl-CoA and formate in a reaction that is crucial to the primary metabolism of many anaerobic bacteria. The glycyl radical cofactor, which is posttranslationally installed by a radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) activase, is a simple and effective catalyst, but is also susceptible to oxidative damage in microaerobic environments. Such damage occurs at the glycyl radical cofactor, resulting in cleaved PFL (cPFL). Bacteria have evolved a spare part protein termed YfiD that can be used to repair cPFL. Previously, we obtained a structure of YfiD by NMR spectroscopy and found that the N-terminus of YfiD was disordered and that the C-terminus of YfiD duplicates the structure of the C-terminus of PFL, including a β-strand that is not removed by the oxygen-induced cleavage. We also showed that cPFL is highly susceptible to proteolysis, suggesting that YfiD rescue of cPFL competes with protein degradation. Here, we probe the mechanism by which YfiD can bind and restore activity to cPFL through enzymatic and spectroscopic studies. Our data show that the disordered N-terminal region of YfiD is important for YfiD glycyl radical installation but not for catalysis, and that the duplicate β-strand does not need to be cleaved from cPFL for YfiD to bind. In fact, truncation of this PFL region prevents YfiD rescue. Collectively our data suggest the molecular mechanisms by which YfiD activation is precluded both when PFL is not damaged and when it is highly damaged."
https://openalex.org/W3213954612,"Various plants use antimicrobial proteins/peptides to resist phytopathogens. In the potato, Solanum tuberosum, the plant-specific insert (PSI) domain of an aspartic protease performs this role by disrupting phytopathogen plasma membranes. However, the mechanism by which PSI selects target membranes has not been elucidated. Here, we studied PSI-induced membrane fusion, focusing on the effects of lipid composition on fusion efficiency. Membrane fusion by the PSI involves an intermediate state whereby adjacent liposomes share their bilayers. We found that increasing the concentration of negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) phospholipids substantially accelerated PSI-mediated membrane fusion. NMR data demonstrated that PS did not affect the binding between the PSI and liposomes but had seminal effects on the dynamics of PSI interaction with liposomes. In PS-free liposomes, the PSI underwent significant motion, which was suppressed on PS-contained liposomes. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the PSI binds to PS-containing membranes with a dominant angle ranging from −31° to 30°, with respect to the bilayer, and is closer to the membrane surfaces. In contrast, PSI is mobile and exhibits multiple topological states on the surface of PS-free membranes. Taken together, our data suggested that PS lipids limit the motion of the anchored PSI, bringing it closer to the membrane surface and efficiently bridging different liposomes to accelerate fusion. As most phytopathogens have a higher content of negatively charged lipids as compared with host cells, these results indicate that the PSI selectively targets negatively charged lipids, which likely represents a way of distinguishing the pathogen from the host.

As the PSI's activity is related to its interactions with membranes, it is possibly more inclined to interact with negatively charged liposomes in order to identify potential targets (6Guevara M.

To date, the mechanistic details regarding the dependency of PSI activities on lipid composition, however, remains unclear. Therefore, this work attempts to yield further insights into the functions of the PSI. In this study, various complimentary biophysical techniques, that is, cryo-EM, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), FRET, NMR and Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations, were used to study the fusion activity dependence of the PSI as a function of brain-phosphatidylserine (PS) content, a negatively charged phospholipid, in liposomes. The cryo-EM studies trapped a stalk-like intermediate state, indicating that PSI-induced membrane fusion occurs via a stalk model within the hemi-fusion pathway. The rate of membrane fusion and the PSI's dynamics on liposomes were highly dependent on the content of PS. Increasing the PS content substantially accelerated PSI-induced membrane fusion. The NMR data showed that the PS concentration did not affect the ability of the PSI to bind vesicles but affected the dynamics of the PSI on liposomes. In PS-free liposomes, the PSI experienced pronounced motion, whereas this motion was suppressed when associated with PS-containing liposomes. Consistent with NMR, the MD data suggested that the PSI align a dominant angle ranging from −31° to 30°, on the surface of PS-containing membranes, driven by strong charge-charge interactions. Conversely, in PS-free membranes, the PSI experiences multiple topological states on or away from the surface of the membranes due to a lack of similar type of interactions. Taking into account the hemi-fusion pathway, the stable topology of the PSI on PS-containing liposomes could be more efficient in bridging different liposomes and bringing them into closer proximity, thereby accelerating the fusion process. Because pathogens have much higher amount of negatively charged lipids than host cells, these results suggest that target pathogens are identified through membrane composition. Physiologically, PSI is involved in vacuole sorting; the environment of the vacuole being acidic. Our earlier work also demonstrated that the PSI forms dimers under acidic conditions and induces membrane fusion effectively below pH 4.5 (11Zhao X. Tian J. Yu H. Bryksa B.C. Dupuis J.H. Ou X. Qian Z. Song C. Wang S. Yada R.Y. Insights into the mechanism of membrane fusion induced by the plant defense element, Plant Specific Insert.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 14548-14562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, the fusion-intermediate states have not been observed. Membrane fusion possibly occurs via the lipid-stalk model or the fusion pore model (32Jackson M. Chapman E. The fusion pores of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), both of which are observed within the hemi-fusion pathway. In the present study, cryo-EM was used to observe fusion intermediates at pH 4.5 (Fig. 1). Figure 1B shows an example of an intermediate state of vesicle fusion induced by the PSI, in which the deformation of round vesicles was separated by a single bilayer. In contrast, the vesicles without the PSI did not show shared bilayers, even though some vesicles were in contact with one another (Fig. 1A). This observation agreed with the lipid-stalk model within the hemi-fusion pathway, which includes a diaphragm formed between the inner leaflets of the two membranes (32Jackson M. Chapman E. The fusion pores of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). FRET experiments were conducted to investigate the lipid composition dependence of PSI-induced membrane fusion. Lipid-mixing experiments were performed by mixing nonfluorescent liposomes and fluorescent liposomes, where the PSI was added to induce vesicle fusion. Nonfluorescent liposomes were composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at a molar ratio of 1:1 (termed PS-free liposome hereafter) or PC/PE/PS (in a molar ratio of 1:1:0.5 or 1:1:1). Hereafter, the PC/PE/PS with a molar ratio of 1:1:1 was termed PS-containing liposome. The fluorescent liposomes were prepared by incorporating both Pho-PE and NBD-PE as the fluorescently labeled lipids (preparation details in method section FRET experiments). The close proximity between the fluorophore groups in the fluorescent liposomes quenched emission at 535 nm when using excitation wavelength at 465 nm. Lipid mixing by membrane fusion with nonfluorescent liposomes was expected to recover the emission intensity due to dilution of the fluorophore lipids with the nonfluorophore lipids and therefore separation of the FRET pairs. The fluorescent and nonfluorescent liposomes were mixed in a pH 4.5 buffer and combined at a ratio of 1:9. The PSI solution was added to this mixture. Figure 2 showed that the fusion efficiency depends on the content of PS in liposomes. Increasing the PS concentration substantially increased the fusion efficiency. For liposomes of PS-containing liposomes, 90% fusion efficiency was achieved 1200 s after adding the PSI, with respect to the maximum fluorescent signal obtained upon the addition of Triton X-100 (positive control). However, the fusion efficiency of only 33% was observed for the PS-free liposomes and 68% for 1:1:0.5 PC/PE/PS liposomes (Fig. 2). These results clearly demonstrated that the fusion rates of PSI-induced membrane fusion were substantially faster in PS-containing liposomes than in PS-free liposomes, proving the PS dependency of membrane fusion by the PSI. DLS can quantify the size distribution of the resultant fused liposomes. DLS data were collected before and after addition of the PSI to both types of liposomes (PS-free liposome and PS-containing liposomes). Before PSI addition, two peaks corresponding to vesicle radii of 10 and 100 nm were observed for both types of liposomes, with most vesicles being distributed around 100 nm (Fig. 3). After PSI addition, a broad peak appeared for both types of liposomes, corresponding to vesicles with different radii ranging from 100 to 1000 nm, thus indicating that PSI is able to fuse both PS-free and PS-containing liposomes with similar ranges of vesicle sizes, and that PS lipids did not affect the PSI fusion ability. The lipid composition dependent fusion rate of PSI-induced membrane fusion may result from differences in the capability of the PSI to bind liposomes or differently affect the dynamics of the PSI in or on the liposomes. To clarify this point, NMR spectroscopy was used to study the interaction between PSI and different types of liposomes. Solution NMR was used to study the binding capability between the PSI and different liposomes. As shown in Figure 4, the 1H-15N HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) of the PSI were recorded before and after adding different types of liposomes. Maximal PSI fusion activity has been shown to occur at approximately pH 4.5, which is near the PSI's PI. Owing to solubility issues at pH 4.5, all solution NMR experiments were conducted at 298 K and at pH 3.4. Combining PS-containing liposomes with the PSI at a protein:liposome molar ratio of 1:2 led to substantial reductions of the cross-peak intensities of the PSI. The addition of more liposomes (PSI:liposome molar ratio = 1:4) further reduced the spectral intensities. Only the cross-peaks corresponding to the highly flexible unstructured loop (i.e., 42–63) remained (Fig. 4, F and G). These results showed strong binding between the PSI and PS-containing liposomes (Fig. 4), consistent with earlier reports (11Zhao X. Tian J. Yu H. Bryksa B.C. Dupuis J.H. Ou X. Qian Z. Song C. Wang S. Yada R.Y. Insights into the mechanism of membrane fusion induced by the plant defense element, Plant Specific Insert.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 14548-14562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The largely reduced signal intensities also indicated the limited motion of the PSI in liposomes. The same set of NMR titration experiments were also conducted between the PSI and the PS-free liposomes, where the 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected accordingly (Fig. 4, A–C). Unlike the PS-containing liposomes, the cross-peak intensities for the PSI interacting with PS-free liposomes did not differ appreciably between the PSI alone, regardless of the samples containing protein:liposome in a molar ratio of 1:2 or 1:4 (Fig. 4, A–C). The overall spectral changes of the PSI upon adding PS-free liposome were less pronounced than those when adding PS-containing liposomes. Two scenarios can explain the difference in the titration results. One possibility is that the PSI has a dramatically different binding affinity for two types of liposomes, whereby it interacts transiently with PS-free liposome, with most of the PSI remaining in solution, thus producing sharp lines for the protein signals. Conversely, the PSI may form stable complexes with PS-containing liposomes, thus diminishing its signals. Another possibility is that the PSI strongly binds both types of liposomes, but with different dynamic characteristics. In this scenario, the PSI may bind to PS-free liposomes, but moves relatively freely on their surface, thus potentially leading to narrow line-width for most residues of the PSI in PS-free PSI-liposome complexes. In contrast, the PSI when interacting with PS-containing liposomes may be less mobile. To clarify these two possibilities, both of the PSI-liposome solutions were centrifuged to remove the liposomes, after the collection of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the supernatant. As shown in Figure 4, D and H, protein signals were not observed in either of the supernatants. These results showed that the PSI strongly binds on both types of liposomes, which in turn suggested that the narrow signals observed for the PSI on PS-free liposomes was because of the large dynamic motions of the PSI on PS-free liposomes. Solid-state NMR was further used to validate the dynamics of PSI on two types of liposomes. The centrifuged liposomes with 15N-labeled PSI were packed into solid-state NMR rotors, and temperature dependent 1H-15N cross-polarization solid-state NMR spectra were collected. Because cross-polarization transfer was achieved using dipolar interactions, the motion of the amide groups would average and cancel out the dipolar couplings, yielding a reduction in signal intensities (33Yang J. Aslimovska L. Glaubitz C. Molecular dynamics of proteorhodopsin in lipid bilayers by solid-state NMR.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 4874-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5, the signal intensity of the PSI in PS-free liposomes substantially decreased when the temperature was increased from 268 K to 298 K; the signal intensity of the PSI at 298 K was only 20% with respect to that at 268 K (Fig. 5D). In contrast, using PS-containing liposomes, the temperature dependent spectral changes were much smaller. In PS-containing liposomes, the signal intensity at 298 K was about 76% that at 268 K (Fig. 5H). The different"

Here, we analyzed the physiological activities of all 17 human T-box genes in early hematopoiesis and in lymphopoiesis including developing and mature B-cells, T-cells, natural killer (NK)-cells and innate lymphoid cells. The resultant expression pattern comprised six genes, namely EOMES, MGA, TBX1, TBX10, TBX19 and TBX21. We termed this gene signature TBX-code which enables discrimination of normal and aberrant activities of T-box genes in lymphoid malignancies. Accordingly, expression analysis of T-box genes in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients using a public profiling dataset revealed overexpression of EOMES, TBX1, TBX2, TBX3, TBX10, TBX19, TBX21 and TBXT while MGA showed aberrant downregulation. Analysis of T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia patients indicated aberrant overexpression of six T-box genes while no deregulated T-box genes were detected in anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients. As a paradigm we focused on TBX3 which was ectopically activated in about 6% of HL patients analyzed. Normally, TBX3 is expressed in tissues like lung, adrenal gland and retina but not in hematopoiesis. HL cell line KM-H2 expressed enhanced TBX3 levels and was used as an in vitro model to identify upstream regulators and downstream targets in this malignancy. Genomic studies of this cell line showed focal amplification of the TBX3 locus at 12q24 which may underlie its aberrant expression. In addition, promoter analysis and comparative expression profiling of HL cell lines followed by knockdown experiments revealed overexpressed transcription factors E2F4 and FOXC1 and chromatin modulator KDM2B as functional activators. Furthermore, we identified repressed target genes of TBX3 in HL including CDKN2A, NFKBIB and CD19, indicating its respective oncogenic function in proliferation, NFkB-signaling and B-cell differentiation. Taken together, we have revealed a lymphoid TBX-code and used it to identify an aberrant network around deregulated T-box gene TBX3 in HL which promotes hallmark aberrations of this disease. These findings provide a framework for future studies to evaluate deregulated T-box genes in lymphoid malignancies."

National reports have emphasized professional development as a critical component of this training period. In response, many institutions are establishing transferable skills training workshops for postdocs; however, the lack of structured programs and an absence of methods to assess outcomes beyond participant satisfaction surveys are critical gaps in postdoctoral training. To address these shortcomings, we took the approach of structured programming and developed a method for controlled assessment of outcomes. Our program You 3 (You, Your Team, Your Project), co-designed by postdoctoral fellows, focused on discussing specific management and leadership skills agnostic of ultimate career path(s) in a structured manner. We then measured outcomes in a controlled manner, by systematically comparing perceived knowledge and growth as indicators of awareness and confidence in participants against that of non-participants as the control group. You 3 participants self-rated greater growth in targeted competencies compared to non-participants independent of the number of years of training. This growth was shown by multiple criteria including self-reporting and associative analysis. Correspondingly, You 3 participants reported greater knowledge in 75% of the modules when compared to controls. These data indicate that structured learning, where postdocs commit to a curriculum via a cohort-structure, leads to positive outcomes and provides a framework for programs to assess outcomes in a rigorous manner."

Objective This study aimed to evaluate the immune regulatory capacity of canine peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived B cells pretreated with LPS. Methods Canine B cells were isolated from canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which were obtained from three healthy canine donors. The B cells were preconditioned with LPS, and then cell viability and the expression of the regulatory B cell marker were assessed. Finally, RNA extraction and immunofluorescence analysis were performed. Results LPS primed B cells expressed the interleukin (IL)-10 surface marker and immunoregulatory gene expression, such as IL-10, programmed death-ligand 1, and transforming growth factor beta. Macrophages in the inflammatory condition cocultured with primed B cells were found to have significantly down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, and up-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Additionally, it was revealed that co-culture with primed B cells re-polarized M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. Conclusions This study revealed that LPS-primed B cells have an anti-inflammatory effect and can re-polarize macrophages, suggesting the possibility of using LPS-primed B cells as a therapeutic agent for its anti-inflammatory effects and immune modulation."

However, their diets in agricultural landscapes remain largely unexplored. Pest dietary evaluation in agricultural fields is a challenging task currently approached through visual observation of plant feeding and microscopic identification of semi-digested plant material in pest’s guts. While molecular gut content analysis using metabarcoding approaches using universal primers (e.g., rbcl and trnL) have been successful in evaluating polyphagous pest diet, this method is relatively costly and time-consuming. Hence, there is a need for a rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective method to screen for crops in the gut of pests. This is the first study to develop plant-specific primers that target various regions of their genomes, designed using a whole plant genome sequence. We selected Verticillium wilt disease resistance protein (VE-1) and pathogenesis related protein-coding genes 1–5 (PR-1-5) as our targets and designed species-specific primers for 14 important crops in the agroecosystems. Using amplicon sizes ranging from 115 to 407 bp, we developed two multiplex primer mixes that can separate nine and five plant species per PCR reaction, respectively. These two designed primer mixes provide a rapid, sensitive and specific route for polyphagous pest dietary evaluation in agroecosystems. This work will enable future research to rapidly expand our knowledge on the diet preference and range of crops that pests consume in various agroecosystems, which will help in the redesign and development of new crop rotation regimes to minimize polyphagous pest pressure and damage on crops."

We compared the presence/absence of OM (OM: yes/no) between patients with and without PEMT (PEMT: yes/no) as the primary endpoint and OM severity as the secondary endpoint. The following information was surveyed: age, gender, weight loss, steroid or immunosuppressant use, hematological values (albumin, white blood cell count, blood platelets, and neutrophils), cancer grade, primary cancer site, type and use of mouthwash and moisturizer, opioid use (yes/no, days until the start of opioid use, and dose, switch to tape), and length of hospital day (LOD). The two groups were compared using Fisher's exact test for qualitative data and the Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative data, and a significance level of p<0.05 was set.The group managed by PEMT had significantly lower weight loss and a significantly lower incidence of local anesthetic and opioid use and switch to tape compared with the group not managed by PEMT (p<0.05). The two groups showed no significant difference in OM (yes/no) or OM severity. The PEMT group had significantly shorter LOD at 57 (53-64) days compared with the non-PEMT group at 63.5 (57-68) days (p<0.05).Our results showed that PEMT did not improve OM (yes/no) or OM severity in HNC patients undergoing CCRT. However, the PEMT group had a lower incidence of grades 3 and 4 OM than the non-PEMT group, although not significantly.

Trump supporters (vs. others) recalled seeing a greater number of negative protest tactics and events (e.g., breaking windows, burning things), even though many of these events did not occur. False perceptions among Trump supporters, in turn, predicted beliefs that the protesters' tactics were extreme, ultimately accounting for greater opposition to the movement and its cause.

However, the mechanism by which IFNγ suppresses Th2 cell proliferation is still not fully understood. We found that IFNγ decreases the expression of growth factor independent-1 transcriptional repressor (GFI1) in Th2 cells, resulting in the inhibition of Th2 cell proliferation. The deletion of the Gfi1 gene in Th2 cells results in the failure of their proliferation, accompanied by an impaired cell cycle progression. In contrast, the enforced expression of GFI1 restores the defective Th2 cell proliferation, even in the presence of IFNγ. These results demonstrate that GFI1 is a key molecule in the IFNγ-mediated inhibition of Th2 cell proliferation."

Despite the importance of PAS/CNBH domain interactions, little is known about their affinity. Here, we used the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique to investigate interactions between isolated PAS and CNBH domains and the effects of LQTS-causing mutations R20G, N33T, and E58D, located at the PAS/CNBH domain interface, on these interactions. We determined that the affinity of the PAS/CNBH domain interactions was ∼1.4 μM. R20G and E58D mutations had little effect on the domain interaction affinity, while N33T abolished the domain interactions. Interestingly, mutations in the intrinsic ligand, a conserved stretch of amino acids occupying the beta-roll cavity in the CNBH domain, had little effect on the affinity of PAS/CNBH domain interactions. Additionally, we determined that the isolated PAS domains formed oligomers with an interaction affinity of ∼1.6 μM. Coexpression of the isolated PAS domains with the full-length hERG channels or addition of the purified PAS protein inhibited hERG currents. These PAS/PAS interactions can have important implications for hERG function in normal and pathological conditions associated with increased surface density of channels or interaction with other PAS-domain-containing proteins. Taken together, our study provides the first account of the binding affinities for wild-type and mutant hERG PAS and CNBH domains and highlights the potential functional significance of PAS/PAS domain interactions."

In this study, the genetic variability of the frequently circulating RV types in Northern Tunisia was investigated, using phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses with a specific focus on the most frequent RV types: RV-A101 and RV-C45. This study concerned 13 RV types frequently circulating in Northern Tunisia. They were obtained from respiratory samples collected in 271 pediatric SARI cases, between September 2015 and November 2017. A total of 37 RV VP4-VP2 sequences, selected among a total of 49 generated sequences, was compared to 359 sequences from different regions of the world. Evolutionary analysis of RV-A101 and RV-C45 showed high genetic relationship between different Tunisian strains and Malaysian strains. RV-A101 and C45 progenitor viruses' dates were estimated in 1981 and 1995, respectively. Since the early 2000s, the two types had a wide spread throughout the world. Phylogenetic analyses of other frequently circulating strains showed significant homology of Tunisian strains from the same epidemic period, in contrast with earlier strains. The genetic relatedness of RV-A101 and RV-C45 might result from an introduction of viruses from different clades followed by local dissemination rather than a local persistence of an endemic clades along seasons.

Our experiments explored whether the model could predict the likelihood of observers correctly identifying hazards. In Experiment 1, we tested fourteen normally sighted subjects with blur goggles that simulated moderate or severe acuity reduction.

Subjects viewed computer-generated images of a walkway containing five possible targets ahead-big step-up, big step-down, small step-up, small step-down, or a flat continuation. Each subject saw these stimuli with variations of lighting and viewpoint in 250 trials and indicated which of the five targets was present. The model generated a score on each trial that estimated the visibility of the target. If the model is valid, the scores should be predictive of how accurately the subjects identified the targets. We used logistic regression to examine the correlation between the scores and the participants' responses. For twelve of the fourteen normally sighted subjects with artificial acuity reduction and all ten low-vision subjects, there was a significant relationship between the scores and the participant's probability of correct identification. These experiments provide evidence for the validity of a computational model that predicts the visibility of architectural hazards. It lays the foundation for future validation of this hazard evaluation tool, which may be useful for architects to assess the visibility of hazards in their designs, thereby enhancing the accessibility of spaces for people with low vision."

Little is known about the population structure of this bacterium despite its association with disease in a wide range of different fish species throughout the world. The phylogenetic relationships between 53 isolates, primarily derived from diseased lumpfish, but including a number of reference strains from diverse geographical origins and fish species, were reconstructed by Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) using nine housekeeping genes (rpoB, atpD, gyrB, rpoD, ileS, aroE, carA, glnS and recA). MLSA revealed a high degree of relatedness between the studied isolates, altough the seven genotypes identified formed three main phylogenetic lineages. While four genotypes were identified amongst Norwegian lumpfish isolates, a single genotype dominated, irrespective of geographic origin. This suggests the existence of a dominant genotype associated with disease in production of lumpfish in Norwegian aquaculture. Elucidation of the population structure of the bacterium has provided valuable information for potential future vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W3217796978,"In the midst of numerous setbacks that beclouds the fight against leishmaniasis; a neglected tropical disease, the search for new chemotherapeutics against this disease is of utmost importance. Leishmaniasis is a disease closely associated with poverty and endemic in Africa, Asia, southern Europe and the Americas. It is caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania and transmitted by a sandfly vector. In this study, we evaluated the antileishmanial potency of eighteen pathogen box compounds and elucidated their biosafety and possible mechanisms of action against Leishmania donovani promastigotes and amastigotes in vitro. IC50s range of 0.12±0.15 to >6.25 μg/ml and 0.13±0.004 to >6.25μg/ml were observed for the promastigotes and amastigotes, respectively. We demonstrated the ability of some of the compounds to cause cytocidal effect on the parasites, induce increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), disrupt the normal parasite morphology and cause the accumulation of parasites at the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle. We recommend a further in vivo study on these compounds to validate the findings."
