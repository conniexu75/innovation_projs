Our evidence comes from public goods experiments that we conducted in 16 comparable participant pools around the world. However, there is a huge cross-societal variation. Some participant pools punished the high contributors as much as they punished the low contributors, whereas in others people only punished low contributors. In some participant pools, antisocial punishment was strong enough to remove the cooperation-enhancing effect of punishment. We also show that weak norms of civic cooperation and the weakness of the rule of law in a country are significant predictors of antisocial punishment. Our results show that punishment opportunities are socially beneficial only if complemented by strong social norms of cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W1997269293,"Time has always had a special status in physics because of its fundamental role in specifying the regularities of nature and because of the extraordinary precision with which it can be measured. This precision enables tests of fundamental physics and cosmology, as well as practical applications such as satellite navigation. Recently, a regime of operation for atomic clocks based on optical transitions has become possible, promising even higher performance. We report the frequency ratio of two optical atomic clocks with a fractional uncertainty of 5.2 x 10(-17). The ratio of aluminum and mercury single-ion optical clock frequencies nuAl+/nuHg+ is 1.052871833148990438(55), where the uncertainty comprises a statistical measurement uncertainty of 4.3 x 10(-17), and systematic uncertainties of 1.9 x 10(-17) and 2.3 x 10(-17) in the mercury and aluminum frequency standards, respectively. Repeated measurements during the past year yield a preliminary constraint on the temporal variation of the fine-structure constant alpha of alpha/alpha = (-1.6+/-2.3) x 10(-17)/year."

Optomechanical systems in which this coupling is sufficiently strong are predicted to show quantum effects and are a topic of considerable interest. Devices in this regime would offer new types of control over the quantum state of both light and matter, and would provide a new arena in which to explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics. Experiments so far have achieved sufficient optomechanical coupling to laser-cool mechanical devices, but have not yet reached the quantum regime. The outstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive micromechanical elements (which must be small, light and flexible) into high-finesse cavities (which are typically rigid and massive) without compromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more fundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's energy eigenstate. Displacement measurements (no matter how sensitive) cannot determine an oscillator's energy eigenstate, and measurements coupling to quantities other than displacement have been difficult to realize in practice. Here we present an optomechanical system that has the potential to resolve both of these challenges. We demonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a 50-nm-thick dielectric membrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high-finesse mirrors. This approach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct structures and avoids compromising either. It also allows for direct measurement of the square of the membrane's displacement, and thus in principle the membrane's energy eigenstate. We estimate that it should be practical to use this scheme to observe quantum jumps of a mechanical system, an important goal in the field of quantum measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2007226897,"Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that, based on patterns of activity evoked by different categories of visual images, it is possible to deduce simple features in the visual scene, or to which category it belongs. Kay et al. take this approach a tantalizing step further. Their newly developed decoding method, based on quantitative receptive field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas, can identify with high accuracy which specific natural image an observer saw, even for an image chosen at random from 1,000 distinct images. This prompts the thought that it may soon be possible to decode subjective perceptual experiences such as visual imagery and dreams, an idea previously restricted to the realm of science fiction. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that it is possible to deduce simple features in the visual scene or to which category it belongs. A decoding method based on quantitative receptive field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas has now been developed. These models make it possible to identify, out of a large set of completely novel complex images, which specific image was seen by an observer. A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation1,2, position3 and object category4,5 from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person’s visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone."

https://openalex.org/W2022414939,"The fungus Laccaria bicolor — seen in its above-ground fruiting body presence as the 'bicoloured deceiver' mushroom — lives symbiotically on the roots of trees. Its genome has now been sequenced, and the key features of the genome characterized by transcript profiling. The study throws light on the mechanism of mycorrhizal symbiosis, the union of roots and soil fungi that is of vital important to plant productivity. And it will be of keen interest to evolutionary and plant biologists for its revelations about plant–fungus interactions shaping genomes over time. The genome of the fungus Laccaria bicolor is described; it is of keen interest to evolutionary and plant biologists for its revelations about plant–fungus interactions shaping genomes over time. Mycorrhizal symbioses—the union of roots and soil fungi—are universal in terrestrial ecosystems and may have been fundamental to land colonization by plants1,2. Boreal, temperate and montane forests all depend on ectomycorrhizae1. Identification of the primary factors that regulate symbiotic development and metabolic activity will therefore open the door to understanding the role of ectomycorrhizae in plant development and physiology, allowing the full ecological significance of this symbiosis to be explored. Here we report the genome sequence of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor (Fig. 1) and highlight gene sets involved in rhizosphere colonization and symbiosis. This 65-megabase genome assembly contains ∼20,000 predicted protein-encoding genes and a very large number of transposons and repeated sequences. We detected unexpected genomic features, most notably a battery of effector-type small secreted proteins (SSPs) with unknown function, several of which are only expressed in symbiotic tissues. The most highly expressed SSP accumulates in the proliferating hyphae colonizing the host root. The ectomycorrhizae-specific SSPs probably have a decisive role in the establishment of the symbiosis. The unexpected observation that the genome of L. bicolor lacks carbohydrate-active enzymes involved in degradation of plant cell walls, but maintains the ability to degrade non-plant cell wall polysaccharides, reveals the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots. The predicted gene inventory of the L. bicolor genome, therefore, points to previously unknown mechanisms of symbiosis operating in biotrophic mycorrhizal fungi. The availability of this genome provides an unparalleled opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the processes by which symbionts interact with plants within their ecosystem to perform vital functions in the carbon and nitrogen cycles that are fundamental to sustainable plant productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2031855605,"Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the least curable (ABC) subtype of DLBCL, survival of the malignant cells is dependent on constitutive activation of the nuclear factor–κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. In normal B cells, antigen receptor–induced NF-κB activation requires CARD11, a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein. To determine whether CARD11 contributes to tumorigenesis, we sequenced the CARD11 gene in human DLBCL tumors. We detected missense mutations in 7 of 73 ABC DLBCL biopsies (9.6%), all within exons encoding the coiled-coil domain. Experimental introduction of CARD11 coiled-coil domain mutants into lymphoma cell lines resulted in constitutive NF-κB activation and enhanced NF-κB activity upon antigen receptor stimulation. These results demonstrate that CARD11 is a bona fide oncogenein DLBCL, providing a genetic rationale for the development of pharmacological inhibitors of the CARD11 pathway for DLBCL therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1993774943,"Earth's long-term sea-level history is characterized by widespread continental flooding in the Cretaceous period (∼145 to 65 million years ago), followed by gradual regression of inland seas. However, published estimates of the Late Cretaceous sea-level high differ by half an order of magnitude, from ∼40 to ∼250 meters above the present level. The low estimate is based on the stratigraphy of the New Jersey margin. By assimilating marine geophysical data into reconstructions of ancient ocean basins, we model a Late Cretaceous sea level that is 170 (85 to 270) meters higher than it is today. We use a mantle convection model to suggest that New Jersey subsided by 105 to 180 meters in the past 70 million years because of North America's westward passage over the subducted Farallon plate. This mechanism reconciles New Jersey margin–based sea-level estimates with ocean basin reconstructions."
https://openalex.org/W2042330728,"A protocol where entanglement between two atomic ensembles is created by coherent mapping of an entangled state of light, effectively separating the generation of entanglement and its storage, is reported. Developments in quantum information science1 rely critically on entanglement—a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that causes parts of a composite system to show correlations stronger than can be explained classically2. In particular, scalable quantum networks require the capability to create, store and distribute entanglement among distant matter nodes by means of photonic channels3. Atomic ensembles can play the role of such nodes4. So far, in the photon-counting regime, heralded entanglement between atomic ensembles has been successfully demonstrated through probabilistic protocols5,6. But an inherent drawback of this approach is the compromise between the amount of entanglement and its preparation probability, leading to intrinsically low count rates for high entanglement. Here we report a protocol where entanglement between two atomic ensembles is created by coherent mapping of an entangled state of light. By splitting a single photon7,8,9 and performing subsequent state transfer, we separate the generation of entanglement and its storage10. After a programmable delay, the stored entanglement is mapped back into photonic modes with overall efficiency of 17%. Together with improvements in single-photon sources11, our protocol will allow ‘on-demand’ entanglement of atomic ensembles, a powerful resource for quantum information science."

https://openalex.org/W1981784563,"Mercury toxicity mediated by different forms of mercury is a major health problem; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity remain elusive. We analyzed the effects of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and monomethylmercury (MeHg) on the proteins of the mammalian thioredoxin system, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and thioredoxin (Trx), and of the glutaredoxin system, glutathione reductase (GR) and glutaredoxin (Grx). HgCl2 and MeHg inhibited recombinant rat TrxR with IC50 values of 7.2 and 19.7 nm, respectively. Fully reduced human Trx1 bound mercury and lost all five free thiols and activity after incubation with HgCl2 or MeHg, but only HgCl2 generated dimers. Mass spectra analysis demonstrated binding of 2.5 mol of Hg2+ and 5 mol of MeHg+/mol of Trx1 with the very strong Hg2+ complexes involving active site and structural disulfides. Inhibition of both TrxR and Trx activity was observed in HeLa and HEK 293 cells treated with HgCl2 or MeHg. GR was inhibited by HgCl2 and MeHg in vitro, but no decrease in GR activity was detected in cell extracts treated with mercurials. Human Grx1 showed similar reactivity as Trx1 with both mercurial compounds, with the loss of all free thiols and Grx dimerization in the presence of HgCl2, but no inhibition of Grx activity was observed in lysates of HeLa cells exposed to mercury. Overall, mercury inhibition was selective toward the thioredoxin system. In particular, the remarkable potency of the mercury compounds to bind to the selenol-thiol in the active site of TrxR should be a major molecular mechanism of mercury toxicity.

In particular, the remarkable potency of the mercury compounds to bind to the selenol-thiol in the active site of TrxR should be a major molecular mechanism of mercury toxicity. Over centuries, human populations have been exposed to different chemical and physical forms of mercury, all of which have deleterious effects. Past medical applications of mercury included the treatment of syphilis and skin infections, and presently its uses in amalgams and as a preservative in vaccines and topic preparations are very controversial (1Clarkson T.W. Magos L. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2006; 36: 609-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Mercury exists in three oxidation states, Hg0 (metallic), Hg+ (mercurous), and Hg2+ (mercuric), giving rise to distinct inorganic and organic mercurials. Differences in the transport of the different forms of mercury are responsible for variations in tissue and organ distribution, patterns of biological effect, and toxic potencies (1Clarkson T.W. Magos L. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2006; 36: 609-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 2World Health Organization Mercury: Environmental Aspects.

Other health risks arising from exposure to MeHg include developmental and immunotoxic effects (5Ballatori N. Environ.

MeHg contamination is a critical public health problem, since fish constitutes the major source of this xenobiotic to humans; in fish, MeHg binds to free amino acids and proteins of muscle tissues and is neither removed nor destroyed by cooking or general food preparation processes. Therefore, MeHg bioaccumulation and concentration through the aquatic food chain puts at risk the human population, who consume fish as part of a daily diet or high end fish predators in excess (4World Health Organization Summary and Conclusions of the Sixty-first Meeting of JECFA. World Health Organization, Rome2003Google Scholar, 7Clarkson T.W. Strain J.J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1539S-1543SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, MeHg is a global pollutant, with elevated levels being detected worldwide (2World Health Organization Mercury: Environmental Aspects.

Total Environ. 2006; 368: 352-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Mercury toxicity has been related to the ability of mercury to form stable complexes with sulfhydryl-containing molecules, such as the cysteine residues of cellular proteins and nonprotein molecules (5Ballatori N. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9Boelsterli U.A. Mechanistic Toxicology. Taylor and Francis, London2003Crossref Google Scholar, 10Bando I.

Toxicology. 2007; 234: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). GSH, the most abundant intracellular thiol, with 1–10 mm concentrations, is a major antioxidant and redox buffer in human cells. The role of GSH in the molecular mechanism of mercury toxicity has revealed that conjugation of MeHg with GSH contributes to the development of toxicity due to the formation of MeHg-l-cysteine complex (structurally similar to methionine), which by molecular mimicry results in this xenobiotic gaining access across cell membranes through amino acid methionine transporters (see Ref. 5Ballatori N. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and references therein). GSH depletion induced by MeHg has also been reported (12Sarafian T. Verity M.A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1991; 9: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, to date, GSH involvement is not sufficient to explain the mode of action of mercury in living organisms (13Clarkson T.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 32: 545-571Crossref Google Scholar, 14Kaur P. Aschner M. Syversen T. Toxicology. 2007; 230: 164-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The possible protective role of selenium against mercury toxicity was first observed by Ganther et al. (15Ganther H.E. Goudie C. Sunde M.L. Kopecky M.J. Wagner P. Science. 1972; 175: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). However, the results available currently are still controversial (16Cuvin-Aralar M.L. Furness R.W. Ecototoxicol. Environ. Safety. 1991; 21: 348-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 17Heinz G.H. Hoffman D.J. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1998; 17: 139-145Crossref Google Scholar, 18Hoffman D.J. Heinz G.H. Environ.

Selenides can also be a relevant target for mercurial compounds, and mercury could hypothetically inhibit the biochemical functions involving selenoenzymes (20Carvalho C.M.L. Pedrero Z. Santos A.P.M. Mateus M.L. Madrid Y. Cámara C. Batoréu M.C.C. Metal Ions in Biology and Medicine. 9. John Libbey Eurotext, Paris2006: 381-390Google Scholar). Among the 25 human selenoproteins, the well known isoenzymes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) are responsible for catalyzing redox reactions involving basic mechanisms in cell growth like DNA synthesis and antioxidant defense. Selenium is incorporated in the form of selenocysteine (Sec) in the active sites of these enzymes and participates in the catalytic mechanism of reduction of peroxide by GSH-dependent GPx and reduction of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx) by NADPH-dependent TrxR (21Papp L.V. Lu J. Holmgren A. Khanna K.K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 775-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The Trx system is critical for cellular stress response, protein repair, and protection against oxidative damage. Human Trx has a conserved dithiol active site, Cys32-Gly-Pro-Cys35 (22Holmgren A. Thioredoxin Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and, like other mammalian Trx1 proteins, contains three structural cysteine residues (Cys62, Cys69, and Cys73); these additional residues make Trx1 susceptible to oxidation via generation of a second disulfide (Cys62–Cys69) which leads to loss of catalytic activity (22Holmgren A. Thioredoxin Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. Antioxid.

Mammalian TrxR has a broad range of functions, which include reducing hydroperoxides and regenerating compounds, such as dehydroascorbate, lipoate, and ubiquinone. Additionally, selenium-compromised forms of TrxR induce apoptosis (25Anestål K. Arnér E.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15966-15972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Both TrxR and Trx are widely distributed in different mammalian organs and tissues (26Rozell B. Hansson H.A. Lthman M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 38: 79-86Google Scholar). Among cell types, epithelial, secretory, blood, and neuronal cells showed high immunoreactivity by immunohistochemical location (26Rozell B. Hansson H.A. Lthman M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 38: 79-86Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that Trx and TrxR are synthesized in nerve cell bodies and then transported to synaptic terminals, where they are likely to be involved in synaptic transmission (27Stemme S. Hansson H.-A. Holmgren A. Rozell B. Brain Res. 1985; 359: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Biomarkers have been used to assess exposure and disease risks of human populations. Until now, hair and blood mercury concentrations are considered the only valid biomarkers of human exposure to MeHg (1Clarkson T.W. Magos L. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2006; 36: 609-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 7Clarkson T.W. Strain J.J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1539S-1543SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Grandjean P. Budtz-Jørgensen E. Jørgensen P.J. Weihe P. Environ. Health Perspect. 2005; 113: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although quantification of exposure to MeHg gives limited information about the toxic effects exerted on the organism. In fact, depending on the diet, state of chemoprotection, and other specific characteristics of susceptibility of an individual, food-associated chemicals, such as MeHg, can have a certain degree of negative impact (29Chapman L. Chan H.M. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 29-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30Woods J.S. Echeverria D. Heyer N.J. Simmonds P.L. Wilkerson J. Farin F.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 206: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of early alterations in living organisms that anticipate processes of serious disruption by xenobiotics or diseases is crucial for the protection of human populations. Cellular responses to a specific hazardous food chemical may reveal whether the body contains the chemical and how the toxic effects are developing. On the basis that mercury has a chemical propensity to interact with thiols and selenols, we hypothesized that thiol redox systems and the associated selenoenzymes might be involved in the development of mercury toxicity. In this study, we have investigated the effects of inorganic mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and organic methylated monomethylmercury (CH3HgCl, herein referred to as MeHg) on components of the Trx system, TrxR and Trx, and their related components in the glutaredoxin system, glutathione reductase (GR) and glutaredoxin (Grx). The main goal is the investigation of the molecular mechanisms accounting for mercury toxicity as well as the identification of a potential biomarker indicative of mercury effects. Materials and Enzymes—The preparation of recombinant rat TrxR was carried out as previously described (31Arner E.S. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Bock A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The protein had 47% specific activity of wild-type TrxR as determined by the 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) assay; results are reported with respect to active enzyme. Preparations of wild-type and double mutant C62S/C73S human Trx were as previously published (32Ren X. Bjornstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). His-tagged human Grx1 protein was purified as described before (33Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Yeast GR, GSSG, insulin, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), hydroxyl-ethyl disulfide, NADPH, dl-dithiothreitol (DTT), GSH, 5,5′-ditiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), mercuric chloride (HgCl2), and monomethylmercury chloride (MeHg) were purchased from Sigma. HgCl2 and MeHg were prepared as 100 mm stocks in MilliQ water and DMSO, respectively. Tris base was supplied by Calbiochem and was of molecular biological grade with 99.2% purity to titration and <0.0005% heavy metals. Solutions and Reagent Preparation—For in vitro assays performed with recombinant proteins, buffers and enzyme solutions were processed to ensure the exclusion of metal ion chelator EDTA and to minimize the presence of traces of other metal ions that could have interfering effects on TrxR activity. Stocks of purified TrxR and Trx were stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (TE buffer). To remove EDTA, stock protein solutions were loaded onto Sephadex G-25-containing PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (Tris buffer). The protein concentration of eluted protein solution was then determined. The stock of purified Grx was stored in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and was therefore used directly in incubation assays with mercurial compounds. To minimize traces of metal ions, buffers used were prepared with fresh MilliQ water (Ω= 18.2), followed by 1-h orbital agitation with Chelex® 100 chelating ion exchange resin (5% (w/v); Bio-Rad). The buffer was then recovered by filtration (0.2-μm filter). For assays involving enzyme activity determination in cell lysates, buffers and enzyme solutions were not subjected to the procedures mentioned above, since the metal ions and salts present would be negligible relative to that contained in the collected lysates. TrxR Activity Determination by DTNB Reduction Assay—In 96-well plates, 50 nm recombinant rat TrxR (EDTA-free) was preincubated with HgCl2 or MeHg of different concentrations and 200 μm NADPH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (final volume 100 μl) for various times at room temperature. Then TrxR activity was determined as previously described (34Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) upon adding 100 μl of Tris buffer containing DTNB and NADPH (final concentration 5 mm and 200 μm, respectively). Briefly, the absorbance at 412 nm was followed using a VERSA microplate reader (Molecular Devices), and TrxR activity was obtained as the linear change in absorbance over the initial 2 min. Trx System Activity Determination by Insulin Reduction Assay—Activity of the Trx system was determined by modification of a method previously described (34Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In disposable semimicro-UV cuvettes (Plastibrand), 12 nm recombinant rat TrxR (EDTA-free) and 3 μm hTrx were preincubated with HgCl2 or MeHg of different concentrations and 200 μm NADPH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (final volume 500 μl) for 10 min at room temperature. Then 100 μl of Tris buffer containing insulin and NADPH (final concentration 160 and 200 μm, respectively) was added, and absorbance at 340 nm was followed in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer. Activity was calculated as the linear change in absorbance over the initial 5 min. Determination of Free Thiols Content in Trx and Grx with DTNB—The number of free thiols in reduced Trx and Grx after treatment with HgCl2 or MeHg was determined by the method of Ellman with modifications (35Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Briefly, fully reduced recombinant human Trx and Grx were prepared by incubating the proteins with 10 mm DTT at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by passing the protein solution through a NAP-5 desalting column to remove excess DTT. The concentration of eluted protein was calculated from absorbance measurements at 280 and 310 nm. HgCl2 was incubated at different molar ratios with 10 μm fully reduced Trx or Grx at room temperature. After incubation, 1 mm DTNB and 6 m guanidine HCl in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, was added (final volume 500 μl). The absorbance was read at 412 nm against a reference cuvette that contained the same amount of DTNB without protein, and the number of free thiols was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 m–1 cm–1. Gel Electrophoresis—Untreated and mercurial compound-treated Trx and Grx proteins (10 μg) were loaded onto 12% bis-Tris NuPAGE® gel (Invitrogen) and separated using MES running buffer. The gel was then Coomassie-stained. Mass Spectra Analysis—Human Trx was DTT-treated to obtain the fully reduced form. Following desalting to remove excess DTT, the protein was treated with HgCl2 or MeHg, and excess mercurial compound was removed by another desalting process. These samples were divided into two aliquots, and 500 μl were further DTT-treated as an attempt to obtain the fully reduced form of the protein again; excess DTT was also removed after treatment. Prior to mass spectra analysis, all samples were passed through NAP-5 columns pre-equilibrated with MilliQ water. The buffer-free solutions were diluted to a final protein concentration of ∼10 μm. Data were acquired on a QTOF Ultima API spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped with a standard Z-spray API source in positive mode (at the Protein Analysis Center of Karolinska Institute). Samples were introduced from the metal-coated borosilicate glass capillary needle (Proxeon Biosystems A/S, Odense, Denmark), and the capillary voltage was 1.5 kV. The instrument was calibrated between 300 and 1400 m/z with myoglobin before the run. The data were sampled over a mass range between 300 and 3000 m/z with a scan of 1 s for about 5 min. The spectra were combined and deconvoluted to zero charged ions (average mass) using Maxlynx 4.0 software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Cell Culture—Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and human HEK 293 embryonic kidney cells in RPMI medium. Both media were supplemented with glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cell Viability Assay—Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 106 cells/well and allowed to attach for 24 h before the addition of different concentrations of HgCl2 and MeHg. Cell viability at the time of drug addition (time 0) and following 24, 48, and 72 h of drug treatment were determined by the MTT assay. MTT was added to each well (final concentration 400 μg/ml), and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h to allow viable cells to metabolize MTT. Medium in each well was then aspirated, and formazan formed by viable cell dehydrogenase-mediated reduction of MTT was dissolved by the addition of DMSO/glycine buffer (pH 10.5) (ratio 4:1). Cell viability, which was proportional to the amount of formazan formed, was determined by measuring the absorbance at 550 nm. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells (1 × 106) were plated onto 100-mm plates, and when cell confluence reached ∼70%, cells were incubated with a fresh volume of medium containing HgCl2 and MeHg of different concentrations for 7, 15, and 24 h. Whole cell lysates of control and mercurial compound-treated cells were obtained by lysing cell pellets (composed of attached and floating cells) in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% Triton X-100 containing freshly added protease inhibitor mixture) (Roche Applied Science). Before use, lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 6 min, followed by protein content determination using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's manual. Enzyme Activity Determination in Cell Lysates—TrxR and Trx activity in cell lysates were measured in 96-well plates using an end point insulin assay (36Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Curr. Protocol. Toxicol. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 7.4.1-7.4.14Google Scholar). For TrxR activity measurement, 25 μg (HeLa) or 40 μg (HEK 293) of protein cell lysate was incubated in a final volume of 50 μl containing 0.3 mm insulin, 660 μm NADPH, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 5 μm human C62S/C73S Trx in 85 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, for 20 min at room temperature. Control wells containing incubate of cell lysates with similar reagents excluding human Trx were set up too. Then 250 μl of 1 mm DTNB and 240 μm NADPH in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, was added, and absorbance readings were taken at 412 nm. TrxR activity was represented as the A412 nm nm by subtracting that in the control well. For determination of Trx activity, procedures were the same as for the TrxR activity assay; cell lysates were incubated in reaction solutions with 600 nm recombinant rat TrxR except for control wells. Measurements of GR activity in cell lysates were carried out in 96-well plates using published methods (37Mannervik B. Curr. Protocol Toxicol. 1999; : 7.2.1-7.2.4Crossref Google Scholar, 38Cenas N. Prast S. Nivinskas H. Sarlauskas J. Arnér E.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5593-5603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, to 25 μg of protein cell lysate per well (volume made up to 80 μl with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7), 120 μl of GSSG and NADPH in phosphate buffer (final concentration 1 mm and 200 μm, respectively) was added, and absorbance at 340 nm was followed. GR activity was obtained as the linear change in absorbance over the initial 10 min. Grx activity in cell lysates was measured using the same assay as described for detecting activity in purified Grx protein (see below); Grx1 protein sample was replaced by 100 μg of protein cell lysate. Determination of GR Activity—In cuvettes, HgCl2 or MeHg of different concentrations was added to 2 nm yeast GR and 200 μm NADPH and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Upon mixing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing GSSG (final concentration 1 mm) to a final volume of 500 μl, GR activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm during the initial 3 min using an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer. Determination of Grx Activity—HgCl2 or MeHg of different concentrations was incubated with 100 μm fully reduced recombinant human Grx1 (DTT-treated and desalted) for 15 min at room temperature, and excess mercurial compounds were removed by passing the protein samples through NAP-5 columns. The enzymatic activity of Grx1 was determined as previously described (39Luthman M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Padilla C.A. Martinez-Galisteo E. Bárcena J.A. Spyrou G. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a 96-well plate, substrate hydroxyl-ethyl disulfide (0.7 mm) was mixed with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm GSH, 200 μm NADPH, and 6 μg/ml yeast GR in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA. After 3 min of incubation at 30 °C, different concentrations (ranging from 0 to 50 nm) of untreated or mercury-treated Grx1 (desalted) were added to start the reactions. The rates of decrease at 340 nm were recorded against a reference sample containing similar reagents excluding Grx; results were plotted against Grx1 concentrations to provide a linear curve. The effect of mercurial compounds on Grx activity was determined by comparing the slopes of curves obtained from mercury-treated and untreated protein samples. Effects of Mercurial Compounds on Mammalian TrxR Activity—The effect of inorganic HgCl2 and organic MeHg on purified mammalian TrxR was investigated. Different concentrations of HgCl2 and MeHg were incubated with NADPH-reduced and EDTA-free rat TrxR protein (50 nm) for between 5 and 60 min at room temperature, and TrxR activity was determined using the DTNB reduction assay. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, both mercurial compounds inhibited enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner as early as within 5 min of mercury exposure. Inorganic HgCl2 exhibited greater inhibitory effect, with an IC50 value of 7.2 nm, as compared with organic MeHg, showing an IC50 of 19.7 nm. Inhibitory experiments were also performed in the presence of the metal ion chelator EDTA at 1 mm; results showed similar dose dependence as seen in assays carried out in the absence of EDTA; higher IC50 values of 14.2 and 25.6 nm for HgCl2 and MeHg, respectively, were obtained (data not shown). Inhibitory effect of these mercurial compounds on mammalian TrxR was observed to be rapid and not time-dependent (Fig. 1B). Effects of Mercurial Compounds on Trx Activity and Structure—To study the effect of mercurial compounds on the whole Trx system, HgCl2 and MeHg were preincubated at different concentrations with components of the Trx system for 10 min at room temperature, followed by measurement of Trx system activity using the insulin reduction assay. Results showed that HgCl2 brought about a similar extent of inhibition of TrxR/Trx-mediated disulfide reduction with comparable IC50 values (Fig. 2) as that achieved for TrxR inhibition (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, across the concentrations tested, MeHg failed to exhibit a significant extent of Trx inhibition (Fig. 2), which was in contrast to an MeHg-mediated drastic drop in TrxR activity as determined by the DTNB reduction assay (Fig. 1A). This could be due to MeHg redistribution, since it may also interact with the Trx, present in large excess, or with insulin. The next objective was to investigate effects on the Trx protein (independent of TrxR), and for that we employed free thiol determinations. In the assay, the mercurial compounds were incubated with 10 μm human Trx fully reduced by DTT. Both HgCl2 and MeHg caused an apparent oxidizing effect on the redox state of hTrx that was independent of time and fast, since effects could be detected in 30 s (results not shown). The increase of the molar ratio of mercurial compounds to hTrx protein (I/Trx) had a progressive effect, and a ratio of ≥2.5 for HgCl2 and ≥5 for MeHg resulted in complete loss of the five"
https://openalex.org/W2013146348,"Formation of catalytically active RNA structures within the spliceosome requires the assistance of proteins. However, little is known about the number and nature of proteins needed to establish and maintain the spliceosome's active site. Here we affinity-purified human spliceosomal C complexes and show that they catalyse exon ligation in the absence of added factors. Comparisons of the composition of the precatalytic versus the catalytic spliceosome revealed a marked exchange of proteins during the transition from the B to the C complex, with apparent stabilization of Prp19-CDC5 complex proteins and destabilization of SF3a/b proteins. Disruption of purified C complexes led to the isolation of a salt-stable ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core that contained both splicing intermediates and U2, U5 and U6 small nuclear RNA plus predominantly U5 and human Prp19-CDC5 proteins and Prp19-related factors. Our data provide insights into the spliceosome's catalytic RNP domain and indicate a central role for the aforementioned proteins in sustaining its catalytically active structure."
https://openalex.org/W2090892825,"The semiconducting properties of a wide range of minerals are often ignored in the study of their interfacial geochemical behavior. We show that surface-specific charge density accumulation reactions combined with bulk charge carrier diffusivity create conditions under which interfacial electron transfer reactions at one surface couple with those at another via current flow through the crystal bulk. Specifically, we observed that a chemically induced surface potential gradient across hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3 ) crystals is sufficiently high and the bulk electrical resistivity sufficiently low that dissolution of edge surfaces is linked to simultaneous growth of the crystallographically distinct (001) basal plane. The apparent importance of bulk crystal conduction is likely to be generalizable to a host of naturally abundant semiconducting minerals playing varied key roles in soils, sediments, and the atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2014322534,"Some neotropical, fleshy-fruited plants have fruits structurally similar to paleotropical fruits dispersed by megafauna (mammals > 10(3) kg), yet these dispersers were extinct in South America 10-15 Kyr BP. Anachronic dispersal systems are best explained by interactions with extinct animals and show impaired dispersal resulting in altered seed dispersal dynamics.We introduce an operational definition of megafaunal fruits and perform a comparative analysis of 103 Neotropical fruit species fitting this dispersal mode. We define two megafaunal fruit types based on previous analyses of elephant fruits: fruits 4-10 cm in diameter with up to five large seeds, and fruits > 10 cm diameter with numerous small seeds. Megafaunal fruits are well represented in unrelated families such as Sapotaceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Apocynaceae, Malvaceae, Caryocaraceae, and Arecaceae and combine an overbuilt design (large fruit mass and size) with either a single or few (< 3 seeds) extremely large seeds or many small seeds (usually > 100 seeds). Within-family and within-genus contrasts between megafaunal and non-megafaunal groups of species indicate a marked difference in fruit diameter and fruit mass but less so for individual seed mass, with a significant trend for megafaunal fruits to have larger seeds and seediness.Megafaunal fruits allow plants to circumvent the trade-off between seed size and dispersal by relying on frugivores able to disperse enormous seed loads over long-distances. Present-day seed dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents, introduced livestock, runoff, flooding, gravity, and human-mediated dispersal allowed survival of megafauna-dependent fruit species after extinction of the major seed dispersers. Megafauna extinction had several potential consequences, such as a scale shift reducing the seed dispersal distances, increasingly clumped spatial patterns, reduced geographic ranges and limited genetic variation and increased among-population structuring. These effects could be extended to other plant species dispersed by large vertebrates in present-day, defaunated communities."

https://openalex.org/W2016612191,"We have recently demonstrated that the cells expressing CD36, localized apically on the taste buds of mouse lingual circumvallate papillae, act as gustatory cells. In the present study we isolated these CD36-positive cells from mouse circumvallate papillae and investigated intracellular signaling events, triggered by a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, i.e. linoleic acid (LA). LA induced increases in free intracellular calcium concentrations, [Ca2+]i, by recruiting calcium from endoplasmic reticulum pool via inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production followed by calcium influx via opening of store-operated calcium (SOC) channels. LA also induced phosphorylation of Src-protein-tyrosine kinases (Src-PTKs), particularly of Fyn59 and Yes62. LA-evoked phosphorylation of Fyn59 and Yes62 was implicated in the activation of SOC channels. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed that the CD36-positive gustatory cells possessed mRNA of enzymes like tryptophan hydroxylase-1, l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopamine β-hydroxylase, involved in the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters. Interestingly, the addition of LA to these cells induced the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenalin to the extracellular environment. The LA-induced release of these neurotransmitters was curtailed by SOC channel blockers and Src-PTK inhibitors. These results altogether demonstrate that LA binds to mouse CD36-positive gustatory cells, induces Src-PTKs phosphorylation, triggers calcium signaling, and evokes the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenalin, which in turn may be implicated in the downstream signaling to the afferent nerve fibers, thus transmitting the output signal from taste buds to the central nervous system.

The tongue contains primarily four types of papillae. Filiforms are involved in the somesthesic perception of foods, whereas fungiforms, foliates, and circumvallates, which contain taste buds, are responsible for the chemosensory perception of basic taste modalities (sweet, bitter, salt, sour, umami). Recent evidences have strongly suggested the existence of an additive oro-sensory system devoted to the dietary fat perception in rodents. Gilbertson et al. (1Gilbertson T.A. Fontenot D.T. Liu L. Zhang H. Monroe W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1203-C1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that lipids may be sensed by isolated rat fungiform taste receptor cells (TRC) 2The abbreviations used are: TRC, taste receptor cells; CVP, circumvallate papillae; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin); PLC, phospholipase C; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; SSO, sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; LA, linoleic acid; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; Ct, cycle threshold; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NA, noradrenalin; SOC, store-operated calcium. via the inhibition of the delayed rectifying K+ channels by polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fukuwatari et al. (2Fukuwatari T. Kawada T. Tsuruta M. Hiraoka T. Iwanaga T. Sugimoto E. Fushiki T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and Laugerette et al. (3Laugerette F. Passilly-Degrace P. Patris B. Niot I. Febbraio M. Montmayeur J.P. Besnard P. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) documented the expression of the receptor-like lipid-binding protein CD36 in rat and mouse taste bud cells, respectively. Kawai and Fushiki (4Kawai T. Fushiki T. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2003; 285: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the addition of a lipase inhibitor diminished the spontaneous preference for triglycerides. These investigators proposed that the lingual lipase, present in the rodent saliva, might release free fatty acids that would be detected by gustatory cells. The immunolocalization of CD36 in the apical side of few TRC in circumvallate papillae (3Laugerette F. Passilly-Degrace P. Patris B. Niot I. Febbraio M. Montmayeur J.P. Besnard P. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) is especially adequate for this function since CD36 is known to exhibit a very high affinity for long-chain fatty acids (5Baillie A.G. Coburn C.T. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Consistent with this assumption, we have recently provided the first evidence that CD36-positive gustatory cells play a significant role in dietary lipid perception in the mouse (3Laugerette F. Passilly-Degrace P. Patris B. Niot I. Febbraio M. Montmayeur J.P. Besnard P. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Indeed, the CD36 gene inactivation fully abolished the spontaneous preference for long-chain fatty acids observed in wild-type mice (3Laugerette F. Passilly-Degrace P. Patris B. Niot I. Febbraio M. Montmayeur J.P. Besnard P. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this effect on feeding behavior is lipid-specific since sweet preference and bitter aversion are not affected in these transgenic mice (3Laugerette F. Passilly-Degrace P. Patris B. Niot I. Febbraio M. Montmayeur J.P. Besnard P. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). To further explore whether a sixth taste modality devoted to the “fat” functionally exists in rodents, the downstream signaling events triggered by the free fatty acid/CD36 interaction in gustatory cells must be studied. We have for the first time purified the CD36-positive gustatory cells from mouse CVP and demonstrated that linoleic acid induced increases in [Ca2+]i in these cells via CD36 (6Gaillard, D., Laugerette, F., Darcel, N., El-Yassimi, A., Degrace-Passily, P., Hichami, A., Khan, N. A., Montmayeur, J. P., and Besnard, P. (2007) FASEB J., in pressGoogle Scholar). In the present study we have extended these investigations to characterize the mechanisms of action of linoleic acid on calcium signaling/protein phosphorylation, leading to the release of neurotransmitters, which might be implicated in the activation of afferent nerve fibers. Materials—C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Janvier Elevage (Le Genest-st-isle, France). Sulfo-N-succinimidyloleate (SSO) was a generous gift from JF Glatz (Maastricht, The Netherlands). The culture medium RPMI 1640 and l-glutamine were purchased from Lonza Verviers SPRL (Verviers, Belgium). Fura-2/AM was procured from Invitrogen. All other chemicals including linoleic acid (18:2 n-6), collagenase type-I, and trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Sigma. SKF96365, econazole, and SU6656 were purchased from Calbiochem. Elastase and dispase were purchased from Serlabo (Bonneuil/Marne, France) and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. Anti-CD36 antibody coupled to phycoerythrin and anti-α-gustducin antibody were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-p-Fyn59, anti-p-Lyn53/56, and anti-p-Yes62 antibodies were bought from Tebu-Bio (Paris, France), and anti-phosphotyrosine kinase (p-PTK) antibody was obtained from Chemicon (Dundee, UK). Anti-CD36 antibody was procured from Cell Sciences®. All the experiments on animals were conducted as per declaration of Helsinki and European ethical guidelines, and the protocols were approved by the Regional Ethical Committee. Isolation of CD36-positive Cells from Mouse Circumvallate Papillae (CVP)—Mouse lingual CVP were isolated according to previously published procedure (3Laugerette F. Passilly-Degrace P. Patris B. Niot I. Febbraio M. Montmayeur J.P. Besnard P. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Lingual epithelium was separated from connective tissues by enzymatic dissociation (elastase and dispase mixture, 2 mg/ml each, in Tyrode buffer: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4), and papillae were dissected under a microscope. The CD36-positive cells from mouse CVP were purified as described elsewhere (6Gaillard, D., Laugerette, F., Darcel, N., El-Yassimi, A., Degrace-Passily, P., Hichami, A., Khan, N. A., Montmayeur, J. P., and Besnard, P. (2007) FASEB J., in pressGoogle Scholar). In brief, cells were isolated by incubation in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm EDTA, 1.2 mg/ml elastase, 0.6 mg/ml collagenase (type I), and 0.6 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor at 37 °C for 20 min followed by a centrifugation (600 g × 10 min). The mixture of different cell populations was incubated with anti-CD36 antibody coupled to phycoerythrin for 2 h followed by a wash with PBS (600 g × 10 min) and resuspended in a solution containing microbeads coupled to anti-phycoerythrin IgG. The CD36-positive cells were isolated by passing through the MACS columns of the Miltenyi magnet system. The CD36-negative cells passed through the column, whereas CD36-positive cells were retained therein. Both the cells populations, after separation, were suspended in a fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, seeded onto a Biocoat poly-d-lysine-coated dishes, and cultured for 24 h. At the end of this period cells were used for the experiments or stained with trypan blue to assess their viability. To check the purity of CD36-positive cells, we performed an immunocytochemical detection of CD36 and α-gustducin after selection. Hence, cytospin-prepared slides were fixed in 95% ethanol and rehydrated in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4. Slides were blocked in PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature before overnight incubation at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of anti-rat CD36 antibody (UA009) or a 1:150 dilution of polyclonal anti-mouse α-gustducin antibody. It is noteworthy that the clone UA009 also recognizes mouse CD36 (3Laugerette F. Passilly-Degrace P. Patris B. Niot I. Febbraio M. Montmayeur J.P. Besnard P. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). After washing, slides were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:600 dilutions) for CD36 expression or with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:600) for α-gustducin detection. Staining specificity was assessed by treating slides in the absence of primary antibodies. After three washings with PBS, a drop of Aqua Poly-Mount mounting medium was added on the slide for the analysis under fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axioskop). Measurement of Ca2+ Signaling—The CD36-negative and CD36-positive gustatory cells, cultured for 24 h, were washed with PBS, pH 7.4. The composition of PBS was as follows: 3.5 mm KH2PO4, 17.02 mm Na2HPO4, 136 mm NaCl. The cells were then incubated with Fura-2/AM (1 μm) for 60 min at 37 °C in loading buffer which contained 110 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes-Na, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. After loading, the cells (2 × 106/ml) were washed 3 times (600 g × 10 min) and remained suspended in the identical buffer. For experiments in Ca2+-free (0% Ca2+) medium, CaCl2 was replaced by EGTA (2 mm). [Ca2+]i was measured according to Grynkiewicz et al. (7Grynkiewicz G.M. Ponie M. Tsein R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensities were measured in the ratio mode in PTI spectrofluorometer at 340 and 380 nm (excitation filters) and 510 nm (emission filter). The cells were continuously stirred throughout the experimentation. The test molecules were added into the cuvettes in small volumes with no interruptions in recordings. The intracellular concentrations of free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, were calculated by using the equation [Ca2+]i = Kd × (R – Rmin)/(Fmax – F) × (Sf2/Sb2), where Kd is the dissociation constant for Fura-2/calcium complex, R is the ratio emission with excitation at 340 nm divided by excitation at 380 nm, Rmin is the ratio in the presence of no Ca2+, Fmax is the ratio of saturating [Ca2+]i, and Sf2/Sb2 is the ratio of 380 nm excitation fluorescence at zero and saturating [Ca2+]i. A value of 224 nm for Kd was added into the calculations. Rmax and Rmin values were obtained by the addition of ionomycin (5 μm) and MnCl2 (2 mm), respectively. The SOC channel blockers (SKF96365 and econazole), CD36 inhibitor (SSO), or protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors (PP2, genistein, and SU6656) were added to the cells for 20 min before the addition of linoleic acid. Measurement of Inositol 1,4,5-Triphosphate (IP3) Production— The CD36-negative and CD36-positive gustatory cells were treated with LA in the presence or absence of SSO for 20 min. The vehicle control received 0.1% ethanol (v/v) for 20 min. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell suspension was then lysed with 20% ice-cold perchloric acid (0.2:1; v/v). After centrifugation, the supernatant was assayed for IP3 production according to the manufacturer's instructions, furnished with [3H] Biotrak Assay System (GE Healthcare). Briefly, the assay is based on competition between [3H]IP3 (tracer) and unlabeled (cellular) IP3 for binding to bovine adrenal d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-binding protein. The bound IP3 is separated from the free IP3 by centrifugation, which brings the binding protein to the bottom of the tube. The free IP3 in the supernatant is then discarded by decantation, leaving the bound fractions. The radioactivity is measured with a β-scintillation counter. Immunoprecipitation and Immunodetection of PTKs—First, we detected the presence of CD36 and Src-related kinases (Src total, Fyn, Yes, and Lyn) in CD36-positive cells by employing the specific antibodies (Fig. 3A). Second, we detected LA-induced phosphorylation at tyrosine resides by employing anti-phosphorylated PTK antibodies. Hence, the cells were incubated with or without SSO (50 μm) for 20 min then stimulated or not with LA (20 μm) as described in the legends of Fig. 3, B and C. After stimulation, cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C with 800 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine, 1% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged (13,500 g × 15 min at 4 °C), and supernatants were subjected to Western blotting. To ensure equal loading of proteins, immunodetection of β-actin was performed in the same assays. To detect the phosphorylation of Src-related kinases, we first immunoprecipitated the treated-CD36-positive or CD36-negative gustatory cells with anti-phospho-PTK and then probed them with antibodies against Fyn, Yes, and Lyn (Fig. 3D). Briefly, 1 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-PTK antibody and 25 μl of A/G-Sepharose beads. Phosphotyrosine protein-containing immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A and diluted with Laemmli sample buffer. For Western blotting, denatured proteins (20 μg) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide (8%) gel and transferred onto the PVDF membrane. After saturation for 1 h in the TBS/Tween 20 (10 mm Tris base, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with delipidated milk 1% (v/v), the PVDF membrane was incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing 4 times in the TBS/Tween 20, the PVDF membrane was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:1000) in TBS/Tween 20 supplemented with 1% delipidated milk (v/v). The PVDF membrane was washed 3 times in 0.05% TBS/Tween 20 and once in TBS. The phosphorylated bands were revealed with the horseradish peroxidase substrate (Super Signal Substrate, Western blotting kit from Pierce). To ensure the specificity of the detection of phosphorylated Src-related kinases, immunodetection of unphosphorylated Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lyn was performed in each sample (Fig. 3D). Detection of mRNA of Enzymes Involved in the Synthesis of Neurotransmitters by RT-quantitative PCR and Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from CD36-negative and CD36-positive gustatory cells by using Trisol (Invitrogen) and subjected to DNase treatment using the RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen). One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Super script II RNase H-reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed on the iCycler iQ real time detection system, and amplification was undertaken by using SYBR Green I detection. Oligonucleotide primers were based on the sequences of mice gene in GenBank™ data base (see Table 1). The amplification was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl that contained 12.5 μl of SYBR® Green Supermix buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTPs, 0.63 units of iTaq DNA polymerase, and SYBR®Green 1.0 nm fluorescein) and 12.5 μl (0.3 μm) of each primer and diluted cDNA.TABLE 1Sequences of the primers used to study the expression of mRNA of different genesGenePrimer sequencesβ-ActinForward, 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′Reverse, 5′-CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT-3′TPH-1Sense, 5′-GAGTTGCTCCACGCTTTGC-3′Antisense, 5′-ACACTCAGTCTACATCCATCCC-3′AADCForward, 5′-TCCTGCTGTTCTTTTGACAATCTC-3′Reverse, 5′-GCGTAAGCAGCGTCAATGTG-3′THForward, 5′-AAGCTGATTGCAGAGATTGCC-3′Reverse, 5′-TTCCTCCTTTGTGTATTCCACGT-3′DBHForward, 5′-GAGAGCCCCTTCCCCTACC-3′Reverse, 5′-TGGAGCTGGAAGTGGATGATCT-3′VMAT-2Forward, 5′-GGTTGCCAAGCCTTATCGGA-3′Reverse, 5′-ACCTGCTCCACTGCCTTGCT-3′ Open table in a new tab The amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min as a “hot start” followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30s and 60 °C for 30s with a single fluorescence detection point at the end of the relevant annealing or extension segment. At the end of the PCR, the temperature was increased from 60 to 95 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, and the fluorescence was measured every 15 s to construct the melting curve. The standard curves were generated for each gene using serial dilutions of positive control template to establish PCR efficiencies. All determinations were performed at least in duplicate using two dilutions of each assay to achieve reproducibility. Results were evaluated by iCycler iQ software including standard curves, amplification efficiency (E), and cycle threshold (Ct). Relative quantification of mRNA in different groups was determined as ΔΔCt =ΔCt of gene of interest – ΔCt of β-actin. ΔCt = Ct of CD36-positive or CD36-negative cells – Ct of total cells. Relative quantity (RQ) was calculated as RQ = (1 + E)(–ΔΔCt). For semiquantitative determinations, amplification was performed in the same conditions as described above for 30 cycles followed by a final extension period of 72 °C for 10 min. Reaction products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel impregnated with ethidium bromide. The RNA pattern was visualized by UV transillumination. Determination of Monoamine Neurotransmitters by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—HPLC separation of monoamine neurotransmitters was performed as described elsewhere (8Moret F. Guilland J.C. Coudouel S. Rochette L. Vernier P. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 468: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cultured CD36-negative and CD36-positive gustatory cells were incubated with LA, as mentioned in the legends, and at the end of incubation supernatant was removed and supplemented with equal volume of solution A (0.2 m perchloric acid, 2.7 mm EDTA, 5.26 mm sodium metabisulfite), then 100 pg of an internal standard (3,4-dihydroxy-benzylamine hydrobromide) was added to each sample. Samples were centrifuged for 6 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g. The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC with a reverse phase column (60 RP Select B, 250 × 4 mm, 5 μm, Merck) with electrochemical detection (Waters, Milford, MA) before or after passing through alumina column, as described previously (9Riggin R.M. Kissinger P.T. Anal. Chem. 1977; 49: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The potential of the electrochemical detector was set at +0.85 V. The mobile phase consisted of 0.08 m sodium phosphate, 0.27 mm EDTA, 3.7 mm octan-1-sulfonic acid, pH 3.5. The biogenic amines were identified and quantified in comparison with commercial standards using the KromaSystem 2000 software (BIO-TEK Instruments, Milano, Italy). Measurement of Membrane Potential, Vm—The probe bisoxonol was used to measure membrane potential in isolated CD36-positive gustatory cells. This probe is chemically unrelated to the cyanines and is not toxic to the cells (10Rink T.J. Motecucco C. Hesketh T.R. Tsein R.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 595: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). For these experiments the cells were prepared as described for [Ca2+]i determinations. After washing, the cells (106/1.5 ml) were transferred to the fluorometer cuvettes, and 150 nm of bisoxonol was added. The stock solution of bisoxonol was prepared in DMSO. The cells were allowed to equilibrate with the dye, and after 10 min different test molecules were added. The fluorescent intensities were determined at 540 nm (excitation filter) and 580 nm (emission filter). Upward deflections represent depolarizations. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of data was carried out using Statistica (Version 4.1, Statsoft, Paris, France). The significance of the differences between mean values was determined by analysis of variance one way followed by a least significant difference test. For all the tests the significance level chosen was p < 0.05. Linoleic Acid Induces Increases in [Ca2+]i in CD36-positive Gustatory Cells—To explore whether LA triggers a calcium response via CD36 receptor, we purified the CD36-positive gustatory cells which expressed CD36 (Fig. 1A) and α-gustducin, a G-protein considered as a specific marker of TRC (Fig. 1B). We observed that LA induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i which was followed by a stationary phase both in calcium-free (0% Ca2+) and calcium-enriched (100% Ca2+) buffers (Fig. 1C). LA-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were more important in 100% Ca2+ buffer than those in 0% calcium buffer. We also measured the production of IP3, known to recruit calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool. Fig. 1E shows that LA induced 4-fold increases in IP3 production in comparison to unstimulated cells. To shed light on whether LA induces the production of IP3 via binding to CD36, we employed sulfo-N-succinimidyl derivative of oleate (SSO) which is known to inhibit the binding of fatty acids to CD36 (11Harmon C.M. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We observed that SSO curtailed LA-induced increases in IP3 in these cells. As far as the CD36-negative cells are concerned, we observed that these cells, in response to LA, exhibited a weak increase in [Ca2+]i in 100% Ca2+ buffer without influencing the same in 0% Ca2+ buffer (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, in CD36-negative cells, LA failed to induce IP3 production, and SSO exerted no effect on it (Fig. 1E). It is important to mention that SSO treatment exerted no cytotoxic effect on either of the cell populations as assessed by trypan bleu exclusion assay (not shown). LA Stimulates Capacitative Calcium Influx via a PTK-dependent Mechanism in CD36-positive Gustatory Cells—Because LA-induced increases in [Ca2+]i are more important in 100% calcium buffer than those in 0% Ca2+ buffer, it is possible that LA activates a capacitative calcium entry due to calcium recruitment from internal stores in CD36-positive gustatory cells. To support this hypothesis we conducted experiments in 100% calcium buffer in the presence of SKF96365 and econazole, the inhibitors of store-operated calcium (SOC) channels. Fig. 2A shows that the addition of either SKF96365 or econazole significantly diminished the LA-induced increases in [Ca2+]i in CD36-positive gustatory cells. These two SOC channel blockers exerted no effect on CD36-negative gustatory cells (Fig. 2A). Because PTKs have been shown to modulate the activation of SOC channels (12Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we investigated the involvement of PTKs in the LA-induced SOC influx. We used the inhibitors of PTKs: PP2 (known to inhibit the PTK activity of Src in a non-competitive manner against ATP), genistein (a soybean isoflavone, known to selectively inhibit PTK), and SU6656 (a selective inhibitor of Fyn, Yes, and Lyn). We observed that in CD36-positive gustatory cells, these inhibitors significantly abolished the increases in [Ca2+]i, induced by LA; however, these agents exerted no effects in CD36-negative cells (Fig. 2B). LA Induces the Phosphorylation of Src, Fyn, and Yes in CD36-positive Gustatory Cells—We observed that mouse lingual CD36-positive gustatory cells expressed abundantly CD36, Src, and Src-PTK-like Fyn and Yes. The CD36-negative cells also expressed these Src-PTK but to a lesser extent than CD36-positive cells. The two cell populations do not express the Lyn isoform of Src-PTK (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows that LA induced the phosphorylation of PTKs, which was well apparent at 5 min and started declining at 15 min of incubation. Moreover, the LA-induced phosphorylation of PTKs was completely abolished by SSO in these cells (Fig. 3C). In CD36-negative cells, LA failed to induce PTK phosphorylation, and SSO exerted no effect on the same (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we immunoprecipitated the cell lysates with total anti-phospho-PTKs and detected different isoforms of Src-PTKs. We noticed that LA induced the phosphorylation of both Fyn59 and Yes62, but not of Lyn56/53, at 5 and 15 min of incubation (Fig. 3D). mRNA Expression of the Enzymes Involved in the Synthesis of Monoamine Neurotransmitters in CD36-positive Gustatory Cells—By employing RT-PCR, we have assessed the expression of mRNA of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of 5-HT and catecholamines. We have measured tryptophan hydroxylase-1 mRNA as the tph1 gene that encodes for the synthesis of tryptophan hydroxylase in peripheral tissues (13Izikki M. Hanoun N. Marcos E. Savale L. Barlier-Mur A.M. Saurini F. Eddahibi S. Hamon M. Adnot S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2007; 293: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Tryptophan hydroxylase-1 converts l-tryptophan to l-5-hydroxytryptophan. We have also detected l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase that converts l-5 hydroxytryptophan to 5-HT. l-Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase has been detected both in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (14Nagatsu T. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 12: 315-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have also determined the mRNA of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, like tyrosine hydroxylase that converts tyrosine to l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and dopamine β-hydroxylase that converts dopamine to NA. We evaluated the expression of vesicular monoamine transporter-2, implicated in the vesicular storage and subsequent release of neurotransmitters. We observed that CD36-positive gustatory cells expressed a high level of tryptophan hydroxylase-1 and l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) mRNA (Fig. 4, A and B). However, tyrosine hydroxylase mRNAs are less abundantly expressed in purified CD36-positive gustatory cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Dopamine β-hydroxylase mRNAs were identically present in unpurified (total), CD36-positive, and CD36-negative cells (Fig. 4B). Vesicular monoamine transporter-2 mRNA is highly expressed in CD36-positive gustatory cells (Fig. 4, A and B). It is also noteworthy that the unpurified total cells also express in relatively small quantities the aforementioned mRNAs (Fig. 4B). Production and Releas"

https://openalex.org/W2010592389,"We report that developmental competition between sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a series of feedback loops. Target-derived nerve growth factor (NGF) promoted expression of its own receptor TrkA in mouse and rat neurons and prolonged TrkA-mediated signals. NGF also controlled expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-4, which, through the receptor p75, can kill neighboring neurons with low retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling whereas neurons with high NGF-TrkA signaling are protected. Perturbation of any of these feedback loops disrupts the dynamics of competition. We suggest that three target-initiated events are essential for rapid and robust competition between neurons: sensitization, paracrine apoptotic signaling, and protection from such effects."

https://openalex.org/W2004144873,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is synthesized in neural tissue of the central and peripheral nervous systems and has a number of important functions besides regulating appetite and energy homeostasis. Here we identify a novel site of NPY biosynthesis and a role for NPY in promoting proliferation of adipocyte precursor cells. We show that NPY mRNA is not only expressed in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) but that its levels are up-regulated 6-fold in our early-life programmed rat model of increased visceral adiposity. This is accompanied by a parallel rise in NPY protein, demonstrating that VAT is a novel peripheral site of NPY biosynthesis. Furthermore, NPY mRNA expression is also elevated >2-fold in VAT of obese Zucker rats. Importantly, NPY stimulates proliferation of primary rat preadipocytes as well as 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in vitro. This mitogenic effect appears to be mediated by the Y1 receptor and involves the activation of extracellular related kinase 1/2. In addition, insulin and glucocorticoid up-regulate VAT NPY expression in lean but not obese Zucker rats. Taken together, these results suggest that an enhanced local expression of NPY within VAT may be a common feature of and contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying increased visceral adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W2001532725,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as an energy sensor and is considered a promising drug target for treatment of type II diabetes and obesity. A previous report has shown that mammalian AMPK alpha1 catalytic subunit including autoinhibitory domain was inactive. To test the hypothesis that small molecules can activate AMPK through antagonizing the autoinhibition in alpha subunits, we screened a chemical library with inactive human alpha1(394) (alpha1, residues 1-394) and found a novel small-molecule activator, PT1, which dose-dependently activated AMPK alpha1(394), alpha1(335), alpha2(398), and even heterotrimer alpha1beta1gamma1. Based on PT1-docked AMPK alpha1 subunit structure model and different mutations, we found PT1 might interact with Glu-96 and Lys-156 residues near the autoinhibitory domain and directly relieve autoinhibition. Further studies using L6 myotubes showed that the phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream substrate, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, were dose-dependently and time-dependently increased by PT1 with-out an increase in cellular AMP:ATP ratio. Moreover, in HeLa cells deficient in LKB1, PT1 enhanced AMPK phosphorylation, which can be inhibited by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases inhibitor STO-609 and AMPK inhibitor compound C. PT1 also lowered hepatic lipid content in a dose-dependent manner through AMPK activation in HepG2 cells, and this effect was diminished by compound C. Taken together, these data indicate that this small-molecule activator may directly activate AMPK via antagonizing the autoinhibition in vitro and in cells. This compound highlights the effort to discover novel AMPK activators and can be a useful tool for elucidating the mechanism responsible for conformational change and autoinhibitory regulation of AMPK."
https://openalex.org/W2014716434,"Clusterin is, in its major form, a secreted heterodimeric disulfide-linked glycoprotein (75–80 kDa). It was first linked to cell death in the rat ventral prostate after androgen deprivation. Recent studies have demonstrated that overexpression of clusterin in prostatic cells protects them against tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced apoptosis. However the details of this survival mechanism remain undefined. Here, we investigate how clusterin prevents cells from undergoing TNFα-induced apoptosis. We established a double-stable prostatic cell line for inducible clusterin by using the Tet-On gene expression system. We demonstrated that 50% of the cells overexpressing clusterin escaped from TNFα- and actinomycin D-induced cell death. Moreover we demonstrated that the incubation of MLL cells with conditioned medium containing the secreted clusterin or the supplementation of purified clusterin in the extracellular medium decreased the TNFα-induced apoptosis significantly. This extracellular action implicates megalin, the putative membrane receptor for clusterin to mediate survival. Indeed clusterin overexpression up-regulated the expression of megalin and induced its phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. We interestingly showed that clusterin overexpression is associated with the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of Akt. Activated Akt induced the phosphorylation of Bad and caused a decrease of cytochrome c release.

Clusterin, also known as testosterone-repressed message-2, is overexpressed in the rat prostate during castration-induced programmed cell death (1Bettuzzi S. Hiipakka R.A. Gilna P. Liao S.T. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Clusterin overexpression reaches a maximum 3–4 days post-castration and coincides with the onset of massive cell death (2Lee C. Sensibar J.A. Dudek S.M. Hiipakka R.A. Liao S.T. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The clusterin level also rises in various tissues during cell death responses (3Bursch W. Gleeson T. Kleine L. Tenniswood M. Arch. Toxicol. 1995; 69: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Kyprianou N. English H.F. Davidson N.E. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 162-166PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kyprianou N. English H.F. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3748-3753PubMed Google Scholar). As clusterin is present during apoptosis, it was initially viewed as a cell death inducer, but other studies suggest that clusterin overproduction occurs in resistant cells (6French L.E. Sappino A.P. Tschopp J. Schifferli J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Ho S.M. Leav I. Ghatak S. Merk F. Jagannathan V.S. Mallery K. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, clusterin has been described as an anti-apoptotic factor, and it has also been implicated in prostate cancer progression to androgen independence (8July L.V. Akbari M. Zellweger T. Jones E.C. Goldenberg S.L. Gleave M.E. Prostate. 2002; 50: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Miyake et al. (9Miyake H. Nelson C. Rennie P.S. Gleave M.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the overexpression of clusterin in human androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells LNCaP by stable transfection rendered them highly resistant to androgen ablation, and the introduction of antisense testosterone-repressed message-2 oligodeoxynucleotide therapy in the Shionogi tumor model induces apoptosis and tumor regression. Moreover small interference RNA-mediated clusterin gene silencing in osteosarcoma and prostate cancer induces significant reduction of cellular growth and increases cellular apoptosis (10Miyake H.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Clusterin is a sulfated glycoprotein encoded by a single gene. It has two known isoforms obtained by alternative splicing (12Leskov K.S. Klokov D.Y. Li J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. J. Biol.

The translation product of the clusterin gene is a polypeptide of 449 amino acids, where the first 22 amino acids represent the classical hydrophobic secretory signal sequence. Maturation of the primary translation molecule includes disulfide bonding, conversion to a high mannose endoplasmic reticulum-associated form of 60 kDa, extensive additional N-linked glycosylation, and finally, proteolytic cleavage in the trans-Golgi compartments that results in the mature secreted heterodimeric clusterin protein form of 70–80 kDa. The other clusterin isoform is the nuclear form (nClu) of 55-kDa, which originates after apoptosis induction from a 49-kDa primary product that is translated from an alternatively spliced Clu transcript. The elucidation of the function of clusterin after stress induction is clearly complicated by the discovery of the two isoforms of the protein. Theses isoforms explain in part the conflicting results for clusterin function in different laboratories. Many studies have demonstrated that overexpression of the nClu acts as a prodeath signal, inhibiting cell growth and survival (12Leskov K.S. Klokov D.Y. Li J. Kinsella T.J. Boothman D.A. J. Biol.

Rep. 2005; 14: 1371-1375PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the expression of the secreted form exerts cytoprotective properties. Despite growing evidence that the secreted clusterin acts as an anti-apoptotic factor and plays an important role in resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs (17Miyake H. Nelson C. Rennie P.S. Gleave M.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2547-2554PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of clusterin-mediated survival signaling in cancer cells is not completely understood. Clusterin has long been viewed as a chaperone exerting its survival effect and cryoprotective function by at least two mechanisms: by increasing the solubility of denatured proteins and by mediating uptake and degradation of a broad spectrum of hydrophobic denatured aggregated molecules (18Bartl M.M. Luckenbach T. Bergner O. Ullrich O. Koch-Brandt C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Poon S. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Rybchyn M.S. Carver J.A. Wilson M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15953-15960Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although clusterin has long been proposed to participate in cell survival and it has been extensively studied to inhibit TNFα apoptosis, no studies have been carried out to investigate the link between clusterin and survival signaling pathways. Here we have established and characterized a model cell line showing inducible production of the secreted form of clusterin, to study how this protein can protect cells against tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced apoptosis. We have shown that when overexpressed or added in the culture medium, clusterin protects the MLLTet-sClu cell line from TNFα-induced apoptosis. On the one hand we have studied how the overexpression of the secreted clusterin affects two major survival pathways that might be stimulated during TNFα-induced apoptosis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway, one of the major survival pathways in the cell that is often constitutively activated in advanced stages of prostate cancer (20Nesterov A.

Yao Y.J. Kowalczyk D. Lyakh L.A. Karseladze A. Slaga T.J. Budunova I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 141-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have studied the clusterin putative receptor, megalin (also called gp330), a 600-kDa membrane protein participating in debris-dependent clusterin internalization (24Zlokovic B.V. Martel C.L. Matsubara E. McComb J.G. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Materials—The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen Life Technology (Grand Island, NY). Peptides used to generate antibodies were synthesized by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Antibody against a synthetic C-terminal megalin peptide (CEDTFKTANLVKEDSDV (25Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and an N-terminal cysteine residue for conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin) was prepared in rabbits at the Animal Facilities of the University of Liège. The antiphosphorylated megalin was generated in rabbits against a synthetic peptide (4569–4579 sequence of rat megalin plus the N-terminal cysteine residue for conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin). Cell Culture Conditions—The rat prostate cell line Dunning R3327 MAT LyLu was kindly provided by Dr. De Coster (Beerse, Belgium). Cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% Tet-System-approved fetal bovine serum (Tet-free FBS, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), 50 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Expression Vectors and Generation of Transfected Cell Lines—The Tet-On System (Clontech), a modification of the tetracycline-controlled transcription activation system developed by Gossen and Bujard (26Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar), was chosen to induce the conditional oversynthesis of clusterin by doxycycline (Dox). This system includes (i) the regulator plasmid pTet-On, expressing the gene coding for the reverse tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator protein (under the control of the strong cytomegalovirus promoter) and the neomycin-resistance gene allowing selection of stably transformed cells in the presence of G418 (Geneticin); (ii) the response plasmid pTRE, containing the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE), into which the gene of interest was cloned. Because plasmid pTRE does not have a selectable marker, cells have to be cotransfected with pTK-HYG to permit selection of stable transformants by growth in the presence of hygromycine; (iii) two plasmids, pTRE-EGFP (containing a gene coding for an enhanced green fluorescence protein) and pTRE-Luc (a luciferase expression vector), provided an essential control in screening process of clonal cell lines. Plasmid pTRE-sClu contains, at its EcoRI site, the complete open reading frame of clusterin, excised from the pSB28 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. S. Bettuzzi (1Bettuzzi S. Hiipakka R.A. Gilna P. Liao S.T. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)) by means of the EcoRI. For transfection the Lipofectamine PLUS™ reagent (Invitrogen) was used. 3 × 106 MAT LyLu cells were transfected with 3 μg of pTet-On. After a 24-h culture, cells were trypsinized and seeded into 10-cm dishes (2 × 105 cells/dish). 24 h later, cells were cultured in a medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen) for 4 weeks. G418-resistant cells were isolated with a Freshny cylinder, and the activity of the transactivator system was estimated by transient transfection with pTRE-EGFP or pTRE-Luc. Clones showing the most intense green fluorescence in the presence of 2 μm Dox (a tetracycline derivative (Sigma-Aldrich)) were transiently transfected with pTRE-Luc to allow selection of the clone with the lowest basal expression level. 3 × 106 cells of MLLTet were selected and cotransfected with 10 μg of pTRE-sClu or the empty vector pTRE (used as negative control) and 1 μg of pTK-HYG. Transformants were cultured with 800 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) for 15 days. Surviving clones were then tested for Dox-inducible clusterin synthesis by Western blot analysis as described below, using a monoclonal antibody against clusterin (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). Growth Rate Analysis—MAT Ly Lu (MLL) and MLLTet-sClu cells were seeded at 105 cells per 35-mm diameter dish in RPMI containing 10% Tet-free FBS replaced 24 h later with medium containing 0.1% or 10% Tet-free FBS with or without Dox. The culture medium was replaced every 24 h. At daily intervals cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), stained with Trypan Blue (Sigma), and counted with a hemocytometer in triplicate. MTT Cell Viability Assay—The MTT assay is based on the ability of viable mitochondria to convert MTT, a soluble tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), into a formazan precipitate, which is then dissolved in DMSO and quantified by spectrophotometry at 570 nm (27Scudiero D.A. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Monks A. Tierney S. Nofziger T.H. Currens M.J. Seniff D. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4827-4833PubMed Google Scholar). MLL or MLLTet-sClu cells were seeded into 96-well dishes (3000 cells per well) in RPMI containing 10% Tet-free FBS and incubated for 48 h in the presence of varying concentrations of exogenous clusterin purified from rat serum as described below. Apoptosis was induced by adding 50 ng/ml TNFα (Roche Applied Science) and 4 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for 24 h. The cells were then tested for MTT conversion, and cell viability was estimated as the amount of MTT dye converted relative to that of control cells. Cell Proliferation—Cell proliferation was quantified by measuring bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation during DNA synthesis using the Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU kit (Roche Applied Science). The experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Apoptosis—Cells were seeded into 6-well plates. Clusterin production was induced with 2 μm Dox (control cells and cells where induction was not desired were cultured without Dox). Following treatment with 50 ng/ml TNFα and 4 μg/ml actinomycin D for 24 h, the number of apoptotic, necrotic, and viable cells was determined using an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate detection kit (MEBCYTO-Apoptosis kit, MBL, Immunosources, Halle-Zoersel, Belgium). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room temperature. Stained cells were quantified using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Apoptosis is often analyzed using fluorescent annexin conjugates to detect phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. The PI is a fluorescent vital dye that stains DNA. It does not cross the plasma membranes that are viable or in the early stages of apoptosis, because they maintain plasma membrane integrity and are permeable to PI. Annexin V binds to cells early in apoptosis and continues to be bound through cell death. PI is used to distinguish cells that are in the earlier stages of apoptosis (Annexin-positive and PI-negative) from those that are in later stages of apoptosis or already dead (necrosis, Annexin-positive and PI-positive). Each experiment was performed three times. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from induced and uninduced cells was isolated by a single-step guanidium thiocyanate method with Tri-Pure reagent. A 2-μg aliquot of RNA was reverse-transcribed for 45 min at 40 °C in the presence of 1 μg of random hexamers (Promega, Madison, WI) in a total volume of 20 μl. PCR mixtures contained 2 μl of reverse transcriptase (200 units/μl, Promega) in a total volume of 25 μl. Serial cDNA dilutions (1:1 to 1:100) were amplified for 20 cycles with sense (5′-ATTGCCGATAGTGATGACCT-3′) and antisense (5′-CGTGAAAAGATGACCCAGAT-3′) β actin primers using an annealing temperature of 59 °C. Dilutions yielding equal amounts of product were amplified for 35 cycles with sense (5′-GGTGTGTGACGAGGAT-3′) and antisense (5′-AGTTGCAATTGCGCTCATCG-3′) megalin primers, and clusterin was amplified for 28 cycles with sense primers (5′-TGCATGAAGTTCTACGCACG-3′) and antisense (5′-TTGTTGGTCGAACAGTCCAC-3′). The products of the PCR were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. Rat Clusterin Purification—Rat clusterin was purified as follows. Rat serum (200 ml) was chromatographed on 1.5 liters of AFFI-Gel blue (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA), the non-adsorbed fraction was loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose column (50 ml, Amersham Biosciences); the non-adsorbed fraction from this column was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 75% saturation and further purified out by ConA-Sepharose chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography (pH 9.5, 0.01 m sodium glycinate) on a fast-flow DEAE-Sepharose column (15 ml). Fractions containing clusterin were pooled and finally purified out by gel filtration (Sephacryl S200 in phosphate-buffered saline). Chemical purity was assessed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured for 48 h in medium containing 10% Tet-free FBS, with or without Dox (final Dox concentration as indicated). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Total cell extracts were prepared by sonication for 20 s in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 10% SDS. The homogenates were centrifuged (15,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. The bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce) was used to determine the protein content of each lysate. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min, electrophoresed through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Clusterin was immunodetected by using either a monoclonal anti-clusterin antibody under nonreducing conditions, recognizing the complete 80-kDa protein (Upstate) or an anti-clusterin α-chain antibody recognizing the 40-kDa α subunit (Upstate) or the goat polyclonal anti-clusterin (SC-6419, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by incubation with an anti-mouse or the anti-goat Ig G coupled to horseradish peroxidase. 4-Chloro-1-naphtol was used as a substrate according to the supplier's instructions or alternatively the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) kit (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for the detection. For cytochrome c Western blot analysis, 50 μg of cytosolic protein extract, obtained as described by Yang et al. (28Yang C.C. Lin H.P. Chen C.S. Yang Y.T. Tseng P.H. Rangnekar V.M. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was resolved by 14% Tris-glycine PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with a monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), and immunoreactive bands were visualized as described above. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Then 1.5-ml ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm α-glycerophosphate) containing 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the phosphatase inhibitors Na3VO4 (1 mm) and NaF (50 mm) was added, and the cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were disrupted by repeated aspirations through a 21-gauge needle and transferred to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared by adding 1 μg of normal rabbit IgG and protein G/A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting supernatants were incubated with antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Then 25 μl of protein G/A-agarose were added to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer. Finally the pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 1× electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation and Activity Assay of IκB Kinase (IKK)—For the IKK assay, 106 MLLTet-sClu cells cultured in T-75 flasks with or without 2 μm Dox for 48 h were treated for 10 min either with 50 ng/ml TNFα (Roche Applied Science), 4 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma), or both (each flask was treated separately). Then cells were collected with 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The kinase from protein extracts (500 μg of protein/sample) was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-IKK α monoclonal antibody (Sanvertech, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the resulting complex was incubated with protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C (the beads were prewashed four times with lysis buffer). The in vitro kinase assay was performed by incubating the mixture at 30 °C for 30 min in a reaction buffer containing 1 μg of GST-IκBα-(1–55) (as substrate) and 100 μm ATP in ice-cold kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm α-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reaction was stopped by adding 2× SDS sample buffer, and the products were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on a cellulose nitrate membrane. The phosphorylated IκB was detected by, using a monoclonal anti-phosphoserine 32–36-IκB (Westburg, Allison Park, PA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The immunoreactive band was then revealed by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [32P]ATP were used to label a DNA fragment corresponding to the NF-κB consensus sequence. The nuclear extracts obtained as described by Caccamo et al. (29Caccamo A.E. Scaltriti M. Caporali A. D'Arca D. Scorcioni F. Candiano G. Mangiola M. Bettuzzi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1010: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (10 μg) were incubated for 10 min in gel-shift binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 0.25 μg/μl poly(dI:dC), 20% glycerol) and for 20 min at room temperature with the labeled fragment was added (radioactivity exceeding 50,000 cpm/ml). The samples were then resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 200 V. The gels were dried and developed by autoradiography. Establishment and Characterization of a MATLyLu Cell Line Displaying Doxycycline-inducible Clusterin Synthesis—We first developed three double-stable MLL cell line clones displaying inducible clusterin synthesis. To this end, we used the Tet-On System kit (Clontech), a modification of the system developed by Gossen and Bujard (26Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar), in which a gene coding for a tetracycline-regulated transcription activator and the gene to be studied are sequentially introduced into a cell line. Two consecutive stable transfections were carried out to create a “double-stable” cell line containing integrated copies of both the regulator plasmid pTet-On and the vector (pTRE-sClu). The first step led to establishing a Tet-On MLL cell line. The screening method consisted of transient transfection with pTRE-EGFP and identification of transfectants by fluorescence microscopy. We identified five clones showing inducible high level synthesis of the green fluorescent protein. These MLLTet clones were then transiently transfected with pTRE-Luc, and luciferase activity was measured. The “best” clone, i.e. the clone showing a high level of luciferase activity in the presence of Dox and the lowest basal level in the absence of this antibiotic, was stably transfected with pTRE-sClu or with the empty vector to establish a negative control. Sixty hygromycin-resistant clones were analyzed by Western blotting to detect clusterin. We identified three positive clones displaying different levels of clusterin production. Clusterin was detected in the culture medium of the Dox-induced MLLTet-sClu clones (Fig. 1). It appeared as a 40-kDa band under reduced conditions and an 80-kDa band under unreduced conditions. PAGE-resolved total protein extracts of MLLTet-sClu cells showed no immunoreactive band upon treatment with both upstate anti-clusterin antibodies, whether the cells were induced with 2 μm Dox or not. Even with the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody we have detected only a slight intracellular form when we have used the sensitive system of detection ECL after 10 min of exposition. These results show that the intracellular form is present but at a very low concentration compared to the secreted form, so we can deduce that our inducible cell line is a model where the major induced clusterin is secreted (Fig. 1). We can conclude that MLLTet-sClu cells represent a suitable model for studying the effects of the long form of this sulfated glycoprotein. The clone (Clone1) that expressed clusterin at a high level for which results are shown in Fig. 2 displayed Dox dose-dependent clusterin production. When cells were treated with 2 μm Dox, production increased with the incubation time; the negative control clone (cells transfected with the empty vector) incubated for the same length of time in the presence of Dox did not show any accumulation of clusterin in the media (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2A, inducible synthesis of the secreted form of rat"

https://openalex.org/W2088396961,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) emerges to play fundamental roles in cellular signaling pathways in the brain. One of its prominent ligands is the serine proteinase tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), which has been shown to act as a key activator of neuronal mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways via the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. However, here we set out to examine whether LRP1 and the NMDA receptor might eventually act in a combined fashion to mediate tPA downstream signaling. By blocking tPA from binding to LRP1 using the receptor-associated protein, we were able to completely inhibit NMDA receptor activation. Additionally, inhibition of NMDA receptor calcium influx with MK-801 resulted in dramatic reduction of tPA-mediated downstream signaling. This indicates a functional interaction between the two receptors, since both experimental approaches resulted in strongly reduced calcium influx and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Additionally, we were able to inhibit Erk1/2 activation by competing for the LRP1 C-terminal binding motif with a truncated PSD95 construct resembling its PDZ III domain. Furthermore, we identified the distal NPXY amino acid motif in the C terminus of LRP1 as the crucial element for LRP1-NMDA receptor interaction via the adaptor protein PSD95. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of a tPA-induced, LRP1-mediated gating mechanism for NMDA receptors.

LRP1 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family with its highest expression in liver and brain. Following its synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum as a 600-kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein, LRP1 is cleaved in the Golgi compartment by furin, producing two subunits, 515 and 85 kDa in size. These two subunits remain noncovalently associated during their transport to the cell surface (1Waldron E. Jaeger S. Pietrzik C.U. Neurodegener. Dis. 2006; 3: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Via a receptor-recycling pathway, LRP1 is responsible for the endocytosis of more than 30 different extracellular ligands (2Strickland D.K. Ranganathan S. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3Bu G. Cam J. Zerbinatti C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1086: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In neurons, where it is highly expressed and predominantly localized in neuronal cell bodies and dendritic processes (4May P. Rohlmann A. Bock H.H. Zurhove K. Marth J.D. Schomburg E.D. Noebels J.L.

In addition to its role in endocytosis of various ligands, LRP1 has been implicated to play a crucial role in cell signaling. The observation that the LRP1 C terminus undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation after tPA binding corroborates its function as a signal transmitter (6Hu K. Yang J. Tanaka S. Gonias S.L. Mars W.M. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2120-2127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Several adaptor proteins can bind to the LRP1 tail, some of which seem to play a role in neuronal calcium, platelet-derived growth factor, or MAPK signaling (7Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q. Strickland D.K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34948-34956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Beyond its known function of lipid uptake, LRP1 has also been attributed to be the mediator of an LTP-enhancing effect of exogenously added tPA in hippocampal slices from tPA-deficient mice (5Zhuo M. Holtzman D.M. Li Y. Osaka H. DeMaro J. Jacquin M. Bu G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 542-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence supporting the hypothesis of an involvement in synaptic plasticity results from neuron-specific LRP1 knock-out mice, which show motor and coordination defects, muscle tremor, premature aging, and death (4May P. Rohlmann A. Bock H.H. Zurhove K. Marth J.D. Schomburg E.D. Noebels J.L. Beffert U. Sweatt J.D. Weeber E.J. Herz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8872-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Given the central role of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in synaptic plasticity and the function of LRP1 as a tPA receptor, an interaction between both molecules seems likely. Interestingly, a possible interaction between LRP1 and the NMDA receptor has been deduced from immunohistochemical and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, pointing to an LRP1-NMDA receptor interaction at the synapse (4May P. Rohlmann A. Bock H.H. Zurhove K. Marth J.D. Schomburg E.D. Noebels J.L. Beffert U. Sweatt J.D. Weeber E.J. Herz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8872-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, it has been reported that tPA binds directly to the NMDA receptor, resulting in the cleavage of the NMDA receptor subunit 1, leading to enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated intracellular calcium accumulation and neuronal degeneration (10Nicole O. Docagne F. Ali C. Margaill I. Carmeliet P. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Other studies report a proteolysis-independent effect of tPA on NMDA receptor-mediated downstream signaling events through direct interaction of tPA with the NMDA receptor (11Medina M.G. Ledesma M.D. Dominguez J.E. Medina M. Zafra D. Alameda F. Dotti C.G. Navarro P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1706-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanism, how tPA facilitates NMDA receptor activation, remains controversial, the general involvement of tPA in modulating NMDA receptor function is not in doubt (12Pang P.T. Lu B. Ageing Res. Rev. 2004; 3: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Pang P.T. Teng H.K. Zaitsev E. Woo N.T. Sakata K. Zhen S. Teng K.K. Yung W.H. Hempstead B.L. Lu B. Science. 2004; 306: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that tPA indeed activates the NMDA receptor cascade as hypothesized before (14Samson A.L. Medcalf R.L. Neuron. 2006; 50: 673-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, we are able to demonstrate that tPA-induced NMDA receptor activation and downstream signaling is exclusively mediated via LRP1. This activation is based on a mechanism involving the distal NPXY motif of LRP1 and the adaptor protein PSD95, which bridges LRP1 to the NMDA receptor. This complex formation is followed by calcium influx into the cell and subsequent activation of the MAPK pathway. Materials—Human recombinant tPA derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells (Actilyse) was purchased from Boehringer Ingelheim, and pure synthetic recombinant human tPA (stPA) was purchased from Biopur (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The NMDA receptor blockers DL-AP5 (Sigma) and MK-801 (Sigma) were dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH solution and in double-distilled H2O, respectively. The MEK inhibitor U0126 (Calbiochem) was diluted from a stock solution of 10 mm in DMSO. We constructed a RAP-GST fusion protein as described before (15Kang D.E. Pietrzik C.U. Baum L. Chevallier N. Merriam D.E. Kounnas M.Z. Wagner S.L. Troncoso J.C. Kawas C.H. Katzman R. Koo E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21, and protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roth) for 4 h. After bacterial lysis in 3% Sarkosyl buffer, the RAP-GST protein was pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with a 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris solution, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline overnight. Antibodies—Primary antibodies used were monoclonal phospho-p44/42 MAPK (E10), polyclonal p44/42 MAP kinase (both from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), monoclonal ANTI-FLAG ® M2 antibody, and polyclonal actin 20-33 antibody (both from Sigma). The polyclonal LRP1 antibody (1704), which reacts with the cytoplasmic domain of LRP1, has been described previously (16Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Secondary goat antibodies against mouse and rabbit were both horseradish peroxidase-coupled and purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Tissue Culture—The immortalized cell line HT22, a subclone of the HT4 cell line, was derived from the mouse hippocampus and therefore has neuronal properties (17Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm minimal essential medium sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (both from Cambrex) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Hippocampal neurons were prepared from either Sprague-Dawley rat embryos at embryonic day 17 or 18 or C57Bl6 wild-type and C57Bl6/129 LRP1 knock-in mouse embryos at embryonic day 15 or 16 (18Roebroek A.J. Reekmans S. Lauwers A. Feyaerts N. Smeijers L. Hartmann D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, hippocampi were collected in Hanks' balanced saline solution (Invitrogen), cut in small pieces, and trypsinized (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) for 15 min. After mechanical dissociation in Neurobasal (Invitrogen) containing B-27 and 2-fold Glutamax (both from Invitrogen), cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 4 min and resuspended again in Neurobasal for counting. The cells were then plated onto poly-l-ornithine (100 μg/ml; Sigma)-coated 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. For calcium-imaging experiments, cells were plated onto poly-l-ornithine-coated glass coverslips in 4-cm dishes. The medium was changed the next day, and the cells were cultured for another 14 days at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Drug Treatment—HT22 cells were grown to 80% confluence and serum-starved for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before tPA treatment. tPA (Actilyse) was reconstituted in double-distilled H2O and added to the culture medium for 30 min or 1 h at 37 °C, respectively. Stimulation of MAPK with stPA was detectable at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, whereas 40 μg/ml Actilyse was required to induce the same degree of MAPK stimulation. Therefore, we concluded that 10 μg/ml stPA functionally equals 40 μg/ml Actilyse, which we from now on refer to as tPA. The inhibitors MK-801 (10 μm) and U0126 (50 μm) were preincubated for 15 min, DL-AP5 (100 μm) was preincubated for 5 min, and RAP (500 nm) was preincubated for 1 h, and they were still present during tPA treatment. After 14 days in vitro (DIV), primary hippocampal neurons were treated as HT22 cells, except there was no medium change 24 h prior to stimulation. Calcium Phosphate-mediated Transfection of PSD95 and PDZ Domains—HT22 cells were transfected with three different vector constructs corresponding to the PSD95 PDZ domain I, II, or III. Each single PDZ domain was cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 zeo (+) vector (Invitrogen), bearing a 3× FLAG sequence at its N terminus. The corresponding nucleotide sequences (rat) are as follows: PDZI (nucleotides 178–465), PDZII (nucleotides 463–747), and PDZIII (nucleotides 904–1206) (19Cao J. Viholainen J.I. Dart C. Warwick H.K. Leyland M.L. Courtney M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Additionally, a GW1-CMV-vector bearing the full-length PSD95 protein (a kind gift of Dr. Morgan Sheng) (20Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) was transfected. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at ∼30% confluence and transfected with 2 μg of DNA/well via a calcium phosphate-mediated transfection protocol (21Sambrook J., and Russell, D. W. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., pp. 16.14–16.20, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkGoogle Scholar). 4–6 h post-transfection, the medium was changed to serum-free conditions for 24 h before cells were stimulated with tPA. LRP1 Knockdown with shRNA Vector Transfection—The shRNA expression vector pALsh-LRP1 recognizes the 5′-region of the open reading frame of LRP1 (22Laatsch A. Ragozin S. Grewal T. Beisiegel U. Joerg H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The generated self-annealing oligodeoxynucleotide targets the following sequence of the human LRP1 coding region: 5′-TAA GAC TTG CAG CCC CAA GCA GTT-3′ (position 72–95 of the human LRP1 open reading frame). pALsh vector alone served as transfection control. The mouse neuronal cell line HT22 was grown in 6-well plates until ∼50% confluence and transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 2 μgof plasmid DNA to 4 μl of Lipofectamine. To obtain better transfection efficiency, the cells were retransfected after 48 h with the same amount of DNA for another 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 72 h in total, cells were stimulated with tPA, lysed, subjected to 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE, and tested for LRP1 knockdown and Erk1/2 activation with Western blotting as described below. siRNA Knockdown—Stealth™/siRNA duplex oligoribo-nucleotides against mouse PSD95, Shc1, and FE65 were purchased from Invitrogen, carrying the following sequences: 5′-GGA GUA UGA GGA GAU CAC AUU GGA A-3′ (PSD95), 5′-CCA GAU GCU CAA GUG CCA CGU GUU U-3′ (FE65), and 5′-GGC UGU GUG GAG GUC UUA CAG UCA A-3′ (Shc1). Transfections in primary hippocampal neurons or HT22 cells were carried out with 40 nm (PSD95), 20 nm (Shc1), and 100 nm (FE65) siRNA duplex with Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for 48 h. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Primary hippocampal cultures as well as HT22 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing proteinase inhibitors (complete; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and 10 mm sodium fluoride (AppliChem)). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce), and equal amounts of total protein (20 μg) were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Western blot was performed overnight at 30 V and 4 °C. Incubation with the primary antibodies occurred in general overnight, and detection of proteins was carried out with the ECL method (SuperSignal; Pierce). Calcium Imaging—The fluorescent calcium indicator calcium green was used to analyze changes of the [Ca2+]i in cultured neurons and HT22 cells. In detail, after 24 h in serum-free medium, cells cultured on glass coverslips were loaded (60 min at 37 °C) with the fluorescent dye by adding 10 μm calcium green in pluronic acid (both from Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) to the culture medium. After loading, excessive dye was removed, and the cells were kept in Hanks' balanced saline solution (PAA, Linz, Austria) supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose and transferred to a temperature-controlled recording chamber adapted to an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany), equipped with a Nipkov spinning disk confocal system (QLC10; Visitech, Sunderland, UK) and a krypton/argon laser (Laser Physics, Cheshire, UK). The fluorescence of calcium green was excited at 488 nm. After background subtraction, changes of the emitted fluorescence were analyzed using Metamorph imaging software (Molecular Devices Corp, Downington, PA). Changes of [Ca2+]i in individual cell somata are shown as relative changes of calcium green fluorescence compared with the starting fluorescence intensity (dF/F0). The addition of tPA (40 μg/ml) was conducted 120 s after the recording was started. Inhibitors (10 μm MK-801 or 500 nm RAP) were preincubated for at least 30 min and were present during the whole recording time. In another set of experiments, calcium green was used to determine [Ca2+]i of HT22 cells or primary hippocampal neurons cultured in 96-well plates, and fluorescence intensity was quantified using a fluorescence plate reader (Infinite F200; Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). Dye loading and pretreatment with inhibitors was performed as mentioned above. Fluorescence was excited at 485 nm, and the emitted light was detected at 535 nm. The maximum increase of calcium green fluorescence during a time window of 5 min after the start of the stimulation was normalized to the fluorescence intensity prior to stimulation ((F/F0)max). Glutamate Measurement—Release of l-glutamate from HT22 cells in response to tPA stimulation was examined using an Amplex Red kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). Cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 16,000 cells/well. 24 h after seeding, culture medium was changed to serum-free medium for another 24 h. Afterward, HT22 cells were incubated for 1 or 5 min with 40 μg/ml tPA in Hanks' balanced saline solution with Ca2+, Mg2+ and glucose. 50-μl samples were used in the assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader (Infinite F200; Tecan). Fluorescence was excited at 540 nm, and the emission was detected at 580 nm. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from either HT22 cells or primary hippocampal neurons (RNeasy minikit; Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCRs (One-Step reverse transcription-PCR kit; Qiagen) were carried out in 50 μl of reaction solution containing 500 ng of total RNA, 0.4 mm deoxynucleotides, 0.6 μm forward and reverse primer, 5 units of RNase inhibitor, and 2 μl of enzyme mixture. The reaction solution was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min and denatured at 94 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The final extension step was at 72 °C for 10 min. The primers were as follows: forward primer for NMDA receptor subunit 1 (mouse, gi: 6680094) was 5′-AGT GCT GTT ATG GCT TCT GC-3′ (exon 10, positions 1451–1470); reverse primer was 5′-TCG GCC AAA GGG ACT GAA GC-3′ (exon 13, positions 1857–1838). The amplified products (20 μl) were separated by 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Data Analysis—Results were expressed as mean values ± S.E. Statistically significant effects of the calcium-imaging experiments were assessed by two-way analyses of variance followed by post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance of the results. Specific Activation of Erk1/2 Kinases by tPA in Neuronal Cells—Previous studies from Medina et al. (11Medina M.G. Ledesma M.D. Dominguez J.E. Medina M. Zafra D. Alameda F. Dotti C.G. Navarro P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1706-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Nicole et al. (10Nicole O. Docagne F. Ali C. Margaill I. Carmeliet P. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that tPA stimulates the MAPK pathway and NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx into N2a cells and hippocampal neurons. Although both groups postulated a tPA-mediated activation of the NMDA receptor, they proposed different mechanisms of tPA-mediated downstream signaling. Therefore, we set out to determine the tPA-mediated effects using two related model systems: the mouse neuronal hippocampus-derived cell line HT22 (17Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and rat primary hippocampal neurons. As illustrated in Fig. 1, tPA (Actilyse) is able to induce the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 without altering the total amount of the protein, both in primary hippocampal cells (Fig. 1A) and HT22 cells (Fig. 1B). The amount of Actilyse used in our experiments corresponds to 10 μg/ml pure synthetic tPA (data not shown). Maximal Erk1/2 activation in the two cell systems was observed between 30 min and 1 h, respectively, after the start of stimulation. Shorter stimulations starting from 2 to 15 min did not induce a significant increase in phospho-Erk1/2 in our cell systems and were hence thought to be inappropriate for further studies (data not shown). To further examine the pathway leading to the activation of Erk1/2, we preincubated the cells for 15 min with U0126, an inhibitor of the upstream MAPK kinase (MEK1/2). Subsequent tPA treatment resulted in no Erk1/2 phosphorylation compared with the normal tPA-treated cells, indicating that MEK1/2 is directly responsible for this effect in HT22 cells (Fig. 1C). RAP, an Antagonist for Lipoprotein Receptor Ligand Binding Blocks tPA-mediated Erk1/2 Activation—It has been previously suggested that LRP1 mediates tPA-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation (6Hu K. Yang J. Tanaka S. Gonias S.L. Mars W.M. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2120-2127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To verify the involvement of LRP1 in tPA-mediated signaling, we incubated neuronal cells with RAP, thereby inhibiting all ligands from binding to lipoprotein receptors. Preincubation of 500 nm RAP-GST 1 h prior to tPA stimulation resulted in a pronounced decrease of Erk1/2 phosphorylation compared with total Erk1/2 protein in HT22 cells (Fig. 2A, upper bands). Similar effects were detected for primary neurons (Fig. 2B). To investigate a possible proteolytic influence of tPA on LRP1, we measured the protein level of LRP1 β-chain (85 kDa) and C-terminal fragments (∼18 kDa) using the anti-LRP1 polyclonal 1704 antibody (16Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A (lower bands), tPA treatment did not alter LRP1 protein expression or processing, since no differences in LRP1 β-chain or LRP1 C-terminal fragment protein levels could be detected in tPA-treated compared with untreated control cells. Specific Knockdown of LRP1 with a Short Hairpin RNA Plasmid Construct Results in Decreased Erk1/2 Phosphorylation—To address the question of whether the observed RAP effect on Erk1/2 phosphorylation is actually due to a blockage of LRP1 and not due to any other low density lipoprotein receptor family member, we employed a well documented vector-based shRNA knockdown strategy to specifically block LRP1 protein translation in HT22 cells (22Laatsch A. Ragozin S. Grewal T. Beisiegel U. Joerg H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As presented in Fig. 3A, Western blot analysis of the short hairpin LRP1 plasmid (shLRP1)-transfected cells confirms the down-regulation of LRP1 β-chain in contrast to the pALsh vector control after 72 h of transfection. The quantitative data on the protein knockdown (Fig. 3B) demonstrate a reduction of LRP1 β-chain by ∼70%. Subsequent tPA stimulation resulted in an almost abolished Erk1/2 phosphorylation signal in the shRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data indicate that LRP1 is specifically responsible for the tPA-induced Erk1/2 activation and therefore mediates the signal from the cell surface into the cell. NMDA Receptor Open Channel Blocker MK-801 Prevents tPA-induced Erk1/2 Phosphorylation—It has been proposed that tPA might transduce its signal into the cell via direct binding to the NMDA receptor on the cell surface (10Nicole O. Docagne F. Ali C. Margaill I. Carmeliet P. MacKenzie E.T. Vivien D. Buisson A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 23Fernandez-Monreal M. Lopez-Atalaya J.P. Benchenane K. Cacquevel M. Dulin F. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. Jarrige A.C. Mackenzie E.T. Colloc'h N. Ali C. Vivien D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50850-50856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Pawlak R. Melchor J.P. Matys T. Skrzypiec A.E. Strickland S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to investigate the role of this receptor in our model system by blocking calcium influx with MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor inhibitor. Consistent with previous findings (11Medina M.G. Ledesma M.D. Dominguez J.E. Medina M. Zafra D. Alameda F. Dotti C.G. Navarro P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1706-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), tPA-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation in primary neurons and HT22 cells was reduced after preincubation with 10 μm MK-801 (Fig. 4, A and B). Most interestingly, MK-801 reduced the tPA-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in primary hippocampal neurons to similar levels as seen with RAP (Fig. 4B), suggesting that NMDA receptors and LRP1 either act in parallel or in succession in this signaling cascade. DL-AP5, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, corroborates the involvement of NMDA receptors in tPA-mediated Erk1/2 activation. To further study the role of the NMDA receptor, both cell types were additionally preincubated with the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist DL-AP5. As expected, the tPA-induced Erk1/2 activation was abolished both in HT22 cells (Fig. 4C) and primary neurons (Fig. 4D), further proving the involvement of NMDA receptors in LRP1-mediated tPA signaling. For control purposes, cells were coincubated with 0.2 mm NaOH and tPA to rule out any solvent effect of DL-AP5 on Erk1/2 phosphorylation. As we used the well established drug Actilyse (Boehringer Ingelheim) instead of pure synthetic tPA, we wanted to rule out any effects of possible low molecular weight contaminants like, for example, glutamate, which would directly activate NMDA receptors, or l-arginine as a prerequisite for NO generation, which could lead to stimulation of MAPK (25Kanterewicz B.I. Knapp L.T. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we dialyzed the Actilyse against double-distilled H2O with three buffer changes. The subsequent stimulation of HT22 cells with the dialyzed tPA resulted in an Erk1/2 phosphorylation comparable with that seen without dialysis (Fig. 4E). This implies that the observed Erk1/2 activation through the NMDA receptor pathway is due to tPA itself and not to any other component in the tPA solution. These results strongly suggest a pivotal role of tPA in LRP1-mediated NMDA receptor activation. The Functional Cooperation of LRP1 and NMDA Receptor Can Be Certified by Calcium-imaging Experiments—To provide further evidence for an LRP1-mediated effect on NMDA receptor activation, we measured calcium influx into the cells in response to tPA stimulation. The addition of tPA resulted in a rapid increase of [Ca2+]i in both HT22 cells (Fig. 5, A and C) and primary hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5, B and D). The pattern of the calcium signal was similar in both cell types, showing an initial peak and a subsequent plateau phase. This calcium response to tPA was abolished if the cells were pretreated with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (Fig. 5, A and B) or the LRP1 binding inhibitor RAP (Fig. 5, C and D). For statistical evaluation, we compared the maximum calcium increase after the addition of tPA. As shown in Fig. 5E, the calcium signal evoked by tPA was significantly reduced by MK-801 or RAP treatment (* or #, p < 0.05, n = 43–91 single cells from at least three individual coverslips). These experiments suggest that tPA-LRP1 signaling can activate NMDA receptors within several sec"

https://openalex.org/W1975165181,"Coral reefs resemble islands of productive habitats where fishes aggregate, forage, and spawn. Although it has been suggested that some reef fishes use biogenic chemicals as aggregation cues, specific chemicals have not been identified. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a secondary metabolite of many marine algal species, is released during foraging by higher-order consumers. DMSP has been studied intensively for its role in oceanic sulfur cycles and global climate regulation, but its ecological importance to marine fishes is unknown. We present evidence that planktivorous reef fishes will aggregate to experimental deployments of DMSP over coral reef habitats in the wild."

https://openalex.org/W2129394280,"Active metabolic suppression in anticipation of winter conditions has been demonstrated in species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, but not fish. This is because the reduction in metabolic rate in fish is directly proportional to the decrease in water temperature and they appear to be incapable of further suppressing their metabolic rate independently of temperature. However, the Antarctic fish (Notothenia coriiceps) is unusual because it undergoes winter metabolic suppression irrespective of water temperature. We assessed the seasonal ecological strategy by monitoring swimming activity, growth, feeding and heart rate (fH) in N. coriiceps as they free-ranged within sub-zero waters. The metabolic rate of wild fish was extrapolated from fH recordings, from oxygen consumption calibrations established in the laboratory prior to fish release. Throughout the summer months N. coriiceps spent a considerable proportion of its time foraging, resulting in a growth rate (Gw) of 0.18±0.2% day−1. In contrast, during winter much of the time was spent sedentary within a refuge and fish showed a net loss in Gw (−0.05±0.05% day−1). Whilst inactive during winter, N. coriiceps displayed a very low fH, reduced sensory and motor capabilities, and standard metabolic rate was one third lower than in summer. In a similar manner to other hibernating species, dormancy was interrupted with periodic arousals. These arousals, which lasted a few hours, occurred every 4–12 days. During arousal activity, fH and metabolism increased to summer levels. This endogenous suppression and activation of metabolic processes, independent of body temperature, demonstrates that N. coriiceps were effectively ‘putting themselves on ice’ during winter months until food resources improved. This study demonstrates that at least some fish species can enter a dormant state similar to hibernation that is not temperature driven and presumably provides seasonal energetic benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2067954113,"Polycystin-1 (PC1) may play an important role in skeletogenesis through regulation of the bone-specific transcription factor Runx2-II. In the current study we found that PC1 co-localizes with the calcium channel polycystin-2 (PC2) in primary cilia of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. To establish the role of Runx2-II in mediating PC1 effects on bone, we crossed heterozygous Pkd1m1Bei and Runx2-II mice to create double heterozygous mice (Pkd1+/m1Bei/Runx2-II+/-) deficient in both PC1 and Runx2-II. Pkd1+/m1Bei/Runx2-II+/- mice exhibited additive reductions in Runx2-II expression that was associated with impaired endochondral bone development, defective osteoblast-mediated bone formation, and osteopenia. In addition, we found that basal intracellular calcium levels were reduced in homozygous Pkd1m1Bei osteoblasts. In contrast, overexpression of a PC1 C-tail construct increased intracellular calcium and selectively stimulated Runx2-II P1 promoter activity in osteoblasts through a calcium-dependent mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis of critical amino acids in the coiled-coil domain of PC1 required for coupling to PC2 abolished PC1-mediated Runx2-II P1 promoter activity. Additional promoter analysis mapped the PC1-responsive region to the “osteoblast-specific” enhancer element between -420 and -350 bp that contains NFI and AP-1 binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the calcium-dependent binding of NFI to this region. These findings indicate that PC1 regulates osteoblast function through intracellular calcium-dependent control of Runx2-II expression. The overall function of the primary cilium-polycystin complex may be to sense and transduce environmental clues into signals regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone development. Polycystin-1 (PC1) may play an important role in skeletogenesis through regulation of the bone-specific transcription factor Runx2-II. In the current study we found that PC1 co-localizes with the calcium channel polycystin-2 (PC2) in primary cilia of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.

Site-directed mutagenesis of critical amino acids in the coiled-coil domain of PC1 required for coupling to PC2 abolished PC1-mediated Runx2-II P1 promoter activity. Additional promoter analysis mapped the PC1-responsive region to the “osteoblast-specific” enhancer element between -420 and -350 bp that contains NFI and AP-1 binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the calcium-dependent binding of NFI to this region. These findings indicate that PC1 regulates osteoblast function through intracellular calcium-dependent control of Runx2-II expression. The overall function of the primary cilium-polycystin complex may be to sense and transduce environmental clues into signals regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone development. Embryonic bone is formed from mesenchymal stem cells by either direct differentiation of these cells into mineralized matrix-generating osteoblasts (intramembranous bone) or by their condensation and subsequent formation of a cartilage template that is replaced by osteoblast-mediated bone formation (endochondral bone formation) (1Cohen Jr., M.M.

The total loss of Runx2 in the mouse results in the complete absence of intramembranous and endochondral bone formation. Expression of Runx2 is initiated from the distal P1 and the proximal P2 promoters that, respectively, give rise to N-terminal distinct Runx2-type II (Runx2-II) and Runx2-type I (Runx2-I) isoforms. Selective deletion of the P1 promoter and Runx2-II in mice results in impaired terminal osteoblastic maturation and endochondral bone formation (5Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K.

In the current study we investigate the role of PC1 in the regulation of P1-Runx2-II expression and skeletal development. Using mouse genetic approaches to create combined PC1 and Runx2-II-deficient mice, we demonstrate a functional linkage between PC1, Runx2-II expression, and skeletal development in vivo. In addition, we show that PC1 regulates the osteoblast-specific enhancer element in the Runx2-II P1 promoter through intracellular calcium-dependent mechanisms. These findings establish that PC1 is an important regulator of skeletal development through the selective regulation of Runx2-II. Mice—Pkd1m1Bei heterozygous mice, which have an inactivated point mutation in the Pkd1 gene leading to the substitution of an arginine for methionine in the first transmembrane domain (28Herron B.J.

We crossed Pkd1+/m1Bei mutant mice with Runx2-II+/- mice to create double heterozygous mice lacking one functional allele of both Runx2-II and Pkd1. Animal experiments were performed after review and approval by the University of Kansas Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee. Immunofluorescence Staining—MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were grown on collagen-coated coverslips and kept at confluence for at least 3 days. An acetylated α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used to identify the primary cilium. PC1- and PC2-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA) were used to localize PC1 and PC2. We used a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody and fluorescent microscopy to identify the primary cilium and PC1/PC2 complexes. The secondary antibody in the absence of a primary antibody was used as a negative control. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole blue staining was used to identify cell nuclei (15Xiao Z. Zhang S. Mahlios J.

Femurs and tibias from newborn mice were decalcified at 4 °C in 12.5% EDTA, 2.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Longitudinal sections of bone were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess the histology of the growth plate as previously described (11Xiao Z.S. Hjelmeland A.B. Quarles L.D. J. Biol.

Bone Densitometry and Histomorphometric Analysis—Bone mineral density (BMD) of femurs was assessed at 6 weeks of age using a LUNARPIXIMUS bone densitometer (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). Calcein (Sigma) double labeling of bone was performed as previously described (12Xiao Z. Awad H.A. Liu S. Mahlios J. Zhang S. Guilak F. Mayo M.S. Quarles L.D. Dev.

Quantitative histomorphometric analyses of bone sections were performed using the Osteomeasure analysis system (Osteometrics). Micro-CT Analysis—For newborn mice, the whole mouse skeleton and tibias were scanned using a μCT 40 in high resolution (Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). 100 slices of the metaphyses under the growth plate, constituting 0.6 mm in length, and 50 slices of the diaphysis, constituting 0.3 mm in length, were selected. For 6-week-old mice, the distal metaphyses and the mid-shaft regions of diaphyses in femurs were scanned using a middle resolution. 100 slices of the metaphyses under the growth plate, constituting 1.2 mm in length, and 50 slices of the diaphysis, constituting 0.6 mm in length, were selected. A three-dimensional image analysis was done to determine bone volume (bone volume/total volume) and cortical bone thickness as previously described (12Xiao Z. Awad H.A. Liu S. Mahlios J. Zhang S.

The c-Jun plasmid was obtained from Dr. Hong Lu at the University of Kansas Medical Center. We used the rVISTA program to map the PC1-reponsive element in the Runx2-II P1 promoter (30Loots G.G. Ovcharenko I. Pachter L. Dubchak I. Rubin E.M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). For promoter deletion analysis, we used a PCR strategy to create a series of 5′ deletions of the Runx2-II P1 promoter, ranging from -420, -398, -382, -370, -362, -350 to +1, that were cloned as NotI-HindIII fragments into the pluc4 reporter construct. We used a PCR strategy to generate previously described amino acid substitutions at sites 148, 149, and 155 of PC1-AT to create a mutant construct (PC1-ATmutant) that was unable to couple to PC2 (31Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The P1 deletion promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and PC1-AT constructs were transiently co-transfected into MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts by electroporation using Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amaxa Inc, Gaithersburg, MD). Promoter activity was assessed by measuring luciferase activity 24 and 48 h after transfection in the presence or absence of the specified pharmacological treatments as previously described (15Xiao Z.

Intracellular Calcium Measurements—For basal intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) measurements, we used the Fluo-4 NW calcium assay kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, osteoblasts were plated at 50,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and grown overnight. After removing the growth medium, cells were directly incubated in the 1× Fluo-4 NW dye loading solution at 37 °C for 30 min. The Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity (494/516 nm) was measured in each well using the Synergy HT Fluorescence Microplate Reader according to manufacturer's instruction (32Gee K.R. Brown K.A. Chen W.N. Bishop-Stewart J. Gray D. Johnson I. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—RT-PCR was performed using the Titan™ One tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from either non-transfected MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts or MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts that had been transiently transfected with either the control sIgØ or the PC1-AT constructs for 48 h. RT-PCR was carried out with NFI-specific degenerate primers Deg1 (5′-TTCCGGATGARTTYCAYCITTYATYGARGC-3′, where R is purine (A or G), Y is pyrimidine (C or T), S is C or G, and I is inosine) and Deg2 (5′-AATCGATRTGRTGSGGCTGIAYRCAIAG-3′) as previously described (33Mukhopadhyay S.S. Wyszomierski S.L. Gronostajski R.M. Rosen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 486-bp amplified product was digested with BamHI, Bpu10I, and NarI and then separated on 2% agarose gel. Mouse hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was amplified as a control for the RT-PCR reactions. Real-time RT-PCR—For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, 2.0 μg of total RNA isolated from newborn mice and the long bone of 6-week-old mice were reverse-transcribed as previously described (15Xiao Z. Zhang S. Mahlios J. Zhou G. Magenheimer B.S. Guo D. Dallas S.L. Maser R. Calvet J.P. Bonewald L. Quarles L.D. J. Biol.

PCR reactions contained 100 ng of template (cDNA or RNA), 300 nm each forward and reverse primers, and 1× iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in 50 μl. The threshold cycle (Ct) of tested-gene product from the indicated genotype was normalized to the Ct for cyclophilin A. Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analyses—The ChIP analyses were performed using the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad CA) and modifications of previously described methods (34Zhu E.D. Demay M.B. Gori F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7361-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were transiently transfected with PC1-AT for 72 h and treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link chromatin. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-NFI antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose. The specific protein-DNA complex was reversely cross-linked, and DNA fragments were purified. Real-time PCR was performed using primers located in the Runx2 P1 promoter. Primers amplifying sequences in exon 4 of Runx2 were used to normalize for DNA content and to calculate the relative ratio of the P1 promoter sequences over control sequences. -Fold enrichment reflects the ratio of promoter/control sequences in the immunoprecipitate versus the input samples. Normal rabbit IgG was used as a control. Statistics—We evaluated differences between groups by one-way analysis of variance. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. All computations were performed using the Statgraphic statistical graphics system (STSC Inc.). Pkd1 Selectively Regulates P1-Runx2-II Expression in Vivo—Because Pkd1 null mice are embryonic lethal and Runx2-II-/- mice have high perinatal mortality, to establish a potential functional link between Pkd1- and Runx2-II-dependent bone development, we created double heterozygous mice lacking one functional allele of Runx2-II and Pkd1. This was accomplished by crossing Pkd1+/m1Bei mutant mice with heterozygous Runx2-II+/- mice to create double heterozygous Pkd1+/m1Bei/Runx2-II+/- animals. We observed an approximate 35% reduction of Runx2-II expression in newborn heterozygous Pkd1+/m1Bei mice, comparable with the levels found in heterozygous Runx2-II+/- mice. Consistent with Pkd1 regulation of Runx2-II expression, we observed further reductions of Runx2-II expression in combined Pkd1+/m1Bei and Runx2-II+/- mice to levels that were 50% that observed in wild-type mice (Fig. 1). These changes were selective for P1-Runx2-II, since we observed no differences in P2-Runx2-I isoform expression in Pkd1-deficient mice (Fig. 1). We also found that reduction of Runx2-II expression persisted in adult mice, as evidenced by a respective 35 and 40% reduction in single heterozygous Pkd1+/m1Bei and Runx2-II+/- mice and a 66% reduction in 6-week-old double Pkd1+/m1Bei/Runx2-II+/- mice (Table 1).

However, few tumor antigens recognized by TCRγδ have been defined so far. To investigate antigenic epitopes/proteins recognized by γδT cells, we have established a new immunobiochemical strategy that uses complementarity-determining region 3 of TCR δ chain (CDR3δ) peptide-mediated epitope/protein-binding assays. CDR3δ peptides synthesized using the CDR3 region in TCR Vδ2 chain were validated for their binding specificity to target cells or tissues. These CDR3δ peptides were then employed as probes to pan putative epitopes in a 12-mer random peptide phage-displayed library and to identify putative protein ligands within tumor protein extracts by affinity chromatography and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. As a result, we have identified nine peptides and two proteins for TCRγδ, including human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2) and heat shock protein (HSP) 60. All nine tested epitope peptides not only bind to γδT cells but also functionally activate γδT cells in vitro. Identification of HSP60 confirms the validity of this method as HSP60 is an identified ligand for TCRγδ. We show that hMSH2 is expressed on the surface of SKOV3 tumor cells, and cytotoxicity of Vδ2 γδT cells to SKOV3 cells was blocked by anti-hMSH2 antibody, suggesting that hMSH2 may be a new ligand for TCRγδ.

TCRαβ specifically recognize antigenic peptides (epitopes) presented by MHC I/II molecules. Although many peptide ligands have been identified for TCRαβ (1Novellino L. Castelli C. Parmiani G. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2005; 54: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), only a few ligands have been identified for TCRγδ so far (2Tanaka Y. Morita C.T. Tanaka Y. Nieves E. Brenner M.B. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1995; 375: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 3Bukowski J.F. Morita C.T. Brenner M.B. Immunity. 1999; 11: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Human γδT cells account for ∼5% of CD3+ T cells in the peripheral blood, but constitute a major T cell subset in other anatomic locations, such as the intestine. In the peripheral blood of healthy individuals, TCR Vδ2 chain pairing with one particular Vγ9 chain is expressed on 50-90% of the γδT cells, whereas intestinal intraepithelial γδT cells frequently express the Vδ1 gene, which can associate with different Vγ elements (4Hayday A.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 975-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The antigen-binding site of TCRγδ is formed primarily from three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) contributed by each Vγ and Vδ domain. CDR1 and CDR2 fragments are encoded by germ line V genes, whereas the CDR3 is formed by somatic rearrangement of V(D) and J fragments. Sequence diversity in antigen receptors is not evenly distributed among all six CDRs but is highly concentrated in one or two CDR3. It had been proposed that the principal antigen specificity of an immunoglobulin or TCR is derived from its most diverse CDR3 fragments (5Davis M.M. Lyons D.S. Altman J.D. McHeyzer-Williams M. Hampl J. Boniface J.J. Chien Y. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 204: 94-104PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to TCR diversity, structures of the TCR-CD3 complex, and tissue distribution, the pattern of antigenic recognition is another key difference between γδT cells and conventional αβT cells. TCRγδT cells have two important features in their antigenic recognition. First, TCRγδ is structurally similar to the B cell receptor (BCR) on B lymphocytes, binding to its antigens or epitopes directly to trigger a fast response against foreign pathogens or self-malignant cells (6Allison T.J. Winter C.C. Fournie J.J. Bonneville M. Garboczi D.N. Nature. 2001; 411: 820-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Second, TCRγδ and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are functionally alike, because these receptors recognize conserved molecules (7Holtmeier W. Kabelitz D. Chem. Immunol. Allergy. 2005; 86: 151-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although γδT cells only account for a small proportion in the human T lymphocyte pool, they play important roles in both anti-tumor and anti-microbe responses in innate immunity (8Kabelitz D. Wesch D. He W. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Human γδT cells recognize stress-induced or malignancy/infection-related antigens. Such recognition is mediated through a non-MHC restricted manner in most cases. Among the known antigens for γδT cells, the most frequently identified ones are non-peptide antigens, such as pyrophosphoantigen (naturally occurring and synthetic antigens) recognized by T cells bearing Vγ9δ2 heterodimer TCR chain (9Viey E.

Blood. 2000; 96: 384-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, classical MHC and MHC-like molecules can directly serve as ligands for γδT cells (12Davies A. Lopez-Briones S. Ong H. O'Neil-Marshall C. Lemonnier F.A. Nagaraju K. Metcalf E.S. Soloski M.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6828-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA) and B (MICB) are recognized by Vδ1 γδT cells (13Maeurer M.J. Martin D. Walter W. Liu K. Zitvogel L. Halusczcak K. Rabinowich H. Duquesnoy R. Storkus W.

Commun. 2006; 339: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). UL-16 binding protein (ULBP) is a novel ligand for NKG2D receptor in humans (15Cosman D. Mullberg J. Sutherland C.L. Chin W. Armitage R. Fanslow W. Kubin M. Chalupny N.J. Immunity. 2001; 14: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). We found that RAET1E2, a soluble isoform of the UL16-binding protein RAET1E produced by tumor cells, inhibits NKG2D-mediated NK cytotoxicity (16Cao W. Xi X. Hao Z. Li W. Kong Y. Cui L. Ma C. Ba D. He W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18922-18928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because of the sequence and structure similarity of the extra-cellular domains between MICA and ULBPs, ULBPs are also considered as antigens for Vδ1 γδT cells (17Cao W. He W. Immunobiology. 2004; 209: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins (HSP) are highly conserved among prokaryotes and eukaryotes and are known to be involved in various stress conditions. HSP had been implicated in γδT cell-mediated anti-tumor response (18Zhang H. Hu H. Jiang X. He H. Cui L. He W. Immunol. Investig. 2005; 34: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Thomas M.L. Samant U.C. Deshpande R.K. Chiplunkar S.V. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2000; 48: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, other protein antigens, such as ectopically expressed mitochondrial ATPase, have also been identified as ligands for TCRγδ (20Scotet E. Martinez L.O. Grant E. Barbaras R. Jeno P. Guiraud M. Monsarrat B. Saulquin X. Maillet S. Esteve J.P. Lopez F. Perret B. Collet X. Bonneville M. Champagne E. Immunity. 2005; 22: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, a crucial issue regarding γδT cells is the paucity of the identified ligands for these cells. To date, only a few human TCRγδ-recognized protein antigens have been reported. To better understand γδT cell function, we have developed a new technical strategy to identify human TCRγδ-recognized epitopes/proteins by combining immunological and biochemical methods using the CDR3 peptide of T cell receptor δ2 chain (CDR3δ)-mediated epitope/protein-binding assays (CEPAs). This CDR3δ peptide-based immunobiochemical strategy was based on a hypothesis that the primary sequence of CDR3, especially CDR3δ, because of its similarity to CDR3β of TCRβ and VH CDR3 of BCR in gene composition, could serve as the key determinant of specificity in antigen binding by the TCRγδ. We have confirmed this hypothesis using in vitro binding assays. Synthesized TCR Vδ2 CDR3 peptides derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in ovarian epithelial carcinoma (OEC) could specifically bind tumor cell lines and tissues, suggesting the determinant role of CDR3δ in antigen binding. Moreover, CDR3δ peptide-mediated binding specificity was blocked by preincubation with the same peptide, which decreased the cytotoxicity of γδT cells to OEC cells in vitro, further indicating such binding is specific (21Xu C. Zhang H. Hu H. He H. Wang Z. Xu Y. Chen H. Cao W. Zhang S. Cui L. Ba D. He W. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on our previous findings, we then used synthesized CDR3δ peptides as specific probes to identify putative TCRγδ-recognized antigenic epitopes in a peptide library and TCRγδ-recognized proteins in an affinity chromatography system. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, CDR3δ peptide-based immunobiochemical strategy is technically composed of four steps as follows: selecting probes for epitopes/proteins, screening epitopes/proteins, identifying epitopes/proteins sequences, and validating epitopes/proteins functions. Based on the specific binding of CDR3δ peptide to its target, we developed a set of CEPAs, which contains eight assays running through all the four steps of our strategy, including the following: 1) CDR3δ peptide-mediated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine interaction between CDR3δ peptides and target proteins; 2) CDR3δ peptide-mediated immunofluorescence assays to detect specific binding of CDR3δ peptides to target cells; 3) CDR3δ peptide-mediated enzyme immunoassays to detect specific binding of CDR3δ peptides to target proteins and tissues; 4) competitive test to confirm CDR3δ peptide sharing antigenic binding specificity with TCRγδ; 5) panning putative epitope peptides in a 12-mer random peptide phage-displayed library with immobilized CDR3δ peptides; 6) screening antigenic proteins in affinity chromatography with CDR3δ peptide as affinity molecule; 7) phage-ELISA to select single CDR3δ peptide-binding phage clone; and 8) CDR3δ peptide-mediated Western blotting to detect CDR3δ peptide-binding proteins. With this strategy, we have identified seven tumor-related epitopes and two HBV infection-related epitopes, as well as two self-proteins, including HSP60 and human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2). HSP60 has been identified as a ligand for γδT cells (18Zhang H. Hu H. Jiang X. He H. Cui L. He W. Immunol. Investig. 2005; 34: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Thomas M.L. Samant U.C. Deshpande R.K. Chiplunkar S.V. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2000; 48: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas hMSH2 is a DNA mismatch repair protein in the cell nucleolus (22Mitchell R.J. Farrington S.M. Dunlop M.G. Campbell H. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2002; 156: 885-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We show that hMSH2 is expressed on tumor cell membrane and recognized by Vδ2 γδT cells, suggesting that hMSH2 may be a novel ligand for TCRγδ. Taken together, our findings provide a novel strategy to identify epitopes/proteins for TCRγδ. Peptide Synthesis—The following four Vδ2 CDR3 peptides were synthesized, including three (OT1, OT2, and OT3) corresponding to the sequences derived from γδTIL in OEC and one CDR3 peptide HP1, whose sequence was derived from a peripheral γδT cell clone from an HBV-infected patient: OT1, CACDSHGPSRLMMEGGLLGTDKLIFGKG; OT2, CARKDLPINNWGIPRIDKLIFGKG; OT3, CDFPSHTFHSTGGHTTDKLIFGKG; and HP1, CACDHLPLGDTRVHDKLIFGKG. Meanwhile, a structurally very similar peptide HP1m was synthesized with mutations of the first four amino acids and was employed as the control for HP1: HP1m, TQEHHLPLGDTRVHDKLIFGKG. The conformational preference of the CDR3δ peptides OT3 and HP1 was analyzed by molecular dynamics. The results suggested that both of them displayed loop-like conformations in water (supplemental Fig. 2 shows the C-α root mean square deviation of the CDR3δ peptides). The modeled structure of OT3 and HP1 is shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A, respectively. Seven tumor-related epitope peptides, named as EP1 to EP7, and two HBV infection-related epitopes, EP8 and EP9, were also synthesized (Table 1). All peptides were biotinylated by adding a biotin tag at the N terminus of each peptide sequence for detection in the following assays. Peptides were synthesized by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China. The purity of each peptide was 85% in high performance liquid chromatography analysis.FIGURE 2HBV infection-related CDR3δ peptide HP1 specifically bound HBV-infected tissues/cells/cell extracts, and HBV infection-related epitope peptides stimulatedγδT cells in vitro.

Another human OEC cell line HO8910 was established in our laboratory and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS. A human uterine cervix cancer cell line (HeLa) and a human T lymphoma cell line (J.RT3-T3.5) deficient in both TCR α and β chains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in 10% FCS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% FCS/RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), respectively.

After immobilization, the surfaces were blocked with 1 mm ethanolamine (pH 8.5) and then washed with 1 mm formic acid to remove noncoupled proteins. OT3 peptide from low to high concentrations (0.25 to 2 mm) consecutively and HP1/HP1m peptides (0.5 mm) were employed for the binding assay at room temperature. BIAevaluation version 3.1 (Biacore AB) was used for data analysis. FCM and Confocal Microscopy Assays—Immunofluorescence assays were applied to assess CDR3δ peptide/OT3 graft immunoglobulin (OT3-Ig), whose VH CDR3 region of a human autoantibody (IgG) recognizing thyroglobulin was replaced with OT3 peptide sequence (21Xu C. Zhang H. Hu H. He H. Wang Z. Xu Y. Chen H. Cao W. Zhang S. Cui L. Ba D. He W. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), epitope peptide-mediated binding activity to target cells (tumor cells/γδT cells), and the expression of hMSH2 on tumor cells. For FCM assay, cells were incubated with biotinylated CDR3δ/epitope peptides, OT3-Ig (mouse IgG), and rabbit anti-hMSH2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG antibody (Pierce) was then added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Wide type immunoglobulin (WT-Ig) and rabbit IgG (Zhongshan, China) were used as controls for OT3-Ig and rabbit anti-hMSH2 polyclonal antibody. The cells were analyzed on a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For confocal microscopy, cells were fixed on slides by 2% cold paraformaldehyde and in turn incubated with biotinylated synthesized HP1 peptide and with FITC-conjugated streptavidin. Cells incubated with biotinylated synthesized HP1m peptide instead of the HP1 peptide were used as controls. Slides were examined with a confocal laser microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss). Immunohistochemistry and ELISA—Immunohistochemistry assay was used to evaluate CDR3δ peptide-mediated binding activity to target tissues. Briefly, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of HBV-infected liver tissues or normal tissues were deparaffinized and then boiled by microwave for antigen retrieval. After quenching with hydrogen peroxide, the sections were blocked with 5% goat serum. Biotinylated synthesized HP1 peptide (5 μg) was then added to the slides. The sections were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Zhongshan, China). Binding was visualized using diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as the substrate and observed under a light microscope. In CDR3δ-ELISA, 96-well plates were coated with proteins extracted from SKOV3 cells (10 μg/well) in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.6), or formalin-fixed SKOV3 cells (4 × 105/well). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin solution, the plates were incubated with biotinylated CDR3δ peptides or OT3-Ig/WT-Ig. After reaction with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce) and substrate (Sigma), the plates were then read on a microplate reader (Labsystem) at 450 nm. MTT Colorimetric Test and CDR3δ Peptide Competitive Test—This test was used for evaluation of γδT cell cytotoxicity to tumor lines. Briefly, SKOV3 cells as target cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (1 × 104/well). For competitive testing, target cells were preincubated with CDR3δ peptides (0.1 mg/ml) or anti-hMSH2 polyclonal antibody (0.2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h, and equivalent rabbit IgGs (Zhongshan, China) were used as controls for anti-hMSH2 polyclonal antibody. Then γδT cells as effector cells were incubated with target cells for another 8 h (the γδT cells were preincubated with epitope peptides for 2 h in stimulating assay). MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to wells (15 μl/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 additional hours. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of lysis buffer (10% SDS) to dissolve the tetrazolium crystals. The plate was examined in a Multiskan Microplate Reader (Thermo Lab-systems, Finland) and the percentage of specific lysis was calculated by using Equation 1, TA-((E+T)A-EA)TA×100%Eq. 1 TA = absorbance of target cells for control; EA = absorbance of effector cells for control, and (E + T)A = absorbance of effector cells cultured with target cells. The absorbance was determined at 570 and 630 nm. Panning of CDR3δ Peptide-binding Phage Clones in a 12-mer Random Peptide Phage-displayed Library—A 12-mer random peptide phage-displayed library (New England Biolabs) was screened by CDR3δ peptides as follows: a 96-well plate was coated with 100 μl/well coating buffer (containing 10 μg CDR3δ peptide) for 2 h at 37 °C and then blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The primary library solution was added to the wells (10 μl per well containing 1011 colony-forming units) and shaken gently at room temperature for 1 h. After thoroughly washing with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, the CDR3δ peptide-binding phages were eluted by acidic buffer (0.2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.2)) and neutralized by 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.1) immediately. In some cases, a high concentration of CDR3δ peptide (200 μg/ml) was used for competitive elution as well. The concentration of Tween 20 in washing buffer was increased to 0.3 and 0.5% in the following two rounds of biopanning and was kept at 0.5% thereafter. Affinity Chromatography—Affinity chromatography was used to enrich CDR3δ peptide-binding proteins with the following procedures. CDR3δ peptide was coupled to a 1-ml HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences) (5 mg) through its C-terminal hydroxyl group in coupling buffer (0.2 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.3)). The excess active groups uncoupled to CDR3δ peptide were deactivated with solution (0.5 m ethanolamine, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.3)). CDR3δ peptide-coupled column was then thoroughly equilibrated by binding buffer (20 mm PBS (pH 7.0)). After the proteins were applied to the column, the absorbance value of the outflow at 280 nm was detected, and elution buffer (1% formic acid) was changed until the A280 returned to the base line. The fractions containing eluted proteins were collected and neutralized quickly with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). throughout the process, the flow rate was kept under 0.2 ml per min. Identification for CDR3δ Peptide-binding Phage Clones by Phage-ELISA, PCR, and Sequencing—After five rounds of panning, individual plaque was picked randomly, and positive phage clones were selected by phage-ELISA using HRP-anti-M13 phage antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, wells of ELISA plate were coated with CDR3δ peptides and blocked as in the panning procedures. Single colony phage was added into CDR3δ peptide-coated wells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After fully washing, HRP-anti-M13phage antibody was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The positive phage clones in ELISA were then amplified, and epitopes containing parts were obtained by PCR and sequenced with the ABI automatic sequencer 377 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the -96 sequencing primer, 5′-CC CTC ATA GTT AGC GTA ACG-3′ (supplied in the kit). Identification of CDR3δ Peptide-binding Proteins by SDS-PAGE and CDR3δ Peptide-mediated Western Blotting—The enriched proteins through affinity chromatography were separated by SDS-PAGE. After proteins were electrically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, the blot membrane was placed in blocking buffer. The biotinylated CDR3δ peptide (10 μg/ml) was used as the primary antibody, and HRP-streptavidin was employed as the secondary antibody for usual Western blotting. Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Pierce) was added, and the blot was exposed to a x-ray film for an appropriate duration. Data Base Search and Protein Identification—The in-gel trypsin digestion and MS analysis of a certain SDS-PAGE protein band was carried out at Beijing Proteome Research Center, China. LC ESI-MS/MS analyses were performed using an LTQ system (Thermo Finnigan). Tryptic peptides mixtures were first loaded onto a capillary column (15 cm length, 75 μm inner diameters). The elution from reverse phase liquid chromatography column was directed on line to be detected by MS. All the MS/MS spectra were searched using SEQUEST algorithm-based Bioworks version 3.2 (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) against the International Protein Index human data base 3.19, which had 60,397 entries (23Kersey P.J. Duarte J. Williams A. Karavidopoulou Y. Birney E. Apweiler R. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Proteins with at least two unique “identity” score peptides were considered as being unambiguously identified, and the single peptide-matche"
https://openalex.org/W1992653519,"Ubc7p is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) that functions with endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident ubiquitin ligases (E3s) to promote endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Ubc7p only functions in ERAD if bound to the ER surface by Cue1p, a membrane-anchored ER protein. The role of Cue1p was thought to involve passive concentration of Ubc7p at the surface of the ER. However, our biochemical studies of Ubc7p suggested that Cue1p may, in addition, stimulate Ubc7p E2 activity. We have tested this idea and found it to be true both in vitro and in vivo. Ubc7p bound to the soluble domain of Cue1p showed strongly enhanced in vitro ubiquitination activity, both in the presence and absence of E3. Cue1p also enhanced Ubc7p function in vivo, and this activation was separable from the established ER-anchoring role of Cue1p. Finally, we tested in vivo activation of Ubc7p by Cue1p in an assay independent of the ER membrane and ERAD. A chimeric E2 linking Ubc7p to the Cdc34p/Ubc3p localization domain complemented the cdc34-2 TS phenotype, and co-expression of the soluble Cue1p domain enhanced complementation by this chimeric Ubc7p E2. These studies reveal a previously unobserved stimulation of Ubc7p E2 activity by Cue1p that is critical for full ERAD and that functions independently of the well known Cue1p anchoring function. Moreover, it suggests a previously unappreciated mode for regulation of E2s by Cue1p-like interacting partners."
https://openalex.org/W2143977712,"The NF-kappaB family member RelB has many properties not shared by other family members such as restricted subunit association and lack of regulation by the classical IkappaB proteins. We show that the protein level of RelB is significantly reduced in the absence of p100 and reduced even more when both p100 and p105 are absent. RelB stabilizes itself by directly interacting with p100, p105, and their processed products. However, RelB forms complexes with its partners using different interaction modes. Although the C-terminal ankyrin repeat domain of p105 is not involved in the RelB-p105 complex formation, all domains and flexible regions of each protein are engaged in the RelB-p100 complex. In several respects the RelB-p52 and RelB-p100 complexes are unique in the NF-kappaB family. The N-terminal domain of p100/p52 interacts with RelB but not RelA. The transcriptional activation domain of RelB, but not RelA, directly interacts with the processing region of p100. These unique protein-protein contacts explain why RelB prefers p52 as its dimeric partner for transcriptional activity and is retained in the cytoplasm as an inhibited complex by p100. This association-mediated stabilization of RelB implies a possible role for RelB in the processing of p100 into p52."
https://openalex.org/W2117719145,"Calcineurin B homologous protein (CHP) 1 and 2 are Ca(2+)-binding proteins that modulate several cellular processes, including cytoplasmic pH by positively regulating plasma membrane-type Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHEs). Recently another CHP-related protein, termed tescalcin or CHP3, was also shown to interact with the ubiquitous NHE1 isoform, but seemingly suppressed its activity. However, the precise physical and functional nature of this association was not examined in detail. In this study, biochemical and cellular studies were undertaken to further delineate this relationship. Glutathione S-transferase-NHE1 fusion protein pulldown assays revealed that full-length CHP3 binds directly to the proximal juxtamembrane C-terminal region (amino acids 505-571) of rat NHE1 in the same region that binds CHP1 and CHP2. The interaction was further validated by coimmunoprecipitation and coimmunolocalization experiments using full-length CHP3 and wild-type NHE1 in transfected Chinese hamster ovary AP-1 cells. Simultaneous mutation of four hydrophobic residues within this region ((530)FLDHLL(535)) to either Ala, Gln, or Arg (FL-A, FL-Q, or FL-R) abrogated this interaction both in vitro and in intact cells. The NHE1 mutants were sorted properly to the cell surface but showed markedly reduced (FL-A) or minimal (FL-R and FL-Q) activity. Interestingly, and contrary to an earlier finding, ectopic coexpression of CHP3 up-regulated the cell surface activity of wild-type NHE1. This stimulation was not observed with the CHP3 binding-defective mutants. Mechanistically, overexpression of CHP3 did not alter the H(+) sensitivity of wild-type NHE1 but rather promoted its biosynthetic maturation and half-life at the cell surface, thereby increasing the steady-state abundance of functional NHE1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2145639052,"Glycine residues may play functional and structural roles in membrane proteins. In this work we studied the role of glycine residues in EmrE, a small multidrug transporter from Escherichia coli. EmrE extrudes various drugs across the plasma membrane in exchange with protons and, as a result, confers resistance against their toxic effects. Each of 12 glycine residues was replaced by site-directed mutagenesis. Four of the 12 glycine residues in EmrE are evolutionary conserved within the small multidrug resistance family of multidrug transporters. Our analysis reveals that only two (Gly-67 and Gly-97) of these four highly conserved residues are essential for transporter activity. Moreover, two glycine positions that are less conserved, Gly-17 and Gly-90, demonstrate also a nil phenotype when substituted. Our present results identifying Gly-17 and Gly-67 as irreplaceable reinforce the importance of previously defined functional clusters. Two essential glycine residues, Gly-90 and Gly-97, form a protein motif in which glycine residues are separated by six other residues (GG7). Upon substitution of glycine in these positions, the protein ability to form dimers is impaired as evaluated by cross-linking and pull-down experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2009885443,"Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) is a newly identified ubiquitin-like protein. Like ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like proteins, Ufm1 is synthesized as a precursor that needs to be processed to expose the conserved C-terminal glycine prior to its conjugation to target proteins. Two novel proteases, named UfSP1 and UfSP2, have been shown to be responsible for the release of Ufm1 from Ufm1-conjugated cellular proteins as well as for the processing of its precursor. They show no sequence homology with known proteases. Here, we describe the 1.7Å resolution crystal structure of mouse UfSP1, consisting of 217 amino acids. The structure reveals that it is a novel cysteine protease having a papain-like fold, with Cys53, Asp175, and His177 that form a catalytic triad, and Tyr41 that participates in the formation of the oxyanion hole. This differs from the canonical catalytic triad of papain-like proteases in that the aspartate and the histidine residues are from the “Asp-Pro-His” box. The Asp-Pro-His configuration seen in UfSP1, together with Atg4B and M48USP, seem to form a new subfamily of the cysteine protease superfamily. The mutagenesis study of the active site residues confirms structural basis for catalysis. The interaction between UfSP1 and Ufm1 appears quite substantial, since the KD value was estimated to be 1.6 μm by the isothermal titration calorimetry analysis. Furthermore, the NMR data shows that the loop between β3 and α2 in addition to the C-terminal region of Ufm1 plays a role in binding to UfSP1.

In eukaryotes, the posttranslational modification of cellular proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) 4The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; UBL, ubiquitin-like protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; DUB, deubiquitinating enzymes; ULP, UBL-specific protease; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction. 4The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; UBL, ubiquitin-like protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; DUB, deubiquitinating enzymes; ULP, UBL-specific protease; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction. is an essential step in regulatory mechanisms of many cellular processes. These include cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and targeting of misfolded proteins for degradation by the proteasome (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 3Pickart C.M.

Cell Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Ub, which is a 76-residue polypeptide with a well defined α/β fold, is highly conserved in all eukaryotes but absent in bacteria or archaea (5Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 396-6399Google Scholar). It is synthesized as an inactive precursor and needs to be processed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) to expose the C-terminal glycine. The C terminus of Ub is then covalently ligated to the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues on target proteins by the sequential action of three classes of enzymes: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). Ub may be attached to a target protein as a monomer or as a polyubiquitin chain. The ubiquitination pathway is further regulated by DUBs that also remove Ub from Ub-conjugated proteins (6Galan J.M.

In addition to Ub, there are a number of distinct ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs), such as SUMO (small Ub-related modifier), ISG15, NEDD8, and Atg8, that function as protein modifiers. Like Ub, these UBLs also function as critical regulators of many cellular processes, such as transcription, DNA repair, signal transduction, autophagy, and the cell cycle (12Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 13Welchman R.L. Gordon C. Mayer R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The UBLs share further similarities with Ub. For example, UBLs display tertiary structure similar to that of Ub, although they lack obvious sequence identity. They also require a series of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes in order to be conjugated to a target protein. Like Ub, most UBLs, if not all, are synthesized as precursors that are processed by UBL-specific proteases (ULPs). ULPs also play a role in the release of UBLs from their conjugated proteins. However, unlike Ub, most UBLs are conjugated to their substrates as a monomer. Dysregulation of UBL substrate modification and/or mutations in the UBL conjugation machinery lead to a number of human diseases (11Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 14Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 15Chung K.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 7-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a novel UBL called ubiquitin-fold modifier 1, or Ufm1, has been identified (16Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It has the same tertiary structure as Ub despite the fact that they share only 16% sequence identity (17Sasakawa H. Sakata E. Yamaguchi Y. Komatsu M. Tatsumi K. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similar to other UBLs, Ufm1 is synthesized as a precursor. Interestingly, however, Ufm1 possesses a single glycine at its C terminus followed by a Ser-Cys dipeptide in the precursor form unlike Ub or UBLs that have the conserved diglycine at the C terminus. The matured Ufm1 is specifically activated by a novel E1-like enzyme called Uba5 and then transferred to its cognate E2-like enzyme, called Ufc1. Ufm1 is demonstrated to conjugate several proteins in human HEK293 cells and various mouse tissues, and the identification of these target proteins is under way (16Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Since Ufm1, Uba5, and Ufc1 are conserved in metazoa and plants but not in yeast, potential roles of Ufm1 modification in various multicellular organisms are of special interest. Earlier two novel proteases specific for Ufm1, named UfSP1 and UfSP2, were identified (18Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Song M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. Ovaa H. Tatsumi K. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both UfSP1 and UfSP2 cleave only the C-terminal extension of Ufm1 but not Ub or UBLs. In addition, they are both capable of releasing Ufm1 from Ufm1-conjugated cellular proteins. The long UfSP2 is present in most, if not all, multicellular organisms, whereas the short UfSP1 is not found in plants or nematodes. Both UfSP1 and UfSP2 possess highly conserved Cys and His residues, indicating that they are cysteine proteases, and biochemical and mutational analysis confirmed that they are indeed thiol proteases (see Fig. 1). However, they share no sequence homology with other known proteases, including DUBs or ULPs, suggesting a new subfamily of cysteine proteases. Here, we report the crystal structure of mouse UfSP1 at 1.7 Å resolution and discuss the structural basis for Ufm1 processing. Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNAs for Ufm1 (SwissProt entry P61961) and UfSP1 (SwissProt entry Q9CZP0) from mice were cloned into pET28a and pET22b (Novagen) to generate N- or C-terminal His-tagged proteins. The resulting vectors were transformed to Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL (Stratagene) cells, and the His-tagged proteins were purified using nickel affinity resins (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. They were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare). The purified UfSP1 was concentrated to 40 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol using Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore). Selenomethionine-substituted UfSP1 was generated as described previously (19Hu M. Li D. Song L. Jeffrey P.D. Chernova T.A. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3747-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity was measured as described earlier (18Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Song M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. Ovaa H. Tatsumi K. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Initial screening for the crystallization was carried out by using 96-well Intelli plates (Hampton Research) and a Hydra II Plus One (MATRIX Technology) robotics system at 295 K, and they were further optimized using the hanging drop methods. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained by mixing equal volumes of 40 mg/ml mouse UfSP1 in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m succinic acid (pH 7.0), and 5% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. Attempts to crystallize UfSP1 complexed with Ufm1 did not yield crystals suitable for high resolution data collection. X-ray Data Collection and Processing—The crystals of UfSP1 belong to the space group R32, with a = b = 71.70 Å, c = 209.23 Å, and α = β = 90° and γ = 120°. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals were equilibrated in a cryoprotectant buffer containing reservoir buffer plus 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and then flash-cryocooled in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structure of UfSP1 was determined by the MAD phasing method. All three selenium sites were found and refined, and the initial phases were calculated using the program SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). About 84% of the residues were automatically modeled as a polyalanine chain by RESOLVE and further constructed using the molecular modeling program COOT (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23004) Google Scholar). The refinement was then performed using the CNS and REF-MAC (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P.

The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Site-directed Mutagenesis and UfSP1 Activity Assay—Site-directed mutagenesis on the residues that might be involved in the catalysis was carried out using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutants of UfSP1 were produced as MBP-fused proteins with single point mutations at positions Tyr41, Cys53, Trp98, Gln154, Asp175, and His177. Ufm1 processing activity was assayed by using GST-Ufm1-HA as a substrate as described previously (18Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Song M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. Ovaa H. Tatsumi K. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of proteins of wild type and mutant forms of MBP-UfSP1 were incubated with 5 μg of GST-Ufm1-HA for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue R250. Ufm1 Binding by NMR Chemical Shift Perturbation—Uniformly labeled 15N-labeled or 13C/15N-labeled mouse Ufm1 was produced in M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl or a mixture of 15NH4Cl and 13C-labeled glucose, respectively. The C53S mutant of mouse UfSP1 was used. They were purified as described above and concentrated to 0.3-0.8 mm. For backbone resonance assignment, CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB experiments were performed using 0.8 mm 13C/15N-enriched Ufm1 in 20 mm deuterated Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) D2O. NMR titration experiments were performed by measurement of 1H-15N TROSY on 0.3 mm 15N-Ufm1 with various amounts of unlabeled UfSP1 in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) D2O at pH 6.8. The molar ratio of unlabeled UfSP1 to 15N-labeled UfSP1 was about 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 1:0.5, and 1:1, respectively. 1H-15N resonances of Ufm1 at pH 6.8 with or without UfSP1 were assigned from the analysis of 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum of the respective sample. All NMR spectra were collected at 25 °C on a Varian Unity Inova 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with Coldprobe™ at KIST. All NMR data were processed using NMRPipe software (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11446) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView software (27Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothemal titration calorimetric experiments were performed using a MicroCal VP isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 22 °C, and the data were analyzed using the program ORIGIN. Protein samples were prepared in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 200 mm NaCl buffer. The purified C53S mutant of UfSP1 protein was concentrated to 1.5 mm, whereas Ufm1 was concentrated to 0.1 mm using an Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator. All protein solutions were degassed for 10 min under vacuum with a ThermoVac accessory prior to performing the experiment at 22 °C. During a typical titration experiment, 250 μl of Ufm1 protein solution (or the same volume of the buffer as a control) was added to 1.4 ml of UfSP1 protein, and 250 μl buffer solutions were added to UfSP1 protein as a control under the same condition. Typically, 5 μl injections, with 10 s duration, were made every 180 s, and the sample cell was stirred with the flat tip of the syringe rotating at 307 rpm. Both Ufm1-(1-85) and UfSP1-(6-215) from mice were expressed in E. coli and purified. The apo form of UfSP1 was crystallized in rhombohedral form, and the crystal structure has been determined using multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion data collected from the selenomethionine-substituted UfSP1 and refined to a final R value of 18.6% (Rfree = 22.7%) at 1.7 Å resolution. The electron density map is clearly defined for all atoms except for residues 149-154. For those six residues, the electron density was weak but enough to trace, so they were included in the final model. The side chain of Trp98 can be modeled in two distinct orientations. Table 1 summarizes statistics on the crystallographic data. Binding of Ufm1 to UfSP1 has been analyzed using ITC and NMR chemical shift perturbation. Overall Crystal Structure of Mouse UfSP1—The overall structure, with dimensions of 45 × 30 × 38 Å, consists of an α/β-fold with a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices on either side of the sheet and the N terminus forming an antiparallel β-structure. The central antiparallel β-sheet is composed of β1, β4, β5, and β6; the C-terminal antiparallel β-sheet consists of β2, β3, and β7 (Fig. 2A). The helices α1, α2, and α3 are located at one side of the β-sheet, whereas the other three are on the opposite side (Fig. 2B). The active site cysteine is located at the N terminus of helix α1, whereas histidine is at the loop between β5 and α5. The overall structure mimics the papain fold despite the fact that they share no obvious sequence homology (11%). Since the C-terminal catalytic domain of UfSP2 shares 36% sequence identity with UfSP1, the catalytic domain of UfSP2 is expected to assume the same structure as UfSP1. Comparison of UfSP1 with other structures in the Protein Data Bank using the DALI algorithm (28Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) yielded a few structural homologues from the cysteine protease superfamily. The most significant match, based on having the highest Z-score, was Atg4B (Protein Data Bank accession code 2CY7 (29Sugawara K. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40058-40065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and Protein Data Bank accession code 2D1I (30Kumanomidou T. Mizushima T. Komatsu M. Suzuki A. Tanida I. Sou U.S. Ueno T. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Yamane T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)), which showed a Z-score of 12.6. Atg4B, an essential enzyme in autophagy, cleaves nascent Atg8 at its C-terminal arginine residue and also deconjugates Atg8 family proteins from a small adduct, phosphatidylethanolamine. The second highest hit was the recently reported protease domain of murine cytomegalovirus, M48USP, with a Z-score of 6.7 (Protein Data Bank accession code 2J7Q (31Schlieker C. Weihofen W.A. Frijns E. Kattenhorn L.M. Gaudet R. Ploegh H.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). DUBs, such as a 40-kDa catalytic core domain of HAUSP (Protein Data Bank accession code 1NBF (32Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar)) and UCH-L3 (Protein Data Bank accession codes 1UCH and 1XD3 (33Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 1512-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)) showed only low structural similarities with UfSP1, as indicated by the Z-scores of 3.9 and 1.9, respectively. Fig. 2B shows the superposition of Atg4B, M48USP, and papain on UfSP1. Despite their overall structural similarity, Atg4B and M48USP exhibit a number of significant local structural differences from UfSP1 (Fig. 2B). Atg4B has an additional domain called the “short fingers domain” or “auxiliary domain,” which is composed of three α-helices and two β-stands forming an α/β structure whose function is unknown (29Sugawara K. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40058-40065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Kumanomidou T. Mizushima T. Komatsu M. Suzuki A. Tanida I. Sou U.S. Ueno T. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Yamane T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the other hand, M48USP has an “extended β-hairpin” structure that participates in extensive hydrophobic interaction with the Ub core that is bound. This interaction is quite distinct from what has been seen in the DUB·Ub or ULP·UBL complexes, and this Ub binding mode has been suggested to contribute to Ub specificity of M48USP (31Schlieker C. Weihofen W.A. Frijns E. Kattenhorn L.M. Gaudet R. Ploegh H.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HAUSP has three domains, described as fingers, palm, and thumb, and its active site is located between the palm and thumb. In this case, however, binding of Ub aldehyde induces a drastic conformational change in the active site that realigns the catalytic triad residues for catalysis (32Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviations for the core structures are 2.8 Å for 138 Cα atoms in papain, 2.9 Å for 169 Cα atoms in Atg4B, 3.9 Å for 137 Cα atoms in M48USP, and 4.0 Å for 121 Cα atoms in HAUSP. Active Site of UfSP1—Cys53 and His177 of UfSP1 were identified as catalytic residues earlier (18Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Song M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. Ovaa H. Tatsumi K. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). They are part of highly conserved stretches (i.e. Gly-Trp-Cys53-Ala/Gly-Tyr-Arg- Ser/Thr, and Ile-Leu-Asp175-Pro-His177-Tyr-Thr/Trp-Gly, in which strictly conserved residues are shown in boldface type or else sequences are shown in the order of UfSP1/UfSP2. As shown in Fig. 3A, Cys53 is located at the N-terminal end of the α1 helix, and His177 is situated at the loop between the strand β5 and helix α5. Indeed, the structure shows that the Nϵ2 atom in the imidazole ring of His177 is only 3.4 Å away from the Sγ atom of the catalytic Cys53 and is further hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule (W1325) through Nδ1. The Asp175 is 4.5 Å away from the Nδ1 of His177 in the current structure, but with a simple χ1 and χ2 rotation of His177 it can easily make a hydrogen bond to the side chain oxygen of Asp175. Thus, Cys53, His177, and Asp175 are reasonably well posed for catalysis. The proline residue between Asp175 and His177 plays a role in ensuring the proper positioning of the two. In addition to the catalytic triad, cysteine proteases have another conserved residue, typically Asn or Gln, which participates in the formation of the oxyanion hole that is critical for catalysis. In UfSP1, the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr41 makes a hydrogen bond to a water molecule (W1221), which in turn makes a hydrogen bond to the amide backbone of Cys53. This tyrosine is conserved throughout UfSP1 and UfSP2. Therefore, the residues involved in catalysis are Cys53, His177, Asp175, and Tyr41, and the catalytic mechanism of UfSP1 appears to be parallel to that of the papain family of cysteine proteases. This was somewhat surprising, since the catalytic triad of canonical cysteine proteases is such that cysteine is located at the N terminus of an α-helix, and histidine and aspartate are at the end of two adjacent β-strands that form the central β-sheet. In papain, the residues corresponding to the triad are Cys25, Asn175, and His159, whereas Gln19 participates in forming the oxyanion hole. In UfSP1, the position of canonical histidine is occupied by Gln154, and this is histidine in all known UfSP2 and alanine in Drosophila UfSP1. This suggests that it is unlikely that Gln154 participates in catalysis. In the current structure, the electron density in this region (residues 149-154) is not as well defined but enough to trace the chain, and the side chain of Gln154 is facing away from the active site cysteine and histidine. In order to validate our structural analysis, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to alter the key residues in UfSP1 predicted to participate in catalysis. Alanine mutants were made for Tyr41, Gln154, Asp175, His177, and Trp98 in addition to a serine mutant of Cys53. In vitro enzymatic activity was assessed by using GST-Ufm1-HA as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 3C, C53S, H177A, D175A, and Y41A mutants show no activity, whereas Q154A exhibits activity, therefore confirming the conclusions from the structural data. Since the residues at the active site are highly conserved, UfSP2 is expected to have the same active site and is expected to operate via the same mechanism. It is striking to note that the active sites of Atg4B (29Sugawara K. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40058-40065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Kumanomidou T. Mizushima T. Komatsu M. Suzuki A. Tanida I. Sou U.S. Ueno T. Kominami E. Tanaka K.

Cell. 2007; 25: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have similar arrangements of the active site residues; namely, the catalytic histidine and the aspartate residues are from “Asp-Pro-His,” which is located at the tip of a β-strand. The oxyanion position is filled by a glutamine (Gln10) in the case of Atg4B and a tyrosine (Tyr54) in M48USP. Interaction of UfSP1 with Ufm1—In order to examine Ufm1 binding to UfSP1, we first analyzed the solution structure of mouse Ufm1 by NMR. As reported previously (17Sasakawa H. Sakata E. Yamaguchi Y. Komatsu M. Tatsumi K. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), most of the backbone resonances of Ufm1 could be assigned except for the two residues at the N terminus, residues 9-18, which correspond to the flexible loop, and the two residues at the C terminus. Second, the interaction between UfSP1 and Ufm1 was characterized by a chemical shift change"
https://openalex.org/W2088497663,"How the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) discriminates between molecularly related peptide/Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) ligands and converts this information into different possible signaling outcomes is still not understood. One current model proposes that strong pMHC ligands, but not weak ones, induce a conformational change in the TCR. Evidence supporting this comes from a pull-down assay that detects ligand-induced binding of the TCR to the N-terminal SH3 domain of the adapter protein Nck, and also from studies with a neoepitope-specific antibody. Both methods rely on the exposure of a polyproline sequence in the CD3epsilon subunit of the TCR, and neither indicates whether the conformational change is transmitted to other CD3 subunits. Using a protease-sensitivity assay, we now show that the cytoplasmic tails of CD3epsilon and CD3zeta subunits become fully protected from degradation upon TCR triggering. These results suggest that the TCR conformational change is transmitted to the tails of CD3epsilon and CD3zeta, and perhaps all CD3 subunits. Furthermore, the resistance to protease digestion suggests that CD3 cytoplasmic tails adopt a compact structure in the triggered TCR. These results are consistent with a model in which transduction of the conformational change induced upon TCR triggering promotes condensation and shielding of the CD3 cytoplasmic tails."
https://openalex.org/W2024240709,"The ability to analyze and classify three-dimensional (3D) biological morphology has lagged behind the analysis of other biological data types such as gene sequences. Here, we introduce the techniques of data mining to the study of 3D biological shapes to bring the analyses of phenomes closer to the efficiency of studying genomes. We compiled five training sets of highly variable morphologies of mammalian teeth from the MorphoBrowser database. Samples were labeled either by dietary class or by conventional dental types (e.g. carnassial, selenodont). We automatically extracted a multitude of topological attributes using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-like procedures that were then used in several combinations of feature selection schemes and probabilistic classification models to build and optimize classifiers for predicting the labels of the training sets. In terms of classification accuracy, computational time and size of the feature sets used, non-repeated best-first search combined with 1-nearest neighbor classifier was the best approach. However, several other classification models combined with the same searching scheme proved practical. The current study represents a first step in the automatic analysis of 3D phenotypes, which will be increasingly valuable with the future increase in 3D morphology and phenomics databases."

Recently, the herpesvirus protein UL49.5 (known as glycoprotein gN interacting with the glycoprotein gM), which can be detected at the cell surface of virus-infected cells as well as in the virion membrane (22Liang X. Chow B. Raggo C. Babiuk L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1448-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wu S.X. Zhu X.P. Letchworth G.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3029-3036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was identified to mediate PLC inhibition (24Koppers-Lalic D. Reits E.A.D. Ressing M.E. Lipinska A.D. Abele R. Koch J. Rezende M.M.

Although conserved among α-, β-, and γ-herpesviruses, only the UL49.5 homologs of the genus varicellovirus are inhibitory (25Barnett B.C. Dolan A. Telford E.A. Davison A.J. McGeoch D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2167-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the late protein gM is not directly involved in PLC inhibition but recruits the early protein UL49.5 to the virion membrane during virus assembly in the late stage of the infection (26Lipinska A.D. Koppers-Lalic D. Rychlowski M. Admiraal P. Rijsewijk F.A. Bienkowska-Szewczyk K. Wiertz E.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5822-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). UL49.5 of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), which efficiently inhibits bovine as well as human TAP (24Koppers-Lalic D. Reits E.A.D. Ressing M.E. Lipinska A.D. Abele R. Koch J. Rezende M.M. Admiraal P. van Leeuwen D. Bienkowska-Szewczyk K. Mettenleiter T.C. Rijsewijk F.A. Tampé R. Neefjes J.J. Wiertz E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chow B. Li Y. Raggo C. Yoo D. Attah-Poku S. Babiuk L.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3863-3867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, UL49.5 inhibits peptide transport and is involved in proteasomal degradation of components of the PLC in a process that requires the cytosolic tail of UL49.5 (24Koppers-Lalic D. Reits E.A.D. Ressing M.E. Lipinska A.D. Abele R. Koch J. Rezende M.M. Admiraal P. van Leeuwen D. Bienkowska-Szewczyk K. Mettenleiter T.C. Rijsewijk F.A. Tampé R. Neefjes J.J. Wiertz E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.,. 2005; 102: 5144-5149Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Within the current study, we identified distinct domains and critical elements of UL49.5, whose concerted action across the ER membrane is essential for proteasomal degradation of the multi-subunit PLC. Cloning of UL49.5 Constructs—The full-length BHV-1 UL49.5 DNA with a codon usage optimized to a lower GC content was obtained by de novo gene synthesis (Genscript). This construct was used as a template for PCR amplification of the UL49.5 variants. PCR was performed under standard conditions using Phusion DNA polymerase. The following reverse primers were used (restriction sites for EcoRI and BamHI are underlined): 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAACCTCTACCTCTACTC-3′ (UL49.5); 5′-CGCGGATCCTCACAGACGGAAGCACAGAC-3′ (UL49.5Δtail); always in combination with the forward primer 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGATGCCAAGGTCC-3′. For the C-terminal truncations of the UL49.5 protein, the following reverse primers were used: 5′-CGCGGATCCTCATCTACCTCTACTCTCC-3′ (UL49.5ΔC1); 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAACCTCTACTCTCCTTC-3′ (UL49.5ΔC2); 5′-CGCGGATCCTCATCTACT CTCCTTCTTGTTGG-3′ (UL49.5ΔC3); 5′-CGCGGATCCTCACTTCTTGTTGGGGCCAGAG-3′ (UL49.5ΔC6); 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGGGG CCAGAGGCGCCCATCA-3′ (UL49.5ΔC9); and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGGCGCCCATCAGACGGAAGC-3′ (UL49.5ΔC12). For the constructs, lacking N-terminal amino acids primers were used, which contained the signal sequence of UL49.5. The following forward primers were used for the amplification: 5′-CGGAATTCATGCCAAGGTCCCCTCTGATCGTGGCTGTAGTGGCCGCTGCCCTGTTCGCTATCGTCCGTGGCAGGGACATGCGCAGAGAGGGTGCTATG-3′ (UL49.5ΔN5); 5′-CGGAATTCATGCCAAGGTCCCCTCTGATCGTGGCTGTAGTGGCCGCTGCCCTGTTCGCTATCGTCCGTGGCAGGGACGCTATGGACTTCTGGAGC-3′ (UL49.5ΔN10); 5′-CGGAATTCATGCCAAGGTCCCCTCTGATCGTGGCTGTAGTGGCCGCTGCCCTGTTCGCTATCGTCCGTGGCAGGGACAGCGCTGGATGCTACGCTC-3′ (UL49.5ΔN15); 5′-CGGAATTCATGCCAAGGTCCCCTCTGATCGTGGCTGTAGTGGCCGCTGCCCTGTTCGCTATCGTCCGTGGCAGGGACGCTCGTGGCGTGCCTCTG-3′ (UL49.5ΔN20); 5′-CGGAATTCATGCCAAGGTCCCCTCTGATCGTGGCTGTAGTGGCCGCTGCCCTGTTCGCTATCGTCCGTGGCAGGGACCTGAGCGAGCCGCCCCAG-3′ (UL49.5ΔN25). PCR-generated products were inserted into pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) via EcoRI and BamHI upstream of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element and enhanced GFP. The cysteine point mutations were introduced into wild type UL49.5 by site-directed mutagenesis. The following sense oligonucleotides were used (exchanged nucleotides are underlined): 5′-ACTTCTGGAGCGCTGGAGCCTACGCTGTG-3′ (C21A) and 5′-ACGCTTACGGTCTGGCCTTCCGTCTGATGG-3′ (C57A). To generate C-terminal EGFP fusion proteins, UL49.5 was amplified using the same forward primer as for the pIRES2-EGFP constructs (see above). For UL49.5 and UL49.5Δtail, the reverse primers 5′-CGCGGATCCGCACCTCTACCTCTACTC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCGCCAGACGGAA-3′ were used, respectively (BamHI restriction sites are underlined). PCR products were inserted into the pEGFP-N1 vector via EcoRI and BamHI. The identity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Cloning of BiFC Constructs—The yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was split into two fragments as described previously: an N-terminal fragment (YN) consisting of amino acids 1-154, and a C-terminal fragment (YC) comprising residues 155-238 (28Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 29Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). BiFC expression vectors were kindly provided by Tom Kerppola (University of Michigan Medical School). The halves of YFP were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1. The TAP1 gene was fused C-terminally to the YC fragment connected by a flexible (GGSGGSGS) linker. The UL49.5 gene was fused to the N terminus of the YN fragment connected by a (GSGGSGGS) linker. The Shrew-1 gene was fused to the YN fragment. This construct was kindly provided by Anna Starzinski-Powitz (University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany) (30Schreiner A. Ruonala M. Jakob V. Suthaus J. Boles E. Wouters F. Starzinski-Powitz A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1272-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The identity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant Baculoviruses—Full-length UL49.5 was amplified using the following primers (restriction sites are underlined): Fw, 5′-CCGGGATCCATGCCAAGGTCCCCTCTG-3′, and Rv, 5′-CGCAAGCTTTCAACCTCTACCT CTACTC-3′, and subsequently cloned into the expression vector pFASTBac™ Dual (Invitrogen) via BamHI and HindIII. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac® baculovirus expression system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The identity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—For immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, the TAP1 (monoclonal antibody 148.3) and TAP2 (monoclonal antibody 435.3) (31Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and GFP-specific (Dianova) antibodies were used. For detection of UL49.5, two polyclonal rabbit sera were used recognizing N-terminal (H11) and C-terminal epitopes (H19) of UL49.5, respectively (26Lipinska A.D. Koppers-Lalic D. Rychlowski M. Admiraal P. Rijsewijk F.A. Bienkowska-Szewczyk K. Wiertz E.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5822-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The phycoerythrin (PE)-coupled anti-human HLA-ABC (W6/32) and the mouse IgG2a isotype control were purchased from eBioscience. The monoclonal antibody directed against human β-actin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Lines and Transfections—Insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)) were grown in Sf900II medium (Invitrogen) following standard procedures. Baculovirus infection and microsome preparation were performed as described (31Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For co-infections a multiplicity of infection of 3 for the TAP constructs and for the UL49.5 variants were used. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cells were transfected with the expression vectors indicated in each experiment (1 μg of total plasmid DNA per 4 × 105 cells) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Living or fixed cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection. For stimulation, the cells were treated with 500 units/ml γ-interferon (Sigma) 24 h after transfection for 48 h. To analyze the effect of a proteasomal inhibitor, the cells were treated with 20 μm Cbz-L3 (MG132; Sigma) 48 h after transfection for 24 h. Retroviral Transduction—The human melanoma cell line Mel JuSo (MJS) TAP1-GFP was transduced with recombinant retrovirus encoding BHV-1 UL49.5 to generate the MJS TAP1-GFP UL49.5 cell line (24Koppers-Lalic D. Reits E.A.D. Ressing M.E. Lipinska A.D. Abele R. Koch J. Rezende M.M. Admiraal P. van Leeuwen D. Bienkowska-Szewczyk K. Mettenleiter T.C. Rijsewijk F.A. Tampé R. Neefjes J.J. Wiertz E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.,. 2005; 102: 5144-5149Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal microscopy of living or fixed cells was performed using an LSM 510 instrument (Carl Zeiss Jena). For immunostaining, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the cells were first incubated with the unlabeled anti-calnexin antibody (clone AF18, Dianova) and subsequently with the Cy3-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Dianova). GFP was excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence emission was measured with a band pass filter (505-530 nm). Cy3 fluorescence was analyzed at an excitation of 543 nm and emission with a long pass filter (560 nm). YFP in living cells was excited at 514 nm, and emission was measured with a band pass filter at 530-600 nm. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (0.125 μg/ml) for 1 h and washed with PBS afterward. Fluorescence was analyzed at an excitation of 405 nm and emission with a band pass filter at 420-480 nm. Flow Cytometry—MHC I surface expression was analyzed using the PE-coupled antibody W6/32, which recognizes peptide-loaded MHC I molecules. For one experiment 2 × 106 cells were trypsinized, washed with 1 ml of FACS buffer (2% fetal bovine serum in PBS), and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. For blocking of unspecific binding sites, the cells were incubated with 100 μl of FACS buffer containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 10 min on ice. After two washing steps with FACS buffer, the corresponding antibody (1:5 in FACS buffer) was added to the cells and incubated for 15 min on ice, in the dark. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and finally resuspended in 500 μl. The cells were then analyzed using a FACSAria instrument (Becton Dickinson). For each experiment 30,000 cells were evaluated. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Microsomes prepared from Sf9 cells (750 μg of total protein) were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) digitonin (Calbiochem), pH 7.5) for 60 min on ice. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Solubilized components of the peptide-loading complex were co-immunoprecipitated on Dynabeads® (M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG; Dynal Biotech), which were loaded with the TAP2-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 435.3 prior to incubation with solubilized protein. As negative control, Dynabeads® loaded with a Myc-specific antibody were used. Moreover, TAPL was immunoprecipitated using Dynabeads® (M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG) loaded with a TAPL-specific antibody (34Wolters J.C. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As control, beads loaded with a GFP-specific antibody were used. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) digitonin; pH 7.5). The proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, pH 8.0) for 5 min at 65 °C. After transfer of the supernatant into a fresh tube, dithiothreitol (300 mm) was added; protein complexes were denatured for 20 min at 65 °C and separated by SDS-PAGE (12%). After electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the blots were stained with the antibodies indicated, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and protein amounts were quantified after luminescence imaging (Lumi-Imager F1; Roche Applied Science). Transport Assay—Microsomes (150 μg of total protein) were resuspended in 50 μl of AP buffer (5 mm MgCl2 in PBS, pH 7.0) in the presence of 3 mm ATP. The transport reaction (50 μl) was started by adding 1 μm RRYQNSTΦL(Φ, fluoresce-in-labeled cysteine) peptide for 3 min at 32 °C and terminated with stop buffer (10 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.0) on ice. After centrifugation, the membranes were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) for 30 min on ice. N-core glycosylated, therefore transported, peptides were recovered with concanavalin A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer, glycosylated peptides were eluted with methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (200 mm) and quantified with a fluorescence plate reader (λex/em = 485/520 nm; Polarstar Galaxy, BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). Background transport activity was measured in the presence of apyrase (1 unit). All of the measurements were performed in triplicate. To measure TAP-dependent peptide transport in HeLa cells, the cells were transiently transfected using the pIRES-EGFP-UL49.5 constructs. After 48 h, EGFP-positive cells (1 × 106) were FACS-sorted and semi-permeabilized with 0.05% saponin (Sigma) for 1 min at 25 °C in 50 μl of AP buffer. After washing, the cells were resuspended in a final volume of 100 μl of AP buffer containing ATP (10 mm). The transport reaction was initiated by adding 1 μm fluorescent peptide RRYQNSTΦL for 3 min at 32 °C and terminated with stop buffer on ice. After centrifugation, the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer for 60 min on ice, and N-core glycosylated peptides were purified and quantified as described above. TAP1 and TAP2 Are the Prime Target of UL49.5—The association of UL49.5 with the PLC was demonstrated in a previous study (24Koppers-Lalic D. Reits E.A.D. Ressing M.E. Lipinska A.D. Abele R. Koch J. Rezende M.M. Admiraal P. van Leeuwen D. Bienkowska-Szewczyk K. Mettenleiter T.C. Rijsewijk F.A. Tampé R. Neefjes J.J. Wiertz E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.,. 2005; 102: 5144-5149Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); however, the precise interaction partners have not been identified. To investigate the docking sites and inhibition mechanism, UL49.5 of BHV-1 was expressed in insect cells together with TAP1 and TAP2. Because of the lack of an adaptive immune system, insect cells provide several advantages for studying the interaction and function of modulators and individual subunits of the PLC (31Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 35Lauvau G. Gubler B. Cohen H. Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. van Endert P.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, UL49.5 was co-immunoprecipitated with TAP1 and TAP2 using a TAP2-specific antibody. To confirm the specificity of these interactions, UL49.5 was co-expressed together with TAPL, which shares ∼40% amino acid sequence identity with TAP1 and TAP2, respectively. However, UL49.5 could not be co-immunoprecipitated with TAPL. Thus, UL49.5 interacts specifically with the TAP complex. As displayed in Fig. 1C, UL49.5 inhibits peptide translocation into the ER lumen by TAP even in the absence of all other subunits of the PLC. Co-immunoprecipitation studies with singly expressed TAP subunits revealed independent binding sites of UL49.5 at TAP1 and TAP2 (Fig. 1D). Notably, UL49.5 also induces targeted degradation of the TAP complex in insect cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Based on these data, we demonstrate for the first time that TAP is the prime target of UL49.5, which can bind independently to each TAP subunit. Importantly, other components of the PLC including tapasin, ERp57, calreticulin, and MHC I molecules are dispensable for UL49.5-mediated inhibition of TAP. Monomeric UL49.5 Is the Active Unit for TAP Inhibition—In BHV-1-infected cells (26Lipinska A.D. Koppers-Lalic D. Rychlowski M. Admiraal P. Rijsewijk F.A. Bienkowska-Szewczyk K. Wiertz E.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5822-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as well as after heterologous expression in insect cells (Fig. 2A), UL49.5 forms disulfide-linked homodimers. It comprises two cysteines that are highly conserved among the varicellovirus family, Cys21 in the ER lumen and Cys57 at the cytosolic face of the transmembrane helix (Fig. 1A). To investigate which cysteine is involved in dimer formation and essential for function, we examined single and double cysteine mutants. The oligomeric state of UL49.5 was monitored by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). Dimer assembly was abolished in the C21A mutant as well as in the double mutant C21A/C57A, demonstrating that Cys21 is responsible for disulfide-mediated dimerization. The mutant C57A did not affect dimerization. Noteworthy, the monomerdimer ratio differs in the presence and absence of N-ethylmaleimide. This was expected as it reflects the artificial dimer formation during sample preparation (oxidation). To investigate whether dimerization is a prerequisite for UL49.5 function, we analyzed the ability of cysteine mutants to bind and to inhibit the TAP complex. We found that all cysteine mutants bind to the TAP complex (Fig. 2B), inhibit TAP-dependent peptide translocation into the ER lumen (Fig. 2C), and cause down-regulation of MHC I surface expression in human cells (Fig. 2D). Noteworthy, the expression level of all cysteine mutants is comparable with wild type UL49.5. In addition, we found in stably transduced human cells that dimeric as well as monomeric UL49.5 bind to the TAP complex (supplemental Fig. S2). Collectively, these data provide evidence that the monomer is the active unit for TAP inhibition. The Extramembrane Domains of UL49.5 Are Dispensable for TAP Interaction—To analyze the interaction of UL49.5 with the PLC, we established a BiFC assay. This method makes use of two nonfluorescent fragments (YC and YN) of the YFP, which have no intrinsic affinity for each other and complement a fluorophor only after interaction of the two fusion partners (28Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 29Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In this study, the YC fragment was fused to the N terminus of TAP1 and the YN fragment to the C terminus of UL49.5, separated by a flexible glycine-serine linker. At first, the expression and subcellular localization of the fusion constructs were analyzed on the basis of fusions with EGFP in transiently transfected human cells. All UL49.5 and TAP1 variants were correctly targeted to the ER, as reflected by a perinuclear staining, which colocalized with that of the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained from transient or stable expression in different cell lines (data not shown). In the BiFC assays, co-transfection of YC-TAP1 and UL49.5-YN resulted in a fluorescent signal in a perinuclear compartment, corresponding to the ER (Fig. 3B). A similar fluorescence distribution was detected in cells co-transfected with YC-TAP1 and UL49.5Δtail-YN. Various combinations of split fusions of b-Jun, b-Fos, or Shrew-1, the latter representing a type I membrane protein similar to UL49.5, which was shown to interact with CD147 (30Schreiner A.

The trial was conducted between June 2002 and February 2005, including 116 adults (median age 27 years) and 107 children (median age 38 months) with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Subjects were randomized into 4 groups to receive CPG–DDS alone or plus 4, 2 or 1 mg/kg of artesunate once daily for 3 days. Assessments took place on Days 0−3 in hospital and follow-up on Days 7 and 14 as out-patients. Efficacy was evaluated in the Day 3 per-protocol (PP) population using mean time to reduce baseline parasitemia by 90% (PC90). A number of secondary outcomes were also included. Appropriate artesunate dose was determined using a pre-defined decision matrix based on primary and secondary outcomes. Treatment emergent adverse events were recorded from clinical assessments and blood parameters. Safety was evaluated in the intent to treat (ITT) population. Results In the Day 3 PP population for the adult group (N = 85), mean time to PC90 was 19.1 h in the CPG−DDS group, significantly longer than for the +artesunate 1 mg/kg (12.5 h; treatment difference −6.6 h [95%CI −11.8, −1.5]), 2 mg/kg (10.7 h; −8.4 h [95%CI −13.6, −3.2]) and 4 mg/kg (10.3 h; −8.7 h [95%CI −14.1, −3.2]) groups. For children in the Day 3 PP population (N = 92), mean time to PC90 was 21.1 h in the CPG−DDS group, similar to the +artesunate 1 mg/kg group (17.7 h; −3.3 h [95%CI −8.6, 2.0]), though the +artesunate 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg groups had significantly shorter mean times to PC90 versus CPG−DDS; 14.4 h (treatment difference −6.4 h [95%CI −11.7, −1.0]) and 12.8 h (−7.4 h [95%CI −12.9, −1.8]), respectively. An analysis of mean time to PC90 for the Day 14 PP and ITT populations was consistent with the primary analysis. Treatment emergent, drug-related adverse events were experienced in 35.3% (41/116) of adults and 70.1% (75/107) of children; mostly hematological and gastroenterological. The nature and incidence of adverse events was similar between the groups. No dose-related changes in laboratory parameters were observed. Nine serious adverse events due to any cause occurred in five subjects including two cases of hemolysis believed to be associated with drug treatment (one adult, one child). One adult died of anaphylactic shock, not associated with investigational therapy. Conclusions CPG–DDS plus artesunate demonstrated advantages over CPG–DDS alone for the primary efficacy endpoint (mean time to PC90) except in children for the 1 mg/kg artesunate dose. Based on a pre-defined decision matrix, the primary endpoint in the child group supported an artesunate dose of 4 mg/kg. Secondary endpoints also supported a 4 mg/kg artesunate dose to take forward into the remainder of the development program. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00519467"
https://openalex.org/W2161852956,"In yeast, osmotic upshock causes a release of vacuolar Ca(2+) through the mechanosensitive transient receptor potential channel, Yvc1. We screened the collection of 4810 yeast gene deletants twice for alterations in this response in an attempt to find elements that regulate the amount of vacuolar Ca(2+) or the Yvc1 channel. Severe overresponders and underresponders to upshock were further scrutinized for their calcium content with (45)Ca and their Yvc1 electrophysiological activities under patch-clamp. The severe underresponders have lower calcium content but no change in Yvc1 activity. The strong overresponders, most of which are deleted of genes involved in cell wall metabolism, have higher calcium content. Wall mutations are known to up-regulate Ca(2+)-calcineurin-dependent genes. It appears that stress on the cell wall induces Ca(2+) accumulation, adaptively anticipating the need in defense or repair against future stress, including osmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1975176491,"The ectopic expression of the Notch receptor ligand delta-like 1 on stromal cells allows the induction of T cells from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, these in vitro-generated T cells are not transplantable because they are too immature to mount an immune response in an immunocompromised animal. We efficiently generated a subset of T cells called invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells from ESCs derived from peripheral iNKT cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer (ntESCs). These iNKT cells matured autonomously in vivo and exhibited an adjuvant effect accompanying the production of interferon-gamma in an antigen-specific manner. This adjuvant effect culminated in the inhibition of inoculated tumor cell growth. Our results indicate that ntESC-derived iNKT cells are transplantable lymphocytes that will be beneficial for the induction of immune tolerance and the treatment of autoimmune diseases, tumors, and infections."
https://openalex.org/W2121069433,"Although the termination of transcription and 3′ RNA processing of the eukaryotic mRNA has been linked to a polyadenylation signal and a transcript cleavage process, much less is known about the termination or processing of nonpolyadenylated RNA polymerase II transcripts. An efficiently expressed plasmid-based expression system was used to study the termination and processing of Schizosaccharomyces pombe U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) transcripts in vivo. The termination assay was linked to cell transformation, and restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to determine levels of plasmid-derived U3 snoRNA. Mutation analyses in vivo indicate that the maturation of the 3′ end is not directly dependent on an external cis-acting sequence or structure; rather, it is dependent on a transcript cleavage that can occur hundreds or even thousands of nucleotides downstream of the mature U3 snoRNA sequence. Similarly, termination is dependent on the same transcript cleavage that is localized in a hairpin structure that normally follows the 3′ end of the U3 snoRNA but that also can be moved hundreds or thousands of nucleotides downstream. Both processes, however, can be induced simultaneously and equally efficiently with a single unrelated Pac1 endonuclease-labile structure. The results support a “reversed torpedoes” model in which a single cleavage allows exonucleases and/or other protein factors access to the transcript leading to transcription termination in one direction and RNA maturation in the other direction.

In eukaryotic cells, the diversity in their DNA-dependent RNA polymerases appears also to be reflected in the mechanisms of transcription termination that each polymerase utilizes. Although studied most intensely, the mechanism(s) of Pol 2The abbreviations used are: Pol, polymerase; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; bp, base pair(s); RT, reverse transcription; contig, group of overlapping clones. II transcript termination is probably the least understood. In the case of pre-mRNA transcripts, 3′ end processing and termination are normally coupled; the same RNA signals that direct 3′ end processing also promote termination downstream of the processing site. At least two alternative models, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, have been proposed (1Buratowski S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 3: 257-261Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The first, often referred to as the “anti-terminator” model, suggests that polyadenylation triggers a change in polymerase-associated factors that leads to a less processive RNA polymerase; an alternate model suggests that the transcribing RNA polymerase is “torpedoed,” being attacked by an exonuclease that gains access at its free end when the pre-mRNA is cut at the polyadenylation site. In addition to mRNA, Pol II is responsible for the synthesis of many noncoding RNAs, including small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (snRNA and snoRNA). Many of these are encoded by discreet transcriptional units, but the 3′ ends are not polyadenylated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the termination of nonpolyadenylated transcripts has been reported to require two RNA-binding proteins, Nrd1 and Nab3, which appear to bind specifically to two common RNA sequence motifs, GUA[AG] and UCUU (2Carroll K.L. Pradhan D.A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 6241-6252Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Steinmetz E.J. Ng S.B. Cloute J.P. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 2688-2696Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both genetic and physical data (4Carroll K.L. Ghirlando R. Ames J.M. Corden J.L. RNA. 2007; 3: 361-373Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) suggest that a heteromeric complex of these RNA-binding proteins recognizes sequences in the nascent snoRNA transcripts and directs Pol II to terminate, perhaps somewhat reminiscent of Pol I termination (5Reeder R.H. Lang W.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 12: 473-477Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the later case, however, the transcription termination factor (6Lang W.H. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 1: 649-658Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) actually has been shown to bind to repeated DNA sequence elements and postulated to promote a pause in transcription (7Reeder R.H. Guevara P. Roan J.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 7369-7376Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Numerous other protein factors also have been implicated in nonpolyadenylated Pol II termination including a helicase (Sen1) and subunits of the APT complex (Pti1, Ref2, Ssu72, and Swd2), which associate with mRNA cleavage/polyadenylation factor Pta1 (8Steinmetz E.J.

Zhelkovsky A. Moore C. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 5: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar) recently suggested that Pol II may choose between distinct termination mechanisms. In a further study of U3 snoRNA function in pre-rRNA maturation, we have isolated and examined the expression of the U3 snoRNA genes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This fission yeast contains two U3 snoRNA encoding genes that are almost equally expressed (15Selinger D.A. Porter G.L. Brennwald P.J. Wise J.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 2: 297-308Google Scholar). In the course of our analyses we used targeted mutagenesis to assess both upstream and downstream sequence requirements. Finding them to be shorter than previously reported in S. cerevisiae, we undertook a more detailed analysis, including an examination of elements critical to 3′ end processing and the termination of transcription. Surprisingly, as observed with polyadenylated transcripts, in S. pombe 3′ end processing and transcript termination are coupled and dependent on transcript cleavage, which simultaneously initiates both processes. Strains and Vectors—Escherichia coli strain C490 (recA–, rk–, mk–, thr–, leu–, met–) was used as a host for pTZ19R (16Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and pFL20 (17Losson R. Lacroute F. Cell. 1983; 32: 371-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) plasmid recombinants. S. pombe (h–, leu1-32, ura4-D18) cells were used as a host to express the pFL20 yeast shuttle vector recombinants. Bacterial clones were grown at 37 °C in LB-ampicillin broth or LB-ampicillin agar, and yeast transformants were grown with aeration under selective conditions in minimal medium containing 0.64% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% dextrose, 80 μg/ml leucine, 0.36 mg/ml potassium acetate, and 0.5 mg/ml potassium dihydrogen phosphate (18Gutz H. Heslot H. Leupoid U. Loprieno N. Handbook of Genetics. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1974: 395-446Google Scholar, 19Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 22: 6485-6489Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Growth rates were determined using the absorbancy of cultures at 550 nm. Preparation and Expression of Mutant U3 snoRNA Genes—S. pombe genomic and plasmid DNA were extracted from logarithmically growing cells essentially as described by Hoffman and Winston (20Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 23: 267-272Crossref Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Cultures (10 ml) with absorbancies of 0.4–0.6 at 550 nm were harvested by centrifugation, washed with water, and resuspended in 200 μl of breaking buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 200 μl of phenol:chlorophorm:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and 0.3 g of acid-washed glass beads. The cells were disrupted by vortex for 3 min, and after centrifugation and ethanol precipitation, the aqueous phase was treated with RNase A (25 ng/μl) for 30 min. Ammonium acetate (120 mm) was added, and the DNA was again precipitated with ethanol. The U3B snoRNA gene region was prepared by PCR amplification using primers complementary to spacer sequences preceding and following adjacent open reading frames as described in Fig. 1. The 4.7-kilobase pair amplified fragment was cloned in pTZ19R after digestion with HindIII restriction endonuclease and the recombinant DNA (pTZ19U3B) was used as a DNA template for further manipulations. After double digestion with BstUI and BamHI, the U3B gene-containing fragment was subcloned into a multicopy yeast shuttle vector, pFL20, to form a recombinant (pFL20U3B), which contained the U3B gene coding sequence together with a 1868-base pair (bp) upstream region and a 2133-bp downstream region. Shortened gene segments were prepared using PCR amplification and appropriate complementary primers with BamHI adapter sequences at their ends when required. These included pFL20U3B_3.3, which contained 927 bps upstream and 2133 bps downstream as well as pFL20U3B_0.5, which contained only 69 bps upstream and 198 bp downstream. Plasmid DNA preparations for characterization or yeast transformation were based on the methods of Birnboim and Doly (21Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1513-1523Crossref Scopus (9908) Google Scholar). For more detailed sequence analyses, base substitutions were introduced using a two-step PCR-based strategy as described previously (22Nabavi S. Nazar R.N. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 2: 346-348Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Again, when appropriate, primers with BamHI adapter sequences at their ends were used to prepare the final fragments; after digestion with BamHI endonuclease, the mutant gene sequences were cloned directly into the pFL20 yeast shuttle vector using its BamHI site. In other instances, the vector was digested with PvuII endonuclease or double digested with BamHI and PvuII and fragments with blunt or mixed ends were ligated, as required. All of the mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (CBS-DNA Facility, University of Guelph), and the pFL20 recombinants were used to transform S. pombe cells by the method of Okazaki et al. (19Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 22: 6485-6489Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To ensure a reproducible result, at least three transformants were chosen for each mutant sequence. Preparation and Analysis of Cellular U3 snoRNAs and Precursors—To assay the total cellular U3 snoRNA or precursor RNA, logarithmically growing cells were disrupted by vortex with an equal volume of glass beads (23Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 140-142Google Scholar), and cellular RNA was prepared using the protocol of Steele and coworkers (24Steele W.J. Okamura N. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1742-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amounts of U3 snoRNA or pre-snoRNA were determined by RT-PCR after treatment with 0.1 unit/μl of RNase-free DNase (25Kienzle N. Young D. Zehntner S. Bushell G. Sculley T.B. BioTechniques. 1996; 4: 612-616Google Scholar). The RT reactions (20 μl) were performed using 1–2 μg of DNase-treated RNA, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 60 pmol of U3 snoRNA-specific (5′-ACACGTCAGAAAACACC-3′) or precursor-specific (5′-ATGCACATCAAGTTATAAC-3′) primer, and 40 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fermentas Inc., Hanover, MD), incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. For PCRs (50 μl) 0.1–10% of the RT reaction product was used with 0.2 mm dNTPs, 30 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase for 30 cycles. Individual U3 snoRNA components were assayed using restriction fragment length polymorphism. Whole cell nucleic acid was extracted from logarithmically growing cultures with sodium dodecyl sulfate/phenol as previously described (24Steele W.J. Okamura N. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1742-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the U3 snoRNA was purified by fractionation on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and elution by homogenization in SDS buffer after staining with methylene blue (26Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 7: 4562-4567Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). U3 cDNA was prepared from the gel-purified RNA by RT-PCR (27Sambrook J. Russell W.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 8.51-8.58Google Scholar) using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the S. pombe U3 snoRNAs (5′-ATCGACGATACTCCATAG-3′ and 5′-ACACGTCAGAAAACACC-3′), respectively, as described above. [α-32P]dCTP (2–5 μCi) was added to the PCR to label the DNA products. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the labeled copy DNA was precipitated with ethanol and finally digested with MboI endonuclease (Invitrogen); fragments were fractionated on 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. For quantitative analyses, the images were captured using a Umax Astra 600P scanner (Umax Technologies, CA) and quantified using Molecular Analyst PC software (Bio-Rad). Ligation-mediated Terminal Analyses—U3 snoRNA 3′ ends were determined by a three step ligation-mediated PCR amplification protocol essentially as described by Hitchcock et al. (28Hitchcock R.A. Zeiner G.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 1: 73-78Google Scholar). A 5′ end phosphorylated (pCAGGAAACAGCUAUGAC) RNA adapter oligonucleotide (300 pmol) was first ligated to the 3′-hydroxyl groups total cellular RNA (1 μg) using 10 units of T4 RNA ligase (Fermentas, Inc.) in 15 μl of ligation buffer. The ligated RNA was heat-inactivated (75 °C, 10 min) and diluted in reverse transcriptase reaction mix containing 60 pmol of complementary primer. The solution was denatured at 85 °C for 5 min, cooled to 42 °C, and incubated with 40 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fermentas Inc.) for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting cDNA solution was diluted to 20 μl, and a 2-μl aliquot was used for PCR amplification, with 30 pmol of complementary primer, 30 pmol of U3 snoRNA-specific primer (5′-ATCGACGATACTCCATAG-3′), and 2.5 units Taq DNA polymerase in 50 μl of buffer (500 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 containing 1% Triton X-100). A 5-μl aliquot of the PCR products was characterized by fractionation on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel. The remainder was phenol:chloroform-purified, ethanol-precipitated, and cloned in the pTZ19R vector for subsequent DNA sequence analyses. Pac1 Ribonuclease Digestion Analyses—RNA structures for digestion analyses were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (29Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 18: 7035-7056Crossref Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, 30Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 24: 15206-15212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Template sequences forming hairpin structures in the downstream regions of the S. pombe gene encoding the U3B snoRNA and rDNA were prepared by PCR amplification and cloned in both the normal and inverse orientation using pTZ19R (31Hitchen J. Ivakine E. Melekhovets Y.F. Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 4: 481-490Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were performed with 0.4–2 μg of a DNA template in the presence of 2 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP and 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase using N4 buffer (20 mm MgCl2, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm spermidine, 0.01% Triton X-100) in a final volume of 100 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of cold salted ethanol. The transcripts were then purified on a 6% or 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and labeled at the 5′ end using bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (32Chaconas G. van de Sande J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 1: 75-85Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar), after dephosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase (27Sambrook J. Russell W.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 8.51-8.58Google Scholar). The phosphatase was heat-inactivated for 10 min at 75 °C in presence of 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) before the RNAs were labeled, and the labeled RNAs were again purified on a 6 or 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Pac1 RNase was prepared, and cleavage reactions were performed essentially as described by Rotondo and Frendewey (33Rotondo G. Frendewey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2377-2386Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The in vitro synthesized and labeled RNAs were digested with appropriate amounts of the Pac1 RNase for 60 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The reactions were stopped with the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (formamide containing 0.05% xylene cyanol and 0.05% bromo-phenol blue), the solution was heated for 2 min at 90 °C (5 min at 65 °C), and 5-μl aliquots were applied directly to a 6 or 8% (29:1; acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 m urea. RNA partially digested with T1 ribonuclease or hydrolyzed with base (34Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 15: 3071-3078Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also was applied as length markers; after fractionation, the fragments were detected by autoradiography. An efficiently expressed plasmid associated gene system was used to study the expression and maturation of U3 snoRNA encoded by the S. pombe snU32 locus (chromosome 2, contig pJ5566, S. pombe gene data base). As summarized in Fig. 1, the U3B snoRNA encoding region in the S. pombe genome was PCR-amplified and cloned in the pTZ19R vector. For in vivo analyses the normal or altered gene sequences were subcloned into a multi-copy number yeast shuttle vector (pFL20), which subsequently was used to transform S. pombe cultures. The gene was expressed under its own promoter elements, and the increased plasmid-derived U3B snoRNA sequence could be readily detected using RT-PCR amplification. As previously reported (15Selinger D.A. Porter G.L. Brennwald P.J. Wise J.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 2: 297-308Google Scholar), in normal cells U3A snoRNA was found to make up ∼55–60% of the total U3 snoRNA population; when cells were transformed with the plasmid-associated gene, there was a dramatic change, and the U3B snoRNA then made up more than 85% of the cellular U3 snoRNA population (Fig. 1C). This reflected the greatly elevated gene dosage consistent with an efficient expression of the plasmid-associated sequence. Initial mutational analyses were focused on the maturation of U3 snoRNA in vivo, in particular the role of the conserved stem structure downstream of the mature U3 snoRNA sequence (Fig. 1). As also illustrated in Fig. 1D, in the course of these analyses, we observed a surprisingly variable transformation frequency with efficient transformation for many constructs but very few with others (Table 1). Furthermore, subsequent analyses of the few transformants in the second group revealed unanticipated recombination with none corresponding to the initial construct (results not shown). With more examples, a strong correlation was recognized between the transformation frequency and the direction of U3B snoRNA gene insertion or transcription relative (same versus opposite) to the selectable marker (Ura 3). Because read-through transcription appeared to be interfering with Ura 3 gene expression, in each case, the extent of transcription was evaluated using RT-PCR as illustrated in the examples shown in Fig. 2. Indeed, transcripts of mutant genes with normal transformation rates were found to extend only to the end of the 3′ end hairpin structure (+68, upper panels), whereas the others (when evaluated in the same orientation) were observed to extend downstream (+135, upper panels). Run-on transcription equally was evident when only downstream-specific primers were used (lower panel); transcription of the more distal and extended region (+523 to +1166) and the 643-bp product only was present with the abbreviated hairpin (+45). Clearly, termination failure or read-through was interfering with Ura 3 gene expression, in turn, preventing or greatly impeding transformant growth.TABLE 1U3B snoRNA genes with alternative downstream sequencesPlasmidaDirection of U3 snoRNA transcription is opposite (+) to or the same (-) as the Ura3 gene.Downstream sequenceOrientationaDirection of U3 snoRNA transcription is opposite (+) to or the same (-) as the Ura3 gene.Transformation efficiencybNumber of transformants per μg of plasmid DNA.Growth ratecDoubling time in hours.U3B snoRNAdAmount of U3B snoRNA as a percentage of the total U3 snoRNA.U3B_2135+2135Opposite84754.9 ± 0.383.6 ± 6.1U3B_604+604Opposite87754.2 ± 0.279.7 ± 4.2U3B_393+393Opposite100204.5 ± 0.488.0 ± 1.7U3B_198+198Opposite111004.7 ± 0.293.7 ± 1.2U3B_87+87Opposite67054.7 ± 0.191.4 ± 0.8U3B_68+68Opposite61654.4 ± 0.187.5 ± 1.2U3B_59+59Opposite90NAeNA, not applicable.NAU3B_45+45Opposite90NANAU3B_32+32Opposite75NANAU3B_18+18Opposite135NANAU3B_198-198Same117004.1 ± 0.193.7 ± 4.5U3B_59-59Same67507.4 ± 0.340.0 ± 6.3U3B_45-45Same69008.0 ± 0.341.7 ± 5.4U3B_32-32Same72757.4 ± 0.342 ± 6.4U3B_18-18Same70507.7 ± 0.445 ± 7.4a Direction of U3 snoRNA transcription is opposite (+) to or the same (-) as the Ura3 gene.b Number of transformants per μg of plasmid DNA.c Doubling time in hours.d Amount of U3B snoRNA as a percentage of the total U3 snoRNA.e NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Using transformation frequency as an initial assay for termination failure, a study of factors affecting transcript termination was initiated with systematic mutations being introduced into the downstream region. As indicated in Table 1, none of the deletions beyond the hairpin (U3B_68+ to U3B_2135+) had any significant effect on termination, but a deletion of only a few residues forming the hairpin (U3B_59+) had a dramatic effect. Similarly, all other significant changes to the hairpin (U3B_18+ to U3B_45+) resulted in very low transformation frequencies when transcription occurred in the conflicting (opposite) direction. In strong contrast, when equivalent constructs were prepared in a reverse orientation so transcripts did not conflict (same), the transformation frequency returned to normal (U3B_18– to U3B_59–), but run-on transcription could be readily detected by RT-PCR as illustrated in Fig. 2. To establish the relationship of this hairpin to any extended termini, ligation-mediated RT-PCR (28Hitchcock R.A. Zeiner G.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 1: 73-78Google Scholar) was used to detect and identify the normal termini in S. pombe. As shown in Fig. 3, only a single major terminal other than that of the mature U3 snoRNA was detected. Subsequent DNA cloning and sequence analyses (Fig. 3, lower panel) identified the end as nucleotide +C22, located approximately halfway up the 3′ end hairpin structure. In view of the fact that the hairpin seemed to resemble an RNase III substrate and there have been past reports of RNase III-like cleavages in the 3′ ends of snRNA transcripts (35Kufel J. Allmang C.

RNA. 1999; 8: 1083-1098Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the susceptibility of the U3 snoRNA gene-associated structure to Pac1 ribonuclease cleavage (a RNase III-like nuclease in S. pombe) was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, when hairpin RNA was prepared in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase, labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with Pac1 nuclease (33Rotondo G. Frendewey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2377-2386Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the hairpin was efficiently cleaved at nucleotide +C22, fully consistent with the prior terminal analyses (Fig. 3). As a control, RNA also was prepared from the opposite strand (i.e. the complementary sequence). As also shown in Fig. 4, no cleavage was observed with this RNA, and when this hairpin sequence was substituted in the plasmid-associated gene, the transformation frequency was observed to drop dramatically (left plate), again consistent with termination failure. Because sequence downstream of the hairpin was not essential for transformation failure and a comparison of the entire downstream sequences in the two U3 snoRNA genes of S. pombe revealed little sequence conservation other than the extended hairpin structure, an attempt was made to determine whether hairpin cleavage was sufficient, in itself, to induce termination by using an unrelated Pac1 nuclease cleavage site. The best characterized site in S. pombe is found in an extended hairpin within the 3′ external transcribed spacer of the rRNA transcripts. Previously examined in several laboratories including our own (41Rotondo G. Huang J.Y. Frendewey D. RNA. 1997; 10: 1182-1193Google Scholar, 42Spasov K. Perdomo L.I. Evakine E. Nazar R.N. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 24: 7110-7116Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), this hairpin is readily cleaved in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5, when this hairpin structure was substituted in the U3 snoRNA gene, the effect was dramatic. Even though there was no sequence homology, and it was a much more extended structure, this substitution (rDNA hairpin) was able to efficiently induce termination (Fig. 5B) and a production of mature plasmid-derived RNA (Fig. 5C). Clearly this cleavage was sufficient to induce Pol II transcript termination in S. pombe. In strong contrast to the rDNA-derived hairpin sequence, when the complementary sequence was substituted (Complementary), the transformation frequency was again very low (Fig. 5B) when the U3 snoRNA gene was expressed in the conflicting orientation, and plasmid-derived RNA was not detected (Fig. 5C), when this alternate gene construct was inserted so transcription occurred in the same direction as the Ura 3 gene, and transformation was possible. Because many of our analyses (Table 1) indicated that hairpin mutations affected both transcript termination and RNA maturation in a similar fashion, an attempt was made to separate these events for independent study. As diagrammed in Fig. 6, a new construct was prepared in which a slightly shortened, termination defective hairpin remained at the 3′ end of the U3B snoRNA sequence, and a new hairpin was added 1.7-kilobase pairs downstream of it (U3B_59TH+). As anticipated, a control construct with only the defective hairpin (U3B_59+ or U3B_59–) resulted in little or no plasmid-derived U3B snoRNA (Fig. 6, left panel), whereas the new construct with both hairpins produced high levels of U3 snoRNA (Fig. 6, middle panel). Surprisingly, a construct with only a downstream hairpin (U3B_0TH+) also terminated normally and resulted in high levels of U3B snoRNA (Fig. 6, right panel). Three separate transformants were examined in each case to ensure a reproducible result. This observation was further s"
