https://openalex.org/W1998333378,"An autoradiographic study revealed two different patterns of cell wall constructioni associated with two types of morphogenesis in Mucor rouxii. In hyphae, the cell wall was preferentially synthesized in the apical region; these cylindrical walls seemed to be generated by a sharply descending gradient of wall synthesis radiating from the apex. In spherical cells (germinating spores, yeast cells), wall formation occurred largely, if not entirely, in uniformly dispersed fashion over the entire cell periphery."

Applied to the tongue it modifies taste so that sour substances taste sweet. Brouwer et al.2 have isolated a similar protein from miracle fruit. We describe here a psychological study of the protein designed to clarify its mechanism of action."

Although in tissue culture experiments most of these materials were broken down in a few hours after uptake, haemocyanin nevertheless elicited the formation of specific antibodies when the macrophages were transferred to syngeneic hosts, and the haemocyanin bound to macrophages retained its immunogenic activity relatively unchanged for several days. In view of the observation that a small percentage of the haemocyanin bound to macrophages remained intact during in vitro culture for 72 h, we undertook the experiments described here to determine the localization of the persisting antigen (which would presumably comprise the immunogenic moiety)."

Many reactions of HL-A3 antiserums can only be recognized through absorption or by a two-stage test not in general use. Interpretations of donor-recipient compatibility and of the constitution of HL-A alleles affected by these findings."

The performance of the third group showed that visual-motor spatial coordination in the adult is subject to at least limited interocular independence."

https://openalex.org/W2094300765,"INOSINE is one of the rare nucleosides found in nucleic acids. It occurs especially in transfer ribonucleic acid where it appears to form part of a number of anticodons1,2. It can form a base pair with any one of the bases adenine, uracil or cytidine in the third codon1,2 position, and the possibility of atypical base pairs is part of the “wobble” hypothesis2. In addition, the action of mutagenic agents on ribonucleic acid can lead to the conversion of adenosine into inosine."

https://openalex.org/W2041917375,Wynder and Hoffmans study on the carcinogenicity of tobacco-smoke constituents was based on the role of mouse skin in assaying carcinogenicity raising questionable issues such as the ability of alpha-emitting radioisotopes e.g. polonium 210 to penetrate deep dividing cell layer of skin and the level of polonium concentration necessary to promote carcinogenicity. Other studies such as Yuile et al.s reported on low doses of radiation as an important etiological factor in the development of bronchial cancer among miners supporting experimental evidence on the carcinogenic effect of polonium from cigarette smoking. Although it is difficult to isolate the extent of carcinogenic effect of any particular component of cigarette smoking it is nevertheless necessary to identify the causative agents in cigarette smoking as the public could be exposed to such agents from other sources e.g. radionuclides from environmental contamination or aromatic hydrocarbons as air pollutants.

https://openalex.org/W2006627471,"CHERNICK'S1 demonstration of apparent late synthesis of protein on the X chromosome of female lymphocytes labelled with 3H-arginine1 interested me—for several years ago I carried out a similar experiment. The studies were done on an individual with an iso-X chromosome so that there was no question of the identification of the late replicating X chromosome. Lymphocytes were grown in culture with phytohaemagglutinin and, after 72 h, 25 µCi/ml. of 3H-arginine (Schwarz BioResearch, Inc.) and 0.1 µg/ml. of colchicine were added to the culture. Three h later the cultures were collected, treated with hypotonic, fixed in acetic acid–methanol and flame-dried. They were then stained with aceto-orcein, covered with Kodak AR-10 stripping film, and autoradiographed for 48 days. The iso-X chromosome was late labelled (Fig. 1) in a pattern identical to that seen with 3H-thymidine. Similar studies with normal female lymphocytes also showed a labelling pattern that mimicked that of 3H-thymidine."

https://openalex.org/W2086708218,"ACCESS to a Unicam SP800 recording spectrophotometer prompted me to check the absorption spectra of the haemoglobins of the leeches Hirudo medicinalis L., Haemopis sanguisuga (L.) and Erpobdella testacea (Savigny) previously recorded1 with another instrument. The new records (Table 1) show the previous set to have been in considerable error at the longest wavelengths, though substantially correct at the short wave end of the range. The corrected values resolve the problem raised by the apparent implication that leeches live in conditions of very low oxygen tension."
