https://openalex.org/W1533411461,"The carbohydrate-binding specificities of pea lectin and lentil lectin have been determined by testing the ability of radioactively labeled glycopeptides to bind to columns of pea lectin-Sepharose and lentil lectin-Sepharose. The presence of a fucose residue attached to the asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue of the test glycopeptide was essential for high affinity binding to both pea and lentil lectin-Sepharose but not to concanavalin A-Sepharose. In addition to fucose, 2 alpha-mannosyl residues were required for glycopeptide binding to the pea and lentil lectin-Sepharose columns. Substitution of the alpha-mannosyl residues at C-2 did not prevent their interaction. Substitution of 1 alpha-mannosyl residue at both C-2 and C-4 did prevent glycopeptide binding, but substitution of 1 alpha-mannosyl residue at C-2 and C-6 did not impair binding. Glycopeptide binding to lentil lectin-Sepharose was enhanced by the exposure of terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues on the glycopeptide, whereas binding to pea lectin-Sepharose was enhanced by the exposure of terminal mannose residues. The differences in carbohydrate binding specificity of pea lectin-Sepharose and Con A-Sepharose were exploited to fractionate a mixture of [2-3H]mannose-labeled glycopeptides derived from mouse lymphoma cell glycoproteins."

Female mice showed higher susceptibilities to both compounds than male mice."

https://openalex.org/W2079738524,"Systemic administration of the neuroleptic drug Î±-flupenthixol attenuated lever-pressing behavior in rats responding for rewarding brain stimulation. The magnitude of this attenuation was dose-dependent and resembled the effects of reward reduction and termination. However, when the operant response requirements of the same rats were changed to nose poking, identical drug treatments produced relatively little attenuation in performance. These data do not support the belief that neuroleptics produce a general state of anhedonia. Rather, the apparent suppression of reinforced behaviors depends at least in part on the kinetic requirements of the response."

https://openalex.org/W1483113783,"The blood coagulation serine protease, factor Xa, was dansylated with the active site-directed inhibitor, dansyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone. The Ca2+-dependent interactions of the inactivated factor Xa with its cofactors, phospholipid and activated factor V (factor Va), were studied through alterations of fluorescence polarization values of dansyl moiety of the modified enyme. In the presence of phospholipid and Ca2+, factor Va and factor Xa interacted with 1:1 stoichiometry, an interaction characterized by markedly enhanced polarization. The factor Va-independent interaction of factor Xa with phospholipid was also observed, characterized by dissociation constant Kd=2.7 x 10-6 M and stoichiometry of 66 mol of phospholipid/mol of factor Xa. The interaction of factor Xa with vesicles in the absence of factor Va exhibited considerably lower polarization values than in the presence of factor Va. These data obtained by direct spectral measurements are in agreement with the inferences drawn previously from studies of kinetics that the prothrombinase complex consists of 1:1 stoichiometric complex of factor Xa and phospholipid-bound factor Va, and that the enzymatic complex assembles in the absence of the natural substrate, prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1507354353,"Hepatitis B surface antigen has been purified and its major protein (p-25) and glycoprotein (gp-30) isolated. These isolated proteins have been subjected to amino acid analysis, Edman degradation (30 steps), carboxypeptidase digestion, and peptide mapping following tryptic hydrolysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, two-dimensional thin layer chromatography and electrophoresis, and high performance liquid chromatography. These studies demonstrated that p-25 and gp-30 have identical protein structure, differing only by the presence of carbohydrate in gp-30. Removal of this carbohydrate by treatment with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid converted gp-30 into p-25. The NH2-terminal sequence, carboxyl-terminal sequence, and the amino acid composition of several internal tryptic peptides were found to be consistent with the proposed protein sequence based upon the published sequences of hepatitis B viral DNA. The carbohydrate of gp-30 was demonstrated to be attached within the carboxyl-terminal 104 amino acids, most likely between residues 121 and 170."
https://openalex.org/W1512574750,"A spectrophotometric assay for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex has been developed, which measures NADH production by coupling it to the reduction of a tetrazolium dye via an intermediate electron carrier. The procedure uses only commercial reagents. Dependence on pyruvate, coenzyme A, and NAD is complete, and activities are comparable to those obtained by other procedures with both purified (rat kidney mitochondria) and crude (mouse brain homogenate) preparations. These dye-coupled procedures are potentially applicable to assays of other NADH-producing dehydrogenases in crude preparations."

https://openalex.org/W2152149683,"Mice homozygous for the autosomal recessive gene, cartilage matrix deficiency (cmd/cmd), are characterized by disproportionate dwarfism and cleft palate. The collagen and proteoglycan of fetal limb cartilage was examined by biochemical and immunofluorescent techniques. While a normal amount of type II collagen was found, the amount of proteoglycan was reduced as determined by chemical analysis and incorporation of labeled precursors. Analyses of labeled proteoglycans by glycerol density gradient centrifugation under dissociative conditions and by gel filtration showed that the major high molecular weight proteoglycan characteristic of cartilage was absent, but smaller proteoglycans were present in normal amounts. Antibodies directed against proteoglycan core protein failed to stain the cmd/cmd cartilage while antibodies to type II collagen stained the cartilage without hyaluronidase pretreatment. Addition of beta-D-xyloside, an exogenous substrate for chondroitin sulfate synthesis, and direct assay for beta-D-xylosyltransferase activity indicated that cmd/cmd cartilage cells contained normal levels of the enzymes required for chondroitin sulfate synthesis. The data suggest that cmd/cmd is defective in the synthesis of the cartilage proteoglycan core protein."

https://openalex.org/W225503352,"The specific oligosaccharide units of the C-mycosidic glycopeptidolipid antigens from serovarieties in the Myobacterium avium-Mycobacterium intracellulare-Mycobacterium scrofulaceum complex were liberated as oligosaccharide alditols by treatment of the glycopeptidolipids with alkaline borohydride. The complete structures of the oligosaccharide alditols have been derived from their 1H-NMR spectra or those of their permethylated (or pertrideuteriomethylated) derivatives, the mass spectra of the methylated derivatives, and from methylation fragmentation analysis. Periodate oxidation was also used to confirm the position of the link between the ultimate and penultimate sugars. The following structures are proposed (with some extrapolation of enantiomeric configurations where evidence for assignment is not yet complete) for the oligosaccharide alditols: Serovar 9 2,3-Me2-alpha-L-Fucp-(1 leads to 4)-2,3-Me2-alpha-L-Fucp-(1 leads to 3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 leads to 2)-6-deoxy-L-Talol Serovar 25 2-Me-alpha-L-Fucp-(1 leads to 4)-2-Me-alpha-L-Fucp-(1 leads to 3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 leads to 2)-6-deoxy-L-talol Serovar 8 4,6-(1'-carboxyethylidene)-3-Me-beta-D-Glcp-(1 leads to 3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 leads to 2)-6-deoxy-L-Talol Thus, 6-deoxytalitol (6-deoxytalose in the original glycopeptidolipid) invariably occupies the reducing terminus. Rhamnose is invariably the penultimate sugar, and the link between rhamnose and 6-deoxytalose is invariably alpha 1 leads to 2. Moreover, the results point to the outer one or two appendages for the provision of individually distinctive features required for antigen specificity. The abbreviations used are: serovar, serologically distinct varieties; Me, methyl; Fucp, fucopyranose; Rhap, rhamnopyranose; Talol, talitol."

Frozen cells, embedded in a cross-linked protein matrix, and frozen tissues are fractured with a scalpel under liquid nitrogen, thawed, labeled, dehydrated by the critical point drying method, and replicated. This method allows direct, high-resolution, two-dimensional chemical and immunological characterization of the cellular membranes in situ, as well as detection of sites within cross-fractured cytoplasm and extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1565441789,"Clones containing sequences corresponding to testosterone-inducible RNAs of mouse kidney have been identified within a cDNA clone bank prepared from size-fractionated poly(A)-containing kidney RNA. A novel screening method was employed to specifically detect such sequences. One of these, pMK908, containing a 1.2 kilobase pair insert, was studied in detail. RNA blotting experiments show that the inserted DNA of pMK908 hybridizes to two kidney-specific RNA sequences, 2500 and 1500 nucleotides in length, both of which are rapidly induced by testosterone treatment of female mice in vivo. RNA excess hybridization studies reveal that these RNAs constitute approximately 0.004% of th total RNA population in female kidneys and are induced approximately 7-8-fold by testosterone. The RNA has been isolated and translated in a cell-free system and encodes a 43,000-dalton polypeptide chain. The induction of these RNAs by testosterone is independent of the pituitary gland, but does depend upon the testosterone receptor protein. The existence of pMK908, and other chimeric plasmids containing testosterone-inducible sequences, should be valuable in understanding the response of the mouse kidney to androgens."
https://openalex.org/W1497865291,An estrogen-independent variant (R3) was selected by cloning wild type MCF-7 cells in soft agar in the presence of tamoxifen. R3 has a slightly slower growth rate under optimal growth conditions. Estradiol and tamoxifen have minimal effects on growth rate and thymidine incorporation as compared to wild type MCF-7 cells. R3 contains both cytoplasmic receptor and a receptor derived from crude nuclear extract with slightly higher numbers of cytosol receptor than wild type MCF-7. The same dissociation constant (Kd) and the same molecular weight (estimated by Sephadex chromatography) and sucrose density behavior for both cytoplasmic and nuclear estrogen receptor are seen in R3 and MCF-7. Estrogen receptor complexes were activated by salt and nucleotide and translocated to the nucleus equivalently in R3 and MCF-7. Relative binding affinities and extent of competition by estradiol and tamoxifen for cytoplasmic estrogen receptor are the same for MCF-7 and R3. Induction of progesterone receptor and nuclear estrogen receptor processing following treatment with estradiol in R3 is minimal compared with MCF-7. DNA affinity (as assessed by DNA cellulose chromatography) of estrogen receptor complexes from R3 and MCF-7 is different. R3 appears to represent a cell with a defect expressed in receptor function apart from the initial hormone-binding step.
https://openalex.org/W1566150601,"An alpha-mannosidase specific for the hydrolysis of alpha-1,2-mannosyl-mannose linkages has been solubilized and partially purified from rabbit liver microsomes. The enzyme is inhibited by EDTA and has optimal activity in the presence of calcium ions. The purified enzyme has a requirement for nonionic detergents or for specific phospholipids. At detergent concentrations appreciably below the critical micelle concentration, the enzyme is active in the presence of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine but not with phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid. At concentrations of phosphatidylcholine which provide optimal activity, the enzyme is strongly inhibited by phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylglycerol. The substrate specificity of the alpha-mannosidase toward oligosaccharide substrates suggests that the enzyme may be involved in the processing of the oligosaccharide chains of mammalian glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1607683706,"A detailed study of the mechanism of nascent chain elongation and of steady state kinetics of purified mouse DNA polymerase alpha has been conducted. Polymerization was examined using a model replication system of poly(dT) as template, oligo(rA) as primer, and dATP as nucleotide substrate, and the probability of chain termination was determined by measurement of the precise chainlength of the products. Reactions were conducted under conditions where products were not utilized as primer. Product chainlength analysis indicated that alpha-polymerase acted in a processive fashion, elongating the primer by the stepwise addition of up to 20 dAMP residues before dissociating. The probability of termination after each dAMP addition depended upon the chainlength of the product and upon the presence of several agents; spermine, spermidine, putrescine, nalidixic acid, or PPi caused a marked increase in termination after the first dAMP addition, and conversely, mouse helix destabilizing protein-1 caused the enzyme to continue extending the same product chain until 18 to approximately 35 dAMP residues had been added. From these and other data, it is concluded that the kinetic mechanisms of termination after the first dAMP addition and after subsequent dAMP additions are different. With this information on how alpha-polymerase elongates a nascent primer(dA)n molecule, a kinetic model and appropriate steady state rate equations were obtained for analysis of substrate initial velocity data and termination probabilities. The substrate kinetic patterns and PPi product inhibition results were consistent with the ordered Ter Ter mechanism Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping Pong proposed in the model, and the model also permits a rational explanation for the differences in termination probability and for the fact that substrate initial velocity plots were linear even though multiple residues of dATP combined with the enzyme during each catalytic cycle. In addition, the results suggest that a rate-limiting step in the steady state occurs at the transition between initiation and elongation, and that higher levels of template.primer increase the rate of this step. This secondary effect of template.primer is discussed in relation to other polymer-forming enzymes, and various kinetic mechanisms which require the presence of two template.primer-binding sites, effector and catalytic, are discussed for their fit to the experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W1529181216,"Upon reaction with N-ethylmaleimide, a single sulfhydryl residue/Mr = 50,000 subunit of phenylalanine hydroxylase is modified. This modification is accompanied by a 20-30-fold increase in hydroxylase activity when the activity is measured with tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactor. The N-ethylmaleimide-modified enzyme exhibits many of the characteristics of phenylalanine hydroxylase activated by partial proteolysis or by exposure to phospholipids. For example, a change from sigmoid to hyperbolic kinetics with varying phenylalanine concentration is observed, in addition to broadened substrate specificity and a dependence on phenylalanine hydroxylase stimulator protein at pH 6.8. The binding of phenylalanine to phenylalanine hydroxylase in the absence of pterin cofactor has also been studied. The native enzyme exhibits a sigmoidal phenylalanine binding curve. The N-ethylmaleimide-modified enzyme shows a hyperbolic response to phenylalanine binding in addition to an apparent decrease in total phenylalanine binding."
https://openalex.org/W1492198096,"In suspensions of freshly isolated hepatocytes, asialotransferrin type 3 became rapidly bound by the asialoglycoprotein-binding hepatic lectin. Suspended hepatocytes, just as the liver of intact animals, catabolized asialotransferrin in a concentration-dependent manner. At low asialotransferrin concentrations (0.4-1 nM), the fraction of labeled protein degraded was much smaller than found with comparable concentrations of asialofetuin in an earlier study (Tolleshaug, H., Berg, T., Nilsson, M., and Norum, K. R. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 499, 73-84). The fraction of endocytosed asialotransferrin that was degraded, could, however, be substantially increased by raising the concentration of asialotransferrin the medium. Release studies using a chelating agent or competitive inhibitors of the binding reaction showed that at low asialotransferrin concentrations, hepatocytes exocytose the preponderance of the intracellular asialotransferrin with a half-life of approximately 20 min. This novel observation raises the possibility that lysosomal homing of an endosome transporting asialoglycoprotein requires an intracellular target signal."
https://openalex.org/W2416286527,"The assignment of five disulfide bonds in the alpha subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) using partial reduction and S-[14C]carboxymethylation has been reported earlier (Mise, T., and Bahl, O. P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8516-8522). Employing a similar approach, we have determined the locations of six disulfide bonds in hCG-beta. Two partially reduced and S-[14C]carboxymethylated hCG-beta derivatives, DS1.4-hCG-beta and DS3.4-hCG-beta in which on the average 1.4 and 3.4 disulfide bonds were modified, respectively, were prepared. The 14C-labeled derivatives were then completely reduced and S-carboxymethylated with nonradioactive iodoacetic acid and subjected to hydrolysis with trypsin. The radioactive peptides were purified by gel filtration and high voltage paper electrophoresis. The tryptic peptides containing two or more S-[14C]carboxymethylcysteines were further degraded using various proteolytic enzymes such as thermolysin, carboxypeptidase A and Y, cathespin C, and subtilisin to obtain individual S-[14C]carboxymethylcysteine-containing peptides. From the specific radioactivities of S-[14C]carboxymethylcysteines in DS3.4-hCG-beta, four out of six disulfide bonds, 9-90, 26-110, 34-88, and 93-100 were assigned. Similar data from DS1.4-hCG-beta gave the locations of the other two disulfide bonds, 23-72 and 38-57, while confirming the locations of four disulfide bonds derived from the radioactivity distribution in DS3.4-hCG-beta. Thus, all six disulfide bonds in hCG-beta have been located. The results of controlled reduction and S-[14C]alkylation also indicate that disulfide bond 93-100 is the most reactive, followed by disulfide bond 26-110, and that the least reactive among all is 34-88."
https://openalex.org/W1520446061,"Rat cerebral neurons maintained in monolayer culture accumulate 125I-labeled tetanus toxin. Accumulation is receptor-mediated; i.e. it can be prevented by including unlabeled tetanus toxin, gangliosides, or tetanus antitoxin in the incubation medium but not by including tetanus toxoid, high concentrations of serum, or thyrotropin. Accumulation is time-dependent, reaching a plateau after approximately 3 h when 60% of the added toxin is associated with the cells. It is better at 0 degrees C than at ambient temperature and is significantly higher when 0.25 M sucrose replaces physiological salts in a medium containing 5% serum. Unlabeled tetanus toxin, tetanus antitoxin, and tetanus toxoid do not release the accumulated 125I-labeled tetanus toxin to any significant degree; however, gangliosides (50 micrograms/ml) can release 30% of the accumulated 125I-labeled toxin. Treatment of cells with Triton X-100, under conditions where over 90% of the lipids and 70% of the gangliosides are removed, extracts only 15% of the cell-associated 125I-labeled toxin. Evidence is presented that over 50% of the accumulated toxin is internalized in a cellular compartment which is not in immediate equilibrium with the extracellular environment and which is associated with detergent-insoluble cellular constituents. The tetanus toxin accumulated in this compartment has the same gel electrophoretic pattern as the native toxin and is bioactive. The role of gangliosides as potential shuttle vehicles for tetanus toxin internalization is discussed as are the implications of these data to in vitro studies of the pathogenesis of tetanus-induced neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2153224785,"Low temperature visible spectra of Compounds I from peroxidases reconstituted with protohemin, 2-formyl-4-vinyldeuterohemin, 2-vinyl-4-formyldeuterohemin, 2,4-dimethyldeuterohemin, and 2,4-diacetyldeuterohemin reveal that these Fe(IV) porphyrin pi-cation radicals take the 2A2u of peroxidase-type electronic ground state. Compound I of deuterohemin horseradish peroxidase, however, takes the 2A1u or catalase type pi-cation radical electronic ground state. Since deuterohemin horseradish peroxidase possesses no catalase activity, the structure of the peroxidase apoprotein (other than those factors which might influence the Compound I pi-cation radical ground state) is concluded to play the major role in determining the reactivity of Compound I toward hydrogen donors. Studies on peroxidases substituted with the hemins 2-formyl-4-vinyldeuterohemin, 2-vinyl-4-formyldeuterohemin, 2,4-dimethyldeuterohemin, and mesohemin reveal that isoelectronic hemins differentially interact with the peroxidase apoprotein. The hemin 2- and 4-substituents are therefore concluded to interact sterically with the horseradish peroxidase apoprotein. While a variety of 2- and 4-substituted hemins were observed to bind rapidly with apo horseradish peroxidase to form active substituted enzymes, small changes in the substituents in the 6- and 7-positions had drastic effects on the rates of binding to apoperoxidase and the activities of the reconstituted enzymes. Even addition of a single methylene to form butyrate instead of propionate side chains drastically altered the rate of binding of the hemin and the activity of the substituted enzyme. It therefore appears that while the 2-, 4-, 6-, and 7-substituents of the hemins in horseradish peroxidase all interact with the protein, the polypeptide chain possesses more conformational flexibility in the area which binds the 2- and 4-substituents."
https://openalex.org/W1513776934,"ML236B is a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) (EC 1.1.1.34), the major regulatory enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. This compound inhibits cell growth when present in the culture medium of CHO-K1 cells at a concentration as low as 0.1 micrograms/ml. Addition of the product of the HMG-CoA reductase reaction, mevalonate, to the culture medium prevents the cytotoxic effects of ML236B at a concentration of inhibitor as high as 50 micrograms/ml. Using a stepwise selection procedure, we have obtained two variant cell lines which are resistant to the presence of 8 micrograms/ml of ML236B in the culture medium. The rates of cholesterol synthesis and the cholesterol levels in the variant cell lines, grown in the presence of ML236B, are similar to those of the parental CHO-K1 cell line grown in the absence of inhibitor. Assays of HMG-CoA reductase activity from extracts of variant cells, grown in the presence of inhibitor, reveal that the variant cell lines have an approximately 40-fold higher HMG-CoA reductase activity than does the parental CHO-K1 cell line grown in the absence of inhibitor. However, when the variant cell lines are grown without ML236B in the culture medium, the HMG-CoA reductase activity returns to the parental CHO-K1 level within 5 days, but the resistant phenotype is stable for up to 9 months. We conclude that the variant cell lines are unable to overcome the cytotoxic effects of ML236B by a mechanism which leads to overaccumulation of HMG-CoA reductase which in turn permits normal mevalonate metabolism and cholesterol synthesis to take place."
https://openalex.org/W1496507967,"Chromaffin granules have a translocator-mediated uptake system for the monoamines dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These substrates are predominantly cationic at physiological pH but they also exist in neutral, zwitterionic, and anionic forms. The cationic fraction is nearly pH-independent between pH 6.9 and pH 7.6. Over the same pH range, the neutral and zwitterionic fractions increase by a factor of 6.3 and the anionic fraction increases by a factor of 40. In chromaffin granule ghosts, the apparent Km values for dopamine and serotonin transport are independent of pH between 6.8 and 7.6. Consequently, the translocator probably binds the cationic form of the substrate. Vmax values for dopamine and serotonin uptake increase by a factor of 2 between pH 6.8 and pH 7.6."

https://openalex.org/W1503455303,"We have established conditions for the fractionation of cytoplasmic and membrane-bound polyribosomes from the clonal mouse cell line BC3H-1. Polyribosome fractions are obtained in good yield and purity. They are active in protein synthesis when incubated with nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and we have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic and membrane-bound fractions direct the synthesis of distinctly different sets of proteins. Using immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel analysis, we have shown that the membrane-bound but not the cytoplasmic polyribosomes direct the synthesis of two protein species (Mr = 39,000 nd 42,000) which are homologous to the native alpha subunit of acetylcholine receptor. Peptide maps suggest that the two species synthesized in vitro may correspond to the nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms, respectively, of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1510200627,"Camphor is stereospecifically hydroxylated by the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida at the 5-exo position by a cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase system consisting of a flavoprotein reductase; putidaredoxin, an iron-sulfur oxidation-reduction transport-effector protein; and the P-450 hemoprotein. We have studied the interaction of a substrate analog of camphor, 5-exo-bromocamphor, with this cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase system in order to probe the molecular mechanisms of electron transport and catalytic substrate oxygenation. 5-exo-Bromocamphor was found to bind tightly in a 1:1 complex with P-450 with a dissociation constant of 2.9 microM, very near that for the normal camphor substrate. Contrary to camphor, however, the 5-exo-bromocamphor-bound material exhibits only a 46% population of the high spin form of the macromolecule. Measurement of the oxidation-reduction potential of the bromocamphor-P-450 complex yields a value of E0' = -246 mV, intermediate between that of substrate-free (-300 mV) and camphor-bound (-173 mV) cytochrome. These data are interpreted in terms of a thermodynamic linkage model relating spin, substrate, and oxidation-reduction equilibria in the P-450 monoxygenase system. 5-exo-Bromocamphor is readily metabolized by the P-450cam mixed function oxidase to 5-ketocamphor at rates and yields similar to that of the normal substrate, camphor, suggesting abstraction of the endo-hydrogen of 5-exo-bromocamphor and oxygen addition to produce a transient 5-bromo-5-hydroxycamphor intermediate. Implications of these chemical findings for the chemical mechanisms of P-450-catalyzed oxygenations and the flexibility of substrates at the active site of the macromolecule are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1547917441,"A highly purified NADP+-dependent oxidoreductase from hamster liver (1) has been found to catalyze a reaction in which the oxidation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate is coupled to the reduction of D-glucuronate. In the coupled reaction, NADP+ is required in catalytic rather than stoichiometric amounts. When the coupled reaction is carried out under limiting conditions for the oxidation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (i.e. a very low concentration of NADP+ and an inhibitory concentration of NADPH) the rate of gamma-hydroxybutyrate oxidation is determined by the concentration of D-glucuronate and can be stimulated at least 8-fold by D-glucuronate. The kinetics of the oxidation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate have been studied in both the uncoupled and the coupled reaction. In the coupled reaction the reduction of D-glucuronate drives the oxidation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate; the Km for NADP+ is markedly lower than the Km determined in the uncoupled reaction (1.4 X 10(-6) M as compared to 2 X 10(-5) M), and the inhibition by NADPH can be completely overcome. The kinetics of the uncoupled reaction suggest that, unlike many other dehydrogenases, the oxidation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate catalyzed by this enzyme proceeds by a Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1525853466,"We show that 13C NMR spectroscopy is a practical method for following the kinetics of enzymatic digestion of individual carbohydrate residues of glycopeptides and for determining the structures of the products of partial digestions. Specifically, we study the jack bean alpha-mannosidase digestion of the two hen ovalbumin glycopeptides Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to Asn (Compound A) and Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to Asn (Compound B). The reported rule that jack bean alpha-mannosidase hydrolyzes Man alpha 1 leads to 2Man and Man alpha 1 leads to 6Man linkages at least 15 times faster than Man alpha 1 leads to 3Man linkages (Tai, T., Yamashita, K., Ogata-Arakawa, M., Koide, N., Muramatsu, T., Iwashita, S., Inoue, Y., and Kobata, A. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8569-8575) is not of general validity. Although the Man alpha 1 leads to 2Man (alpha) linkage of Compound A is the first one to be digested, the Man alpha 1 leads to 3Man (beta) linkage is hydrolyzed next, faster than the Man alpha 1 leads to 6Man (alpha) linkage. The Man alpha 1 leads to 3Man (alpha) linkage is hydrolyzed very slowly. We show that it is practical to use 13C NMR spectroscopy to determine when the enzymatic digestion should be halted to isolate derivatives such as Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man alpha 1 leads to 6Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to Asn and Man alpha 1 leads to 3Man alpha 1 leads to 6Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to Asn."
https://openalex.org/W1570974642,"Apparent thermodynamic parameters for the process of solubilization of the five major classes of bovine lens crystallins have been determined by the polyethylene glycol solubility method. Although each purified crystallin fraction displays significant structural heterogeneity as analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, they behave as homogeneous proteins by the criteria of solubility. Using experimentally determined values for the apparent enthalpy and entropy of solution and the effects of a variety of low molecular weight solutes on crystallin solubility, the five classes can be arranged in order of the polarity of their solid phase intermolecular contacts as follows: gamma, high molecular weight beta greater than low molecular weight beta greater than high molecular weight alpha greater than alpha. Since alpha-crystallin is the major component of the insoluble material in bovine cataract, we suggest that cataract formation may be related to the intrinsic solubility and polarity of the lens crystallins."

After a 24-h labeling period, the 3H/35S-glycosaminoglycans and 3H-glycoproteins synthesized were found associated with both the cell layer and the culture medium. These tumor cells also synthesized a class of 35S-glycoproteins which contained alkali-stable 35S-oligosaccharide chains. These 35S-glycoproteins did not accumulate with the cell layers but were preferentially found in the culture medium (82-96%). After treatment with 2.5 mM butyrate for 24 h, the tumor cells assumed a more flattened and spread morphology with more clearly defined cell borders. These butyrate-treated cell cultures showed less than a 2-fold increase in the cell-associated form of both 3H/35S-glycosaminoglycans and 3H-glycoproteins, compared to cells cultured in the absence of butyrate. In contrast, butyrate-treated cell cultures had a 3-fold increase in the total incorporation of 35SO4 into glycoproteins and a dramatic 10-30-fold increase in the cell-associated form of these 35S-glycoprotein products as compared to untreated cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1547992945,"NADH-cytochrome c reductase, a component of benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system, is an ion-sulfur flavoprotein with one FAD and one iron-sulfur cluster of [2Fe-2S] type (Yamaguchi, M., and Fujisawa, H. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 8848-8853). Treatment of NADH-cytochrome c reductase with p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid resulted in fading of its color with a concomitant loss of the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity. The p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid-treated enzyme was found to contain one FAD but no significant amounts of iron and labile sulfide. Incubation of the iron-sulfur-depleted enzyme with ferrous ions and sulfide in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol led to both reconstitution of iron-sulfur cluster of the enzyme and concomitant restoration of the enzyme activity. Although the iron-sulfur-depleted enzyme catalyzed NADH-dependent reduction of ferricyanide, nitroblue tetrazolium, or oxygen, it could not catalyze NADH-dependent reduction of the oxygenase component of benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system. In contrast, the reconstituted enzyme recovered the activity of NADH-dependent reduction of the oxygenase component to the original level. Certain other catalytic and molecular properties of the iron-sulfur-depleted enzyme and the reconstituted enzyme are also presented."
https://openalex.org/W2063083308,"In combined cultures of dissociated spinal neurons and explants from the region of locus coeruleus, rich catecholamine-containing fiber projections from the explant to the surrounding regions of spinal neurons were demonstrated by fluorescence histochemistry. Electrical stimulation of the explant resulted in slow depolarizing responses in many of the spinal neurons. Cells exhibiting this type of response were also usually depolarized by local application of noradrenaline, whereas other, unresponsive neurons usually were not. The depolarizing responses to electrical stimulation and to noradrenaline were both increased by depolarizing current injection and decreased by hyperpolarizing current. These and other data suggest that the depolarizing responses of the spinal neurons to explant stimulation are mediated by noradrenaline released from axons of locus coeruleus neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1564052905,"Serine transhydroxymethylase, from lamb or rabbit liver, is known to catalyze slow transamination of D-alanine, but not of L-amino acids, in a tetrahydrofolate-independent reaction. Both enzymes will process the D-isomer of beta-fluoroalanine for alpha, beta-elimination of HF to yield an aminoacrylate-pyridoxal-P-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate partitions between harmless hydrolysis to pyruvate, NH4+, and active enzyme-pyridoxal-P (catalytic turnover) and suicidal enzyme alkylation by covalent modification with an average partition ratio of 40-60 turnovers/inactivation event/monomer unit of this tetrameric enzyme. Enzyme inactivation occurs with stoichiometric incorporation of radioactive label from D-[1,2-14C]fluoroalanine. Titration of enzymic cysteinyl --SH groups with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) indicates loss of 1 --SH group on inactivation. Acid hydrolysis of radioactive-inactive enzyme confirms cysteine residue modification. Treatment of inactive enzyme with 6 M urea, then KBH4, followed by acid hydrolysis yields two radioactive compounds, lanthionine and S-carboxyhydroxyethylcysteine, in about equal amounts. The addition of tetrahydrofolate stimulates both pyruvate production and inactivation to equal extents with about a 200-fold rate acceleration at 0.5 mM tetrahydrofolate to turnover numbers of approximately 120 min-1. The Km for D-fluoroalanine is high, 10-60 mM, and this low substrate affinity suggests D-fluoroalanine will not be a useful in vivo agent for selective inactivation of liver cell serine transhydroxymethylases."

https://openalex.org/W2122917353,"We have detected within the adult rat cerebral cortex 9 identifiable small molecular weight RNAs, K, K', L, Q, A, C, D, G', and H. These molecules are electrophoretically similar to the small RNAs found in other mammalian cells. Metabolic turnover and subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that each of these small RNAs behave in a manner distinguishable from the other 8. In addition, 2 of the small RNAs, K and A, are under considerable developmental regulation. The results obtained suggest that no 2 of these molecules are present exclusively within the same subcellular structure. The cellular concentrations of the small RNAs were analyzed in 7 different adult rat tissues which varied 10-fold in their cellular RNA concentrations. The cellular levels of the cytoplasmic RNAs, 28 S, 18 S, and 5 S rRNA, 4 S tRNA, K, and L, were found to be a function of the total cellular RNA concentration. In contrast, the cellular levels of the nuclear RNAs, A, C, D, and H, varied slightly between tissues and were independent of the total cellular RNA concentration. However, these variations in the levels of the nuclear RNAs were significant in that they revealed these molecules are coordinately regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1575356984,"We have purified the large polypeptide hormone human chorionic somatomammotropin to near electrophoretic homogeneity by a new purification scheme. The hormone crystallized from polyethylene glycol in a form suitable for high resolution x-ray analysis; the crystals are monoclinic, space group C2, a = 123.9, b = 30.3, c = 53.8 A, beta = 119 degrees 30 min, with 1 molecule/asymmetric unit. The growth-promoting activity of homogeneous hormone and of dissolved crystals was measured through their effect on committed erythroid precursor cells in tissue culture assays. Both homogeneous and redissolved crystalline hormone had activities comparable to that of hormone purified by standard procedures. The latter preparations yielded either no crystals, or disordered crystals unsuitable for x-ray analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1587678782,"The kinetics of hydrolysis of 1,3-didecanoyl glycerol by pancreatic lipase were measured in monomolecular films at the air-water interface. Determination of the quantity of active enzyme associated with the film under conditions of constant reaction velocity and surface pressure showed that both the extent of enzyme adsorption and the catalytic rate constant of the adsorbed enzyme were substrate packing dependent. If this rate constant was corrected for the concentration of reactive substrate predicted from kinetic and physical studies (Momsen, W. E., and Brockman, H. L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 8855-8860), a constant value of 2.5 +/- 0.5 X 10(12) (S.E.) cm2/(mol.s) was obtained for the second order rate constant. This constancy supports the hypothesis that a packing dependent conformational distribution of substrate head groups is a factor in the regulation of lipolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1560157486,"The expression of the globin genes which accompanies the chemically induced differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells is subject to inhibition by glucocorticoid hormones. The present study inquires into the possible mechanisms for this suppression. It is shown that the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, can both prevent the initial appearance of beta-globin mRNA during the induction of differentiation and inhibit the ongoing production of this RNA in induced cells. Isolated nuclei from dexamethasone-treated cells also exhibited a depressed ability to synthesize beta-globin mRNA. These effects were achieved without altering the turnover rate of the mature messenger RNA. Electrophoretic analysis of pulse-labeled transcripts before and after a chase interval indicated that large Mr beta-globin precursor molecules were processed normally to mature nuclear beta-globin mRNA in cells treated with dexamethasone. S1 nuclease protection experiments showed further that dexamethasone treatment of induced cells uniquely depressed the amount of precursor-specific beta-globin sequences contained in unlabeled nuclear RNA preparations. The data support the view that dexamethasone regulates globin gene expression at or very close to the transcriptional level."

https://openalex.org/W1553745409,"We have used antibodies directed against two histone H2a variants, H2a.1 and H2a.2, to probe chromatin structure in Friend erythroleukemia cells. Each molecule has at least one unique antigenic determinant, as well as determinants shared by both variants. Some Friend leukemia cell types contained H2a molecules which showed altered immunologic reactivity with the two antisera. The accessibility of the H2a variants in chromatin to anti-H2a antibody was different as measured by the use of whole chromatin as an immunoabsorbent and by binding of antibody to nucleosomes in a solid phase radioimmunoassay. While anti-H2a.1 IgG bound to chromatin, anti-H2a.2 IgG did not. Moreover, anti-H2a.1 IgG binding to chromatin from different Friend cell types reflected, in general, the relative amounts of H2a.1 in total chromatin. The different reactivity of the two antisera with chromatin was also observed with isolated nucleosomes: anti-H2a.1 IgG bound but anti-H2a.2 did not. Furthermore, the binding of anti-H2a.1 Ig with subfractions of nucleosomes varied; H1-depleted, high mobility group-enriched nucleosomes reacted better than H1-containing, high mobility group-depleted nucleosomes. These findings demonstrated a heterogeneity in the organization of H2a variants in chromatin within nucleosomal subfractions of chromatin and among chromatin of different Friend leukemia cell types. Moreover, most of the antigenic determinants common to both H2a variants were shown to be buried within the nucleosome core; only H2a.1-unique determinants were accessible to an anti-H2a.1 IgG molecule."
