https://openalex.org/W2062876721,"Radar observations of Venus during the last close approach have resulted in a value of solar parallax of 8.79460 seconds of arc, corresponding to a value for the astronomical unit of 149,596,000 km. This is in satisfactory agreement with the determinations made, during the same close approach of Venus, at the Millstone Hill Radar Observatory and at Jodrell Bank, which are 149,597,700 km and 149,601,000 km, respectively. The size of the astronomical unit heretofore generally accepted as most authoritative is based upon a 1950 determination by Rabe, and is 149,532,200 km."

Since the stimuli, both during training and testing, were always presented in the lateral or caudal visual field, the parts of a retina involved could not have participated in prior, binocular experience."

https://openalex.org/W2001461390,"We have applied a fat-soluble fluorescent aid to certain microorganisms. The aid, a stilbyl triazole compound, fluoresced more in the presence of certain strains of flocculating brewing yeasts than in the presence of nonflocculating types. The work suggested the possibility that flocculating yeasts may possess more surface lipids than the nonflocculating organisms. The performance of the compound on rapidly growing cell centers and bacterial spores is described, and the possible application of the technique to other areas of microbiology is outlined."

https://openalex.org/W2064910726,"A significant change in growth pattern among the ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) of the Flagstaff region, northern Arizona, occurred in 1947-1948. This is the first such change since 1904-1905. Evidence appears to verify the existence of a tension zone which fluctuates in altitude as a result of changes in the distribution and quantity of the rainfall as recorded through soil moisture."

Although there has been a relative decline in such research, the central nervous system and pathological aspects have recently received increased attention. The United States is producing less than 17 percent of the research on sleep."
