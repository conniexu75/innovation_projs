https://openalex.org/W2078244171,Convection in a layer heated from below and rotating about a vertical axis exhibits a unique phenomenon in fluid dynamics in that the small-amplitude motion is governed by random effects in both its spatial and its time dependence. A simple theoretical description of the phenomenon is compared with laboratory observations. A more detailed mathematical description appears to be feasible because of the weakly nonlinear nature of the problem.

https://openalex.org/W2126011803,"France relies on nuclear power as an important part of her energy program. Anticipating problems with the availability of natural uranium before the year 2020, the French have been pursuing a three-stage program of development of breeder reactors. The third reactor in this program, the near-commercial plant Super Phenix Mark I, is expected to reach power operation in 1983. Although there are still some uncertainties, particularly about the date when the breeder will become competitive with other energy sources, the outlook is considered favorable and preliminary designs for commercial plants are under way."

https://openalex.org/W4255545340,"In the report by Simpson et al., ""Saturnian trapped radiation and its absorption by satellites and rings: The first results from Pioneer 11"" (25 Jan., p. 411), in Fig. 1B the right hand scale of flux (for the electrons with energies > 3.4 million electron volts) should be multiplied by a factor of 10 so that the maximum flux measured by the electron current detector is 3 x 10(6) cm(-2) sec(-1). Furthermore, in reference 9, the following citation was inadvertently omitted: M. H. Acu√±a and N. F. Ness, ibid., p. 444."
