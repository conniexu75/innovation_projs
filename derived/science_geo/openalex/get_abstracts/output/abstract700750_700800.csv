https://openalex.org/W4295951576,"Ferroptosis is a type of cell death caused by radical-driven lipid peroxidation, leading to membrane damage and rupture. Here we show that enzymatically produced sulfane sulfur (S0) species, specifically hydropersulfides, scavenge endogenously generated free radicals and, thereby, suppress lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. By providing sulfur for S0 biosynthesis, cysteine can support ferroptosis resistance independently of the canonical GPX4 pathway. Our results further suggest that hydropersulfides terminate radical chain reactions through the formation and self-recombination of perthiyl radicals. The autocatalytic regeneration of hydropersulfides may explain why low micromolar concentrations of persulfides suffice to produce potent cytoprotective effects on a background of millimolar concentrations of glutathione. We propose that increased S0 biosynthesis is an adaptive cellular response to radical-driven lipid peroxidation, potentially representing a primordial radical protection system."
https://openalex.org/W4295929883,"Abstract Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a therapeutic intervention for inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, but its clinical mode of action and subsequent microbiome dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we analyzed metagenomes from 316 FMTs, sampled pre and post intervention, for the treatment of ten different disease indications. We quantified strain-level dynamics of 1,089 microbial species, complemented by 47,548 newly constructed metagenome-assembled genomes. Donor strain colonization and recipient strain resilience were mostly independent of clinical outcomes, but accurately predictable using LASSO-regularized regression models that accounted for host, microbiome and procedural variables. Recipient factors and donor–recipient complementarity, encompassing entire microbial communities to individual strains, were the main determinants of strain population dynamics, providing insights into the underlying processes that shape the post-FMT gut microbiome. Applying an ecology-based framework to our findings indicated parameters that may inform the development of more effective, targeted microbiome therapies in the future, and suggested how patient stratification can be used to enhance donor microbiota colonization or the displacement of recipient microbes in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4296025922,"The common view is that T lymphocytes activate telomerase to delay senescence. Here we show that some T cells (primarily naïve and central memory cells) elongated telomeres by acquiring telomere vesicles from antigen-presenting cells (APCs) independently of telomerase action. Upon contact with these T cells, APCs degraded shelterin to donate telomeres, which were cleaved by the telomere trimming factor TZAP, and then transferred in extracellular vesicles at the immunological synapse. Telomere vesicles retained the Rad51 recombination factor that enabled telomere fusion with T-cell chromosome ends lengthening them by an average of ~3,000 base pairs. Thus, there are antigen-specific populations of T cells whose ageing fate decisions are based on telomere vesicle transfer upon initial contact with APCs. These telomere-acquiring T cells are protected from senescence before clonal division begins, conferring long-lasting immune protection."
https://openalex.org/W4296038329,"The Natural Product Domain Seeker (NaPDoS) webtool detects and classifies ketosynthase (KS) and condensation domains from genomic, metagenomic, and amplicon sequence data. Unlike other tools, a phylogeny-based classification scheme is used to make broader predictions about the polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes in which these domains are found. NaPDoS is particularly useful for the analysis of incomplete biosynthetic genes or gene clusters, as are often observed in poorly assembled genomes and metagenomes, or when loci are not clustered, as in eukaryotic genomes. To help support the growing interest in sequence-based analyses of natural product biosynthetic diversity, here we introduce version 2 of the webtool, NaPDoS2, available at http://napdos.ucsd.edu/napdos2. This update includes the addition of 1417 KS sequences, representing a major expansion of the taxonomic and functional diversity represented in the webtool database. The phylogeny-based KS classification scheme now recognizes 41 class and subclass assignments, including new type II PKS subclasses. Workflow modifications accelerate run times, allowing larger datasets to be analyzed. In addition, default parameters were established using statistical validation tests to maximize KS detection and classification accuracy while minimizing false positives. We further demonstrate the applications of NaPDoS2 to assess PKS biosynthetic potential using genomic, metagenomic, and PCR amplicon datasets. These examples illustrate how NaPDoS2 can be used to predict biosynthetic potential and detect genes involved in the biosynthesis of specific structure classes or new biosynthetic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4295950911,"The liver has been studied extensively due to the broad number of diseases affecting its vital functions. However, therapeutic advances have been hampered by the lack of knowledge concerning human hepatic development. Here, we addressed this limitation by describing the developmental trajectories of different cell types that make up the human liver at single-cell resolution. These transcriptomic analyses revealed that sequential cell-to-cell interactions direct functional maturation of hepatocytes, with non-parenchymal cells playing essential roles during organogenesis. We utilized this information to derive bipotential hepatoblast organoids and then exploited this model system to validate the importance of signalling pathways in hepatocyte and cholangiocyte specification. Further insights into hepatic maturation also enabled the identification of stage-specific transcription factors to improve the functionality of hepatocyte-like cells generated from human pluripotent stem cells. Thus, our study establishes a platform to investigate the basic mechanisms directing human liver development and to produce cell types for clinical applications."

https://openalex.org/W4296039169,"Accurate identification and effective removal of unwanted variation is essential to derive meaningful biological results from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, especially when the data come from large and complex studies. Using RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we examined several sources of unwanted variation and demonstrate here how these can significantly compromise various downstream analyses, including cancer subtype identification, association between gene expression and survival outcomes and gene co-expression analysis. We propose a strategy, called pseudo-replicates of pseudo-samples (PRPS), for deploying our recently developed normalization method, called removing unwanted variation III (RUV-III), to remove the variation caused by library size, tumor purity and batch effects in TCGA RNA-seq data. We illustrate the value of our approach by comparing it to the standard TCGA normalizations on several TCGA RNA-seq datasets. RUV-III with PRPS can be used to integrate and normalize other large transcriptomic datasets coming from multiple laboratories or platforms."
https://openalex.org/W4296029724,"Here we introduce a mostly natural sequencing-by-synthesis (mnSBS) method for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), adapted to the Ultima genomics platform, and systematically benchmark it against current scRNA-seq technology. mnSBS uses mostly natural, unmodified nucleotides and only a low fraction of fluorescently labeled nucleotides, which allows for high polymerase processivity and lower costs. We demonstrate successful application in four scRNA-seq case studies of different technical and biological types, including 5' and 3' scRNA-seq, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a single individual and in multiplex, as well as Perturb-Seq. Benchmarking shows that results from mnSBS-based scRNA-seq are very similar to those using Illumina sequencing, with minor differences in results related to the position of reads relative to annotated gene boundaries, owing to single-end reads of Ultima being closer to gene ends than reads from Illumina. The method is thus compatible with state-of-the-art scRNA-seq libraries independent of the sequencing technology. We expect mnSBS to be of particular utility for cost-effective large-scale scRNA-seq projects."
https://openalex.org/W4296033645,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are attractive candidates for treating hepatic disorders given their potential to enhance liver regeneration and function. The paracrine paradigm may be involved in the mechanism of MSC-based therapy, and exosomes (Exo) play an important role in this paracrine activity. Hypoxia significantly improves the effectiveness of MSC transplantation. However, whether hypoxia preconditioned MSCs (Hp-MSCs) can enhance liver regeneration, and whether this enhancement is mediated by Exo, are unknown. In this study, mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and secreted Exo were injected through the tail vein. We report that Hp-MSCs promote liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in mice through their secreted exosomes. Interestingly, MSC-Exo were concentrated in liver 6 h after administration and mainly taken up by macrophages, but not hepatocytes. Compared with normoxic MSC-Exo (N-Exo), hypoxic MSC-Exo (Hp-Exo) enhanced M2 macrophage polarization both in vivo and in vitro. Microarray analysis revealed significant enrichment of microRNA (miR)-182-5p in Hp-Exo compared with that in N-Exo. In addition, miR-182-5p knockdown partially abolished the beneficial effect of Hp-Exo. Finally, Hp-MSC-derived exosomal miR-182-5p inhibited theprotein expression of forkhead box transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) in macrophages, which inhibited toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression and subsequently induced an anti-inflammatory response. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of Hp-Exo in liver regeneration and suggest that miR-182-5p from Hp-Exo facilitates macrophage polarization during liver regeneration by modulating the FOXO1/TLR4 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4296029905,"Abstract The storage of facial images in medical records poses privacy risks due to the sensitive nature of the personal biometric information that can be extracted from such images. To minimize these risks, we developed a new technology, called the digital mask (DM), which is based on three-dimensional reconstruction and deep-learning algorithms to irreversibly erase identifiable features, while retaining disease-relevant features needed for diagnosis. In a prospective clinical study to evaluate the technology for diagnosis of ocular conditions, we found very high diagnostic consistency between the use of original and reconstructed facial videos ( κ ≥ 0.845 for strabismus, ptosis and nystagmus, and κ = 0.801 for thyroid-associated orbitopathy) and comparable diagnostic accuracy ( P ≥ 0.131 for all ocular conditions tested) was observed. Identity removal validation using multiple-choice questions showed that compared to image cropping, the DM could much more effectively remove identity attributes from facial images. We further confirmed the ability of the DM to evade recognition systems using artificial intelligence-powered re-identification algorithms. Moreover, use of the DM increased the willingness of patients with ocular conditions to provide their facial images as health information during medical treatment. These results indicate the potential of the DM algorithm to protect the privacy of patients’ facial images in an era of rapid adoption of digital health technologies."
https://openalex.org/W4296034024,"Abstract Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase type 2α (PI3KC2α) and related class II PI3K isoforms are of increasing biomedical interest because of their crucial roles in endocytic membrane dynamics, cell division and signaling, angiogenesis, and platelet morphology and function. Herein we report the development and characterization of PhosphatidylInositol Three-kinase Class twO INhibitors (PITCOINs), potent and highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of PI3KC2α catalytic activity. PITCOIN compounds exhibit strong selectivity toward PI3KC2α due to their unique mode of interaction with the ATP-binding site of the enzyme. We demonstrate that acute inhibition of PI3KC2α-mediated synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates by PITCOINs impairs endocytic membrane dynamics and membrane remodeling during platelet-dependent thrombus formation. PITCOINs are potent and selective cell-permeable inhibitors of PI3KC2α function with potential biomedical applications ranging from thrombosis to diabetes and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4295537971,"Sepsis is an often life-threatening response to infection, occurring when host proinflammatory immune responses become abnormally elevated and dysregulated. To diagnose sepsis, the patient must have a confirmed or predicted infection, as well as other symptoms associated with the pathophysiology of sepsis. However, a recent study found that a specific causal organism could not be determined in the majority (70.1%) of sepsis cases, likely due to aggressive antibiotics or localized infections. The timing of a patient's sepsis diagnosis is often predictive of their clinical outcome, underlining the need for a more definitive molecular diagnostic test. Here, we outline the advantages and challenges to using bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), nanoscale spherical buds derived from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, as a diagnostic biomarker for Gram-negative sepsis. Advantages include OMV abundance, their robustness in the presence of antibiotics, and their unique features derived from their parent cell that could allow for differentiation between bacterial species. Challenges include the rigorous purification methods required to isolate OMVs from complex biofluids and the additional need to separate OMVs from similarly sized extracellular vesicles, which can share physical properties with OMVs."
https://openalex.org/W4296033646,"Recombinant protein-based vaccines are a valid and safer alternative to traditional vaccines based on live-attenuated or killed pathogens. However, the immune response of subunit vaccines is generally lower compared to that elicited by traditional vaccines and usually requires the use of adjuvants. The use of self-assembling protein nanoparticles, as a platform for vaccine antigen presentation, is emerging as a promising approach to enhance the production of protective and functional antibodies. In this work we demonstrated the successful repetitive antigen display of the C-terminal β-barrel domain of factor H binding protein, derived from serogroup B Meningococcus on the surface of different self-assembling nanoparticles using genetic fusion. Six nanoparticle scaffolds were tested, including virus-like particles with different sizes, geometries, and physicochemical properties. Combining computational and structure-based rational design we were able generate antigen-fused scaffolds that closely aligned with three-dimensional structure predictions. The chimeric nanoparticles were produced as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and evaluated for solubility, stability, self-assembly, and antigen accessibility using a variety of biophysical methods. Several scaffolds were identified as being suitable for genetic fusion with the β-barrel from fHbp, including ferritin, a de novo designed aldolase from Thermotoga maritima, encapsulin, CP3 phage coat protein, and the Hepatitis B core antigen. In conclusion, a systematic screening of self-assembling nanoparticles has been applied for the repetitive surface display of a vaccine antigen. This work demonstrates the capacity of rational structure-based design to develop new chimeric nanoparticles and describes a strategy that can be utilized to discover new nanoparticle-based approaches in the search for vaccines against bacterial pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W4296028472,"The aim of this study is to compare acute effects of consuming extra virgin coconut oil (EVCO) as a source of medium chain fatty acids and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) as a source of long chain fatty acids in normal weight and obese subjects.Randomised, crossover design.Metabolically healthy twenty male subjects (10 normal weight; 10 obese) aged 19-40 years.Subjects consumed breakfast meals containing skimmed milk, fat-free white cheese, bread and EVCO (25 g) or EVOO (25 g).Visual analog scale evaluations, resting metabolic rate measurements and selected blood parameters analysis (glucose, triglyceride, insulin and plasma peptide YY) were performed before and after the test breakfast meals. In addition, energy intakes were evaluated by ad libitum lunch meal at 180 min.Visual analogue scale values of hunger and desire to eat decreased significantly after EVCO consumption than EVOO consumption in normal weight subjects at 180 min. There was an increase trend in plasma PYY at 30 and 180 min after EVCO breakfast compared to EVOO breakfast. Ad libitum energy intakes after EVCO and EVOO consumption in normal weight subjects were 924 ± 302; 845 ± 158 kcal (p = 0.272), respectively whereas in obese subjects were 859 ± 238; 994 ± 265 kcal (p = 0.069) respectively.The results of this study shows that consumption of EVCO compared to EVOO may have suppressive effect on hunger and desire to eat, may affect postprandial PYY levels differently and have no effect on postprandial energy expenditure.Clinical Trials NCT04738929."
https://openalex.org/W4296026574,"Herein, we developed a single and a duplex TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR) for absolute quantification of copy numbers of integrated dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (mdhfr-ts) drug selectable marker for pyrimethamine resistance in Toxoplasma gondii knockouts (KOs). The single TaqMan qPCR amplifies a 174 bp DNA fragment of the inserted mdhfr-ts and of the wild-type (WT) dhfr-ts (wtdhfr-ts) which is present as single copy gene in Toxoplasma and encodes a sensitive enzyme to pyrimethamine. Thus, the copy number of the dhfr-ts fragment in a given DNA quantity from KO parasites with a single site-specific integration should be twice the number of dhfr-ts copies recorded in the same DNA quantity from WT parasites. The duplex TaqMan qPCR allows simultaneous amplification of the 174 bp dhfr-ts fragment and the T. gondii 529-bp repeat element. Accordingly, for a WT DNA sample, the determined number of tachyzoites given by dhfr-ts amplification is equal to the number of tachyzoites determined by amplification of the Toxoplasma 529-bp, resulting thus in a ratio of 1. However, for a KO clone having a single site-specific integration of mdhfr-ts, the calculated ratio is 2. We then applied both approaches to test T. gondii RH mutants in which the major surface antigen (SAG1) was disrupted through insertion of mdhfr-ts using CRISPR-Cas9. Results from both assays were in correlation showing a high accuracy in detecting KOs with multiple integrated mdhfr-ts. Southern blot analyses using BsaBI and DraIII confirmed qPCRs results. Both TaqMan qPCRs are needed for reliable diagnostic of T. gondii KOs following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis, particularly with respect to off-target effects resulting from multiple insertions of mdhfr-ts. The principle of the duplex TaqMan qPCR is applicable for other selectable markers in Toxoplasma. TaqMan qPCR tools may contribute to more frequent use of WT Toxoplasma strains during functional genomics."
https://openalex.org/W4296030004,"Little is known about the impact of ostomy formation in inflammatory bowel disease patients on course of disease, psychological well-being, quality of life and working capacity.We analyzed patients over a follow-up of up to 16 years in the Swiss inflammatory bowel disease cohort study (SIBDCS) with prospective data collection. We compared Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients with and without ostomy as well as permanent and closed stoma formation before and after surgery, investigating disease activity, psychological wellbeing and working capacity in a case-control design.Of 3825 SIBDCS patients, 176 with ostomy were included in the study and matched with 176 patients without ostomy using propensity score, equaling 352 patients for the analysis. As expected, we observed a lower mean and maximal disease activity in patients after stoma surgery compared with control patients without stoma. Overall, psychological wellbeing in patients with stomas vs. controls as well as patients with permanent vs. closed stoma was similar in terms of disease-specific quality of life (total score of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Life questionnaire), psychological distress (total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and stress at work (effort-reward-imbalance ratio), with the exception of a higher Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale total score in patient with vs. without stoma. Compared to IBD patients without stoma, the adverse impact on working capacity in overall stoma IBD patients appeared to be modest. However we observe a significantly higher reduction in working capacity in permanent vs. closed stoma in CD but not UC patients.As to be expected, IBD patients may benefit from closed and permanent stoma application. Stoma surgery appears to only modestly impact working capacity. Importantly, stoma surgery was not associated with adverse psychological outcomes, with comparable psychological well-being regardless of presence and type of stoma."
https://openalex.org/W4296033027,"The IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF family of cytokines play an essential role in the growth, differentiation, and effector functions of multiple hematopoietic cell types. Receptors in this family are composed of cytokine-specific α chains and a common β chain (CSF2RB), responsible for the majority of downstream signaling. CSF2RB abundance and stability influence the magnitude of the cellular response to cytokine stimulation, but the exact mechanisms of regulation are not well understood. Here, we use genetic screens in multiple cellular contexts and cytokine conditions to identify STUB1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and CHIC2 as regulators of CSF2RB ubiquitination and protein stability. We demonstrate that Stub1 and Chic2 form a complex that binds Csf2rb and that genetic inactivation of either Stub1 or Chic2 leads to reduced ubiquitination of Csf2rb. The effects of Stub1 and Chic2 on Csf2rb were greatest at reduced cytokine concentrations, suggesting that Stub1/Chic2-mediated regulation of Csf2rb is a mechanism of reducing cell surface accumulation when cytokine levels are low. Our study uncovers a mechanism of CSF2RB regulation through ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation and describes a role for CHIC2 in the regulation of a cytokine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W4296033512,"Infection with the respiratory pathogen influenza A virus (IAV) causes significant morbidity and mortality each year. While host genotype is thought to contribute to severity of disease, naturally occurring genetic determinants remain mostly unknown. Moreover, more severe disease is seen in women compared with men, but genetic mechanisms underlying this sex difference remain obscure. Here, using IAV infection in a mouse model of naturally selected genetic diversity, namely C57BL6/J (B6) mice carrying chromosomes (Chr) derived from the wild-derived and genetically divergent PWD/PhJ (PWD) mouse strain (B6.ChrPWD consomic mice), we examined the effects of genotype and sex on severity of IAV-induced disease. Compared with B6, parental PWD mice were completely protected from IAV-induced disease, a phenotype that was fully recapitulated in the B6.Chr16PWD strain carrying the PWD-derived allele of Mx1. In contrast, several other consomic strains, including B6.Chr3PWD and B6.Chr5PWD, demonstrated greatly increased susceptibility. Notably, B6.Chr5PWD and B6.ChrX.3PWD strains, the latter carrying the distal one-third of ChrX from PWD, exhibited increased morbidity and mortality specifically in male but not female mice. Follow up analyses focused on B6 and B6.ChrX.3PWD strains demonstrated moderately elevated viral load in B6.ChrX3PWD male, but not female mice. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated genotype- and sex-specific gene expression profiles in the infected lung, with male B6.ChrX.3 mice exhibiting the most significant changes, including upregulation of a proinflammatory gene expression program associated with myeloid cells, and altered sex-biased expression of several X-linked genes that represent positional candidates, including Tlr13 and Slc25a53. Taken together, our results identify novel loci on autosomes and the X chromosome regulating IAV susceptibility and demonstrate that sex differences in IAV susceptibility are genotype-dependent, suggesting that future genetic association studies need to consider sex as a covariate."
https://openalex.org/W4296036285,"The population of patients with cancer requiring palliative care (PC) is on the rise in India. Family caregivers will be essential members of the care team in the provision of PC.We aimed to characterize provider perspectives of the challenges that Indian families face in taking on a palliative caregiving role.Data for this analysis came from an evaluation of the PC-PAICE project, a series of quality improvement interventions for PC in India. We conducted 44 in-depth semi-structured interviews with organizational leaders and clinical team members at seven geographically and structurally diverse settings. Through thematic content analysis, themes relating to the caregivers' role were identified using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches.Contextual challenges to taking up the PC caregiving role included family members' limited knowledge about PC and cancer, the necessity of training for caregiving responsibilities, and cultural preferences for pursuing curative treatments over palliative ones. Some logistical challenges include financial, time, and mental health limitations that family caregivers may encounter when navigating the expectations of taking on the caregiving role. Strategies to facilitate family buy-in for PC provision include adopting a family care model, connecting them to services provided by Non-Governmental Organizations, leveraging volunteers and social workers to foster PC awareness and training, and responding specifically to family's requests.Understanding and addressing the various challenges that families face in adopting the caregiver role are essential steps in the provision and expansion of PC in India. Locally initiated quality improvement projects can be a way to address these challenges based on the context."

https://openalex.org/W4296039483,"Human and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV and BRSV) are closely genetically related and cause respiratory disease in their respective host. Whereas HRSV vaccines are still under development, a multitude of BRSV vaccines are used to reduce clinical signs. To enable the design of vaccination protocols to entirely stop virus circulation, we aimed to investigate the duration, character and efficacy of the immune responses induced by natural infections. The systemic humoral immunity was monitored every two months during two years in 33 dairy cattle in different age cohorts following a natural BRSV outbreak, and again in selected individuals before and after a second outbreak, four years later. Local humoral and systemic cellular responses were also monitored, although less extensively. Based on clinical observations and economic losses linked to decreased milk production, the outbreaks were classified as moderate. Following the first outbreak, most but not all animals developed neutralising antibody responses, BRSV-specific IgG1, IgG2 and HRSV F- and HRSV N-reactive responses that lasted at least two years, and in some cases at least four years. In contrast, no systemic T cell responses were detected and only weak IgA responses were detected in some animals. Seronegative sentinels remained negative, inferring that no new infections occurred between the outbreaks. During the second outbreak, reinfections with clinical signs and virus shedding occurred, but the signs were milder, and the virus shedding was significantly lower than in naïve animals. Whereas the primary infection induced similar antibody titres against the prefusion and the post fusion form of the BRSV F protein, memory responses were significantly stronger against prefusion F. In conclusion, even if natural infections induce a long-lasting immunity, it would probably be necessary to boost memory responses between outbreaks, to stop the circulation of the virus and limit the potential role of previously infected adult cattle in the chain of BRSV transmission."

Here, we set out to determine the interaction between a purified recombinant full length NS3 and synthetic guanine-rich substrates that represent the conserved G-quadruplex (G4)-forming sequences in the HCV-positive and HCV-negative strands. We performed fluorescence anisotropy binding, G4 reporter duplex unwinding, and G4RNA trapping assays to determine the binding and G4 unfolding activity of NS3.

Brosh R.M. Mergny J.-L. Survey and summary G-quadruplexes and helicases.Nucl. Acids Res. 2016; 44: 1989-2006Google Scholar). G4 structures are formed when tandem repeats of guanine bases of an RNA or a DNA molecule interact with one another through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form a planer structure known as a quartet or a tetrad (10Rhodes D. Lipps H.J. G-quadruplexes and their regulatory roles in Biology.Nucl. Acids Res. 2015; 43: 8627-8637Google Scholar). When two or more tetrads stack on top of each other, they form a stable G4 (9Mendoza O. Bourdoncle A. Bouí J.-B. Brosh R.M. Mergny J.-L. Survey and summary G-quadruplexes and helicases.Nucl.

The regulation and functions of DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 459-474Google Scholar). G-quadruplex RNA (G4RNA) is more stable than its counterpart G4DNA (11Kharel P. Balaratnam S. Beals N. Basu S. The role of RNA G-quadruplexes in human diseases and therapeutic strategies.Wiley Inter. Rev. RNA. 2020; 11: e1568Google Scholar). G4 stability is determined by the number of tetrads, loop length, and the number of strands involved in forming the tetrad (10Rhodes D. Lipps H.J. G-quadruplexes and their regulatory roles in Biology.Nucl. Acids Res. 2015; 43: 8627-8637Google Scholar, 11Kharel P. Balaratnam S. Beals N. Basu S. The role of RNA G-quadruplexes in human diseases and therapeutic strategies.Wiley Inter. Rev. RNA. 2020; 11: e1568Google Scholar). G4 is also stabilized by monovalent cations such as K+ and Na+ that coordinate in the central channel of the four-stranded structure (11Kharel P. Balaratnam S. Beals N. Basu S. The role of RNA G-quadruplexes in human diseases and therapeutic strategies.Wiley Inter. Rev. RNA. 2020; 11: e1568Google Scholar). Quadruplexes can further be stabilized by ligands such as Phen-DC3, NMM, TMPyP4, Pyridostatin (PDS) (9Mendoza O. Bourdoncle A. Bouí J.-B. Brosh R.M. Mergny J.-L. Survey and summary G-quadruplexes and helicases.Nucl. Acids Res. 2016; 44: 1989-2006Google Scholar, 11Kharel P. Balaratnam S. Beals N. Basu S. The role of RNA G-quadruplexes in human diseases and therapeutic strategies.Wiley Inter. Rev. RNA. 2020; 11: e1568Google Scholar). In addition to the human genome, viral genomes could also harbor G4 structures (14Lavezzo E. Berselli M. Frasson I. Perrone R. Palù G. Brazzale A.R. et al.G-Quadruplex forming sequences in the genome of all known human viruses: a comprehensive guide.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2018; 14e1006675Google Scholar). Recently, Lavezzo et al. explored the presence of potential G4-forming sequences in the genome of all human viruses discovered so far (14Lavezzo E. Berselli M. Frasson I. Perrone R. Palù G. Brazzale A.R. et al.G-Quadruplex forming sequences in the genome of all known human viruses: a comprehensive guide.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2018; 14e1006675Google Scholar). The G4s in the genome of viruses could regulate translation, replication, and capsid formation (11Kharel P. Balaratnam S. Beals N. Basu S. The role of RNA G-quadruplexes in human diseases and therapeutic strategies.Wiley Inter. Rev. RNA. 2020; 11: e1568Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analysis on a number of HCV genotypes and subtypes revealed that both the positive and negative strands of the HCV genome contained conserved G4-forming sequences (15Wang S.R. Min Y.Q. Wang J.Q. Liu C.X. Fu B.S. Wu F. et al.A highly conserved G-rich consensus sequence in hepatitis C virus core gene represents a new anti–hepatitis C target.Sci.

Mergny J.L. et al.RNA synthesis is modulated by G-quadruplex formation in Hepatitis C virus negative RNA strand.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 8120Google Scholar). Folded G4s within viral genomes, particularly those stabilized further with ligands, could deter successful viral replication (15Wang S.R. Min Y.Q. Wang J.Q. Liu C.X. Fu B.S.

A dynamic G-quadruplex region regulates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.J. Med. Chem. 2013; 56: 6521-6530Google Scholar). As a result, viruses need to control the folding and unfolding of these nucleic acid structures in a regulated manner. There are several helicases reported to have the ability to unfold RNA or/and DNA G4s (20Sauer M. Paeschke K. G-quadruplex unwinding helicases and their function in vivo.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2017; 45: 1173-1182Google Scholar, 21Caterino M. Paeschke K. Action and function of helicases on RNA G-quadruplexes.Methods. 2022; 204: 110-125Google Scholar). For instance, helicases of the same family as NS3, such as DHX36 and DHX9, unfold G4RNAs (21Caterino M. Paeschke K.

RNA G-quadruplex is resolved by repetitive and ATP-dependent mechanism of DHX36.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 1855Google Scholar). By unfolding these stable secondary structures, helicases remove the roadblocks to translation machineries (26Liu H. Lu Y.N. Paul T. Periz G. Banco M.T. Ferré-D’Amaré A.R. et al.A helicase unwinds hexanucleotide repeat RNA G-quadruplexes and facilitates repeat-associated non-AUG translation.J. Am. Chem.

HCV replication takes places at a vesicle termed the “membranous web (28Gosert R. Egger D. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. Blum H.E. Bienz K. et al.Identification of the hepatitis C virus RNA replication complex in Huh-7 cells harboring subgenomic replicons.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5487-5492Google Scholar)”. It is likely that NS3 is the only helicase inside the vesical because, according to the model proposed by Quinkert et al., only molecules of a specific size (not bigger than 16 kDa) can enter through the “neck’ of the membranous web into the vesicle where replication takes place (29Quinkert D. Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. Quantitative analysis of the hepatitis C virus replication complex.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13594-13605Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that HCV uses its own helicase (NS3) to unfold the conserved G4 structures within its genome to allow effective replication. In our study, we investigated the activity of NS3 on G4RNA-forming sequences derived from the positive or the negative strand of HCV. Our data suggests that NS3 unfolds G4RNA. However, its G4RNA-unfolding activity is significantly reduced when the G4 is inherently stable or stabilized with a G4 ligand. To determine whether and how NS3 interacts with G4RNA, we first design three different G-rich sequences: HCVG4, NEGG4, and NONHCVG4 (see Table S1 for sequences). HCVG4 contains the G-rich sequences from the positive strand of genotype 3a (15Wang S.R. Min Y.Q. Wang J.Q. Liu C.X. Fu B.S. Wu F. et al.A highly conserved G-rich consensus sequence in hepatitis C virus core gene represents a new anti–hepatitis C target.Sci. Adv. 2016; 2e1501535Google Scholar) that can theoretically form a three-tetrad G4 structure. NEGG4 substrate contains the conserved G-rich sequences from the negative strand of various strains of HCV (16Jaubert C. Bedrat A. Bartolucci L. Di Primo C. Ventura M. Mergny J.L. et al.RNA synthesis is modulated by G-quadruplex formation in Hepatitis C virus negative RNA strand.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 8120Google Scholar) and has the potential to form a two-tetrad G4 structure. Unlike HCVG4 and NEGG4, NONHCVG4 does not represent a sequence from HCV; however, it is a useful model substrate because it can potentially fold into a highly stable three-tetrad G4 since it has only one nucleotide loop length. For G4RNA structures containing relatively shorter loops, loop length has an inverse relationship with G4 stability (30Pandey S. Agarwala P. Maiti S. Effect of loops and G-quartets on the stability of RNA G-quadruplexes.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2013; 117: 6896-6905Google Scholar). Therefore, the shorter loop length results in more stable G4. NONHCVG4 was included in this study to understand how NS3 interacts with an RNA substrate that is likely to fold into an inherently stable G4. The helicase domain of NS3 interacts with oligonucleotides in an orientation-specific manner (31Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. Characterization of RNA binding activity and RNA helicase activity of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 654-659Google Scholar, 32Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. The helicase activity associated with hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 3 (NS3).J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Google Scholar, 33Levin M.K. Gurjar M. Patel S.S. A Brownian motor mechanism of translocation and strand separation by hepatitis C virus helicase.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 429-435Google Scholar). For instance, Levin and Patel reported that the HCV helicase bound to a duplex DNA substrate containing a 3′ overhang around 50 times tighter than a similar substrate with a 5′ overhang (33Levin M.K. Gurjar M. Patel S.S. A Brownian motor mechanism of translocation and strand separation by hepatitis C virus helicase.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 429-435Google Scholar). In addition, Tai et al. and Gwack et al. independently demonstrated that effective duplex substrate–unwinding activity of NS3 helicase was dependent on the presence of a 3′ overhang (31Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. Characterization of RNA binding activity and RNA helicase activity of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 654-659Google Scholar, 32Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. The helicase activity associated with hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 3 (NS3).J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Google Scholar). Therefore, a 3′ overhang has a significant effect on the affinity and activity of NS3 on a partial duplex. With the aim of understanding the effect of a 3′ overhang on the interaction between NS3 and G4RNA, 20 nucleotide (nt) adenosine monophosphates (A20) were added to each of the above three substrates to form HCVG4-A20, NEGG4-A20, and NONHCVG4-A20. CD spectra of all of the G-rich substrates mentioned above indicate that the sequences fold into a parallel G4 structures in 100 mM KCl (Fig. 1). A parallel G4 possesses a distinct CD spectrum with a peak around 265 nm and a valley around 240 nm (34Kypr J. Kejnovská I. Renčiuk D. Vorlíčková M. Circular dichroism and conformational polymorphism of DNA.Nucl. Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1713-1725Google Scholar, 35Oliver A.W. Kneale G.G. Structural characterization of DNA and RNA sequences recognized by the gene 5 protein of bacteriophage fd.Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 525-531Google Scholar, 36Del Villar-Guerra R. Trent J.O. Chaires J.B. G-quadruplex secondary structure obtained from circular dichroism spectroscopy.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2018; 57: 7171-7175Google Scholar). We conclude that the presence of 20-nt adenosine monophosphates at the 3′ end of HCVG4, NEGG4, or NONHCVG4 does not hinder the formation of a parallel G4. To test whether NS3 binds to the G4RNA structures, a fluorescence anisotropy–binding assay was performed in 100 mM KCl binding buffer containing fluorescently labeled HCVG4, NEGG4, or NONHCVG4 and increasing concentration of NS3. NS3 bound tightly to the ssRNA, A20-3′FAM, with similar affinity (Kd = 6 ± 1 nM) to what was reported in the past for NS3 binding to a ssRNA (37Beran R.K.F. Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. The serine protease domain of hepatitis C viral NS3 activates RNA helicase activity by promoting the binding of RNA substrate.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34913-34920Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Because A20 has the highest amplitude and two NS3 molecules could potentially bind to the same oligonucleotide (based on eight nucleotides-binding site size for NS3 (38Raney V.M. Reynolds K.A. Harrison M.K. Harrison D.K. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. Binding by the hepatitis C virus NS3 helicase partially melts duplex DNA.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 7596-7607Google Scholar, 39Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Helicase from hepatitis C virus, energetics of DNA binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Google Scholar)), we also fit the data points to a two-sites binding model and determined the Kd1 and Kd2 to be 4.9 nM and 860 nM, respectively (Fig. S1). NS3 bound to HCVG4, NEGG4, or NONHCVG4 tightly with Kd values in the nano-molar range (Kd = 17 ± 4 nM, 19 ± 5 nM, and 23 ± 7 nM, respectively) (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). Similarly, NS3 binds tightly to the 3′ overhang–containing substrates, HCVG4-A20, NEGG4-A20, or NONHCVG4-A20 (Kd= 11 ± 3 nM, 6 ± 2 nM, and 12 ± 3 nM, respectively) (Fig. 2, A, C, and D). The binding affinity of NS3 to the 3′ overhang containing substrates is within two-fold of the single-stranded substrate. However, the substrates that lack a 3′ overhang bind to NS3 with a dissociation constant as high as four-fold than the ssRNA substrate. Nonetheless, the absence of a single-strand protein-loading zone does not prevent the NS3 from binding to the G4-forming substrates. Unfolding of a G4 structure requires a reaction buffer containing enough cations to maintain the folding of the G4 during the span of the reaction. Therefore, it is necessary to first verify the activity of the helicase in a buffer in which the G-rich oligonucleotides fold to form a stable G4. Several previous studies that examined the interaction of a helicase with a G4-forming oligonucleotides reported of using a buffer containing 100 mM KCl (26Liu H. Lu Y.N. Paul T. Periz G. Banco M.T. Ferré-D’Amaré A.R. et al.A helicase unwinds hexanucleotide repeat RNA G-quadruplexes and facilitates repeat-associated non-AUG translation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021; 143: 7368-7379Google Scholar, 40Griffin W.C. Gao J. Byrd A.K. Chib S. Raney K.D. A biochemical and biophysical model of G-quadruplex DNA recognition by positive coactivator of transcription 4.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 9567-9582Google Scholar, 41Yangyuoru P.M. Bradburn D.A. Liu Z. Xiao T.S. Russell R. The G-quadruplex (G4) resolvase DHX36 efficiently and specifically disrupts DNA G4s via a translocation-based helicase mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 1924-1932Google Scholar). Therefore, we first determined the ATPase activity of a recombinant NS3 protein in 100 mM KCl buffer by conducting enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric ATPase assay that links ATP hydrolysis with the oxidation of NADH (Fig. 3A). In saturating conditions, which is the concentration of Poly (U) at which the specific activity is maximum, NS3 has ATPase activity of 52.5 ± 1.8 s−1 in low salt (50 mM KCl) buffer and 49.8 ± 5.0 s−1 in high salt (100 mM KCl) buffer, which is not significantly different (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the purified NS3 is as active at high salt concentration as it is at low salt concentration. To test whether NS3 can unfold G4-forming substrates to which it binds, we conducted a G4 reporter duplex unwinding assay. A radiolabeled–G4 reporter duplex substrate that contains the G-rich sequences from HCVG4, NEGG4, or NONHCVG4 oligonucleotides flanked by a 25 base pair duplex region and A20 3′ overhang was made as described in the Experimental procedures and illustrated in Fig. S2. Three nucleotides were added as a linker between the duplex region and the G4-forming sequences to allow proper folding of the G4 structure. The reporter substrate was incubated with the enzyme and the reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP (Fig. 4, A and B). In the reporter assay, the unfolding of the G4 structure by the enzyme is reported by the unwinding of the duplex region (Fig. 4B). Initially, we evaluated the amount of NS3 needed for the G4 reporter assay to saturate the substrate. We carried out the G4 reporter assay with varying concentrations of NS3 (400 nM, 600 nM, 800 nM, or 1000 nM) and 2 nM HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex substrate. The product formed from 400 nM NS3 was significantly lower than the product formed from the other NS3 concentrations; however, the amount of products obtained from 600 nM, 800 nM, and 1000 nM NS3 are not significantly different (Figs. 4, C, D and S3), suggesting 600 nM NS3 is enough to saturate the substrate. Consequently, 600 nM NS3 is the concentration used for subsequent dsRNA or G4 reporter duplex unwinding reactions. We used these reaction conditions as our standard condition: 600 nM NS3 incubated with 2 nM-radiolabeled HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex substrate in a buffer containing 100 mM KCl (Fig. 5A). Under standard conditions, NS3 unwinds HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex with an amplitude of product formation of 50 ± 1% at 20 min. The product formation is drastically reduced to 11 ± 1% when 0.25 μM PDS, a known G4-stabilizing ligand, is added to the reaction (Fig. 5, B and C). The same concentration of PDS has less effect on the activity of NS3 on a partial duplex substrate with the same length and sequence as the HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex, except that the guanines within the G-rich sequence are mutated to adenine (MUTHCVG4-A20; Table S1 and Fig. S4). For the HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex unwinding, there is a small (<5%) but measurable amount of product observed in the absence of ATP during the course of the reaction. In contrast, virtually no product is measured in the absence of NS3, suggesting that the product observed under the standard reaction conditions is driven by the enzyme. Interestingly, some product is measured from the zero second-time point (Fig. 5B). It is possible that this product is formed during preincubation in an ATP-independent manner. Reynolds et al. reported NS3 unwinding of 3′- or 5′-tailed short duplexes in an ATP-independent manner and proposed a noncanonical duplex melting mechanism by NS3, which involved local strand separation utilizing binding energy (42Reynolds K.A. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. Melting of duplex DNA in the absence of ATP by NS3 helicase domain through specific interaction with a single-strand/double-strand junction.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 4248-4258Google Scholar). Therefore, the product we observe from the G4 reporter duplex unwinding reaction in the absence of ATP could be due to NS3 binding and unwinding of the duplex region adjacent to the G4 structure in an ATP-independent manner. A single-turnover reaction involves product formation by the actions of NS3 molecules that are bound to the substrate at the initiation of the reaction. To create single-turnover reaction conditions, a protein trap is added in the reaction buffer to keep the dissociated NS3 molecules from rebinding to the substrate. The amount of product formed from a single-turnover reaction indicates the level of processivity of NS3 with the substrate studied. Under single-turnover conditions, 11 ± 1% product is formed from HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex, which is a 78% reduction from the product measured under a multi-turnover reaction condition in which NS3 molecules are allowed to bind, unwind, dissociate, and rebind for another cycle of enzymatic action (Fig. 6, A and B). The low product formation from the single-turnover reaction indicates NS3 might need to undergo a series of association and dissociation events from the substrate in order to unfold the G4 and then unwind the adjacent duplex region. Unlike KCl and NaCl, LiCl does not support the formation of a stable G4 (43Bhattacharyya D. Arachchilage G.M. Basu S. Metal cations in G-quadruplex folding and stability.Front. Chem. 2016; 4: 38Google Scholar). To test the effect of not having a stable G4 on the unfolding activity of NS3, we allowed the enzyme to unfold the same substrate, HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex, in 100 mM LiCl reaction buffer, which resulted in 91 ± 2% product formation (Fig. 6, C and D). The product obtained in 100 mM KCl is significantly lower than in 100 mM LiCl, implying that a stable G4 could be a formidable barrier, keeping the NS3 from unwinding the adjoining duplex region of the G4 reporter duplex substrate. In addition to the external factors discussed above, the length of the 3′ overhang could also regulate the G4-unfolding activity of NS3. Efficient partial duplex unwinding by NS3 is highly dependent on the length of the 3′ overhang; the longer the tail, the higher the unwinding amplitude (44Zhou T. Ren X. Adams R.L. Pyle A.M. NS3 from hepatitis C virus strain JFH-1 is an unusually robust helicase that is primed to bind and unwind viral RNA.J. Virol. 2018; 92e01253-17Google Scholar). In order to investigate the effect of the length of a 3′ overhang on G4-unfolding activity of NS3, a G4 reporter duplex unwinding reaction was conducted with HCVG4 reporter substrate containing 20-nt, 9-nt, or 2-nt 3′ overhangs. We observed 50 ± 1%, 40 ± 3%, and 20 ± 2% product at 20 min for substrates with 20-nt, 9-nt, and 2-nt of 3′ overhangs, respectively, in a multi-turnover reaction (Fig. 7). The result strongly implies that the length of the single-strand extension is important for efficient unfolding of a G4 by NS3. Under multi-turnover conditions, 82 ± 4% of the MUTHCVG4-A20 control duplex is unwound, which is significantly higher than the product obtained from HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex substrate (50 ± 1%) (Fig. 8, A and B). In addition, the fraction of the duplex substrate unwound under single-turnover conditions was considerably higher than the amount of G4 containing reporter duplex unwound (Fig. 8, A and B). This higher activity of NS3 with the control duplex substrate than with the G4 reporter duplex implies that the helicase is more processive on the former than on the later. It also indicates that G4 is a strong deterrent for helicase progression. Unlike for HCVG4-A20 reporter duplex unwi"
https://openalex.org/W4296017078,"Invasive fungal infections, which pose a serious threat to human health, are increasingly associated with a high mortality rate and elevated health care costs, owing to rising resistance to current antifungals and emergence of multidrug-resistant fungal species. Candida glabrata is the second to fourth common cause of Candida bloodstream infections. Its high propensity to acquire resistance toward two mainstream drugs, azoles (inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis) and echinocandins (target cell wall), in clinical settings, and its inherent low azole susceptibility render antifungal therapy unsuccessful in many cases. Here, we demonstrate a pivotal role for the SET {suppressor of variegation 3 to 9 [Su(var)3-9], enhancer of zeste [E(z)], and trithorax (Trx)} domain-containing protein, CgSet4, in azole and echinocandin resistance via negative regulation of multidrug transporter-encoding and ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG) genes through the master transcriptional factors CgPdr1 and CgUpc2A, respectively. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that C. glabrata responds to caspofungin (CSP; echinocandin antifungal) stress by downregulation and upregulation of ERG and cell wall organization genes, respectively. Although CgSet4 acts as a repressor of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway via CgUPC2A transcriptional downregulation, the CSP-induced ERG gene repression is not dependent on CgSet4, as CgSet4 showed diminished abundance on the CgUPC2A promoter in CSP-treated cells. Furthermore, we show a role for the last three enzymes of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, CgErg3, CgErg5, and CgErg4, in antifungal susceptibility and virulence in C. glabrata. Altogether, our results unveil the link between ergosterol biosynthesis and echinocandin resistance and have implications for combination antifungal therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4296025985,"Engineered nanomaterials pose occupational health and environmental concerns as they possess unique physical and chemical properties that can contribute to toxicity. High throughput toxicity screening methods are needed to address the increasing number of nanomaterials in production. Here we used a zebrafish photomotor response (PMR) test to evaluate a set of fifteen nanomaterials with military relevance. Automated dechorionation of zebrafish embryos was used to enhance nanomaterials bioavailability. Optimal PMR activity in zebrafish embryos was found at 30–31 hours post-fertilization (hpf). Behavioral and toxicological responses were measured at 30 and 120 hpf; behavioral responses were found for thirteen of the fifteen nanomaterials and acute toxicity (LC50) levels for nine of the fifteen nanomaterials below the maximum test concentration of 500 μg/ml. Physico-chemical characterization of the nanomaterials detected endotoxin and bacterial contamination in two of the tested samples, which may have contributed to observed toxicity and reinforces the need for physical and chemical characterization of nanomaterials use in toxicity testing. The zebrafish PMR test, together with automated dechorionation, provides an initial rapid assessment of the behavioral effects and toxicity of engineered nanomaterials that can be followed up by physico-chemical characterization if toxicity is detected, reducing the amount of time and monetary constraints of physico-chemical testing."
https://openalex.org/W4296026133,"Shipping emissions have aroused wide concern in the world. In order to promote the implementation of emission regulations, this study develop a ship based sniffing technique to perform remote measurement of the SO 2 , NO x and CO 2 from ships entering and leaving Shanghai port at the open sea. The ship emission prediction model, Smoke diffusion model and source identification model were developed to automatically analyze the emission data and screen the object ship source based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) system. The fueling documents of the detected ship were obtained from maritime sector and the results precision of the sniffer technique was evaluated by comparing the measured Fuel sulfur content (FSC) with actual value deduced from fueling documents. The influences of wind speed and direction, object ship parameters and monitoring distance on the identification of object ship and accuracy of the calculated FSC were thoroughly investigated and the corresponding correction factors under different conditions were deduced. The modified emission factor ratio of CO 2 to NOx were proposed in order to improve the accuracy. It is demonstrated that with wind speed higher than 2 m/s and test distance shorter than 400m, the sniffer technique exhibit high efficiency and accuracy for the remote emissions measurement of ship upwind with detection rate higher than 90% and test error of FSC below 15%. To reduce the influence of the wind direction, at least two sniffer systems were required to guarantee that at least one station is in the downwind of the ship lane. Based on the results and discussion, a novel sniffer monitoring system with two buoy based sniffing stations placed close to each side of the ship lane far off shore was proposed to realize the remote monitoring of ship emissions."
https://openalex.org/W4296026519,"Under most natural marine conditions, phytoplankton cells suspended in the water column are too distantly spaced for direct competition for resources (i.e., overlapping cell boundary layers) to be a routine occurrence. Accordingly, resource-based competitive exclusion should be rare. In contrast, contemporary ecosystem models typically predict an exclusion of larger phytoplankton size classes under low-nutrient conditions, an outcome interpreted as reflecting the competitive advantage of small cells having much higher nutrient 'affinities' than larger cells. Here, we develop mechanistically-focused expressions for steady-state, nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth that are consistent with the discrete, distantly-spaced cells of natural populations. These expressions, when encompassed in a phytoplankton-zooplankton model, yield sustained diversity across all size classes over the full range in nutrient concentrations observed in the ocean. In other words, our model does not exhibit resource-based competitive exclusion between size classes previously associated with size-dependent differences in nutrient 'affinities'."
https://openalex.org/W4296026752,"Accession of Poland to the European Single Market generated trade creation and diversion effects, which in turn resulted in a high degree of concentration of the Polish foreign trade in agri-food products with other EU countries. On the one hand, a high share of export to the markets of countries with a stable market economy is a confirmation of the Polish agri-food sector's capacity to compete on the foreign markets. On the other hand, when considering limited capability to increase food demand in the EU it provides grounds for the assumption that further export expansion to a considerable extent will depend on the potential expansion of sale to non-EU markets. In this context significant issues include diversification of target markets and search for prospective markets outside the EU, while they also determine directions of an advantageous export specialization. In the period up to 2021 the USA was the fourth non-EU export partner of Poland in the agri-food sector after the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Russia. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the level of comparative advantages of the Polish agri-food sector on the EU and US markets in 2004-2021 using Widodo's products mapping technique. The study used statistical data from the ComExt database of the European Statistical Office (Eurostat). The conducted studies showed Polish export specializations in the transatlantic trade, as confirmed by high comparative advantages, as well as a positive and steadily improving trade balances for food preparations, including meat, cereal, fruit and vegetable, as well as confectionery preparations, and less processed animal origin products (meat and offal as well as dairy produce). Poland had a disadvantageous competitive position in trade of products complementary in relation to domestic production, which import was necessary. In view of the comparative cost theory the directions of the realized export specialization were rational and should be maintained. While in trade with the other EU countries the competitive position of the Polish agri-food sector was weakened, it was strengthened on the US market. In view of the considerable EU market saturation the improved competitive capacity in the non-EU markets is a positive development, which is a promising finding particularly in the long-term perspective."
https://openalex.org/W4296029220,"The NICHD BPD Outcome Estimator uses clinical and demographic data to stratify respiratory outcomes of extremely preterm infants by risk. However, the Estimator does not have an option in its pull-down menu for infants of Asian descent. We hypothesize that respiratory outcomes in extreme prematurity among various racial/ethnic groups are interconnected and therefore the Estimator can still be used to predict outcomes in infants of Asian descent. Our goal was to apply a machine learning approach to assess whether outcome prediction for infants of Asian descent is possible with information hidden in the prediction results using White, Black, and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups as surrogates. We used the three racial/ethnic options in the Estimator to obtain the probabilities of BPD outcomes for each severity category. We then combined the probability results and developed three respiratory outcome prediction models at various postmenstrual age (PMA) by a random forest algorithm. We showed satisfactory model performance, with receiver operating characteristics area under the curve of 0.934, 0.850, and 0.757 for respiratory outcomes at PMA 36, 37, and 40 weeks, respectively, in the testing data set. This study suggested an interrelationship among racial/ethnic groups for respiratory outcomes among extremely preterm infants and showed the feasibility of extending the use of the Estimator to the Asian population."

The aim extends to account for regional disparities in service delivery and mortality including high and non-high focus states.Ever-married women aged 15-49 years (1,87,702) who had delivered at least one child in five years preceding the survey date surveyed in National Family Health Survey (2015-16) were included in the study. Neonatal deaths between day two and seven and neonatal deaths between day two and twenty-eight were considered dependent variables. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis were conducted.Chances of early neonatal mortality were 29% (OR = 0.71; 95%CI: 0.59-0.84) among newborns receiving PNC within a day compared to ones devoid of it while 40% (OR: 0.60; 95%CI: 0.51-0.71) likelihood for the same was noted if PNC was delivered within a week. Likelihood of neonatal mortality decreased by 24% (OR: 0.76; 95%CI: 0.65-0.88) when skilled PNC was delivered within 24 hours. Receiving quality PNC by skilled providers within a day in a non-high focus state decreased the chances of neonatal mortality by 26% (OR: 0.74; 95%CI: 0.59-0.92) compared to ones who did not receive any PNC.Neonatal deaths were significantly associated with socioeconomic and contextual characteristics including age, education, household wealth, social group and region. Timing of PNC delivered and by a skilled healthcare provider was found significant in reducing neonatal mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4296035053,"The study aimed to delineate the robustness of the culture-based and molecular biology methods to assess the total bacterial concentration and Campylobacter jejuni (C . jejuni) quantification in caecal content, analysed as fresh or after being stored immediately at ultra-low (-80°C) temperature at different time points (for 3, 7, 14, 28 and 62 days post collection). The caecal content was collected from birds that were artificially colonised with C . jejuni (in-vivo) , and quantification was performed using both colony-forming unit (CFU) and qPCR. The results showed that storage time affected the output of culture-based analyses but mostly did not alter concentration retrieved via qPCR. After an initial ~4.5 log 10 reduction in CFU observed from fresh (day 0) to frozen samples, bacterial concentration retrieved with culture-based methods seemed to be constant in samples frozen for 3 to 62 days, indicating a possible threshold for C . jejuni loss of viability due to effect of storage temperature. Ranking order analyses, revealed that the molecular biology technique was able to attribute somewhat the same relative C . jejuni concentrations to the samples analysed via qPCR. However, day 0 measurements from culture-based methods were associated with the absence of or negatively weak correlations with the rest of the time points, but ranking order was maintained from day 3 onwards. On the other hand, ranking order correlations were less constant when measuring total bacterial concentration through qPCR. The study suggests that if biological samples can’t be analysed as fresh (immediately after collection) and have to be stored prior to analysis, then storage at -80°C samples be recommended to avoid the temporal-dependent effects on C . jejuni concentrations. In addition, irrespective of the method of analysis, an initial loss of CFU must be factored in when interpreting the results obtained from frozen samples."
https://openalex.org/W4296035915,"Evaluation of geographic disparities in type 2 diabetes (T2D) onset requires multidimensional approaches at a relevant spatial scale to characterize community types and features that could influence this health outcome. Using Geisinger electronic health records (2008–2016), we conducted a nested case-control study of new onset T2D in a 37-county area of Pennsylvania. The study included 15,888 incident T2D cases and 79,435 controls without diabetes, frequency-matched 1:5 on age, sex, and year of diagnosis or encounter. We characterized patients’ residential census tracts by four dimensions of social determinants of health (SDOH) and into a 7-category SDOH census tract typology previously generated for the entire United States by dimension reduction techniques. Finally, because the SDOH census tract typology classified 83% of the study region’s census tracts into two heterogeneous categories, termed rural affordable-like and suburban affluent-like, to further delineate geographies relevant to T2D, we subdivided these two typology categories by administrative community types (U.S. Census Bureau minor civil divisions of township, borough, city). We used generalized estimating equations to examine associations of 1) four SDOH indexes, 2) SDOH census tract typology, and 3) modified typology, with odds of new onset T2D, controlling for individual-level confounding variables. Two SDOH dimensions, higher socioeconomic advantage and higher mobility (tracts with fewer seniors and disabled adults) were independently associated with lower odds of T2D. Compared to rural affordable-like as the reference group, residence in tracts categorized as extreme poverty (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.11 [1.02, 1.21]) or multilingual working (1.07 [1.03, 1.23]) were associated with higher odds of new onset T2D. Suburban affluent-like was associated with lower odds of T2D (0.92 [0.87, 0.97]). With the modified typology, the strongest association (1.37 [1.15, 1.63]) was observed in cities in the suburban affluent-like category (vs. rural affordable-like–township), followed by cities in the rural affordable-like category (1.20 [1.05, 1.36]). We conclude that in evaluating geographic disparities in T2D onset, it is beneficial to conduct simultaneous evaluation of SDOH in multiple dimensions. Associations with the modified typology showed the importance of incorporating governmentally, behaviorally, and experientially relevant community definitions when evaluating geographic health disparities."

https://openalex.org/W4296037792,"Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are biosynthetic assembly lines that construct structurally diverse natural products with wide-ranging applications in medicine and agriculture. Various mechanisms contribute to structural diversification during PKS-mediated chain assembly, including dehydratase (DH) domain-mediated elimination of water from R and S-configured 3-hydroxy-thioesters to introduce E- and Z-configured carbon–carbon double bonds, respectively. Here we report the discovery of a DH domain variant that catalyzes the sequential elimination of two molecules of water from a (3R, 5S)-3,5-dihydroxy thioester during polyketide chain assembly, introducing a conjugated E,Z-diene into various modular PKS products. We show that the reaction proceeds via a (2E, 5S)-2-enoyl-5-hydroxy-thioester intermediate and involves an additional universally conserved histidine residue that is absent from the active site of most conventional DH domains. These findings expand the diverse range of chemistries mediated by DH-like domains in modular PKSs, highlighting the catalytic versatility of the double hotdog fold. Polyketides are assembled by modular polyketide synthases and undergo chemical tailoring reactions. A dehydratase domain variant catalyzes two sequential elimination reactions from thioester intermediates to produce conjugated diene modifications."

Participants older than 18 years who suffered from a chronic disease and with information about the occurrence of a CDR in the last 4 weeks prior to the survey were included. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were estimated to determine the associated factors. Socioeconomic inequality in CDR was estimated using concentration curves (CC) and the Erreygers concentration index (ECI).Data from 38,662 participants were analyzed; the prevalence of CDR in the last 4 weeks prior to the survey was 16.5% (95% CI: 15.8-17.2).

https://openalex.org/W4296039037,"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is one of the most common refractory epilepsies and is usually accompanied by a range of brain pathological changes, such as neuronal injury and astrocytosis. Naïve astrocytes are readily converted to cytotoxic reactive astrocytes (A1) in response to inflammatory stimulation, suppressing the polarization of A1 protects against neuronal death in early central nervous system injury. Our previous study found that pro-inflammatory cytokines and miR-132-3p (hereinafter referred to as ""miR-132"") expression were upregulated, but how miR-132 affected reactive astrocyte polarization and neuronal damage during epilepsy is not fully understood. Here, we aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of miR-132 on A1 polarization. Our results confirmed that A1 markers were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of MTLE rats and IL-1β-treated primary astrocytes. In vivo, knockdown of miR-132 by lateral ventricular injection reduced A1 astrocytes, neuronal loss, mossy fiber sprouting, and remitted the severity of status epilepticus and the recurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. In vitro, the neuronal cell viability and axon length were reduced by additional treatment with A1 astrocyte conditioned media (ACM), and downregulation of astrocyte miR-132 rescued the inhibition of cell activity by A1 ACM, while the length of axons was further inhibited. The regulation of miR-132 on A1 astrocytes may be related to its target gene expression. Our results show that interfering with astrocyte polarization may be a breakthrough in the treatment of refractory epilepsy, which may extend to the research of other astrocyte polarization-mediated brain injuries."

We aimed to determine factors that influence patient satisfaction in refugee health centers.The study was a cross-sectional quantitative study. A patient survey was administered among 4548 patients attending services in selected 16 provinces in Turkey. A quantitative questionnaire was used to collect information on patient satisfaction and experience in the healthcare facility. Information on ""overall satisfaction with health services"" was collected on a 5-point Likert scale and dichotomized for analysis. Logistic regression was conducted to identify factors that influenced patient satisfaction.We found that 78.2% of the participants were satisfied with the health services they received. Factors related to service quality and communication were significant determinants of patient satisfaction. The strongest predictors of satisfaction were having a sufficient consultation time (AOR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.76-3.21; p< 0.0001), receiving a comprehensive examination (AOR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.49-2.70; p < 0.0001) and being treated with respect by the nurse (AOR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.52-2.85; p< 0.0001).Providing integrated, culturally and linguistically sensitive health services is important in refugee settings. The quality of service and communication with patients influence patient satisfaction in refugee health centers.

The aim of this paper is to study household medicines expenditure and its associated determining factors to develop policies to protect households from financial hardship.The present cross-sectional and population-level study used the Bangladesh 2016-17 National Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). The final sample size was 46,080 households. We analyzed the probability of OOPE for medicines, the share of total OOPE due to medicines out of total OOPE in health (reported as a ratio between zero and one), the OOPE amount for medicines reported (in United States Dollars), and the share of OOPE amount on medicines out of total household expenditure (reported as a ratio between zero and one). Predictors of analyzed outcomes were identified using three regression models.Out of those households who spent on healthcare, the probability of having any OOPE on medicines was 87.9%. Of those who spent on medicines, the median monthly expenditure was US$3.03. The poorest households spent 9.97% of their total household expenditure as OOPE on medicines, nearly double that of the wealthiest households (5.86%). The characteristic which showed the most significant correlation to a high OOPE on medicines was the presence of chronic diseases, especially cancer. Twenty six percent of all surveyed households spend more than 10% of their OOPE on medicines.Our study shows that financial protection should be targeted at the poorest quintiles and such protection should include enrollment of rural households. Further, outpatient medicines benefits should include those for non-communicable diseases (NCDs)."
https://openalex.org/W4296036286,"Introduction Over one billion people live with disability worldwide, of whom 80% are in developing countries. Robust childhood disability data are limited, particularly as tools for identifying disability function poorly at young ages. Methods A subgroup of children enrolled in the Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial (a cluster-randomised, community-based, 2x2 factorial trial in two rural districts in Zimbabwe) had neurodevelopmental assessments at 2 years of age. We evaluated functional difficulty prevalence in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed children using the Washington Group Child Functioning Module (WGCFM), comparing absolute difference using chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests. Concurrent validity with the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) was assessed using logistic regression with cohort MDAT score quartiles, linear regression for unit-increase in raw scores and a Generalised Estimating Equation approach (to adjust for clusters) to compare MDAT scores of those with and without functional difficulty. A 3-step, cluster-adjusted multivariable regression model was then carried out to examine risk factors for functional difficulty. Findings Functional Difficulty prevalence was 4.2% (95%CI: 3.2%, 5.2%) in HIV-unexposed children (n = 1606) versus 6.1% (95%CI: 3.5%, 8.9%) in HIV-exposed children (n = 314) (absolute difference 1.9%, 95%CI: -0.93%, 4.69%; p = 0.14). Functional difficulty score correlated negatively with MDAT: for each unit increase in WGCFM score, children completed 2.6 (95%CI: 2.2, 3.1) fewer MDAT items (p = 0.001). Children from families with food insecurity and poorer housing were more at risk of functional difficulty. Interpretation Functional difficulty was identified in approximately 1-in-20 children in rural Zimbabwe, which is comparable to prevalence in previous studies. WGCFM showed concurrent validity with the MDAT, supporting its use in early childhood."
https://openalex.org/W4296037050,"Since recovery time of the RF coil is long at low field MRI, the rising and the ring-down times of the square pulse are also long, which means the applied sinc pulse can easily be distorted from the changing amplitude. However, both the rising time and ring-down time can be calculated using Q-factor. Using this information, an RF square pulse were compensated by appending two square pulses before and after the RF pulse. The durations of these RF square pulses were calculated using the Q-factor. Since the amplitude of the sinc pulse changes continuously, a series of square pulses were applied to apply sinc pulse to the coil. The minimum number of square pulses and the amplitude of the square pulses were calculated. It was successfully demonstrated that the sinc pulse can be compensated using a series of square pulses. The more number of square pulses were used, the smoother sinc pulse was applied to the RF coil. The Q-factor was experimentally calculated from the ring-down time of a signal induced in a sniffer loop which was connected to an oscilloscope. The resulting Q-factor was then used to calculate both the duration and amplitude of the square pulses for compensation. Echo trains were also acquired in an inhomogeneous B0 field using the compensated RF pulses. In order to enhance the SNR of the echo trains, a pre-polarization pulse was added to the CPMG spin echo sequence. The SNRs of the echo signal acquired using compensated pulses were compared with those of signal obtained with uncompensated pulses and showed significant improvements of 61.1% and 51.5% for the square and sinc shaped pulses respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4296038313,"Varroa destructor is a honey bee (Apis mellifera) parasite identified as one of the leading causes of overwintering colony loss in New Zealand. It has been shown that a naturally occurring heritable trait, ""Varroa Sensitive Hygiene"" (VSH), confers an advantage to colonies by increasing behaviours that limit the survival and reproduction of Varroa mites. The SNP 9-9224292 is an adenine/guanine (A/G) polymorphism on chromosome 9 of Apis mellifera where the G allele was observed to be associated with VSH behaviour in North American honey bees. In this study, we sought to determine if selection for the G allele of SNP 9-9224292 could decrease Varroa mite infestation of New Zealand honey bee (Apis mellifera ligustica) colonies. We genotyped queens and tracked their colonies over summer before measuring Varroa levels at the point of autumn Varroa treatment. The mean Varroa population level in colonies headed by queens that carry two copies of VSH associated G allele of SNP 9-9224292 was 28.5% (P<0.05) lower compared with colonies headed by queens with two copies of non-VSH associated A alleles. Although a significant reduction in mite infestation was achieved in treatment colonies, conventional Varroa treatment was still required for adequate Varroa control. Considering the open mating of queens used and a lack of drift control in this study, this VSH SNP shows promise for marker assisted selection of New Zealand honey bees when aiming for innate Varroa control traits."

Previously, a MOS generating β-mannanase from Aspergillus oryzae MTCC 1846 (βManAo) was characterized and its structural and functional properties were unraveled through homology modeling and molecular dynamics in this study. The βManAo model was validated with 92.9% and 6.5% of the residues found to be distributed in the most favorable and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Glu244 was found to play a key role in the interaction with mannotriose, indicating conserved amino acids for the catalytic reaction. A detailed metadynamic analysis of the principal components revealed the presence of an α8-helix in the C-terminus which was very flexible in nature and energy landscapes suggested high conformation sub-states and the complex dynamic behavior of the protein. The binding of the M3 substrate stabilized the β-mannanase and resulted in a reduction in the intermediate conformational sub-states evident from the free energy landscapes. The active site of the β-mannanase is mostly hydrophilic in nature which is accordance with our results, where the major contribution in the binding energy of the substrate with the active site is from electrostatic interactions. Define Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) analysis revealed a major transition of the protein from helix to β-turn for binding with the mannotriose. The molecular dynamics of the βManAo-mannotriose model, and the role and interactions of catalytic residues with ligand were also described. The substrate binding pocket of βManAo was found to be highly dynamic and showed large, concerted movements. The outcomes of the present study can be exploited in further understanding the structural properties and functional dynamics of βManAo."

The combination of blueberries and yoghurt down-regulated the mRNA expression of AGTR-1 and Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) in the EDL. Whereas the combination of C3G and peptides down-regulated AGTR-1 and up-regulated GLUT4 mRNA expression in the EDL. In the soleus, blueberries and yoghurt alone, and their combination down-regulated AGTR-1 and up-regulated GLUT4 mRNA expression. In summary blueberries and yoghurt, regulated multiple genes associated with glucose metabolism in skeletal muscles, and therefore may play a role in the management and prevention of T2DM."

At present, there is no definite conclusion to explain the cause of genu varus. The purpose of this study is to systematically review and meta-analysis the effectiveness and scientific basis of the clinical efficacy of customized orthopedic insoles on genu varus and hope to provide a reference for future research in this field.The following electronic databases will be searched from inception to January 2022: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Weipu, Wanfang Data, and CNKI. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were collected to examine the effect of lateral wedge-shaped orthopedic insole on patients with genu varus. We will consider inclusion, select high-quality articles for data extraction and analysis, and summarize the intervention effect of lateral wedge orthotic insoles on patients with genu varus. Two reviewers will screen titles, abstracts, and full texts independently according to inclusion criteria; Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed in the included studies. We will use a hierarchy of recommended assessment, development, and assessment methods to assess the overall certainty of the evidence and report findings accordingly. Endnote X8 will be applied in selecting the study, Review Manager 5.3 will be applied in analyzing and synthesizing.The results will provide evidence for judging the effect of lateral wedge-shaped orthopedic insole on patients with genu varus.Our study will provide reliable evidence for the effect of lateral wedge-shaped orthopedic insole on patients with genu varus.INPLASY registration number: INPLASY202190002 https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=INPLASY202190002."
