https://openalex.org/W1963940229,"Mitochondria dynamically fuse and divide within cells, and the proper balance of fusion and fission is necessary for normal mitochondrial function, morphology, and distribution. Drp1 is a dynamin-related GTPase required for mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. It harbors four distinct domains: GTP-binding, middle, insert B, and GTPase effector. A lethal mutation (A395D) within the Drp1 middle domain was reported in a neonate with microcephaly, abnormal brain development, optic atrophy, and lactic acidemia (Waterham, H. R., Koster, J., van Roermund, C. W., Mooyer, P. A., Wanders, R. J., and Leonard, J. V. (2007) N. Engl. J. Med. 356, 1736-1741). Mitochondria within patient-derived fibroblasts were markedly elongated, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these findings were not demonstrated. Because the middle domain is particularly important for the self-assembly of some dynamin superfamily proteins, we tested the hypothesis that this A395D mutation, and two other middle domain mutations (G350D, G363D) were important for Drp1 tetramerization, higher order assembly, and function. Although tetramerization appeared largely intact, each of these mutations compromised higher order assembly and assembly-dependent stimulation of Drp1 GTPase activity. Moreover, mutant Drp1 proteins exhibited impaired localization to mitochondria, indicating that this higher order assembly is important for mitochondrial recruitment, retention, or both. Overexpression of these middle domain mutants markedly inhibited mitochondrial division in cells. Thus, the Drp1 A395D lethal defect likely resulted in impaired higher order assembly of Drp1 at mitochondria, leading to decreased fission, elongated mitochondria, and altered cellular distribution of mitochondria."

Here, we report that subtoxic drug concentrations are sufficient to inhibit plus-end microtubule dynamic instability and cell migration without affecting cell division or microtubule assembly. The higher drug concentrations needed to inhibit cell division act through a novel mechanism that generates microtubule fragments by stimulating microtubule minus-end detachment from their organizing centers. The frequency of microtubule detachment in untreated cells increases at prophase suggesting that it is a regulated cellular process important for spindle assembly and function. We conclude that drugs produce differential dose-dependent effects at microtubule plus and minus-ends to inhibit different microtubule-mediated functions."
https://openalex.org/W2054598829,"The acquisition of invasiveness in ovarian cancer (OC) is accompanied by the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The MUC4 mucin is overexpressed in ovarian tumors and has a role in the invasiveness of OC cells. The present study was aimed at evaluating the potential involvement of MUC4 in the metastasis of OC cells by inducing EMT. Ectopic overexpression of MUC4 in OC cells (SKOV3-MUC4) resulted in morphological alterations along with a decreased expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and cytokeratin (CK)-18) and an increased expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and vimentin) compared with the control cells (SKOV3-vector). Also, pro-EMT transcription factors TWIST1, TWIST2 and SNAIL showed an upregulation in SKOV3-MUC4 cells. We further investigated the pathways upstream of N-cadherin, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), MKK7, JNK1/2 and c-Jun, which were also activated in the SKOV3-MUC4 cells compared with SKOV3-vector cells. Inhibition of phospho-FAK (pFAK) and pJNK1/2 decreased N-cadherin expression in the MUC4-overexpressing cells, which further led to a significant decrease in cellular motility. Knockdown of N-cadherin decreased the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), AKT and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and inhibited the motility in the SKOV3-MUC4 cells. Upon in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis analysis, the SKOV3-MUC4 cells produced significantly larger tumors and demonstrated a higher incidence of metastasis to distance organs (peritoneal wall, colon, intestine, stomach, lymph nodes, liver and diaphragm). Taken together, our study reveals a novel role for MUC4 in inducing EMT through the upregulation of N-cadherin and promoting metastasis of OC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087996699,"We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study to identify common genetic variation altering risk of the metabolic syndrome and related phenotypes in Indian Asian men, who have a high prevalence of these conditions. In Stage 1, approximately 317,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 2700 individuals, from which 1500 SNPs were selected to be genotyped in a further 2300 individuals. Selection for inclusion in Stage 1 was based on four metabolic syndrome component traits: HDL-cholesterol, plasma glucose and Type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity measured by waist to hip ratio, and diastolic blood pressure. Association was tested with these four traits and a composite metabolic syndrome phenotype. Four SNPs reaching significance level p<5x10(-7) and with posterior probability of association >0.8 were found in genes CETP and LPL, associated with HDL-cholesterol. These associations have already been reported in Indian Asians and in Europeans. Five additional loci harboured SNPs significant at p<10(-6) and posterior probability >0.5 for HDL-cholesterol, type 2 diabetes or diastolic blood pressure. Our results suggest that the primary genetic determinants of metabolic syndrome are the same in Indian Asians as in other populations, despite the higher prevalence. Further, we found little evidence of a common genetic basis for metabolic syndrome traits in our sample of Indian Asian men."
https://openalex.org/W2092098171,"Down syndrome (DS) is associated with many neural defects, including reduced brain size and impaired neuronal proliferation, highly contributing to the mental retardation. Those typical characteristics of DS are closely associated with a specific gene group ""Down syndrome critical region"" (DSCR) on human chromosome 21. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired neuronal proliferation in DS and, more specifically, a regulatory role for dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y) phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A), a DSCR gene product, in embryonic neuronal cell proliferation. We found that Dyrk1A phosphorylates p53 at Ser-15 in vitro and in immortalized rat embryonic hippocampal progenitor H19-7 cells. In addition, Dyrk1A-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser-15 led to a robust induction of p53 target genes (e.g. p21(CIP1)) and impaired G(1)/G(0)-S phase transition, resulting in attenuated proliferation of H19-7 cells and human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor cells. Moreover, the point mutation of p53-Ser-15 to alanine rescued the inhibitory effect of Dyrk1A on neuronal proliferation. Accordingly, brains from embryonic DYRK1A transgenic mice exhibited elevated levels of Dyrk1A, Ser-15 (mouse Ser-18)-phosphorylated p53, and p21(CIP1) as well as impaired neuronal proliferation. These findings suggest that up-regulation of Dyrk1A contributes to altered neuronal proliferation in DS through specific phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and subsequent p21(CIP1) induction."
https://openalex.org/W2139681679,"This study describes the design and evaluation of a portable bright-field and fluorescence microscope that can be manufactured for $240 USD. The microscope uses a battery-operated LED-based flashlight as the light source and achieves a resolution of 0.8 microm at 1000x magnification in fluorescence mode. We tested the diagnostic capability of this new instrument to identify infections caused by the human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sixty-four direct, decontaminated, and serially diluted smears were prepared from sputa obtained from 19 patients suspected to have M. tuberculosis infection. Slides were stained with auramine orange and evaluated as being positive or negative for M. tuberculosis with both the new portable fluorescence microscope and a laboratory grade fluorescence microscope. Concordant results were obtained in 98.4% of cases. This highly portable, low cost, fluorescence microscope may be a useful diagnostic tool to expand the availability of M. tuberculosis testing at the point-of-care in low resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W1991397443,"A forward genetic screen of mice treated with the mutagen ENU identified a mutant mouse with chronic motor incoordination. This mutant, named Pingu (Pgu), carries a missense mutation, an I402T substitution in the S6 segment of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kcna2. The gene Kcna2 encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel α-subunit Kv1.2, which is abundantly expressed in the large axon terminals of basket cells that make powerful axo-somatic synapses onto Purkinje cells. Patch clamp recordings from cerebellar slices revealed an increased frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents and reduced action potential firing frequency in Purkinje cells, suggesting that an increase in GABA release from basket cells is involved in the motor incoordination in Pgu mice. In line with immunochemical analyses showing a significant reduction in the expression of Kv1 channels in the basket cell terminals of Pgu mice, expression of homomeric and heteromeric channels containing the Kv1.2(I402T) α-subunit in cultured CHO cells revealed subtle changes in biophysical properties but a dramatic decrease in the amount of functional Kv1 channels. Pharmacological treatment with acetazolamide or transgenic complementation with wild-type Kcna2 cDNA partially rescued the motor incoordination in Pgu mice. These results suggest that independent of known mutations in Kcna1 encoding Kv1.1, Kcna2 mutations may be important molecular correlates underlying human cerebellar ataxic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2124712466,"Previous studies have examined the association between ABO blood group and the risk of some malignancies. However, no prospective cohort study to date has examined the association between ABO blood group and the risk of skin cancer.Using two large cohorts in the US, we examined ABO blood type and incidence of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). We followed up study participants (70,650 female nurses and 24,820 male health professionals) on their diagnosis of incident skin cancer from cohort baseline (1976 in women and 1986 in men) until 2006. Study participants reported their blood type in 1996 in both cohorts. During the follow-up, 685 participants developed melanoma, 1,533 developed SCC and 19,860 developed BCC. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of each type of skin cancer. We observed that non-O blood group (A, AB, and B combined) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer overall. Compared to participants with blood group O, participants with non-O blood group had a 14% decreased risk of developing SCC (multivariable HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.95) and a 4% decreased risk of developing BCC (multivariable HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). The decreased risk of melanoma for non-O blood group was not statistically significant (multivariable HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.05).In two large independent populations, non-O blood group was associated with a decreased risk of skin cancer. The association was statistically significant for non-melanoma skin cancer. Additional studies are needed to confirm these associations and to define the mechanisms by which ABO blood type or closely linked genetic variants may influence skin cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2099029525,"Kava (Piper methysticum Foster, Piperaceae) organic solvent-extract has been used to treat mild to moderate anxiety, insomnia, and muscle fatigue in Western countries, leading to its emergence as one of the 10 best-selling herbal preparations. However, several reports of severe hepatotoxicity in kava consumers led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and authorities in Europe to restrict sales of kava-containing products. Herein we demonstrate that flavokawain B (FKB), a chalcone from kava root, is a potent hepatocellular toxin, inducing cell death in HepG2 (LD(50)=15.3 ± 0.2 μM) and L-02 (LD(50)=32 μM) cells. Hepatocellular toxicity of FKB is mediated by induction of oxidative stress, depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), inhibition of IKK activity leading to NF-κB transcriptional blockade, and constitutive TNF-α-independent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, namely, ERK, p38, and JNK. We further demonstrate by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging that oral consumption of FKB leads to inhibition of hepatic NF-κB transcriptional activity in vivo and severe liver damage. Surprisingly, replenishment with exogenous GSH normalizes both TNF-α-dependent NF-κB as well as MAPK signaling and rescues hepatocytes from FKB-induced death. Our data identify FKB as a potent GSH-sensitive hepatotoxin, levels of which should be specifically monitored and controlled in kava-containing herb products."
https://openalex.org/W1987489036,"Myc oncoproteins and histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate gene transcription and enhance cancer cell proliferation, and HDAC inhibitors are among the most promising new classes of anticancer drugs. Here, we show that N-Myc and c-Myc upregulated HDAC2 gene expression in neuroblastoma and pancreatic cancer cells, respectively, which contributed to N-Myc- and c-Myc-induced cell proliferation. Cyclin G2 (CCNG2) was commonly repressed by N-Myc and HDAC2 in neuroblastoma cells and by c-Myc and HDAC2 in pancreatic cancer cells, and could be reactivated by HDAC inhibitors. 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays showed that transcriptional repression of CCNG2 was, in part, responsible for N-Myc-, c-Myc- and HDAC2-induced cell proliferation. Dual crosslinking chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that N-Myc acted as a transrepressor by recruiting the HDAC2 protein to Sp1-binding sites at the CCNG2 gene core promoter. Moreover, HDAC2 was upregulated, and CCNG2 downregulated, in pre-cancerous and neuroblastoma tissues from N-Myc transgenic mice, and c-Myc overexpression correlated with upregulation of HDAC2 and repression of CCNG2 in tumour tissues from pancreatic cancer patients. Taken together, our data indicate the critical roles of upregulation of HDAC2 and suppression of CCNG2 in Myc-induced oncogenesis, and have significant implications for the application of HDAC inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of Myc-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2017618441,"Semaphorins and plexins are implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, although the molecular basis has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report the expression of plexin-B3 in glioma cells, which upon stimulation by its ligand Sema5A results in significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion. A search for the underlying mechanism revealed direct interaction of plexin-B3 with RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα), a negative regulator of RhoGTPases that blocks guanine nucleotide exchange and sequesters them away from the plasma membrane. Glioma cells challenged with Sema5A indeed showed a marked reduction in Rac1-GTP levels by 60%, with a concomitant disruption of lamellipodia. The inactivation of Rac1 was corroborated to contribute to the impediment of glioma cell invasion by Sema5A, as supported by the abolishment of effect upon forced expression of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant. Furthermore, silencing the endogenous expression of RhoGDIα in glioma cells was found to be sufficient in abrogating the down-regulation of Rac1-GTP and the ensuing suppression of glioma cell motility induced by Sema5A. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that Sema5A promotes Rac1 recruitment to RhoGDIα and reduces its membrane localization in a plexin-B3-dependent manner, thereby preventing Rac1 activation. This represents a novel signaling of semaphorin and plexin in the control of cell motility by indirect inactivation of Rac1 through RhoGDIα.

This represents a novel signaling of semaphorin and plexin in the control of cell motility by indirect inactivation of Rac1 through RhoGDIα. Semaphorins represent one of the largest families of axon guidance molecules. To date, more than 30 semaphorins have been identified in vertebrates and invertebrates, which fall into eight subclasses of secreted, membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, and transmembrane proteins according to their structural features (1Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Although initially identified as guidance cues, semaphorins and their receptor plexins have been implicated in a strikingly diverse set of biological processes ranging from cell migration, immune responses, and angiogenesis to organogenesis (2Roth L. Koncina E. Satkauskas S. Crémel G. Aunis D. Bagnard D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 649-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recent studies have reported the expression of semaphorins and plexins in various types of cancer (3Neufeld G. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Guttmann-Raviv N. Herzog Y. Kessler O. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Rieger J. Wick W. Weller M. Glia. 2003; 42: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Wong O.G. Nitkunan T. Oinuma I.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19040-19045Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting their emerging roles in cancer progression. The secreted class 3 semaphorins Sema3B and -3F, for instance, show potent anti-tumor effects in breast and lung cancers (6Castro-Rivera E. Ran S. Thorpe P. Minna J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11432-11437Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Kusy S. Nasarre P. Chan D. Potiron V. Meyronet D. Gemmill R.M. Constantin B. Drabkin H.A. Roche J. Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A loss of Sema3F protein is in fact significantly correlated with the advanced stage of cancer invasion (7Kusy S. Nasarre P. Chan D. Potiron V. Meyronet D. Gemmill R.M. Constantin B. Drabkin H.A. Roche J. Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sema3A was found to inhibit tumor cell invasive growth in vitro (8Catalano A. Caprari P. Rodilossi S. Betta P. Castellucci M. Casazza A. Tamagnone L. Procopio A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 358-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these inhibitory effects of semaphorins on cancer cells, there has been evidence indicating that members such as Sema3C and -3E instead promote tumorigenesis and tumor progression (9Banu N. Teichman J. Dunlap-Brown M. Villegas G. Tufro A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2150-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Christensen C. Ambartsumian N. Gilestro G. Thomsen B. Comoglio P. Tamagnone L. Guldberg P. Lukanidin E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6167-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, transmembrane members of semaphorins can mediate both tumor progression and suppression effects in different cancer types. For instance, Sema4D is highly expressed in invading islands of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, which when shed from the cell surface stimulates endothelial cell migration and promotes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma invasion through its receptor plexin-B1 (11Basile J.R. Castilho R.M. Williams V.P. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9017-9022Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, gene microarray analysis of breast cancer specimens showed that low expression level of the receptor plexin-B1 correlates with a more aggressive tumor phenotype (12Rody A. Holtrich U. Gaetje R. Gehrmann M. Engels K. von Minckwitz G. Loibl S. Diallo-Danebrock R. Ruckhäberle E. Metzler D. Ahr A. Solbach C. Karn T. Kaufmann M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown that activation of plexin-B1 signaling by the ligand Sema4D triggers its endogenous GTPase-activating protein activity toward R-Ras, thereby negatively regulating integrin functions, and may potentially suppress metastasis (13Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, several somatic missense mutations in the plexin-B1 gene have been identified in both primary and metastatic prostate tumor samples, which lead to a compromise of its GTPase-activating protein activity toward R-Ras, resulting in an increase in cancer cell motility and invasion (5Wong O.G. Nitkunan T. Oinuma I. Zhou C. Blanc V. Brown R.S. Bott S.R. Nariculam J. Box G. Munson P. Constantinou J. Feneley M.R. Klocker H. Eccles S.A. Negishi M. Freeman A. Masters J.R. Williamson M. Proc.

Although these findings point to the importance of semaphorins and plexins in cancer development, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. The expression of Sema5A and its receptor plexin-B3 (15Artigiani S. Conrotto P. Fazzari P. Gilestro G.F. Barberis D. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L.

Sema5A was found to impose inhibitory effect on glioma cell motility in a plexin-B3-dependent manner. We provide evidence that Sema5A suppresses glioma cell invasion by inhibiting the activation of Rac1 GTPase through its negative modulator RhoGDIα. This represents a novel mechanism through which semaphorins and plexins regulate cancer cell motility. Antibodies directed against hemagglutinin (HA), glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose-binding protein (MBP), 2The abbreviations used are: MBPmaltose-binding proteinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. and RhoGDIα were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and human IgG-Fc were from Chemicon International. Rac1 antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG-Fc was from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Pierce. maltose-binding protein tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. C6 and U87-MG glioma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The glioma cells and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin (100 IU/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For transfection experiments, cells grown to ∼80% confluence were transiently transfected with expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA isolated from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) was reverse-transcribed by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer. The resulting cDNA was then subjected to amplifications by PCR using the following primer pairs: rat plexin-B3 (5′-AACCCTGACCCTTCTCT-3′ and 5′-CATGACTAAGTGGAGCCAGG-3′), human plexin-B3 (5′-TCAACATTTCCGAGGCCTGC-3′ and 5′-TGCCTGGTGGCTGGCTCTTA-3′), rat GAPDH (5′-GTGCAGTGCCAGCCTCGTC-3′ and 5′-GGCAGCACCAGTGGATGCA-3′), and human GAPDH (5′-TTTGCGTCGCCAGCCGAGC-3′ and 5′-TTGGCAGCGCCAGTAGAGG-3′). PCR products were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To produce soluble Sema5A, HEK293 cells were transfected with an expression construct, which encompasses a fusion cDNA between the extracellular domain of Sema5A and the Fc region of human IgG (Sema5A-Fc). An expression plasmid harboring the human IgG-Fc alone serves as the control (Fc control). Transfected cells were allowed to recover in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 20 h prior to incubation in serum-free DMEM for 2 days. Conditioned medium containing Sema5A-Fc or Fc was purified and concentrated using Centricon column (Millipore), followed by Western blot analysis using anti-human IgG-Fc antibodies. For all functional studies, Sema5A-Fc and Fc proteins were pretreated with anti-human IgG-Fc antibodies at a concentration of 7.5 μg/ml for multimerization. The migration of glioma cells was analyzed by wound-healing assay as described with modifications (20Ma P.C. Kijima T. Maulik G. Fox E.A. Sattler M. Griffin J.D. Johnson B.E. Salgia R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6272-6281PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (4 × 105/well) were seeded into 6-well culture dishes and allowed to grow to near-confluency. Physical “scratch wounds” were created on the cell layer using a p-20-μl pipette tip to stimulate cell migration. After a brief wash in DMEM to remove dislodged cells, the culture was incubated in conditioned medium containing Sema5A-Fc or Fc protein for 24 h. “Wound closure” was monitored and documented by photomicrography for quantification of the number of migrated cells. Glioma cell invasion was analyzed by in vitro transfilter Matrigel assay. Briefly, Transwell insert (5 μm pore size, Costar) was pretreated with Matrigel solution (1 mg/ml in DMEM, BD Biosciences) at 37 °C for 2 h. An aliquot of 2 × 104 cells suspended in serum-free DMEM was plated in Matrigel-coated Transwell insert and allowed to migrate and invade toward either Sema5A-Fc or Fc control protein in the lower chamber for 24 h. Cells that remained on the inner side of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab, and those that have invaded through the Matrigel to the outer side of the membrane were stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 0.9% NaCl containing 10% ethanol. Cells were photographed, and the dye was solubilized in 10% acetic acid to measure absorbance at 590 nm in a microplate reader. Glioma cells were transfected with siRNAs against plexin-B3, RhoGDIα, or control siRNAs in scrambled irrelevant sequences using the transfection reagent Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were plated in antibiotics-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 pmol of siRNA in transfection reagent and cultured in a CO2 incubator to reach 30–50% confluence in 24 h. The efficiency and specificity of plexin-B3 and RhoGDIα down-regulation were assessed by Western blot analysis 24–72 h post-transfection. A GAL4-based two-hybrid interaction screen of adult mouse brain cDNA library (Clontech) was performed using the cytoplasmic domain of plexin-B3 as a bait. Briefly, yeast host AH109 harboring the bait expression plasmid pGBKT7/plexin-B3CD was mixed with Y187 yeast host pretransformed with the library according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformants were screened on the quadruple dropout selection medium SD/−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp. Positive colonies that survive the selection were confirmed with X-α-Gal assay. Candidate plasmids were then isolated from the yeast and expanded in Escherichia coli for sequence determination. Interactions between plexin-B3CD and the positive clones were confirmed by co-transforming the bait plasmid and the respective AD/library plasmids into the yeast host AH109, or via reciprocal mating of the yeast hosts AH109 and Y187 transformed with the AD/library clone and the bait plasmid, respectively. The interaction was further verified in mammalian cells by pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. To express RhoGDIα as a fusion protein with MBP, full-length cDNA of RhoGDIα was amplified by RT-PCR from adult mouse brain and cloned into the pMALC2 vector via XbaI and EcoRI sites. The cytoplasmic domain of mouse plexin-B3 was expressed as a GST fusion protein by cloning the PCR-amplified cDNA fragment into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEX-KG vector. p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) (amino acids 69–140) with an HA epitope at the C terminus was cloned into the pGEX-KG vector via EcoRI and NotI sites. Each of these expression constructs was transformed into the BL21 strain of E. coli, and the expression of recombinant proteins was induced by 0.5 to 1 mm of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacteria were subjected to sonication, and the GST or MBP fusion proteins in the soluble fraction of the resulting bacterial lysate were purified with GSH-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) or amylose resin (New England Biolabs), respectively, following the manufacturers' instructions. Correct expression of these proteins was confirmed with Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis. Purified MBP or MBP-RhoGDIα was incubated with 20 μl of GST or GST-plexin-B3CD prebound to GSH-Sepharose in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 1× PBS, and eluted in SDS sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. To verify the yeast two-hybrid screening results in mammalian cells, mouse brain lysate was subjected to pulldown assay with GST-plexin-B3CD. Briefly, postnatal day 7 mouse brain was homogenized in 1 ml of binding buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking, the brain lysate was precleared with 30 μl of GSH-Sepharose, followed by overnight incubation with 30 μl of GST or GST-plexin-B3CD prebound to GSH-Sepharose beads at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were then washed three times with the binding buffer. Proteins were eluted in sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-RhoGDIα antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by chemiluminescence detection with x-ray radiography. To assay for the binding between RhoGDIα and Rac1, glioma cells at 50–70% confluence were treated with Sema5A-Fc or Fc control protein for 30 min. Cells were then lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture for 15 min. 200 μg of precleared lysate were incubated with 2 μg of anti-RhoGDIα antibody overnight with agitation at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added and incubated for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with PBS before Western blot analysis using anti-Rac1 and anti-RhoGDIα antibodies. To confirm the interaction of plexin-B3 with RhoGDIα in glioma cells by immunoprecipitation, 200 μg of precleared cell lysates were incubated with antibodies specific for plexin-B3 or RhoGDIα overnight, followed by 20 μl of protein A-agarose for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with PBS and subjected to Western blot analysis. Glioma cells stimulated with Sema5A-Fc or Fc control at predetermined time points were extensively washed with PBS prior to lysis in RIPA buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Rac1-GTP level was then determined with a PAK1 binding domain pulldown assay previously described with modifications (21Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, 100 μg of lysates were precleared with GSH-Sepharose beads in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with GST-PAK1 binding domain (GST-PBD) fusion protein coupled to GSH-Sepharose. Bound complexes were pelleted and washed twice in PBS. The beads and total cell lysate were subjected to Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-Rac1 and polyclonal anti-Cdc42 antibody. The intensity of immunoreactive signals was quantified with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Glioma cells grown to 50% confluence on fibronectin-coated coverslips were stimulated with Sema5A-Fc or Fc protein for 30 min. Changes in the actin cytoskeleton were then revealed by phalloidin stain. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min, followed by incubation in a 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then stained with 200 ng/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Nucleus was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Coverslips were mounted on microscopic slides using an antifade mounting agent (Aqua PolyMount, Polysciences) and examined under a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss). Glioma cells treated with Sema5A-Fc or Fc control protein for 30 min were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (HBL) (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor and 1 mm PMSF for 10 min to allow cell swelling. Cells were then lysed by Dounce homogenization (40 strokes) with a tight fitting pestle, and the lysates were cleared by low speed centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble cell debris, nuclei, and intact cells. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic (soluble) and membrane (pellet) fractions. Equal amounts of proteins from these two fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Rac1 antibody. All data are mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. Differences between groups were analyzed by Student's t test. p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. The presence of plexin-B3 expression in glioma cells was first examined by RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, plexin-B3 was found to be endogenously expressed in rat C6 glioma cells (lane 1). The same primer pair also successfully amplified plexin-B3 in rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which is known to express plexin-B3 (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Western blot analysis of both rat and human glioma cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2, respectively) using a plexin-B3-specific antibody revealed a 260-kDa protein, consistent with that detected in HEK293 cells heterologously expressing full-length plexin-B3 (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Given the high invasiveness of glioma cells, we asked whether plexin-B3 plays a role in the regulation of glioma motility. To begin with, rat C6 and human U87-MG glioma cells were challenged with Sema5A, the functional ligand for plexin-B3 (15Artigiani S. Conrotto P. Fazzari P. Gilestro G.F. Barberis D. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and monitored for changes in cell migration using scratch wound assay. Similar to untreated cells, glioma cells treated with Fc control protein showed active migration and attained a near-complete closure of the scratch wound in 24 h (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, cells subjected to Sema5A-Fc stimulation displayed a significant reduction in migration by 50% as compared with the Fc control (Fig. 1C). Next, the effect of Sema5A on glioma cell invasion was evaluated by an in vitro transfilter Matrigel invasion assay. Glioma cells untreated or subjected to Fc control protein stimulation both actively invade through the Matrigel (Fig. 1D). In contrast, Sema5A-Fc significantly reduced the rate of cell invasion to 55% that in the Fc control. To ascertain the role of plexin-B3 in relaying the signal of Sema5A in inhibiting glioma cell invasion, the endogenous expression of plexin-B3 in glioma cells was subjected to down-regulation by RNAi prior to Sema5A stimulation. Western blot analysis of cells transfected with plexin-B3 siRNA-1 or -2 indicated a >80% reduction in plexin-B3 protein expression 48 h post-treatment, whereas scrambled siRNA control and mock transfection have no effect (Fig. 1E). When glioma cells transfected with siRNA control or mock transfected were challenged with Sema5A-Fc, cell invasion was significantly impeded to an extent similar to that in untransfected cells (Fig. 1D). Nonetheless, the effect was almost completely abolished when endogenous expression of plexin-B3 in glioma cells was silenced (Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that Sema5A inhibits glioma cell motility through plexin-B3. In addition, Sema5A was found to impose no appreciable effects on glioma cell proliferation throughout the course of motility assays (data not shown), further supporting its function in suppressing glioma cell migration and invasion. Semaphorins and plexins are known to control cell motility by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics through various mechanisms (13Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To understand the way Sema5A and plexin-B3 inhibit glioma cell motility, we began by characterizing the signal transduction pathways mediated by plexin-B3. A yeast two-hybrid screening for molecules that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of plexin-B3 (plexin-B3CD) revealed candidate clones that showed complete sequence identity to the C-terminal 130 amino acids of RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα), which is known to negatively regulate RhoGTPases by sequestering prenylated GTPases from membranes, blocking guanine nucleotide exchange, and maintaining them in the inactive form in cytosolic complexes (26Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Yamamoto J. Takai Y. J. Biol.

To confirm direct interaction between RhoGDIα and plexin-B3CD, they were expressed as MBP and GST fusion proteins, respectively. The purified recombinant proteins were then subjected to GST pulldown assays. The results showed that RhoGDIα co-precipitated with plexin-B3CD but not with GST protein alone (Fig. 2A). Interaction of plexin-B3CD and RhoGDIα in mammalian brain was also confirmed with in vitro binding assay by incubating mouse total brain lysate with GST-plexin-B3CD, as shown in Fig. 2B. To verify the interaction of endogenous plexin-B3 with RhoGDIα in glioma cells, C6 cells were subjected to three different treatments: (i) nonstimulated, (ii) challenged with Fc control protein, or (iii) challenged with Sema5A-Fc protein prior to immunoprecipitation. Plexin-B3 was found to co-precipitate with RhoGDIα in a Sema5A-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, upper panel). The result was corroborated in reciprocal immunoprecipitation assay using anti-RhoGDIα antibodies (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Plexin-B3 represents the first plexin member and is among the few cell surface receptors that directly interact with RhoGDIα. Next, the RhoGDIα-binding site was mapped by GST pulldown assay using various truncation mutants of plexin-B3CD. Although plexin-B3CD-A–C (which together cover the entire intracellular domain of plexin-B3) all interact with RhoGDIα, the N-terminal fragment A shows significantly stronger binding than B and C, and at a level well above that of full-length plexin-B3CD (Fig. 2D). Further analysis revealed that deletion mutants excluding either fragment A or B (plexin-B3CD-D and -E, respectively) still show stronger interaction than fragment C alone (Fig. 2D). In light of the former report of intramolecular interaction between the N and C terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of plexin-B1 (29Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11473-11480Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we proposed that plexin-B3CD-C might interact with -A and -B, thereby masking the major RhoGDIα binding regions on the latter. Evidence in support of this postulation includes the confirmation of direct binding of GST-plexin-B3CD-A and -B with MBP-plexin-B3CD-C (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, the deletion mutants plexin-B3CD-H and -I (that lack the CRIB domain (30Vikis H.G. Li W. He Z. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or the N-terminal half of fragment C, respectively) allow robust binding to RhoGDIα (Fig. 2D). Notably, the deleted domains in these two mutants are critical for Rac1 binding. Nonetheless, the Rnd1-binding site is only essential for Rac1 but not RhoGDIα interaction (Fig. 2D). In short, the N-terminal half of plexin-B3CD shows preferential binding to RhoGDIα, which, however, can be impaired by the C-terminal Rac1-binding sites via intramolecular interaction. It is tempting to speculate that Sema5A stimulation plausibly promotes conformational changes in plexin-B3CD, which together with the recruitment of Rac1 to the CRIB region would facilitate the binding of RhoGDIα in a ligand-dependent manner. GTPases of the Rho superfamily have been known to play pivotal roles in the control of cell motility"
https://openalex.org/W2060801844,"The neuron-restrictive silencer factor/RE1-silencing transcription factor (NRSF/REST) is a negative regulator of gene expression restricting the expression of neuronal genes to the nervous system. NRSF/REST is highly expressed in non-neuronal tissues like the lung. In previous work, we identified small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines with no detectable NRSF/REST expression that, as a consequence, expressed neuronal markers like L1-cell adhesion molecule (L1-CAM) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). The loss of NRSF/REST expression was linked to malignant progression; however, its mechanistic role remained elusive. Here, we show that NRSF/REST itself, rather than one of its regulated genes, acts like a classic tumour suppressor, being in part regulated by methylation. In SCLCs, NRSF/REST is positively regulated by CREB, with an NRSF/REST promoter fragment showing cell type specificity. Downstream, NRSF/REST directly regulates AKT2, in which NRSF/REST loss leads to an epidermal growth factor-mediated de-regulation of AKT-Serine473 phosphorylation, important for cellular proliferation and survival. Assaying anchorage-independent growth, we observed that with reduced NRSF/REST expression, proliferation was significantly enhanced, whereas NRSF/REST rescue decreased the potential of cells to grow anchorage independently. Our observations support the fact that NRSF/REST may act as an important modulator of malignant progression in SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2047690400,"The MUC1 cytoplasmic tail (MUC1.CT) conducts signals from spatial and extracellular cues (growth factor and cytokine stimulation) to evoke a reprogramming of the cellular transcriptional profile. Specific phosphorylated forms of the MUC1.CT achieve this function by differentially associating with transcription factors and redirecting their transcriptional regulatory capabilities at specific gene regulatory elements. The specificity of interaction between MUC1.CT and several transcription factors is dictated by the phosphorylation pattern of the 18 potential phosphorylation motifs within the MUC1.CT. To better appreciate the scope of differential gene expression triggered by MUC1.CT activation, we performed microarray gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–chip promoter analysis and identified the genome-wide transcriptional targets of MUC1.CT signaling in pancreatic cancer. On a global scale, MUC1.CT preferentially targets genes related to invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis, suggesting that MUC1.CT signaling contributes to establishing a reactive tumor microenvironment during tumor progression to metastatic disease. We examined in detail the molecular mechanisms of MUC1.CT signaling that induces the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2), a potent mediator of ECM remodeling and angiogenesis. We demonstrate a robust induction of CTGF synthesis and secretion in response to serum factors that is enabled only when MUC1 is highly expressed. We demonstrate the requirement of phosphorylation at distinct tyrosine motifs within the MUC1.CT for MUC1-induced CTGF expression and demonstrate a phosphorylation-specific localization of MUC1.CT to the CTGF promoter. We found that MUC1 reorganizes transcription factor occupancy of genomic regions upstream of the CTGF gene, directing β-catenin and mutant p53 to CTGF gene regulatory elements to promote CTGF expression and destabilizing the interaction at these regions of the transcriptional repressor, c-Jun. With this example we illustrate the capacity of MUC1.CT to mediate transcription factor activity in a context-dependent manner to achieve wide spread and robust changes in gene expression and facilitate creation of the reactive tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2127425327,"Loss of p16INK4a–RB and ARF–p53 tumor suppressor pathways, as well as activation of RAS–RAF signaling, is seen in a majority of human melanomas. Although heterozygous germline mutations of p16INK4a are associated with familial melanoma, most melanomas result from somatic genetic events: often p16INK4a loss and N-RAS or B-RAF mutational activation, with a minority possessing alternative genetic alterations such as activating mutations in K-RAS and/or p53 inactivation. To generate a murine model of melanoma featuring some of these somatic genetic events, we engineered a novel conditional p16INK4a-null allele and combined this allele with a melanocyte-specific, inducible CRE recombinase strain, a conditional p53-null allele and a loxP-stop-loxP activatable oncogenic K-Ras allele. We found potent synergy between melanocyte-specific activation of K-Ras and loss of p16INK4a and/or p53 in melanomagenesis. Mice harboring melanocyte-specific activated K-Ras and loss of p16INK4a and/or p53 developed invasive, unpigmented and nonmetastatic melanomas with short latency and high penetrance. In addition, the capacity of these somatic genetic events to rapidly induce melanomas in adult mice suggests that melanocytes remain susceptible to transformation throughout adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2010072619,"Matriptase, a membrane-tethered serine protease, plays essential roles in epidermal differentiation and barrier function, largely mediated via its activation of prostasin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored serine protease. Matriptase activity is tightly regulated by its inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1) such that free active matriptase is only briefly available to act on its substrates. In the current study we provide evidence for how matriptase activates prostasin under this tight control by HAI-1. When primary human keratinocytes are induced to differentiate in a skin organotypic culture model, both matriptase and prostasin are constitutively activated and then inhibited by HAI-1. These processes also occur in HaCaT human keratinocytes when matriptase activation is induced by exposure of the cells to a pH 6.0 buffer. Using this acid-inducible activation system we demonstrate that prostatin activation is suppressed by matriptase knockdown and by blocking matriptase activation with sodium chloride, suggesting that prostatin activation is dependent on matriptase in this system. Kinetics studies further reveal that the timing of autoactivation of matriptase, prostasin activation, and inhibition of both enzymes by HAI-1 binding are closely correlated. These data suggest that, during epidermal differentiation, the matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade is tightly regulated by two mechanisms: 1) prostasin activation temporally coupled to matriptase autoactivation and 2) HAI-1 rapidly inhibiting not only active matriptase but also active prostasin, resulting in an extremely brief window of opportunity for both active matriptase and active prostasin to act on their substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2075041197,"The Pak4 serine/threonine kinase is highly expressed in many cancer cell lines and human tumors. Although several studies have addressed the role for Pak4 in transformation of fibroblasts, most human cancers are epithelial in origin. Epithelial cancers are associated not only with changes in cell growth but also with changes in the cellular organization within the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the affected tissues. In this study we used immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells (iMMECs) as a model system to study the role for Pak4 in mammary tumorigenesis. iMMECs are an excellent model system for studying breast cancer, as they can grow in 3D-epithelial cell culture, in which they form acinar structures that recapitulate in vivo mammary morphogenesis. Although Pak4 is expressed at low levels in wild-type iMMECs, it is overexpressed in response to oncogenes, such as oncogenic Ras and Her2/neu. In this study we found that overexpression of Pak4 in iMMECs leads to changes in 3D acinar architecture that are consistent with oncogenic transformation. These include decreased central acinar cell death, abrogation of lumen formation, cell polarity alterations and deregulation of acinar size and cell number. Furthermore, iMMECs overexpressing Pak4 form tumors when implanted into the fat pads of athymic mice. Our results suggest that overexpression of Pak4 triggers events that are important for the transformation of mammary epithelial cells. This is likely to be owing to the ability of Pak4 to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival and thus subsequent uncontrolled proliferation, and to its ability to deregulate cell shape and polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2034495544,"Global concern over the possible deleterious effects of noise on marine organisms was catalyzed when toothed whales stranded and died in the presence of high intensity sound. The lack of knowledge about mechanisms of hearing in toothed whales prompted our group to study the anatomy and build a finite element model to simulate sound reception in odontocetes. The primary auditory pathway in toothed whales is an evolutionary novelty, compensating for the impedance mismatch experienced by whale ancestors as they moved from hearing in air to hearing in water. The mechanism by which high-frequency vibrations pass from the low density fats of the lower jaw into the dense bones of the auditory apparatus is a key to understanding odontocete hearing. Here we identify a new acoustic portal into the ear complex, the tympanoperiotic complex (TPC) and a plausible mechanism by which sound is transduced into the bony components. We reveal the intact anatomic geometry using CT scanning, and test functional preconceptions using finite element modeling and vibrational analysis. We show that the mandibular fat bodies bifurcate posteriorly, attaching to the TPC in two distinct locations. The smaller branch is an inconspicuous, previously undescribed channel, a cone-shaped fat body that fits into a thin-walled bony funnel just anterior to the sigmoid process of the TPC. The TPC also contains regions of thin translucent bone that define zones of differential flexibility, enabling the TPC to bend in response to sound pressure, thus providing a mechanism for vibrations to pass through the ossicular chain. The techniques used to discover the new acoustic portal in toothed whales, provide a means to decipher auditory filtering, beam formation, impedance matching, and transduction. These tools can also be used to address concerns about the potential deleterious effects of high-intensity sound in a broad spectrum of marine organisms, from whales to fish."
https://openalex.org/W2164582871,"Epoxyeicotrienoic acids (EETs) are cytochrome P450-dependent anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory derivatives of arachidonic acid, which are highly abundant in the kidney and considered reno-protective. EETs are degraded by the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and sEH inhibitors are considered treatment for chronic renal failure (CRF). We determined whether sEH inhibition attenuates the progression of CRF in the 5/6-nephrectomy model (5/6-Nx) in mice. 5/6-Nx mice were treated with a placebo, an ACE-inhibitor (Ramipril, 40 mg/kg), the sEH-inhibitor cAUCB or the CYP-inhibitor fenbendazole for 8 weeks. 5/6-Nx induced hypertension, albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial damage and these effects were attenuated by Ramipril. In contrast, cAUCB failed to lower the blood pressure and albuminuria was more severe as compared to placebo. Plasma EET-levels were doubled in 5/6 Nx-mice as compared to sham mice receiving placebo. Renal sEH expression was attenuated in 5/6-Nx mice but cAUCB in these animals still further increased the EET-level. cAUCB also increased 5-HETE and 15-HETE, which derive from peroxidation or lipoxygenases. Similar to cAUCB, CYP450 inhibition increased HETEs and promoted albuminuria. Thus, sEH-inhibition failed to elicit protective effects in the 5/6-Nx model and showed a tendency to aggravate the disease. These effects might be consequence of a shift of arachidonic acid metabolism into the lipoxygenase pathway."

Fractionation analysis demonstrated that toxin A-induced α-tubulin deacetylation yielded monomeric tubulin, indicating the presence of microtubule depolymerization.

However, despite the presence of a rapid and severe change in the shape of infected cells, the effect of toxin A on the post-translational modification of tubulin and its subsequent influence on microtubule instability have not received detailed attention. Microtubule instability is critical to cell shape (9Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol.

This instability results in the continual and rapid turnover of microtubules, in a process that is crucial for cytoskeletal remodeling (9Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol.

Because microtubules play a pivotal role in mitosis, drugs that influence microtubule polymerization have been used to study the mechanisms of cytoskeletal organization (13Chen J.G. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1935-1938PubMed Google Scholar). For example, colchicine (14Han Y. Malak H. Chaudhary A.G. Chordia M.D. Kingston D.G. Bane S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6636-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is known to inhibit the microtubule polymerization that leads to mitosis, whereas taxol (15Verdier-Pinard P. Wang Z. Mohanakrishnan A.K. Cushman M. Hamel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) stabilizes microtubules and blocks cell division. The instability of microtubules, which are composed of α-tubulin and β-tubulin (16Mejillano M.R. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 657-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has also been associated with post-translational modifications of tubulin, such as tyrosination and acetylation. In particular, acetylation of α-tubulin at Lys-40 has been reported to enhance microtubule polymerization (17North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Although the precise acetyltransferase for tubulin is not yet known, HDAC6 has been implicated in the deacetylation of tubulin (18Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L.

The nine known isoforms of mammalian HDAC can be classified into two groups based on amino acid sequence length and the degree of sequence homology to a single prototypic yeast HDACs. The smaller class I HDACs (400–500 amino acids) include HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 (21Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The larger class II HDACs (∼1,000 amino acids) include HDAC4, HDAC5 (22McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), HDAC6, and HDAC7 (23Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Exp.

Most class I and class II HDACs are located in the nucleus except class II HDAC6, which is localized strictly to the cytosol (20Zhang Y. Li N. Caron C. Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S. Matthias P.

Based on the hypothesis that abnormal microtubule depolymerization would probably result in barrier dysfunction of epithelial cells, we studied the possible effects of HDAC6-mediated tubulin deacetylation on inflammation and epithelial damage induced by C. difficile toxin A. Our results indicate a major effect of toxin A on microtubules in vitro and in vivo mediated by deacetylation of tubulin. Toxin A was purified from C. difficile strain VPI 10463 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) as described previously (27Warny M. Keates A.C. Keates S. Castagliuolo I. Zacks J.K. Aboudola S. Qamar A. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Kelly C.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The purity of native toxin A was assessed by gel electrophoresis, which confirmed a single protein at the expected molecular mass of 307 kDa (28Kim H. Rhee S.H. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 3336-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HT29 and CaCo2 cells derived from human colorectal adenocarcinoma were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen) and DMEM (Invitrogen), respectively. Cells were cultured in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Polyclonal antibodies against tubulin, acetylated tubulin, and HDAC6 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). UDP-2′3′-dialdehyde, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), 3The abbreviations used are: NACN-acetyl-l-cysteineTSAtrichostatin ATERtransepithelial resistanceROSreactive oxygen species. hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium formate, trichostatin A, trapoxin, sodium butyrate, colchicine, and the antibody against β-actin were purchased from Sigma. The polyclonal antibody against caspase-3 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). N-acetyl-l-cysteine trichostatin A transepithelial resistance reactive oxygen species. Human colonocytes were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40), and equal amounts of protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The appropriate antibodies were applied, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected with the LumiGlo reagent (New England Biolabs). HT29 human colonocytes were exposed to toxin A for 4 or 8 h and then washed twice with PBS. For fractionation of polymerized (polymeric) and depolymerized (monomeric) tubulins, the cells were incubated with 0.3 ml of reaction buffer containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 37 °C. The supernatant contained the monomeric tubulin fraction, whereas polymeric tubulin was extracted from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction by incubation in an SDS lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS) for 10 min at 37 °C. These fractions were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotted membranes were probed with antibodies against α-tubulin, acetylated α-tubulin, and β-actin. HT29 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence and exposed to toxin A or H2O2 for 3 h. After centrifugation at 500 × g, the cell pellet was resuspended in five volumes of 0.3 m sucrose and 2% Tween 40 in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-potassium hydroxide (KOH), pH 7.9, containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). After cells were subjected to freezing, thawing, and gentle homogenization, nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm in Buffer A. Supernatants were collected as the cytosolic fractions, and the precipitated pellets were lysed in Buffer A for isolation of the nuclear proteins. Because HDAC6 is mainly present in the cytosol, whereas the other HDAC family proteins localize to the nucleus, the HDAC activity observed in cytosolic extracts was compared with that in nuclear extracts. Activity was measured from colonocyte nuclear and cytosolic extracts using a fluorescence activity assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Using immunoprecipitation assay with an antibody against HDAC6, activity of colonocyte-HDAC6 in the presence and absence of toxin A was confirmed. Briefly, each extract (1 μg of total protein) or each immunoprecipitant was incubated at 37 °C with 100 μm acetylated fluorogenic substrate in HDAC assay buffer. After 30 min, the lysine developer was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured using a Spectra Max M5 fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. This study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Daejin University (Pocheon, Korea). Male CD1 mice (Daehan Biolink, Daejeon, Korea) weighing 30–35 g were used; they had free access to food and water and were acclimated to these conditions for at least 7 days prior to experiments. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Ileal loops (2 cm) were prepared and injected with control buffer (PBS), toxin A (3 μg), TSA (10 nm), or toxin A (3 μg) plus TSA in a volume of 100 μl of PBS. After 4 h, animals were sacrificed, and ileal loop tissues were collected. Tubulin deacetylation and caspase-3 activation were assessed in tissue extracts by immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies. HT29 cells treated with the various agents were incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye for 2 h. The solubilization reagent was added, and the absorbance was determined at 570 nm (model 3550, Bio-Rad). Toxin A was previously reported to stimulate production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) from target cells (20Zhang Y. Li N. Caron C. Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S. Matthias P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1168-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 21Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether this occurred in our mouse model of gut inflammation, ileal loops of the above described mice were homogenized (40 s) and centrifuged (11,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C), and supernatants were collected. Mouse IL-6 and TNF-α were measured by ELISA using appropriate kits obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). For visualization of microtubule structures, colonocytes were exposed to control medium or toxin A for 6 h and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS. After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated with a polyclonal anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody or a polyclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (diluted 1:500) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 6 h at room temperature (29Arregui L. Muñoz-Fontela C. Serrano S. Barasoain I. Guinea A. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2002; 49: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After three washings, the anti-acetylated tubulin antibody-treated cells were incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:500) for 2 h at room temperature. The anti-α-tubulin antibody-treated cells were incubated with Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:500). The cells were then mounted and analyzed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scanning laser microscope equipped with a krypton/argon mixed gas laser as a light source. Excitation was carried out using the 480- or 594-nm lines from the laser. Colonocytes (CaCo-2 cells) were cultured onto polycarbonate filters (Transwells, Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated for 5 days, reaching confluence. After the cells were exposed to toxin A alone, toxin A plus TSA, or colchicine for 8 h, TER was measured with a Millicel ERS Voltohmeter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) (28Kim H. Rhee S.H. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 3336-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The resistance of the supporting membrane and medium was subtracted from all readings. The results are presented as mean values ± S.E. Data were analyzed using the SIGMA-STAT professional statistics software program (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Analyses of variance with protected t tests were used for intergroup comparisons. We exposed HT29 cells to toxin A for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h and then measured changes in tubulin acetylation, which is known to influence microtubule polymerization (17North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, compared with control cells, the basal acetylation level of tubulin in toxin A-treated cells was markedly reduced at 4 and 8 h post-treatment. The total amounts of α-tubulin and β-actin were unchanged in these cells. We then assessed whether toxin A-induced tubulin deacetylation influenced microtubule polymerization. HT29 cells were exposed to toxin A for 0, 4, and 8 h and incubated in cell membrane-permeabilizing buffer for separation of monomeric and polymeric tubulins (30Chang J.S. Kim S.K. Kwon T.K. Bae S.S. Min D.S. Lee Y.H. Kim S.O. Seo J.K. Choi J.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6897-6905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Toxin A treatment of HT29 cells significantly and time-dependently increased the amount of tubulin in the supernatant (super), indicating that most tubulins were monomeric (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the amount of tubulin in cell pellets (containing polymeric tubulins) was markedly reduced following toxin A exposure. Consistent with these findings, highly acetylated tubulins were detected in control cell pellets but not in pellets from cells exposed to toxin A for 4 h (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that toxin A-induced deacetylation of tubulin causes microtubule depolymerization in human colonocytes. We then assessed whether toxin A increased tubulin deacetylation in the gut epithelium of mice. Ileal loops of CD1 mice were injected with 3 μg of toxin A in 100 μl of PBS (n = 10). Four hours later, ileal mucosal scrapings were collected, protein extracts were subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted membranes were probed with an antibody against acetylated α-tubulin. A marked decrease in α-tubulin acetylation was confirmed in ileal mucosa exposed to toxin A compared with controls (Fig. 1C). Quantitation of the immunoblot results showed that tubulin acetylation was 3-fold lower in toxin A-treated mice than in PBS-treated mice (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Collectively, these results indicate that toxin A causes tubulin deacetylation in both cultured colonocytes and the mouse intestinal epithelium. We next assessed whether toxin A-induced deacetylation of tubulin resulted in microtubule depolymerization. To do this, we applied immunofluorescence staining with an antibody against acetylated α-tubulin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control human colonocytes, the anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody clearly revealed typical microtubule shapes in all stained cells (Fig. 2A, arrowheads), whereas the anti-α-tubulin antibody highly detected such shapes in dividing cells that were in the process of forming a mitotic spindle. Exposure of colonocytes to toxin A for 6 h substantially diminished the levels of polymerized microtubules as well as acetylated tubulins compared with that in control cells (Fig. 2B). This finding is consistent with the results in Fig. 1 showing that toxin A treatment caused tubulin deacetylation, leading to increases in monomeric tubulin. This suggests that toxin A, in addition to its role in depolymerizing actin, may also trigger microtubule depolymerization and subsequent cytoskeletal disorganization. Toxin A-induced monoglucosylation of Rho family proteins at threonine 37 inactivates the Rho proteins, resulting in actin disaggregation in various cells (7Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Because a recent study showed that Rho-GTPase is involved in the increased microtubule instability observed in HIV virus-infected host cells (31Naranatt P.P. Krishnan H.H. Smith M.S. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1191-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we assessed whether the enzymatic activity of toxin A was required for toxin A-induced tubulin deacetylation. For this purpose, we used UDP-2′,3′-dialdehyde, which has been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of toxin A without inducing structural changes (32Kim H. Kokkotou E. Na X. Rhee S.H. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. Lamont J.T. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1875-1888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HT29 cells were exposed to UDP-2′,3′-dialdehyde for 1 h prior to toxin A exposure, and changes in tubulin acetylation were measured. As shown in Fig. 3A, toxin A markedly reduced tubulin acetylation in control colonocytes, but this effect was significantly blocked in cells pretreated with UDP-2′,3′-dialdehyde, which by itself did not affect the basal levels of tubulin acetylation. Because toxin A has been shown to rapidly cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as an early downstream signal (33Kim H. Rhee S.H. Kokkotou E. Na X. Savidge T. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21237-21245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we assessed whether blockage of ROS production could inhibit toxin A-induced tubulin deacetylation. Human colonocytes were exposed for 1 h to NAC, an H2O2 scavenger, or sodium formate, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, followed by toxin A stimulation for 4 h. Interestingly, NAC but not sodium formate specifically inhibited tubulin deacetylation in cells exposed to toxin A (Fig. 3B). Conversely, direct exposure of HT29 cells to H2O2 increased tubulin deacetylation in a time/dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C); 500 μm H2O2 completely abrogated acetylation of tubulin within 1 h, and this effect was retained through 2 h post-treatment, indicating that H2O2, one of the main ROS produced in toxin A-treated colonocytes (33Kim H. Rhee S.H. Kokkotou E. Na X. Savidge T. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21237-21245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was capable of directly decreasing tubulin acetylation. Together, these findings suggest that toxin A-induced tubulin deacetylation requires the enzymatic activity of toxin A against Rho proteins as well as the generation of ROS, leading to signal transduction. Because HDAC6, a unique cytosolic deacetylase, is known to be involved in tubulin deacetylation (18Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 19Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P.

Dev. 2007; 21: 3381-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we examined whether toxin A-mediated tubulin deacetylation is associated with HDAC6 activity in human colonocytes, using the selective HDAC6 inhibitor, TSA (34Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y. Seigneurin-Berny D. Osada H. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6820-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). As expected, TSA-treated human colonocytes showed increased tubulin acetylation compared with control cells exposed to culture medium (Fig. 4A). The maximum TSA-induced increase in tubulin acetylation was observed at 1 h post-treatment, and this level was maintained through 6 h post-treatment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, sodium butyrate (But) and trapoxin (TPX), broad spectrum chemical inhibitors of all HDACs except HDAC6 (34Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y. Seigneurin-Berny D. Osada H. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6820-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), did not affect the basal level of tubulin acetylation in human colonocytes (Fig. 4A), suggesting that HDAC6 is the deacetylase for tubulin in human colonocytes. Interestingly, preincubation of colonocytes with TSA for 1 h completely inhibited the deacetylation of tubulin in response to toxin A, whereas sodium butyrate and trapoxin did not affect toxin A-induced tubulin deacetylation (Fig. 4B). Immunostaining and confocal microscopy also revealed that the marked tubulin deacetylation induced by toxin A was blocked in TSA-pretreated cells, whereas sodium butyrate and trapoxin did not inhibit toxin A-induced tubulin deacetylation (Fig. 4C). TSA alone stimulated a marked increase in microtubule polymerization compared with medium control. Using a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay to measure changes on cell viability, we next assessed whether the TSA-induced blockade of tubulin deacetylation could inhibit the marked drop in cell viability observed following toxin A treatment. As shown in Fig. 4D, treatment of TSA but not trapoxin significantly blocked the toxin A-induced reduction of cell viability. TSA alone did not appear to have any effect on colonocyte viability (Fig. 4D). Given that HDAC6 appears to be largely responsible for the increased tubulin deacetylation in colonocytes exposed to toxin A, and HDAC6 is unique among the deacetylases in being restricted to the cytosol, we investigated whether toxin A could activate HDAC6 in colonocytes. Cells were incubated with toxin A or H2O2 for 3 h, and cytosolic extracts taken as representing HDAC6 activity and nuclear extracts taken as representing the activity of the other HDACs were isolated, incubated with an acetylated fluorogenic substrate, and developed for visualization of results. As shown in Fig. 4E, the enzymatic activity of cytosolic HDAC6 was significantly increased by toxin A or H2O2 stimulation, compared with the medium-treated control. In contrast, the basal activity of the nuclear HDACs was relatively higher than that in the cytosol, but toxin A and H2O2 exposure decreased nuclear HDAC activity (Fig. 4E). The purity of subcellular fractionation was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with an β-actin antibody (C, medium; T, toxin A H, H2O2). Immunoprecipitation assay with an antibody against HDAC6 also revealed that activities of HDAC6 isolated from colonocytes exposed to toxin A or H2O2 were markedly increased compared with the medium-treated cells. Moreover, these increases were significantly inhibited by pretreatment of TSA, suggesting that exposure of colonocytes to toxin A results in activation of HDAC6, and this is responsible for tubulin deacetylation and subsequent microtubule disassembly. We next assessed whether blockage of HDAC6 by TSA inhibited the toxin A-induced drop of TER. CaCo-2 cells were treated with TSA for 1 h prior to exposure of toxin A for 3, and TER was measured, starting with an initial value of 300 ohms/cm2. As shown in Fig. 4G, the drop of TER by toxin A was significantly inhibited by TSA. The TER in cells treated with TSA alone was relatively higher than that in cells exposed to control medium. These results also suggest that the tubulin assembly regulated by HDAC6 is also strongly associated with barrier function of epithelial cells. Given our observations that toxin A caused tubulin deacetylation and subsequent microtubule depolymerization and toxin A is known to cause gut inflammation, we speculated that microtubule disorganization in epithelial cells might result in an inflammatory response with barrier dysf"
https://openalex.org/W2022385796,"We focused our attention on brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), the ATPase subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, and analyzed its role in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biology. We hypothesized that deviation from the correct concentration of these proteins, which act at the highest level of gene regulation, may be deleterious for cells. We wanted to know what would happen if a cell had to cope with altered regulation of gene expression, either by upregulation or downregulation of BRG1. We assumed that cells would try to restore homeostasis or, alternatively, that the event could trigger senescence/apoptosis phenomena. To this end, in MSCs, we silenced BRG1gene. Knockdown of BRG1 expression induced a significant increase in senescent cells and decrease in apoptotic cells. It is interesting that BRG1 downregulation also induced an increase in heterochromatin. At the molecular level, these phenomena were associated with activation of retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (RB2)/P130- and P53-related pathways. Senescence was accompanied by reduced expression of some stemness-related genes. This is consistent with our previous research, which showed that BRG1 upregulation by ectopic expression also induced senescence processes. Together, these data suggest that BRG1 belongs to a class of genes whose expression is tightly regulated; hence, subtle alterations in BRG1 activity seem to negatively affect mechanisms regulating chromatin status and, in turn, impair cellular physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2091687885,"Lung cancer is a common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Aberrant activation of WNT signaling is implicated in lung carcinogenesis. EMX2, a human homologue of the Drosophila empty spiracles gene is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor. The function of EMX2 has been linked to the WNT signaling pathway during embryonic patterning in mice. However, little is known about the role of EMX2 in human tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that EMX2 was dramatically downregulated in lung cancer tissue samples and this downregulation was associated with methylation of the EMX2 promoter. Restoration of EMX2 expression in lung cancer cells lacking endogenous EMX2 expression suppressed cell proliferation and invasive phenotypes, inhibited canonical WNT signaling, and sensitized lung cancer cells to the treatment of the chemo cytotoxic drug cisplatin. On the other hand, knockdown of EMX2 expression in lung cancer cells expressing endogenous EMX2 promoted cell proliferation, invasive phenotypes and canonical WNT signaling. Taken together, our study suggests that EMX2 may have important roles as a novel suppressor in human lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2036870702,"Ants use a great variety of recruitment methods to forage for food or find new nests, including tandem running, group recruitment and scent trails. It has been known for some time that there is a loose correlation across many taxa between species-specific mature colony size and recruitment method. Very small colonies tend to use solitary foraging; small to medium sized colonies use tandem running or group recruitment whereas larger colonies use pheromone recruitment trails. Until now, explanations for this correlation have focused on the ants' ecology, such as food resource distribution. However, many species have colonies with a single queen and workforces that grow over several orders of magnitude, and little is known about how a colony's organization, including recruitment methods, may change during its growth. After all, recruitment involves interactions between ants, and hence the size of the colony itself may influence which recruitment method is used—even if the ants' behavioural repertoire remains unchanged. Here we show using mathematical models that the observed correlation can also be explained by recognizing that failure rates in recruitment depend differently on colony size in various recruitment strategies. Our models focus on the build up of recruiter numbers inside colonies and are not based on optimality arguments, such as maximizing food yield. We predict that ant colonies of a certain size should use only one recruitment method (and always the same one) rather than a mix of two or more. These results highlight the importance of the organization of recruitment and how it is affected by colony size. Hence these results should also expand our understanding of ant ecology."
https://openalex.org/W1985610930,"Children with Down's syndrome (DS) have 20–50-fold higher incidence of all leukaemias (lymphoid and myeloid), for reasons not understood. As incidence of many solid tumours is much lower in DS, we speculated that disturbed early haematopoietic differentiation could be the cause of increased leukaemia risk. If a common mechanism is behind the risk of both major leukaemia types, it would have to arise before the bifurcation to myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Using the transchromosomic system (mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)) bearing an extra human chromosome 21 (HSA21)) we analyzed the early stages of haematopoietic commitment (mesodermal colony formation) in vitro. We observed that trisomy 21 (T21) causes increased production of haemogenic endothelial cells, haematopoietic stem cell precursors and increased colony forming potential, with significantly increased immature progenitors. Transchromosomic colonies showed increased expression of Gata-2, c-Kit and Tie-2. A panel of partial T21 ESCs allowed us to assign these effects to HSA21 sub-regions, mapped by 3.5 kbp-resolution tiling arrays. The Gata-2 increase on one side, and c-Kit and Tie-2 increases on the other, could be attributed to two different, non-overlapping HSA21 regions. Using human-specific small interfering RNA silencing, we could demonstrate that an extra copy of RUNX1, but not ETS-2 or ERG, causes an increase in Tie-2/c-Kit levels. Finally, we detected significantly increased levels of RUNX1, C-KIT and PU.1 in human foetal livers with T21. We conclude that overdose of more than one HSA21 gene contributes to the disturbance of early haematopoiesis in DS, and that one of the contributors is RUNX1. As the observed T21-driven hyperproduction of multipotential immature precursors precedes the bifurcation to lymphoid and myeloid lineages, we speculate that this could create conditions of increased chance for acquisition of pre-leukaemogenic rearrangements/mutations in both lymphoid and myeloid lineages during foetal haematopoiesis, contributing to the increased risk of both leukaemia types in DS."
https://openalex.org/W2088291227,"Ras association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1A) is one of the more heavily methylated genes in human cancers. In addition to promoter-specific methylation, RASSF1A polymorphisms have been identified in cancer patients. RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor protein involved in death receptor-dependent apoptosis and it is localized to microtubules. Currently, the biological importance of RASSF1A microtubule localization and the functional consequences of RASSF1A polymorphisms is not understood. In this study, we have investigated both RASSF1A microtubule association and polymorphisms. Loss of RASSF1A microtubule association resulted in the nuclear appearance of RASSF1A and the loss of association with α-, γ- and β-tubulin. Moreover, the loss of microtubule localization of RASSF1A resulted in enhanced tumor-promoting potential, as determined by a xenograft transplantation model in nude mice. It is surprising that, several RASSF1A polymorphisms also lost the ability to associate with α-, γ- and β-tubulin and lost the ability to prevent tumor formation in a xenograft nude mouse model when compared with wild-type RASSF1A. Our results demonstrate a role for RASSF1A microtubule localization in eliciting its tumor suppressor function. In addition, some RASSF1A polymorphisms lack the tumor suppressor function of RASSF1A and, if present in patients, may be tumorigenic."
https://openalex.org/W2027322859,"The Wnt signaling pathway is capable of self-regulation through positive and negative feedback mechanisms. For example, the oncoprotein c-Myc, which is upregulated by Wnt signaling activity, participates in a positive feedback loop of canonical Wnt signaling through repression of Wnt antagonists DKK1 and SFRP1. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1) silencing. Mapping of CpG island methylation of the WIF-1 promoter reveals regional methylation (-295 to -95 bp from the transcription start site) that correlates with transcriptional silencing. We identified Miz-1 as a direct activator of WIF-1 transcriptional activity, which is found at WIF-1 promoter. In addition, we show that c-Myc contributes to WIF-1 transcriptional repression in a Miz-1-dependent manner. Although the transient repression mediated by Miz-1/c-Myc is independent of de novo methylation, the stable repression by this complex is associated with CpG island methylation of the critical -295 to -95-bp region of the WIF-1 promoter. Importantly, Miz-1 and c-Myc are found at WIF-1 promoter in WIF-1 non-expressing cell lines DLD-1 and 209myc. Transient knockdown or somatic knockout of c-Myc in DLD-1 failed to restore WIF-1 expression suggesting that c-Myc is involved in initiating rather than maintaining WIF-1 epigenetic silencing. In a genome-wide screen, DNAJA4, TGFβ-induced and TRIM59 were repressed by c-Myc overexpression and DNA promoter hypermethylation. Our data reveal novel insights into c-Myc-mediated DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing, a mechanism that might contribute to the dysregulation of Wnt signaling in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2170114427,"BCR-ABL1 is a fusion tyrosine kinase, which causes multiple types of leukemia. We used an integrated proteomic approach that includes label-free quantitative protein complex and phosphorylation profiling by mass spectrometry to systematically characterize the proximal signaling network of this oncogenic kinase. The proximal BCR-ABL1 signaling network shows a modular and layered organization with an inner core of three leukemia transformation-relevant adaptor protein complexes (Grb2/Gab2/Shc1 complex, CrkI complex and Dok1/Dok2 complex). We introduced an ‘interaction directionality’ analysis, which annotates static protein networks with information on the directionality of phosphorylation-dependent interactions. In this analysis, the observed network structure was consistent with a step-wise phosphorylation-dependent assembly of the Grb2/Gab2/Shc1 and the Dok1/Dok2 complexes on the BCR-ABL1 core. The CrkI complex demonstrated a different directionality, which supports a candidate assembly on the Nedd9 (Hef1, CasL) scaffold. As adaptor protein family members can compensate for each other in leukemic transformation, we compared members of the Dok and Crk protein families and found both overlapping and differential binding patterns. We identified an additional level of regulation for the CrkII protein via binding to 14-3-3 proteins, which was independent from its inhibitory phosphorylation. We also identified novel components of the inner core complexes, including the kinases Pragmin (Sgk223) and Lrrk1 (Lrrk2 paralog). Pragmin was found as a component of the CrkI complex and is a potential link between BCR-ABL1/CrkI and RhoA signaling. Lrrk1 is an unusual kinase with a GTPase domain. We detected Lrrk1 as a component of the Grb2/Gab2/Shc1 complex and found that it functionally interacts with the regulator of small GTPases Arap1 (Centd2) and possibly participates in the mitogen-activated protein kinase response to cellular stresses. This modular and phosphorylation-driven interaction network provides a framework for the integration of pleiotropic signaling effects of BCR-ABL1 toward leukemic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1972866157,"Concerted actions of various ion channels that are precisely targeted along axons are crucial for action potential initiation and propagation, and neurotransmitter release. However, the dynamics of channel protein transport in axons remain unknown. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we found fluorescently tagged Kv1.2 voltage-gated K(+) channels (YFP-Kv1.2) moved bi-directionally in discrete puncta along hippocampal axons. Expressing Kvbeta2, a Kv1 accessory subunit, markedly increased the velocity, the travel distance, and the percentage of moving time of these puncta in both anterograde and retrograde directions. Suppressing the Kvbeta2-associated protein, plus-end binding protein EB1 or kinesin II/KIF3A, by siRNA, significantly decreased the velocity of YFP-Kv1.2 moving puncta in both directions. Kvbeta2 mutants with disrupted either Kv1.2-Kvbeta2 binding or Kvbeta2-EB1 binding failed to increase the velocity of YFP-Kv1.2 puncta, confirming a central role of Kvbeta2. Furthermore, fluorescently tagged Kv1.2 and Kvbeta2 co-moved along axons. Surprisingly, when co-moving with Kv1.2 and Kvbeta2, EB1 appeared to travel markedly faster than its plus-end tracking. Finally, using fission yeast S. pombe expressing YFP-fusion proteins as reference standards to calibrate our microscope, we estimated the numbers of YFP-Kv1.2 tetramers in axonal puncta. Taken together, our results suggest that proper amounts of Kv1 channels and their associated proteins are required for efficient transport of Kv1 channel proteins along axons."
https://openalex.org/W2133579100,"Background The most deadly form of cancer is not lung or colon, breast or prostate; it is any cancer that has become metastatic. Mortality due to metastatic melanoma, one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers, has increased steadily over the last several decades. Unfortunately, the arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents available today is most often unsuccessful at extending and improving the life expectancy of afflicted individuals. We sought to identify an effective and nontoxic agent against metastatic melanoma. Methodology/Principal Findings We chose to study Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma cells (sub-clone M3, CCL53.1) because these cells are highly aggressive and metastatic, representing one of the deadliest types of cancer. Melanoma cells also had an experimental advantage because their morphology, which is easily monitored, relates to the physiology of metastatic cells and normal melanocytes. We chose to test methyl sulfone as a chemotherapeutic agent for two reasons. Because of its chemical structure, we speculated a potential anti-cancer activity by targeting microtubules. Equally important, methyl sulfone has a well-established safety profile in humans. Surprisingly, we found that malignant melanoma cells exposed to methyl sulfone demonstrated the loss of phenotypes characteristic of malignant cells, and the reemergence of phenotypes characteristic of healthy melanocytes. Briefly, over time methyl sulfone induced contact inhibition, loss of ability to migrate through an extracellular matrix, loss of anchorage-independent growth, proper wound healing followed by contact inhibition, irreversible senescence followed by arborization with melanosomes in arbors as seen in normal melanocytes. Conclusions/Significance Methyl sulfone may have clinical potential as a non-toxic agent effective against metastatic melanoma. Additionally, methyl sulfone has promise as a tool to explore molecular mechanisms of metastatic transformation as well as fundamental processes such as cell migration, contact inhibition, wound healing and cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2000046967,"Nucleoplasmin (NP) is a pentameric chaperone that regulates the condensation state of chromatin extracting specific basic proteins from sperm chromatin and depositing H2A-H2B histone dimers. It has been proposed that histones could bind to either the lateral or distal face of the pentameric structure. Here, we combine different biochemical and biophysical techniques to show that natural, hyperphosphorylated NP can bind five H2A-H2B dimers and that the amount of bound ligand depends on the overall charge (phosphorylation level) of the chaperone. Three-dimensional reconstruction of NP/H2A-H2B complex carried out by electron microscopy reveals that histones interact with the chaperone distal face. Limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry indicate that the interaction results in protection of the histone fold and most of the H2A and H2B C-terminal tails. This structural information can help to understand the function of NP as a histone chaperone."
https://openalex.org/W2162119174,"Epithelial cells (ECs) are usually hyporesponsive to various microbial products. Detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of gram-negative bacteria, is impeded, at least in part, by intracellular sequestration of its receptor, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). In this study, using human bronchial ECs (hBECs) as a model of mucosal epithelium, we tested the hypothesis that the human LPS-binding, membrane-active cationic host defense peptide cathelicidin LL-37 augments epithelial response to LPS by facilitating its delivery to TLR4-containing intracellular compartments. We found that LL-37 significantly increases uptake of LPS by ECs with subsequent targeting to cholera toxin subunit B-labeled structures and lysosomes. This uptake is peptide specific, dose and time dependent, and involves the endocytotic machinery, functional lipid rafts, and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Cathelicidin-dependent LPS internalization resulted in significant increased release of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. This indicates that, in ECs, this peptide may replace LPS-binding protein functions. In polarized ECs, the effect of LL-37 was restricted to the basolateral compartment of the epithelial membrane, suggesting that LL-37-mediated activation of ECs by LPS may be relevant to disease conditions associated with damage to the epithelial barrier. In summary, our study identified a novel role of LL-37 in host-microbe interactions as a host factor that licenses mucosal ECs to respond to LPS."
https://openalex.org/W2077483294,"We have studied the mechanism of activation of native cardiac thin filaments by calcium and rigor myosin. The acceleration of the rate of 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ADP (mdADP) dissociation from cardiac myosin-S1-mdADP-Pi and cardiac myosin-S1-mdADP by native cardiac muscle thin filaments was measured using double mixing stopped-flow fluorescence. Relative to inhibited thin filaments (no bound calcium or rigor S1), fully activated thin filaments (with both calcium and rigor-S1 bound) increase the rate of product dissociation from the physiologically important pre-power stroke myosin-mdADP-Pi by a factor of ∼75. This can be compared with only an ∼6-fold increase in the rate of nucleotide diphosphate dissociation from nonphysiological myosin-mdADP by the fully activated thin filaments relative to the fully inhibited thin filaments. These results show that physiological levels of regulation are not only dependent on the state of the thin filament but also on the conformation of the myosin. Less than 2-fold regulation is due to a change in affinity of myosin-ADP-Pi for thin filaments such as would be expected by a simple “steric blocking” of the myosin-binding site of the thin filament by tropomyosin. Although maximal activation requires both calcium and rigor myosin-S1 bound to the cardiac filament, association with a single ligand produces ∼70% maximal activation. This can be contrasted with skeletal thin filaments in which calcium alone only activated the rate of product dissociation ∼20% of maximum, and rigor myosin produces ∼30% maximal activation.

IntroductionIn striated muscle, contractility is regulated by the thin filament, a protein complex containing F-actin, tropomyosin, and troponin (Tn). 3The abbreviations used are: TntroponinS1myosin subfragment 1cardiac S1porcine ventricular myosin subfragment 1M-ATPmyosin ATPM-ADP-Pimyosin ADP-inorganic phosphatemdADP2′deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ADPmdATP2′deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ATPTmtropomyosinAMactomyosinAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphatemantN-methylanthraniloyl. The core of the thin filament is a double-stranded helix of actin. Tropomyosin fits into the grooves of this helix, each molecule spanning seven actin monomers and interacting end-to-end with its neighbor. One molecule of troponin, itself a complex of three subunits I, C, and T, associates with one actotropomyosin unit (1Cohen C. Sci. Am. 1975; 233: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although there is no atomic structure for the entire thin filament, the broad architectural detail has been worked out. Troponin is composed of a globular core consisting of the I and C subunits along with the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the T subunit (Tn-T2) and an extended tail that arises from the remainder of troponin-T (Tn-T1) (2Ohtsuki I.

The so-called “IT” arm includes the high affinity metal ion sites of troponin-C (C-lobe) and a span of coiled-coil involving helical sections of troponin-T and -I. The regulatory head is a conformational switching center that consists of the low affinity calcium sites of troponin-C (N-lobe) and the troponin-I inhibitory peptide (8Syska H. Wilkinson J.M.

Structural changes associated with the binding of calcium to troponin, as well as rigor myosin binding to the thin filament, are thought to be relayed by way of tropomyosin (10Bremel R. Murray J.M.

U.S.A. 1980; 77: 3186-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) envisions two thin filament conformers of nonidentical affinity for myosin, with the fraction of each state dependent upon the bound ligand (either calcium or rigor myosin). The three-state model (16McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) included a thin filament state (‘blocked') that did not associate with myosin, in addition to weakly binding (“closed”) and strongly binding (“open”) states. Formation of the open state is produced by the binding of ATP-free myosin to the thin filament but not calcium alone.We have used double mixing stopped-flow fluorescence, which permits the selective generation of myosin intermediates (i.e. myosin-ATP ⇄ myosin-ADP-Pi or myosin-ADP) in the first mix, followed by combination with thin filaments in the second mix. This enabled us to measure the release of products from actomyosin-ADP-Pi using an extrinsically fluorescent bacterial inorganic phosphate (Pi)-binding protein (17Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This work showed that the rate of dissociation of Pi from skeletal acto(TnTm)S1-ADP-Pi was the step of the mechanism regulated by calcium and myosin binding to skeletal thin filaments (19Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Contrary to the steric blocking model, the thin filament affinity of S1-ADP-Pi was relatively insensitive to [Ca2+], changing only ∼1.5-fold from pCa 4–7. Contrary to the three-state model, maximal acceleration of Pi dissociation required the binding of both calcium and rigor S1. For example, at pCa > 7, rigor S1 gave less than half-maximal activation (19Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and at pCa < 4 in the absence of rigor S1 activation was only 20%.We subsequently used the fluorescent nucleotide, mdATP, to measure the dependence of the kinetics of mdADP dissociation from acto(TnTm)myosin-mdADP-Pi upon calcium and bound rigor myosin (20Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 668-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The maximum rate of product dissociation was similar whether measured directly by Pi dissociation kinetics or by mdADP dissociation, which is consistent with ordered dissociation of products (Pi then ADP) in which Pi is rate-limiting. Whether Pi release was measured directly or indirectly, regulation could be explained by an allosteric model in which calcium and rigor myosin binding to the thin filament produces a change between active and inactive thin filament conformations.Our previous studies of thin filament regulation were carried out with thin filaments reconstituted from proteins isolated from rabbit fast skeletal muscle (19Heeley D.H.

Here, we have used a similar approach to investigate the mechanism of thin filament regulation in mammalian cardiac muscle.

U.S.A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).We have measured the kinetics of the acceleration of dissociation of mdADP from cardiac S1-mdADP-Pi and S1-mdADP by native porcine cardiac thin filaments in different ligand states using double mixing stopped-flow fluorescence. The maximum acceleration of mdADP dissociation from cardiac S1-mdADP-Pi (∼75-fold) requires both calcium and myosin to be bound to the thin filaments. The thin filament affinity of S1-mdADP-Pi displays less than 2-fold sensitivity to ligand binding, which is incompatible with steric hindrance by tropomyosin of myosin binding to the thin filament being the principal mechanism of regulation. Compared with the skeletal system, however, cardiac thin filaments are significantly more activated (∼70%) by calcium alone, and there is a correspondingly smaller amount of additional rigor activation. These current data can be explained by an allosteric regulation model in which the binding of either calcium alone or rigor S1 alone to the thin filament shifts the equilibrium in favor of the active conformation, but full activation requires binding of both ligands. Overall, cardiac thin filaments are less inhibited and are more easily turned on by either calcium or rigor myosin alone than are skeletal thin filaments. The slower rate of ADP dissociation from cardiac actomyosin (40Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) allowed us to also measure the regulation of the dissociation of mdADP from cardiac acto(TnTm)S1. Acceleration of the rate of dissociation of mdADP from cardiac acto(TnTm)S1 by calcium and rigor myosin binding was only ∼6-fold compared with ∼75-fold acceleration of the rate mdADP dissociation from acto(TnTm)S1-mdADP-Pi. Thus, different myosin nucleotide complexes appear to be subject to different mechanisms of thin filament regulation.DISCUSSIONWe have extended our analysis of thin filament regulation to cardiac muscle. Native cardiac thin filaments and cardiac S1 were used in conjunction with double mixing stopped-flow fluorescence and active enzyme centrifugation to investigate the regulation, by calcium and rigor myosin, of thin filament activation of mdADP dissociation from two distinct myosin-nucleotide complexes, actomyosin-mdADP-Pi and actomyosin-mdADP. The results, which are summarized in Table 1, can be compared with those previously obtained with rabbit skeletal thin filaments (19Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 668-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For both cardiac and skeletal muscle thin filaments, acceleration of product release from acto(TnTm)S1-ADP-Pi is the principal regulated step and proceeds by an ordered mechanism in which phosphate dissociation precedes ADP dissociation. In both instances, maximum activation of product release requires the binding of both calcium and rigor myosin to the thin filament, and the effect of calcium and rigor myosin binding can be explained by an allosteric model of regulation in which a given ligand shifts the equilibrium of the cardiac thin filament from the inactive to the active conformation. This study also shows significant differences between the mechanisms of regulation of cardiac and skeletal thin filaments, principally cardiac thin filaments are more fully activated by calcium or rigor S1 alone. In addition, the slower rates of ADP dissociation from cardiac actomyosin-ADP (47White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 982-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) allowed us to directly measure the regulation of mdADP dissociation from cardiac acto(TnTm)myosin S1-ADP.TABLE 1Summary of the acceleration of product dissociation kinetics from myosin S1-mdADP-Pi and myosin S1-mdADP by thin filaments and F-actin+TnTm, pCa > 7, 0 [rigor myosin]a[S1] = 0.+TnTm, pCa < 4, 0 [rigor myosin]a[S1] = 0.+TnTm, pCa > 7, 1 [rigor myosin]/7 [actin]b[S1]/[actin] = 1/7.+TnTm, pCa < 4, 1 [rigor myosin]/7 [actin]b[S1]/[actin] = 1/7.Actin,cPurified rabbit skeletal F-actin is in the absence of regulatory proteins.

Open table in a new tab A simple steric blocking mechanism in which the tropomyosin inhibits myosin binding to thin filaments at low calcium predicts that the primary effect of regulation upon the kinetic mechanism would be expected to alter the affinity of S1-ADP-Pi for thin filaments. Such a mechanism was inconsistent with subsequent observations that the effect of calcium upon the affinity of myosin for thin filaments during steady state ATP hydrolysis is small (45Chalovich J.M. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2432-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The kinetic results (summarized in Table 1) and active enzyme centrifugation results (Fig. 7) are consistent with this view in that there is only a small (<2-fold) increase in the apparent affinity of M-ADP-Pi for maximally activated filaments (calcium and rigor heads bound) relative to either partially activated (calcium or rigor heads bound) or maximally inhibited thin filaments (neither calcium or rigor heads bound).A three-state regulation model is shown in Fig. 8 (16McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In this model, the blocked state myosin is prevented from binding to the thin filament. The closed state of thin filaments allows myosin binding but does not allow completion of the power stroke. The open state is fully active, accelerating phosphate dissociation to produce a power stroke. The experiments upon which the three-state model is based were equilibrium and kinetic measurements of rigor S1 (and other myosin-ligands that produce open switch II myosin conformations) binding to the thin filament. The three-state model assumed that the binding of either rigor myosin or myosin with ligands such as ADP, pyrophosphate, AMP-PNP, and ADP-Pi to actin (or thin filaments) occurs by the same two-step mechanism except that the equilibrium constant of the second step is altered by the bound ligand. However, it is now generally accepted that myosin exists in multiple conformations and that the conformation is dependent upon the ligands bound to the active site. Of the ligands listed above, only M-ADP-Pi produces predominantly the closed pre-power stroke switch II conformation, which is the intermediate that produces a power stroke when myosin binds to actin. The other ligands stabilize myosin predominantly in open post-power stroke switch II conformation that does not produce a power stroke on binding to actin (49Steffen W. Sleep J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12904-12909Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).There are also several features of the three-state model for thin filament regulation that are not consistent with the kinetic data summarized in Table 1. First, the ∼75-fold acceleration of product release from myosin-mdADP-Pi by thin filaments at high calcium but without rigor myosin bound is 5–10 times greater than the acceleration predicted by the calcium dependence (3–5-fold) of the equilibrium constant between the closed and open states, KT (16McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) of skeletal thin filaments and ∼75 times greater than that measured with cardiac thin filaments (50Maytum R. Westerdorf B. Jaquet K. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6696-6701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Second, the three-state model predicts that rigor binding should fully activate product release at low calcium, but as is shown in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, rigor binding at pCa > 7 produces only about 70% of the maximal rate of product release that occurs with both calcium and rigor heads bound to the thin filament.The data in Table 1 compare the effect of calcium and rigor cardiac S1 on the rate of dissociation of mdADP from the physiological complex acto(TnTm)S1-mdADP-Pi and the nonphysiological complex acto(TnTm)S1-mdADP. The apparent affinity (KTF) of S1-mdADP-Pi binding to thin filaments shows little calcium dependence, suggesting that there is no blocked state present and that KB in the three-state model is ≫1. The absence of the blocked state is not unexpected in view of previous observations that the block state is not present in skeletal muscle thin filaments at ionic strengths <50 mm (51Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 52Head J.G. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, we observed a 2–4-fold increase in KTF of cardiac S1-ADP for cardiac thin filaments at low ionic strength upon increasing the concentration of calcium from pCa >7 to <4, which is similar to the calcium dependence of the equilibrium between the open and blocked states of the three-state model at physiological ionic strength. Although it is possible that we missed the blocked state for M-ADP-Pi binding to thin filaments because of the very low ionic strength, which we were required to use to obtain maximal dissociation rates, our observation of an apparent blocked state for mdADP dissociation kinetics (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6 and Table 1) suggests that it is the ligand bound to the myosin and not ionic strength that is the most significant factor in determining the regulatory mechanism.Both pCa < 4 and rigor-bound cardiac S1 produce near maximal acceleration (5–6-fold) of mdADP dissociation at saturating concentrations of thin filaments. The good agreement between the data obtained for mdADP dissociation from acto(TnTm)S1-mdADP with the predictions of the three-state model of thin filament regulation is likely because the myosin is in the same open switch II conformation in both sets of experiments.The model that we previously proposed for the regulation of skeletal muscle thin filaments (20Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 668-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is shown in Scheme 2 using the data from Table 1 for cardiac thin filaments. In Scheme 2, calcium and rigor S1 shift the equilibrium from the inactive (I) to the active (A) conformation of the thin filaments. Our model is similar to the modified model of Hill et al. (15Hill T.L. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in which the thin filament conformation is either active (A) or inactive (I) with regard to the ability to bind myosin (6Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The model allows a quantitative evaluation of the relationship between activation of product dissociation and calcium and rigor myosin binding to cardiac thin filaments to be made. In a manner similar to that observed for skeletal thin filaments, the equilibrium strongly favors the inactive form in the absence of bound calcium and rigor myosin.The dependence of the conformational equilibrium constants, Kc upon the ligands calcium and myosin, Ko = 0.02 (no ligands), KCa = 3 (calcium only), KM = 2 (rigor heads only), and KMCa > 10 (rigor and calcium activation), is calculated from the maximum rate of activation as described in the legend of Table 1. The accuracy of the values estimated for the equilibrium between the inactive and active conformers is reasonably good for Ko, KCa, and KM, but only a lower limit of 10 could be obtained for KMCa. A comparison between the extent of activation of cardiac and skeletal thin filaments is shown in Fig. 9. Cardiac thin filaments are more activated by either calcium or rigor binding alone. Cardiac thin filaments are ∼70% activated by pCa < 4 in the presence of MgATP (no rigor myosin binding) compared with skeletal thin filaments, which are only ∼20% activated under similar conditions. Our results indicate that cardiac muscle is primarily regulated by calcium binding to the thin filament and that any rigor-bound heads produced during contraction would be expected to produce only a small additional activation. Similar observations were made using bifunctional fluorescent labels on TnC exchanged into cardiac muscle to measure conformational changes in TnC produced by calcium and rigor myosin. These results showed that although myosin binding can switch on cardiac thin filaments in rigor conditions, it does not significantly contribute to activation under physiological conditions (53Sun Y.B.

Copper-induced differential subcellular localization may play a critical role with respect to fine tuning the number of Ctr4 and Ctr5 molecules at the cell surface. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to analyze protein-protein interactions in vivo in S. pombe. The assay is based on the observation that N- and C-terminal subfragments of the Venus fluorescent protein can reconstitute a functional fluorophore only when they are brought into tight contact. Wild-type copies of the ctr4+ and ctr5+ genes were inserted downstream of and in-frame with the nonfluorescent C-terminal (VC) and N-terminal (VN) coding fragments of Venus, respectively. Co-expression of Ctr4-VC and Ctr5-VN fusion proteins allowed their detection at the plasma membrane of copper-limited cells. Similarly, cells co-expressing Ctr4-VN and Ctr4-VC in the presence of Ctr5-Myc12 displayed a fluorescence signal at the plasma membrane. In contrast, Ctr5-VN and Ctr5-VC co-expressed in the presence of Ctr4-Flag2 failed to be visualized at the plasma membrane, suggesting a requirement for a combination of two Ctr4 molecules with one Ctr5 molecule. We found that plasma membrane-located Ctr4-VC-Ctr5-VN fluorescent complexes were internalized when the cells were exposed to high levels of copper. The copper-induced internalization of Ctr4-VC-Ctr5-VN complexes was not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. When cells were transferred back from high to low copper levels, there was reappearance of the BiFC fluorescent signal at the plasma membrane. Significance These findings reveal a copper-dependent internalization and recycling of the heteromeric Ctr4-Ctr5 complex as a function of copper availability."

Peroxisomes biogenesis can be induced by the presence of peroxisome proliferators, including fatty acids, which activate complex cellular programs that underlie the induction process. Here, we used multi-parameter quantitative phenotype analyses of an arrayed mutant collection of yeast cells induced to proliferate peroxisomes, to establish a comprehensive inventory of genes required for peroxisome induction and function. The assays employed include growth in the presence of fatty acids, and confocal imaging and flow cytometry through the induction process. In addition to the classical phenotypes associated with loss of peroxisomal functions, these studies identified 169 genes required for robust signaling, transcription, normal peroxisomal development and morphologies, and transmission of peroxisomes to daughter cells. These gene products are localized throughout the cell, and many have indirect connections to peroxisome function. By integration with extant data sets, we present a total of 211 genes linked to peroxisome biogenesis and highlight the complex networks through which information flows during peroxisome biogenesis and function."

We demonstrate that swapping the N terminus of PIASy protein with the corresponding region of other PIAS family members abolishes chromosomal binding and mitotic SUMOylation. We further show that the N-terminal domain of PIASy is sufficient for centromeric localization. We identified that the N-terminal domain of PIASy interacts with the Rod/Zw10 complex, and immunofluorescence further reveals that PIASy colocalizes with Rod/Zw10 in the centromeric region. We show that the Rod/Zw10 complex interacts with the first 47 residues of PIASy which were particularly important for mitotic SUMOylation. Finally, we show that depletion of Rod compromises the centromeric localization of PIASy and SUMO2/3 in mitosis.

The SUMO2/3 modification of chromosomal proteins is restricted not only to the early stages of mitosis but also to the centromeric regions, raising the question of how PIASy regulates mitotic SUMOylation in a temporal and regional manner (7Azuma Y.

Recent immunostaining has elucidated that PIASy is exclusively localized to centromeric regions and colocalizes with TopoIIα during mitosis, suggesting that the centromeric localization of PIASy is critical for the spatiotemporal regulation of mitotic SUMOylation. 3H.

Centromeres are specified regions of DNA where kinetochores are assembled to capture growing microtubules from spindle poles in mitosis (21Torras-Llort M. Moreno-Moreno O. Azorín F. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2337-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Kinetochores include multiple proteins whose functions are involved in mitotic checkpoints directly or indirectly, and each component is absolutely required for the accurate progression of the cell cycle including proper chromosome segregation (22Santaguida S. Musacchio A. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2511-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Rod (Rough deal) and Zw10 (Zeste white 10) are kinetochore proteins in higher eukaryotes (23Karess R. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 386-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As a stable complex called RZZ (Rod/Zw10/Zwilch), Rod and Zw10 are localized to the kinetochore until anaphase commences (24Basto R. Scaerou F. Mische S. Wojcik E. Lefebvre C. Gomes R. Hays T.

To determine how PIASy distinctively executes mitotic SUMOylation in a spatiotemporal manner, we have identified the mechanism of PIASy recruitment onto mitotic chromosomes. Using a series of purified PIASy truncations, we found that the N-terminal region of PIASy is vital for chromosome localization and for consequent mitotic SUMOylation but is dispensable for the catalytic activity in vitro. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability of a PIASy N-terminal peptide to interact with chromosomes. Chimeric PIASy containing the N-terminal domain of other PIAS family proteins is defective in chromosome interaction. A PIASy N-terminal peptide fused with mCherry is localized to the centromeric region. Immunofluorescence microscopy combined with biochemical analysis and mass spectrometry revealed that Rod and Zw10 are unique binding proteins of PIASy N terminus among PIAS family proteins. Finally, we show that depletion of Rod proteins from XEE causes mis-localization of PIASy as well as loss of SUMO2/3 foci on the chromosomes. Taken together, these data reveal that PIASy is recruited onto the centromeric region of chromosomes through interaction of the PIASy N terminus with the Rod/Zw10 kinetochore complex, and this results in specific SUMOylation of the centromeric region. The C-terminal portion, encoding amino acids 970∼1060, of Rod DNA was cloned from Xenopus laevis tadpole cDNA (kindly provided by Drs. A. Arnaoutov and M. Dasso) using PCR amplification. For recombinant protein production, the C-terminal fragment of Rod cDNA was subcloned into pET28a and pGEX4T-1 with BamHI/XhoI restriction enzyme sites. PIASy truncations, shown in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 5 were produced by PCR and subcloned into the pET28a vector using EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites. N-terminal fragments of PIAS family DNAs were amplified from original full-length cDNA of each PIAS gene (7Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with additional EcoRI sites at the 5′-end and HinDIII sites at 3′-end, respectively, and were subcloned into the pET30a vector for recombinant protein production. For N-terminal-swapped chimeric constructs of PIASy, a DNA fragment of X. laevis PIASy without the N-terminal domain (amino acids 142∼501) was amplified by PCR creating HinDIII site at the 5′-end and XhoI site at 3′-end, respectively, and subcloned into pET28a. Subsequently, the N-terminal fragments of each PIAS equivalent of 1∼141 amino acids of PIASy was ligated to the PIASy C-terminal construct. In the case of the C-terminal PIAS-swapped chimeric constructs (y-1, y-3, y-x and y-yhs in Fig. 2), C-terminal fragment of PIAS DNAs equivalent to 410–501 amino acid of PIASy were amplified with additional BglII site at the 5′-end and XhoI sites at 3′-end, respectively. A DNA fragment of X. laevis PIASy lacking the C-terminal domain (1- 410 amino acids) was obtained by digesting full-length PIASy in pET28a with EcoRI and BamHI. The C-terminal fragments of PIAS proteins and the PIASy (1–410) fragment were ligated into pET28a EcoRI/XhoI sites. For mCherry fusion of N-terminal fragments of PIASx and PIASy, PCR-amplified mCherry cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. B. Oakley) with NotI and XhoI sites at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was inserted into pET30a N-terminal PIAS constructs described above. cDNA of TopoIIα was subcloned into a pPIC 3.5K vector in which CBP-T7 Tag sequences were inserted. (The CBP and ZZ TAP tag plasmid was kindly provided from Dr. K. Gould.) All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.FIGURE 1N terminus of PIASy is dispensable in vitro but essential for mitotic SUMOylation in Xenopus egg extract assays.

https://openalex.org/W1998896764,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) at the parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapse in the cerebellum is a recently described and poorly characterized form of synaptic plasticity. The induction mechanism for LTP at this synapse is considered reciprocal to ""classical"" LTP at hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons: kinases promote increased trafficking of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic density in the hippocampus, whereas phosphatases decrease internalization of AMPA receptors in the cerebellum. In the hippocampus, LTP occurs in overlapping phases, with the transition from early to late phases requiring the consolidation of initial induction processes by structural re-arrangements at the synapse. Many signalling pathways have been implicated in this process, including PI3 kinases and Rho GTPases.We hypothesized that analogous phases are present in cerebellar LTP, and took as the starting point for investigation our recent discovery that P-Rex--a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor which is activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)--is highly expressed in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons and plays a role in motor coordination. We found that LTP evoked at parallel fibre synapses by 1 Hz stimulation or by NO donors was not sustained beyond 30 min when P-Rex was eliminated or Rac inhibited, suggesting that cerebellar LTP exhibits a late phase analogous to hippocampal LTP. In contrast, inhibition of PI3 kinase activity eliminated LTP at the induction stage.Our data suggest that a PI3K/P-Rex/Rac pathway is required for late phase LTP in the mouse cerebellum, and that other PI3K targets, which remain to be discovered, control LTP induction."

https://openalex.org/W2082340646,"Calpain 3 (CAPN3) is a cysteine protease that when mutated causes Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2A. It is thereby the only described Calpain family member that genetically causes a disease. Due to its inherent instability little is known of its substrates or its mechanism of activity and pathogenicity. In this investigation we define a primary sequence motif underlying CAPN3 substrate cleavage. This motif can transform non-related proteins into substrates, and identifies >300 new putative CAPN3 targets. Bioinformatic analyses of these targets demonstrate a critical role in muscle cytoskeletal remodeling and identify novel CAPN3 functions. Among the new CAPN3 substrates are three E3 SUMO ligases of the Protein Inhibitor of Activated Stats (PIAS) family. CAPN3 can cleave PIAS proteins and negatively regulates PIAS3 sumoylase activity. Consequently, SUMO2 is deregulated in patient muscle tissue. Our study thus uncovers unexpected crosstalk between CAPN3 proteolysis and protein sumoylation, with strong implications for muscle remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2082001892,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is mitogenic for several cell types including pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC), and is associated with the abnormal vascular smooth muscle remodeling that occurs in pulmonary arterial hypertension. RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) function is required for 5-HT-induced PASMC mitogenesis, and 5-HT activates RhoA; however, the signaling steps are poorly defined. Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEFs) transduce extracellular signals to Rho, and we found that 5-HT treatment of PASMC led to increased membrane-associated Lbc Rho GEF, suggesting modulation by 5-HT. Lbc knockdown by siRNA attenuated 5-HT-induced thymidine uptake in PASMC, indicating a role in PASMC mitogenesis. 5-HT triggered Rho-dependent serum response factor-mediated reporter activation in PASMC, and this was reduced by Lbc depletion. Lbc knockdown reduced 5-HT-induced RhoA/ROCK activation, but not p42/44 ERK MAP kinase activation, suggesting that Lbc is an intermediary between 5-HT and RhoA/ROCK, but not ERK. 5-HT stimulation of PASMC led to increased association between Lbc, RhoA, and the α-catulin scaffold. Furthermore, α-catulin knockdown attenuated 5-HT-induced PASMC thymidine uptake. 5-HT-induced PASMC mitogenesis was reduced by dominant-negative G(q) protein, suggesting cooperation with Lbc/α-catulin. These results for the first time define a Rho GEF involved in vascular smooth muscle cell growth and serotonin signaling, and suggest that Lbc Rho GEF family members play distinct roles. Thus, the Lbc/α-catulin axis participates in 5-HT-induced PASMC mitogenesis and RhoA/ROCK signaling, and may be an interventional target in diseases involving vascular smooth muscle remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2001058227,"CDK2-cyclin E triggers centrosome duplication, and nucleophosmin (NPM/B23) is found to be one of its targets. NPM/B23 phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E acquires a high binding affinity to Rho-associated kinase (ROCK II), and physically associates with ROCK II. The NPM/B23-binding results in superactivation of ROCK II, which is a critical event for initiation of centrosome duplication. The activation of ROCK II also requires the binding of Rho small GTPase to the auto-inhibitory region; hence the availability of the active Rho protein is an important aspect of the centrosomally localized ROCK II to properly initiate centrosome duplication. There are three isoforms of Rho (RhoA, B and C), all of which are capable of binding to and priming the activation of ROCK II. Here, we investigated which Rho isoform(s) are involved in the activation of ROCK II in respect to the initiation of centrosome duplication. We found that both RhoA and RhoC, but not RhoB, were required for initiation of centrosome duplication, and overactivation of RhoA, as well as RhoC, but not RhoB, promoted centrosome duplication and centrosome amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2123812711,"Traditionally, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) interactions with their G proteins and regulatory proteins, GPCR kinases (GRKs) and arrestins, are described as sequential events involving rapid assemblies/disassemblies. To directly monitor the dynamics of these interactions in living cells, we combined two spectrally resolved bioluminescence and one fluorescence resonance energy transfer (RET) methods. The RET combination analysis revealed that stimulation of the α(2A)-adrenergic receptor (α(2A)AR) leads to the recruitment of GRK2 at a receptor still associated with the Gα(i1)β(1)γ(2) complex. The interaction kinetics of GRKs with Gγ(2) (2.8 ± 0.4 s) and α(2A)AR (5.2 ± 0.5 s) were similar to that of the receptor-promoted change in RET between Gα(i1) and Gγ(2) (5.2 ± 1.2 s), and persisted until the translocation of βarrestin2 to the receptor, indicating that GRK2 remains associated to the receptor/G-protein complex for longer periods than anticipated. Moreover, GRK2 or a kinase-deficient GRK2 mutant, but not GRK5, potentiated the receptor-promoted changes in RET between Gα(i1) and Gγ(2) and abrogated the α(2A)AR-stimulated calcium response, suggesting that the recruitment of GRK2 to the complex contributes to the structural rearrangement and functional regulation of the signaling unit, independently of the kinase activity. RET combination analysis revealed unanticipated dynamics in GPCR signaling and will be applicable to many biological systems."

https://openalex.org/W1975446426,"Under basal growth conditions, p53 function is tightly controlled by the members of MDM family, MDM2 and MDM4. The Mdm2 gene codes, in addition to the full-length p90MDM2, for a short protein, p76MDM2 that lacks the p53-binding domain. Despite this property and at variance with p90MDM2, this protein acts positively toward p53, although the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that p76MDM2 antagonizes MDM4 inhibitory function. We show that p76MDM2 possesses intrinsic ubiquitinating and degrading activity, and through these activities controls MDM4 levels. Furthermore, the presence of p76MDM2 decreases the association of MDM4 with p53 and p90MDM2, and antagonizes p53 degradation by the heterodimer MDM4/p90MDM2. The p76MDM2-mediated regulation of MDM4 occurs in the cytoplasm, under basal growth conditions. Conversely, upon DNA damage, phosphorylation of MDM4Ser403 dissociates p76MDM2 and prevents MDM4 degradation. The overall negative control of MDM4 by p76MDM2 reflects on p53 function as p76MDM2 impairs MDM4-mediated inhibition of p53 activity. In agreement with the positive role of p76MDM2 toward p53, the p76MDM2/p90MDM2 ratio significantly decreases in a group of thyroid tumor samples compared with normal counterparts. Overall, these findings reveal a new mechanism in the control of p53 basal activity that may account for the distinct sensitivity of tissues to stress signals depending on the balance among MDM proteins. Moreover, these data suggest an oncosuppressive function for a product of the Mdm2 gene."

Under standard light conditions, the second chromophore is considered nonessential for photoreactivation because DNA photolyase bound to only FAD is sufficient to catalyze the repair of UV-damaged DNA. phr1 is a photoreactivation-deficient strain of Chlamydomonas. In this work, the PHR1 gene of Chlamydomonas was cloned through molecular mapping and shown to encode a protein similar to known FO synthases. Additional results revealed that the phr1 strain was deficient in an FO-like molecule and that this deficiency, as well as the phr1 photoreactivation deficiency, could be rescued by transformation with DNA constructs containing the PHR1 gene. Furthermore, expression of a PHR1 cDNA in Escherichia coli produced a protein that generated a molecule with characteristics similar to FO. Together, these results indicate that the Chlamydomonas PHR1 gene encodes an FO synthase and that optimal photoreactivation in Chlamydomonas requires FO, a molecule known to serve as a second chromophore for DNA photolyases."

Previously, Trinidad and Cohen (13Trinidad J.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31622-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that in cultured myotubes agrin-induced AChR clustering was inhibited by co-treatment with Nrg-1. We showed that agrin failed to cluster AChRs in cultured myotubes expressing a constitutively active neuregulin receptor ErbB2 (14Ponomareva O.N. Ma H. Vock V.M. Ellerton E.L. Moody S.E. Dakour R. Chodosh L.A. Rimer M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, when expressed in developing muscle fibers in vivo, constitutively active ErbB2 led to synaptic loss resembling the neuromuscular phenotype in mice deficient for agrin (14Ponomareva O.N.

These results suggested antagonistic interactions between the neuregulin and agrin signaling pathways in developing skeletal muscle and raised the possibility that understanding the molecular mechanisms that mediate such interaction may lead to better understanding of normal agrin signaling. Sustained activation of ERK1/2 is a major signaling event induced by Nrg-1 on skeletal muscle cells (15Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol.

Furthermore, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator that was among the first identified inhibitors of agrin-induced AChR clustering on myotubes (17Wallace B.G. J.

Here, it was investigated whether agrin can activate ERK1/2 directly and whether such activation can modulate agrin-induced AChR clustering. It was found that agrin indeed induces a rapid but transient activation of ERK1/2 in myotubes that is Lrp4/MuSK-dependent. However, blocking this ERK1/2 activation does not prevent but potentiates AChR clustering induced by agrin. ERK1/2 activation is not required for Nrg-1-mediated inhibition of the AChR clustering activity of agrin, but mediates such activity by PMA. These results implicate agrin-induced ERK1/2 activation in a feedback loop that negatively modulates agrin signaling to muscle cells. Recombinant rat C-terminal agrin was from R&D Systems. Most experiments were done with the carrier-free product (catalogue number 550-AG/CF). The carrier (BSA)-containing product (catalogue number 550-AG) was also used in some experiments with similar results. Recombinant human Nrg-1-β1 EGF domain was from R&D Systems. PMA and U0126 were purchased from Sigma. PD0325901 was purchased from Selleck. PMA, U0126, and PD0325901 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma). DMEM, gentamicin, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without CaCl2 and MgCl2 were from Invitrogen. FBS and horse serum were from Gemini Bio-Products. Matrigel was from BD Biosciences. Chick embryo extract was from Sera Laboratories International. Interferon-γ was from PeproTech. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (number 9101) and anti-total ERK1/2 (number 9102) primary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The Western Lighting Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit used for developing Western blots was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rhodamine-α-bungarotoxin was from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Vectashield mounting medium was from Vector Labs. The C2 cells used in this study were initially derived from C2 cells in the Burden lab (Skirball Institute, New York University Medical Center). They have been used in the Rimer lab since 2001. Myoblasts were grown on Matrigel in DMEM, 15% FBS, 0.5% chick embryo extract, and 50 μg/ml of gentamicin. To slow their growth, myoblasts were often grown with the above medium but using 10% FBS. At confluence, myoblasts were switched into differentiation medium (C2DM) containing DMEM, 2.5% horse serum, and 50 μg/ml of gentamicin. C2 cells were grown and differentiated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Myotubes were used for experiments after 2–3 days in C2DM. Wild type, Lrp4−/−, and MuSK−/− immorto+ cells were a kind gift of Steven Burden and Ruth Herbst (Medical University of Vienna). Immorto+ cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 33 °C in 10% CO2 in the following medium: DMEM (with sodium pyruvate), 15% FBS, 2% chicken embryo extract, 50 μg/ml of gentamicin, and 100 μg/ml of interferon-γ. At confluence they were differentiated in a humidified incubator at 39 °C in 10% CO2 in the following medium: DMEM (with sodium pyruvate), 10% FBS, 10% horse serum, 0.5% chicken embryo extract, 50 μg/ml of gentamicin. Myotubes were used for experiments after 2–3 days in differentiation medium. For these experiments C2 cells were grown and differentiated in 60-mm dishes. Myotubes were switched into DMEM + gentamicin for about 4 h before treatment. This medium was replaced with fresh medium previously warmed at 37 °C, with or without 0.1 nm agrin. Dishes were returned to the incubator and at different times thereafter, the dishes were taken out and the medium was aspirated and replaced with ice-cold PBS. Such dishes were kept on ice until lysates were prepared. 1 ml/dish of the following lysis buffer was used: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 95 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaFl, 2 mm Na+ orthovanadate, 2.5 mm Na+ pyrophosphate, 10% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma). Cell scrapers were used to detach the cells from the dish and the slurry was passed several times through a 21-gauge syringe. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until use. Western blotting was done as previously described (19Rimer M. Prieto A.L. Weber J.L. Colasante C. Ponomareva O. Fromm L. Schwab M.H. Lai C. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 75 μg of protein/sample were separated in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Membranes were probed first with anti-pERK1/2 antibodies diluted 1/1000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS-T), 1–5% BSA, and the above phosphatase inhibitors. Membranes were then stripped and reprobed with anti-tERK1/2 antibodies diluted 1/1000–1/3000 in TBS-T, 1–5% BSA. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions. During early experiments membranes were developed on BioMax x-ray film (Kodak). Later, a digital gel imaging system was used. All Western blot quantification was done using the digital system as described below. For experiments with the immorto+ myotubes (Fig. 2) everything was the same as above except that cultures were incubated in C2DM for at least 4 h before adding 0.5 nm agrin. Myotubes were kept at 39 °C in 10% CO2 during this preincubation with C2DM and throughout the experiment. For Western blot quantification, images of the developed membranes were captured with a CCD camera attached to a FluorChem Q MultiImage III system (Alpha Innotech). Exposure times (usually 45 s) were below saturation. ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) bands were quantified separately with AlphaView software (Alpha Innotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Intensity values were corrected with the local background option of the program. For each band, values from the blot probed with anti-pERK1/2 were divided by values from the blot probed with anti-tERK1/2 to derive a phosphorylated/total ratio. These values were divided in turn by the ratio in the control (untreated) samples to derive normalized intensities for each band in each different experiment. Thus, the normalized intensity value for the control sample in each experiment was always 1. The lysis buffer used to prepare samples in Fig. 4A was 30 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl. Phosphatase and protease inhibitors were the same as for the previous lysis buffer except that 100 nm okadaic acid (Sigma) was also added. For these experiments C2 cells were grown and differentiated in 35-mm dishes. Treatments were done in duplicate per experiment. Details of the specific treatments can be found under “Results” and in the figure legends. Following treatments, AChRs were stained live by incubation with 50 nm α-bungarotoxin for 30 min in the cell incubator. Following a rinse with PBS, dishes were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed 3 times in PBS for 10 min, and air-dried for ∼15 min inside a chemical hood. Coverslips were then mounted using Vectashield. Myotubes were visualized by epifluorescence with a Nikon Eclipse microscope equipped with rhodamine optics using a 40× lens (N.A. 1.30). Images from 10 fields per dish were captured using Methamorph software. The same software was used to count AChRs and determine the AChR area after manual thresholding of the images. Filters were set to exclude in the quantification AChR clusters ≤4 μm2. The number of clusters per dish was derived after averaging the number of clusters in each of the 10 fields. The average of clusters per treatment for a given experiment resulted from the average of the two duplicate dishes. For Fig. 3, results were expressed as AChR clusters/field. For FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5 results were expressed as percentage of AChR clusters/field relative to positive control (i.e. agrin treatment) after subtracting clusters in dishes that received no treatment.FIGURE 5Complete rescue of PMA-mediated inhibition of agrin-induced AChR clustering in myotubes treated for 5–6 h. PMA (50 nm) co-treatment for 5–6 h produced a ∼50% inhibition in agrin-induced AChR clustering.

To begin investigating whether changes in ERK1/2 activation are involved in normal agrin signaling in muscle cells, C2 myotubes were treated with a saturating concentration of recombinant neural agrin (0.1 nm). Using Western blotting, a robust, rapid activation of ERK1/2 within 10 min was observed after agrin treatment (Fig. 1). Activated ERK1/2 returned to baseline around 1 h after agrin addition (Fig. 1). The transient ERK1/2 activation induced by agrin appeared specific in that agrin treatment failed to change the levels of PI 3-kinase signaling in the same cells as measured by phosphorylated Akt (data not shown). Agrin-induced ERK1/2 activation occurred as rapidly as agrin-induced MuSK activation observed before by others, however, the latter persists for much longer (3Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Recent work demonstrated that the LDL receptor-related protein Lrp4 binds to agrin and forms a complex with MuSK (6Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R.

On its own, Lrp4 binds to neural, but not to aneural, agrin, however, its affinity for agrin is slightly increased by its association with MuSK. Like MuSK−/− mice (11DeChiara T.M. Bowen D.C. Valenzuela D.M. Simmons M.V. Poueymirou W.T. Thomas S. Kinetz E. Compton D.L. Rojas E. Park J.S. Smith C. DiStefano P.S. Glass D.J. Burden S.J. Yancopoulos G.D.

Development. 2006; 133: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, the Lrp4-MuSK complex mediates agrin-induced signal transduction on the muscle surface that is essential for neuromuscular synaptogenesis. In addition to Lrp4/MuSK, agrin and specifically the C-terminal ∼95 kDa recombinant form of neural agrin used here also binds to other proteins on the muscle sarcolemma, such as α-dystroglycan (20Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and β1-containing integrins (21Martin P.T. Sanes J.R. Development. 1997; 124: 3909-3917PubMed Google Scholar), which might mediate agrin-induced ERK1/2 activation. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the agrin-induced ERK1/2 activation is Lrp4/MuSK-dependent. To this aim, agrin-induced ERK1/2 activation was measured in immortalized muscle cell lines derived from the Lrp4−/− (6Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L. Burden S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and MuSK−/− mice (22Herbst R. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and their wild-type control cells. Preliminary experiments determined that 0.5 nm agrin induced consistent, rapid and transient ERK1/2 activation in control immorto+ cells (Fig. 2A, top panels). The response in the immorto+ control cells was less robust than that in C2 cells. Thus, after 5 min normalized levels of activated ERK1 (p44) were 1.37 ± 0.09-fold over control, whereas activated ERK2 (p42) was 1.57 ± 0.12-fold over control (mean ± S.E., n = 6, Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, levels of activated ERK1/2 dropped to about 3–4-fold under control levels by 30 min after agrin addition in control immorto+ cells (Fig. 2, A and B, activated ERK1 = 0.33 ± 0.24-fold and activated ERK2 = 0.24 ± 0.16-fold relative to untreated control). Agrin failed to activate both ERK1 and ERK2 in Lrp4−/− and MuSK−/− cells within 10 min after its addition to the cultures (Fig. 2A). Thus, after 5 min activated ERK1 was 0.81 ± 0.07-fold and activated ERK2 was 0.80 ± 0.06-fold control levels in Lrp4-deficient cells (Fig. 2B, n = 3). In MuSK-deficient cells activated ERK1 was 0.83 ± 0.05-fold and activated ERK2 was 0.69 ± 0.05-fold control levels (Fig. 2B, n = 4). Table 1 presents the statistical analysis at 5 min for each cell line. Means were compared with the untreated control mean (i.e. 1) using a one-sample t test. The increase in both ERK1 and ERK2 activation was statistically significant in the wild-type cells, whereas the decrease in both ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation observed in the mutants at 5 min was statistically significant only for the MuSK-deficient cells. The data at 5 min for the Lrp4-deficient cells was not different from untreated control (Table 1). At 5 min the differences in activated ERK1/2 between wild-type and mutants were statistically significant (Fig. 2B, bracket). However, the drop in phosphorylated ERK1/2 observed at 30 min after agrin addition in control cells was also seen in Lrp4- and MuSK-deficient cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, in immorto+ cells the agrin-induced, transient and rapid activation of ERK1/2 is Lrp4/MuSK-dependent, whereas the ERK1/2 inactivation that is evident later (30 min) is Lrp4/MuSK-independent. The biological significance of the decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation observed at 5 min in the mutant cell lines is unknown.TABLE 1Statistical analysis of 5-min data for experiments with immorto+ cell lines (Fig. 2)ERKCell lineMean ± S.E.np versus controlaOne sample t test was used to compare means at 5 min versus means at 0 min, which were normalized at 1.ERK2 (p42)WT1.57 ± 0.1260.0051Lrp4−/−0.80 ± 0.0630.0794MuSK−/−0.69 ± 0.0540.0085ERK1 (p44)WT1.37 ± 0.0960.0118Lrp4−/−0.81 ± 0.0730.1132MuSK−/−0.83 ± 0.0540.0425a One sample t test was used to compare means at 5 min versus means at 0 min, which were normalized at 1. Open table in a new tab Next, it was tested whether blocking agrin-induced ERK1/2 activation prevented formation of AChR clusters in cultured myotubes. C2 myotubes were pretreated with 10 μm U0126 for 1 h, and then 0.1 nm agrin was applied for another hour, keeping U0126 still present in the dishes. U0126 specifically blocks MEK 1 and 2 (23Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L.

At the end of this treatment, dishes were extensively washed with medium without agrin or U0126, and returned to the incubator for another 7 h. Then, AChRs were labeled live with fluorescent-α-bungarotoxin and clusters were quantified after fixing and washing of the dishes. Fig. 3A shows that as expected the U0126 treatment was effective in lowering levels of activated ERK1/2 in the presence or absence of agrin. Fig. 3, B and C, show that in the presence of the MEK inhibitor agrin caused a 62% increase in the number of AChR clusters over agrin alone (agrin + U0126, 35.2 ± 3.8 clusters/field; agrin, 21.7 ± 4.7 clusters/field; n = 4 for each treatment). Statistical comparison between the agrin + U0126 and agrin treatments using a t test yielded a significant p = 0.008 (Fig. 3). The effect of U0126 pretreatment on agrin-induced AChR clustering was mainly on cluster number, rather than on cluster size, as there was no statistically significant difference in cluster area between the agrin and the agrin + U0126 treatments (Fig. 3D; p = 0.08, n = 4). Previously, Fuhrer and colleagues (24Mittaud P. Camilleri A.A. Willmann R. Erb-Vögtli S. Burden S.J. Fuhrer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7841-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed that a 5-min pulse of 0.5 nm agrin was sufficient to induce AChR clustering at levels similar to those induced with standard protocols that use agrin at lower concentrations (e.g. 0.1 nm) for longer periods of times (e.g. at least 4 h, typically 8 h or overnight). These authors also demonstrated that the washing conditions that they used to remove agrin from the dishes, which were adopted here, clearly rid the cultures of agrin. One experiment using a 5-min pulse of 0.5 nm agrin in the presence or absence of U0126 pretreatment was performed. It was found that agrin + U0126 also induced more AChR clusters than agrin alone using this protocol (average of two dishes per treatment: agrin + U0126, 44.8 clusters/field; agrin, 34.2 clusters/field). Thus, blocking the agrin-induced transient ERK1/2 activation failed to prevent AChR clustering. Instead, it led to an increase in agrin-induced AChR clustering. The above results suggested that although dispensable for AChR clustering ERK1/2 activation does modulate the activity of agrin as blockage of ERK1/2 activation led to potentiation of agrin-induced clustering. One would predict that the converse, strong and persistent stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, would lead to inhibition of agrin-induced AChR clustering. Thus, we sought to determine whether ERK1/2 activation is required by Nrg-1 and PMA, two factors known to both induce ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4A) (15Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Al-Shanti N. Stewart C.E. J. Endocrinol. 2008; 198: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the AChR clustering activity of agrin in myotubes (13Trinidad J.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31622-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Ross A. Rapuano M. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C2 myotubes were treated for 14–15 h with either 0.1 nm agrin or 0.1 nm agrin in the presence of 2 nm Nrg-1β EGF domain (13Trinidad J.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31622-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or 50 nm PMA (17Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In our hands, Nrg-1 co-treatment reduced agrin-induced AChR clustering to 65.54 ± 7.79% (mean ± S.E., n = 6) control levels, or about 35% inhibition (Fig. 4, B, C, and G). PMA treatment was more effective in reducing agrin-induced AChR clustering under our experimental conditions as it yielded 32.91 ± 3.95% control levels, or about 65% inhibition (Fig. 4, B, E, and G). Both agrin + Nrg-1 and agrin + PMA treatments were significantly different from the agrin alone treatment (p = 0.007 and p < 0.0001, respectively). To test whether ERK1/2 activation is required by Nrg-1 or PMA to inhibit agrin-induced AChR clustering, 10 μm U0126 was added to the agrin + Nrg-1 and agrin + PMA treatments. In the presence of U0126, the inhibition of AChR clustering mediated by Nrg-1 was essentially unchanged (55.62 ± 8.08% control levels, n = 4, Fig. 4, D and G; p = 0.41 versus agrin + Nrg-1), whereas PMA-mediated inhibition of agrin-induced AChR clustering was largely, albeit not completely, relieved (72.65 ± 13.43% control levels, Fig. 4, F and G; p = 0.009 versus agrin + PMA). Similar results were obtained if PD0325901, another highly specific MEK inhibitor (26Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar), was used instead of U0126. Thus, in these experiments (n = 2) agrin + Nrg-1 treatment yielded 65.59 ± 0.52% control levels (mean ± S.D."

While behavioral and theoretical work has provided a number of ideas of how navigation is controlled, progress will require direct physiolgical tests of the underlying mechanisms. In turn, this will require development of appropriate animal models. We trained three monkeys to track a moving visual target in a simple virtual environment, using a joystick to control their direction. The monkeys learned to quickly and accurately turn to the target, and their steering behavior was quite stereotyped and reliable. Monkeys typically responded to abrupt steps of target direction with a biphasic steering movement, exhibiting modest but transient overshoot. Response latencies averaged approximately 300 ms, and monkeys were typically back on target after about 1 s. We also exploited the variability of responses about the mean to explore the time-course of correlation between target direction and steering response. This analysis revealed a broad peak of correlation spanning approximately 400 ms in the recent past, during which steering errors provoke a compensatory response. This suggests a continuous, visual-motor loop controls steering behavior, even during the epoch surrounding transient inputs. Many results from the human literature also suggest that steering is controlled by such a closed loop. The similarity of our results to those in humans suggests the monkey is a very good animal model for human visually guided steering."
