https://openalex.org/W2009597200,"The mosquito gut represents an ecosystem that accommodates a complex, intimately associated microbiome. It is increasingly clear that the gut microbiome influences a wide variety of host traits, such as fitness and immunity. Understanding the microbial community structure and its dynamics across mosquito life is a prerequisite for comprehending the symbiotic relationship between the mosquito and its gut microbial residents. Here we characterized gut bacterial communities across larvae, pupae and adults of Anopheles gambiae reared in semi-natural habitats in Kenya by pyrosequencing bacterial 16S rRNA fragments. Immatures and adults showed distinctive gut community structures. Photosynthetic Cyanobacteria were predominant in the larval and pupal guts while Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated the adult guts, with core taxa of Enterobacteriaceae and Flavobacteriaceae. At the adult stage, diet regime (sugar meal and blood meal) significantly affects the microbial structure. Intriguingly, blood meals drastically reduced the community diversity and favored enteric bacteria. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the enriched enteric bacteria possess large genetic redox capacity of coping with oxidative and nitrosative stresses that are associated with the catabolism of blood meal, suggesting a beneficial role in maintaining gut redox homeostasis. Interestingly, gut community structure was similar in the adult stage between the field and laboratory mosquitoes, indicating that mosquito gut is a selective eco-environment for its microbiome. This comprehensive gut metatgenomic profile suggests a concerted symbiotic genetic association between gut inhabitants and host."
https://openalex.org/W2074562663,"The highly prevalent parasite Toxoplasma gondii manipulates its host's behavior. In infected rodents, the behavioral changes increase the likelihood that the parasite will be transmitted back to its definitive cat host, an essential step in completion of the parasite's life cycle. The mechanism(s) responsible for behavioral changes in the host is unknown but two lines of published evidence suggest that the parasite alters neurotransmitter signal transduction: the disruption of the parasite-induced behavioral changes with medications used to treat psychiatric disease (specifically dopamine antagonists) and identification of a tyrosine hydroxylase encoded in the parasite genome. In this study, infection of mammalian dopaminergic cells with T. gondii enhanced the levels of K+-induced release of dopamine several-fold, with a direct correlation between the number of infected cells and the quantity of dopamine released. Immunostaining brain sections of infected mice with dopamine antibody showed intense staining of encysted parasites. Based on these analyses, T. gondii orchestrates a significant increase in dopamine metabolism in neural cells. Tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, was also found in intracellular tissue cysts in brain tissue with antibodies specific for the parasite-encoded tyrosine hydroxylase. These observations provide a mechanism for parasite-induced behavioral changes. The observed effects on dopamine metabolism could also be relevant in interpreting reports of psychobehavioral changes in toxoplasmosis-infected humans."
https://openalex.org/W2064664612,"G protein-coupled receptors represent the largest family of membrane receptors that instigate signalling through nucleotide exchange on heterotrimeric G proteins. Nucleotide exchange, or more precisely, GDP dissociation from the G protein α-subunit, is the key step towards G protein activation and initiation of downstream signalling cascades. Despite a wealth of biochemical and biophysical studies on inactive and active conformations of several heterotrimeric G proteins, the molecular underpinnings of G protein activation remain elusive. To characterize this mechanism, we applied peptide amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe changes in the structure of the heterotrimeric bovine G protein, Gs (the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase) on formation of a complex with agonist-bound human β(2) adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR). Here we report structural links between the receptor-binding surface and the nucleotide-binding pocket of Gs that undergo higher levels of hydrogen-deuterium exchange than would be predicted from the crystal structure of the β(2)AR-Gs complex. Together with X-ray crystallographic and electron microscopic data of the β(2)AR-Gs complex (from refs 2, 3), we provide a rationale for a mechanism of nucleotide exchange, whereby the receptor perturbs the structure of the amino-terminal region of the α-subunit of Gs and consequently alters the 'P-loop' that binds the β-phosphate in GDP. As with the Ras family of small-molecular-weight G proteins, P-loop stabilization and β-phosphate coordination are key determinants of GDP (and GTP) binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1964594273,"Objectives A number of cross-sectional and prospective studies have now been published demonstrating inverse relationships between diet quality and the common mental disorders in adults. However, there are no existing prospective studies of this association in adolescents, the onset period of most disorders, limiting inferences regarding possible causal relationships. Methods In this study, 3040 Australian adolescents, aged 11–18 years at baseline, were measured in 2005–6 and 2007–8. Information on diet and mental health was collected by self-report and anthropometric data by trained researchers. Results There were cross-sectional, dose response relationships identified between measures of both healthy (positive) and unhealthy (inverse) diets and scores on the emotional subscale of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), where higher scores mean better mental health, before and after adjustments for age, gender, socio-economic status, dieting behaviours, body mass index and physical activity. Higher healthy diet scores at baseline also predicted higher PedsQL scores at follow-up, while higher unhealthy diet scores at baseline predicted lower PedsQL scores at follow-up. Improvements in diet quality were mirrored by improvements in mental health over the follow-up period, while deteriorating diet quality was associated with poorer psychological functioning. Finally, results did not support the reverse causality hypothesis. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of diet in adolescence and its potential role in modifying mental health over the life course. Given that the majority of common mental health problems first manifest in adolescence, intervention studies are now required to test the effectiveness of preventing the common mental disorders through dietary modification."
https://openalex.org/W2155134481,"Quantifying global-scale carbon assimilation by plants, or gross primary production (GPP), has been difficult because there are no direct measures at scales greater than the leaf level. An analysis of nearly 30 years of unpublished records of the oxygen isotope (18O/16O) composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide from sampling sites worldwide has provided a means of estimating the GPP that is not reliant on modelling. The data reveal previously unrecognized interannual fluctuations that are driven by El Niño climate events. The effect propagates from the tropics to higher latitudes through the tropical hydrological cycle. Recovery from El Niño events is rapid, implying a shorter turnover time for CO2 than is generally assumed, and suggests a best-guess figure for global GPP of 150–175 petagrams of carbon per year, rather than the current estimate of 120 petagrams. The stable isotope ratios of atmospheric CO2 (18O/16O and 13C/12C) have been monitored since 1977 to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle, because biosphere–atmosphere exchange fluxes affect the different atomic masses in a measurable way1. Interpreting the 18O/16O variability has proved difficult, however, because oxygen isotopes in CO2 are influenced by both the carbon cycle and the water cycle2. Previous attention focused on the decreasing 18O/16O ratio in the 1990s, observed by the global Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory. This decrease was attributed variously to a number of processes including an increase in Northern Hemisphere soil respiration3; a global increase in C4 crops at the expense of C3 forests4; and environmental conditions, such as atmospheric turbulence5 and solar radiation6, that affect CO2 exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Here we present 30 years’ worth of data on 18O/16O in CO2 from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography global flask network and show that the interannual variability is strongly related to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. We suggest that the redistribution of moisture and rainfall in the tropics during an El Niño increases the 18O/16O ratio of precipitation and plant water, and that this signal is then passed on to atmospheric CO2 by biosphere–atmosphere gas exchange. We show how the decay time of the El Niño anomaly in this data set can be useful in constraining global gross primary production. Our analysis shows a rapid recovery from El Niño events, implying a shorter cycling time of CO2 with respect to the terrestrial biosphere and oceans than previously estimated. Our analysis suggests that current estimates of global gross primary production, of 120 petagrams of carbon per year7, may be too low, and that a best guess of 150–175 petagrams of carbon per year better reflects the observed rapid cycling of CO2. Although still tentative, such a revision would present a new benchmark by which to evaluate global biospheric carbon cycling models."
https://openalex.org/W2090120321,"Background In standard reference sources, the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) ranged between 24 and 46.5%. Since then, the incidence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRF) has increased and modern treatment strategies (“pill in the pocket”) are only applicable to patients without structural heart disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and severity of CAD in patients with AF. Methods From January 2005 until December 2009, we included 261 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF in this prospective study. All patients underwent coronary angiography and the Framingham risk score (FRS) was calculated. Patients with previously diagnosed or previously excluded CAD were excluded. Results The overall incidence of CAD in patients presenting with AF was 34%; in patients >70 years, the incidence of CAD was 41%. The incidence of patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) was 21%. Patients with CAD were older (73±8 years vs 68±10 years, p = 0.001), had significantly more frequent hypercholesterolemia (60% vs 30%, p<0.001), were more frequent smokers (26% vs 13%, p = 0.017) and suffered from angina more often (37% vs 2%, p<0.001). There was a significant linear trend among the FRS categories in percentage and the prevalence of CAD and PCI/CABG (p<0.0001). Conclusions The overall incidence of CAD in patients presenting with AF was relatively high at 34%; the incidence of PCI/CABG was 21%. Based upon increasing CRF in the western world, we recommend a careful investigation respecting the FRS to either definitely exclude or establish an early diagnosis of CAD – which could contribute to an early and safe therapeutic strategy considering type Ic antiarrhythmics and oral anticoagulation."
https://openalex.org/W2151980086,"Background Accumulating evidence shows that the planet is warming as a response to human emissions of greenhouse gases. Strategies of adaptation to climate change will require quantitative projections of how altered regional patterns of temperature, precipitation and sea level could cascade to provoke local impacts such as modified water supplies, increasing risks of coastal flooding, and growing challenges to sustainability of native species. Methodology/Principal Findings We linked a series of models to investigate responses of California's San Francisco Estuary-Watershed (SFEW) system to two contrasting scenarios of climate change. Model outputs for scenarios of fast and moderate warming are presented as 2010–2099 projections of nine indicators of changing climate, hydrology and habitat quality. Trends of these indicators measure rates of: increasing air and water temperatures, salinity and sea level; decreasing precipitation, runoff, snowmelt contribution to runoff, and suspended sediment concentrations; and increasing frequency of extreme environmental conditions such as water temperatures and sea level beyond the ranges of historical observations. Conclusions/Significance Most of these environmental indicators change substantially over the 21st century, and many would present challenges to natural and managed systems. Adaptations to these changes will require flexible planning to cope with growing risks to humans and the challenges of meeting demands for fresh water and sustaining native biota. Programs of ecosystem rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation in coastal landscapes will be most likely to meet their objectives if they are designed from considerations that include: (1) an integrated perspective that river-estuary systems are influenced by effects of climate change operating on both watersheds and oceans; (2) varying sensitivity among environmental indicators to the uncertainty of future climates; (3) inevitability of biological community changes as responses to cumulative effects of climate change and other drivers of habitat transformations; and (4) anticipation and adaptation to the growing probability of ecosystem regime shifts."
https://openalex.org/W2002209067,"Dyadic and collective activities requiring temporally coordinated action are likely to be associated with cardiac and respiratory patterns that synchronize within and between people. However, the extent and functional significance of cardiac and respiratory between-person couplings have not been investigated thus far. Here, we report interpersonal oscillatory couplings among eleven singers and one conductor engaged in choir singing. We find that: (a) phase synchronization both in respiration and heart rate variability increase significantly during singing relative to a rest condition; (b) phase synchronization is higher when singing in unison than when singing pieces with multiple voice parts; (c) directed coupling measures are consistent with the presence of causal effects of the conductor on the singers at high modulation frequencies; (d) the different voices of the choir are reflected in network analyses of cardiac and respiratory activity based on graph theory. Our results suggest that oscillatory coupling of cardiac and respiratory patterns provide a physiological basis for interpersonal action coordination."

The ability to selectively and potently down-regulate MYC would have considerable potential for both efficacy and safety in a variety of tumor types.

In the present study we identified the ellipticine derivative GQC-05 (NSC338258) as a potent and selective stabilizer of the MYC G4 structure. We demonstrate that the activity of this compound is dependent on the presence and regulation of a G4 within the MYC promoter region and that it specifically modulates protein binding to the NHE III1. We go on to describe a new intracellular test, the “CA46 test” that is of enormous benefit to the study of the MYC NHE III1 and, in particular, for demonstrating specific MYC G4 drug targeting within this region. Finally, we discuss our results in relation to cellular targeting of MYC, which, from a therapeutic standpoint, has important implications. Compounds identified for testing from a pharmacophore query were screened for thermal stabilization using FRET with dual-labeled FAM-TAMRA Pu47, as previously described (36De Cian A. Guittat L.

Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a Biacore T100 biosensor with immobilized, biotinylated MYC Pu41 on a streptavidin CM5 sensor chip. Cells were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator, in exponential growth, for the duration of experimentation in RMPI-1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. Cytotoxicity of GQC-05 in RAJI and CA46 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was determined using the MTS assay with compound diluted over a 5–6 log range in 0.5 log steps; IC50s were determined with GraphPad Prism software using non-linear regression modeling. Caspase-3 activation was determined using the ApoAlert Caspase-3 Apoptosis kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). RAJI and CA46 were seeded at of 1 × 106 cells/ml in at least 4 ml overnight before incubation with compounds at described doses for the ascribed times. Cells were collected, washed with PBS, and RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using the Qiacube automated system. Up to 500 ng of cDNA was reverse transcribed with the Quantitect cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen) prior to quantitative real-time PCR detection on the Bio-Rad MyIQ thermocycler. FAM-labeled TaqMan primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA) for GAPDH and MYC (exon 1: 01562521_m1; exon 2: 00153408_m1); the ΔΔCt method was used to calculate changes in expression, normalized to the appropriate time-matched DMSO vehicle-treated control cells. From CA46 cells treated for 6 or 24 h, protein was isolated for Western blotting by collecting and washing the cells, lysing in a RIPA with 1× protease inhibitor (Roche,), sonication for 15 s and passage through a Qiashredder (Qiagen). Protein concentration was determined with a standard BCA assay, and 10–30 μg of protein was loaded on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels for size separation, transferred to a PVDF membrane and standard Western blotting procedures were followed. ChIP analyses were carried out using a modified EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) from 5 × 106 cells/IP/treatment. At each time point queried, cells were collected, crosslinked, and sonicated for 45 cycles of 30 s on/30 s off at a maintained temperature of 4 °C until DNA was 300–500 bp (supplemental Fig. S1). ChIP-quality antibodies for each protein of interest were purchased from AbCam (Cambridge, MA) or Millipore; DNA was purified using the QiaQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) before 2× dilution and quantitation with qRT-PCR, as described above.

The compounds NSC176327 and NSC86374 (Fig. 1A) were identified in a high-throughput FRET screen for interaction with, and stabilization of, the MYC G4. They demonstrated ΔTm values of 21 and 17 °C at 1 equivalence, respectively, as measured by circular dichroism (CD). Energy-minimized conformations of the compounds were superimposed to generate a pharmacophore query (Fig. 1B) from which ten additional compounds were identified for further study (Table 1). These were screened using the FRET melt assay at concentrations spanning a 2-log range (0.1–10 μm). ΔTm values ranged from 0 to 21 °C, with GQC-05 (Fig. 1C) demonstrating the highest and most robust thermal stabilization of the MYC G4. Consequently, this compound was chosen for further examination.TABLE 1ΔTm (°C), as determined by FRET melt, of ten putative G-quadruplex-interactive compoundsNSC numberCompound classaCompound1010.1μmμmμm311150EGQC-011910651556EGQC-02011649091EGQC-0370179486EGQC-04010338258EGQC-052151100594EGQC-0621124037NEGQC-0711165238NEGQC-08000118176NEGQC-09171086372NEGQC-101231a E, ellipticine derivative; NE, non-ellipticine derivative.

To validate the structure stabilized by GQC-05 within the MYC sequence as a G4, CD spectra were recorded in the absence and presence of increasing equivalence of GQC-05 (Fig. 2A). A concentration-dependent stabilization of the positive parallel peak (262 nm) was observed up to 2 equivalents, above which a plateau of molecular ellipticity was noted (Fig. 2A, inset). Thus the ligand:DNA stoichiometry was determined to be 2:1, and thermal stabilization was measured only up to 2 equivalents. GQC-05 stabilized the MYC G4 structure by 3.5 and 7.4 °C at 1 and 2 equivalents, respectively. Affinity for other promoter G4 sequences, chosen to represent a variety of G4 structures including parallel, mixed, equilibrating, and tandem/more complex varieties (40Brooks T.A. Kendrick S. Hurley L. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and double-stranded (ds) DNA complexes was measured using the competition dialysis assay (Fig. 2B). Concentrations bound per putative binding site ranged from 0.5 to 4.38 μm for all G4 sequences and from 0 to 0.75 μm for all dsDNA. GQC-05 demonstrated the greatest concentration bound to the MYC G4, for which, against its own promoter sequence dsDNA, a 45-fold preference was observed. SPR was utilized to determine the equilibrium binding constants for GQC-05; GQC-Qi was used as a reference compound. Binding curves for both compounds were fitted to a two-binding-site model, with χ2 values of 0.25 and 2.5, respectively (Fig. 3). GQC-05 exhibits tighter binding with MYC G4 as compared with GQC-Qi with 10-fold lower equilibrium constants (KD). First site binding constant (KD1) values were determined to be 0.1 ± 0.01 μm and 1.14 ± 0.25 μm for GQC-05 and GQC-Qi, respectively. For both GQC-05 and GQC-Qi, the second binding sites show ∼10-fold lower affinity than the first site, with KD2 values = 1.43 ± 0.07 μm and 17.8 ± 2.9, respectively. There is a notable difference in dissociation of GQC-05, as compared with GQC-Qi, in that GQC-05 demonstrates slower dissociation. Overall, there was an observed negative cooperativity between the first and second binding sites for both compounds, with calculated CF values <1 for each compound. A translocation between an immunoglobin chain, in this case the IgH heavy chain that resides on chromosome 14, and the MYC promoter on chromosome 8 defines Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and results in aberrant control and up-regulation of MYC expression. For the intracellular characterization of GQC-05, a pair of BL cell lines was used where the translocation leads to the loss of the G4 region in the CA46 cell line, but not in RAJI cell line (Fig. 4A). If GQC-05 were mediating any intracellular effects through stabilization of this structure and modulation of MYC expression, it is expected that the CA46 cells will be considerably less sensitive than the RAJI cells, and indeed that is the case. At 24 h the IC50 values of GQC-05 revealed the RAJI cells to be more than 5-fold more sensitive than the CA46 cells (2.6 ± 0.9 versus 13 ± 4 μm, respectively). For all further experiments, these 24 h IC50 concentrations were used to relate any intracellular effects to the inhibitory concentrations. We further examined stimulation of apoptosis with a caspase-3 activation assay; 50 μm doxorubicin served as a positive control. For both RAJI and CA46 cells, doxorubicin and GQC-05 (at the respective 24 h IC50 dose) each caused a significant and time-dependent increase in caspase-3 activation (Fig. 4B). There was approximately twice the activation of the apoptosis cascade in the RAJI, versus the CA46, cells with GQC-05, despite the concentration used being 5-fold less. In comparison, 50 μm doxorubicin demonstrated more similar activity in both cell lines. Finally, GQC-05 was examined at both 10 and 30 μm, in both cell lines in order to determine the equimolar caspase-3 activation at 24 h. At 10 μm, the trend seen at the IC50 doses remained, RAJI cells were ∼2-fold more sensitive than CA46 cells (data not shown). At 30 μm, however, the percent activation of caspase-3 was not significantly different between the cell lines at 782 ± 228 and 624 ± 42% for RAJI and CA46 cells, respectively. Compound GQC-05 was identified ex vivo as interactive with the MYC promoter G4 and demonstrated low micromolar cytotoxicity in BL cell lines in vitro. To tie these two results together, both RAJI and CA46 cells were treated with their respective 24 h IC50 concentrations of GQC-05, and changes in MYC mRNA expression were examined over time (Fig. 4C). In the CA46 cell line, where the activating translocation removes the G4 from the promoter, there is no significant decrease in expression. In comparison, within 6 h there is a robust and significant decrease in MYC expression in the RAJI cells, maintained through 48 h. To localize the action of GQC-05 to the G4-forming region of the MYC promoter in RAJI cells, a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay for various transcription factors (the dsDNA binding transcription factor Sp1, the ssDNA binding transcription factors CNBP (G-rich strand) and hnRNP k (C-rich strand)) and regulatory proteins (the G4 resolving protein NM23-H2, and the stabilizing protein nucleolin) was performed over time (Fig. 4D). Since a significant decrease in mRNA was noted within 6 h of treatment with GQC-05 and continued through 48 h, and to observe changes in protein binding to the MYC promoter region that correspond with transcriptional regulation, the ChIP assay was performed 6 and 12 h post GQC-05. There was no significant change in RNA Pol II binding to the NHE III1 region of the MYC promoter over time, as compared with the vehicle control-treated cells. In contrast, within 6 h of treatment with GQC-05, hnRNP k was significantly decreased, and CNBP was significantly increased. By 12 h post-GQC-05, the binding of all transcription factors and G4 regulatory proteins was significantly decreased (Fig. 4D). To further characterize the mechanism of action of GQC-05, as it relates to the MYC G4, CA46 cells were re-examined for an “exon-specific” effect due to the translocation event. The BL reciprocal translocation t(8;14) maintains G4-mediated control of MYC on both chromosomes in RAJI, but only on the non-translocated (NT) chromosome in CA46. Using primers specific to exons 1 and 2, the NT and T mRNA products, respectively, of the CA46 cell line can be examined independently (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, GQC-05 significantly decreased MYC mRNA expression from the NT (exon 1), but not the T (exon 2), allele in the CA46 cells. As a comparison, in the RAJI cells, where both exons remain under G4 control irrespective of translocation status, there are no exon-specific effects noted (Fig. 5B). The previously published quindoline derivative i compound (GQC-Qi) was also evaluated in this CA46 test at 10 μm for 24 h (39Ou T.M. Lu Y.J. Zhang C. Huang Z.S. Wang X.D. Tan J.H. Chen Y. Ma D.L. Wong K.Y. Tang J.C. Chan A.S. Gu L.Q. J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 1465-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), as was 50 μm TMPyP4 and 50 μm doxorubicin. With GQC-Qi, both exon products were significantly decreased from vehicle control (p < 0.0001) to 15 ± 3 and 12 ± 4% for the NT and T alleles, respectively, with no apparent exon specificity. TMPyP4 hinted at an early exon-specific effect (64 versus 87% for NT and T alleles, respectively, at 6 h), but through 24 h there was no change in MYC expression with either allele. Doxorubicin has been noted to also decrease MYC expression, but is not ascribed to G4 stabilization; in agreement, there was no significant difference in expression from T and NT alleles 24 h post-treatment with 18 ± 10 and 40 ± 20%, respectively. In the CA46 cells, a ChIP assay for RNA Pol II, Sp1, CNBP, hnRNP k, NM23-H2, and nucleolin was again performed over time (Fig. 5C). Expression of the NT allele was determined first over a time course post-GQC-05, which demonstrated a significant decrease in mRNA to 33 ± 2% of vehicle control (p < 0.0001) within 6 h, mirroring the time-dependent effects noted in the RAJI cells. Thus, the ChIP assay was again performed 6 and 12 h post-GQC-05. A similar pattern of altered protein binding was observed to that seen in the RAJI cells such that no significant change in RNA Pol II binding to the NHE III1 region was found in the CA46 cells promoter over time. Within 6 h of treatment with GQC-05, only hnRNP k was significantly decreased, which remained bound less to the NHE III1 region through 12 h. By this later time point, binding of Sp1, CNBP, NM23-H2, and nucleolin was significantly decreased (Fig. 5C). As a negative control, amplification of the 3′-UTR region of the MYC gene was tried for all IPs in both cell lines; no amplification occurred. To determine specificity for the MYC promoter, the regulation of other ‘target mRNAs' was monitored over time in CA46 cells, including genes with demonstrated G4s in their promoters (Bcl-2, HIF1 α, and hTERT) and with no G4 regulatory element (BAX). CA46 cells were chosen to minimize the effect of MYC regulation itself, since there is no global change in MYC expression in these cells (Fig. 4C). Of those with G4s in their promoters, particular genes were chosen based on the competition dialysis assay in order to represent those with moderately high (Bcl-2), moderate (HIF1 α), and low (hTERT) binding of GQC-05, as well as a variation of G4 shapes including mixed, parallel, and tandem. There was no change in mRNA expression, as compared with DMSO control, 6 h post-treatment, versus G4-regulated MYC expression was significantly lowered at this time. There were significant increases in expression noted for both HIF1α (1.4-fold, p < 0.01) and hTERT (1.76-fold, p < 0.05), but not in the G4-containing Bcl-2 or the G4-lacking BAX, at 24 h (supplemental Fig. S2). Finally, to be assured that changes noted in ChIP experiments were not attributed to altered protein levels, changes in expression of Sp1, CNBP, hnRNP k, Nucleolin, and NM23-H2 were evaluated by Western blot at 6 and 24 h post GQC-05 treatment in CA46 cells (Fig. 5D). The only hint of a modulation in protein expression is a slight, but apparent, decrease in NM23-H2 expression 6 h post-GQC-05, which is normalized by 24 h. By ChIP, there is no change in NM23-H2 binding to the NHE III1 region at 6 h. Thus, in both BL cell lines, within a time frame corresponding to altered mRNA expression, significant changes in protein binding, but not expression, to the NHE III1 region of the MYC promoter confirm the location of action of GQC-05 to be within this area and further support the compound's mechanism of action to be stabilization of the G4 structure. Moreover, there is a demonstrated preferential binding and decreased expression of the MYC gene, over any others examined with G4-regulatory agents. MYC was recently described as the conductor of a symphony of intracellular events with direct or indirect roles in transcription, miRNA regulation, ribosome biogenesis, glycolysis, metabolism, angiogenesis, repression of transcription, pluripotency, and more (41Dang C.V. Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). With MYC's role in so many hallmarks of cancer, and growth related events, it is easy to understand why its deregulation is found so frequently as either a causative oncogenic event, or distinctly tied to prognosis and therapy. It is also something to which cancer cells often seem addicted, providing a window of opportunity for new anticancer therapies (15Brooks T.A. Hurley L.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Specific targeting of protein function has yet to be a successful avenue of drug development. Because the primary method of deregulation is transcriptional overexpression, via various mechanisms (42Wierstra I. Alves J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2008; 99: 113-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), targeting transcriptional control is likely to be the most efficacious, with potentially the best selectivity over normal cells due to the increased transcriptional firing in cancer cells. There are many protein regulators of MYC transcription, too many to target collectively, thus the best emerging target is the nascent promoter DNA and its alternate topologies. The near upstream region of the MYC gene contains four promoter start sites: P0-P3. The vast majority of MYC transcripts initiate at the major two of these promoters, P1 and P2, which control over 90% of transcription. Just upstream of these two promoters lies the NHE III1, to which several transcriptional factors bind. This region of DNA also has a propensity to undergo strand separation to form non-B-DNA topologies, through the intermediary of ssDNA, all forms of which play a critical role in transcriptional control of MYC (29Brooks T.A. Hurley L.H. Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 641-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dynamic interplay between the DNA isomers and regulatory proteins is described in Refs. 15Brooks T.A. Hurley L.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 29Brooks T.A. Hurley L.H. Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 641-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar (Fig. 6). An early study examined the stabilization of the MYC G4 with the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4, which decreased luciferase expression in a wild-type vector. Using the RAMOS and CA46 pair of BL cell lines, we showed that TMPyP4 lowers MYC expression in RAMOS, which maintains the G4, but not in CA46 cells, which have lost the G4-mediated transcription control of MYC in the translocated allele (43Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11593-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). TMPyP4 is a pan-G4-stabilizing cationic porphyrin with generally non-drug-like properties, although it does concentrate in the nucleus (44Izbicka E. Wheelhouse R.T. Raymond E. Davidson K.K.

https://openalex.org/W2171862242,"Invasive freshwater fish represent a major threat to biodiversity. Here, we first demonstrate the dramatic, human-mediated range expansion of the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), an invasive fish with a reputation for negatively impacting native freshwater communities. Next, we explore possible mechanisms that might explain successful global establishment of this species. Guppies, along with some other notable invasive fish species such as mosquitofish (Gambusia spp.), have reproductive adaptations to ephemeral habitats that may enable introductions of very small numbers of founders to succeed. The remarkable ability of single pregnant guppies to routinely establish viable populations is demonstrated using a replicated mesocosm set up. In 86% of cases, these populations persisted for two years (the duration of the experiment). Establishment success was independent of founder origin (high and low predation habitats), and there was no loss of behavioural performance amongst mesocosm juveniles. Behavioural “signatures” of the founding locality were, however, evident in mesocosm fish. Our results demonstrate that introductions consisting of a single individual can lead to thriving populations of this invasive fish and suggest that particular caution should be exercised when introducing this species, or other livebearers, to natural water bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2027305039,"Bacterial cells have evolved the capacity to communicate between each other via small diffusible chemical signals termed autoinducers. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen involved, among others, in cystic fibrosis complications. Virulence of P. aeruginosa relies on its ability to produce a number of autoinducers, including 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQ). In a cell density-dependent manner, accumulated signals induce the expression of multiple targets, especially virulence factors. This phenomenon, called quorum sensing, promotes bacterial capacity to cause disease. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa possesses many multidrug efflux pumps conferring adaptive resistance to antibiotics. Activity of some of these efflux pumps also influences quorum sensing. The present study demonstrates that the MexEF-OprN efflux pump modulates quorum sensing through secretion of a signalling molecule belonging to the HAQ family. Moreover, activation of MexEF-OprN reduces virulence factor expression and swarming motility. Since MexEF-OprN can be activated in infected hosts even in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure, it could promote establishment of chronic infections in the lungs of people suffering from cystic fibrosis, thus diminishing the immune response to virulence factors. Therapeutic drugs that affect multidrug efflux pumps and HAQ-mediated quorum sensing would be valuable tools to shut down bacterial virulence."

https://openalex.org/W1984457607,"Background Gluten proteins, prominent constituents of barley, wheat and rye, cause celiac disease in genetically predisposed subjects. Gluten is notoriously difficult to digest by mammalian proteolytic enzymes and the protease-resistant domains contain multiple immunogenic epitopes. The aim of this study was to identify novel sources of gluten-digesting microbial enzymes from the upper gastro-intestinal tract with the potential to neutralize gluten epitopes. Methodology/Principal Findings Oral microorganisms with gluten-degrading capacity were obtained by a selective plating strategy using gluten agar. Microbial speciations were carried out by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Enzyme activities were assessed using gliadin-derived enzymatic substrates, gliadins in solution, gliadin zymography, and 33-mer α-gliadin and 26-mer γ-gliadin immunogenic peptides. Fragments of the gliadin peptides were separated by RP-HPLC and structurally characterized by mass spectrometry. Strains with high activity towards gluten were typed as Rothia mucilaginosa and Rothia aeria. Gliadins (250 µg/ml) added to Rothia cell suspensions (OD620 1.2) were degraded by 50% after ∼30 min of incubation. Importantly, the 33-mer and 26-mer immunogenic peptides were also cleaved, primarily C-terminal to Xaa-Pro-Gln (XPQ) and Xaa-Pro-Tyr (XPY). The major gliadin-degrading enzymes produced by the Rothia strains were ∼70–75 kDa in size, and the enzyme expressed by Rothia aeria was active over a wide pH range (pH 3–10). Conclusion/Significance While the human digestive enzyme system lacks the capacity to cleave immunogenic gluten, such activities are naturally present in the oral microbial enzyme repertoire. The identified bacteria may be exploited for physiologic degradation of harmful gluten peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2161478449,"Measurements of human brain function in children are of increasing interest in cognitive neuroscience. Many techniques for brain mapping used in children, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), use probes placed on or near the scalp. The distance between the scalp and the brain is a key variable for these techniques because optical, electrical and magnetic signals are attenuated by distance. However, little is known about how scalp-brain distance differs between different cortical regions in children or how it changes with development. We investigated scalp-brain distance in 71 children, from newborn to age 12 years, using structural T1-weighted MRI scans of the whole head. Three-dimensional reconstructions were created from the scalp surface to allow for accurate calculation of brain-scalp distance. Nine brain landmarks in different cortical regions were manually selected in each subject based on the published fNIRS literature. Significant effects were found for age, cortical region and hemisphere. Brain-scalp distances were lowest in young children, and increased with age to up to double the newborn distance. There were also dramatic differences between brain regions, with up to 50% differences between landmarks. In frontal and temporal regions, scalp-brain distances were significantly greater in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere. The largest contributors to developmental changes in brain-scalp distance were increases in the corticospinal fluid (CSF) and inner table of the cranium. These results have important implications for functional imaging studies of children: age and brain-region related differences in fNIRS signals could be due to the confounding factor of brain-scalp distance and not true differences in brain activity."
https://openalex.org/W1970990473,"Mechanical signals can inactivate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), resulting in stabilization of β-catenin. This signaling cascade is necessary for the inhibition of adipogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that is produced by a daily strain regimen. We investigated whether Akt is the mechanically activated kinase responsible for phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β in MSC. Mechanical strain (2% magnitude, 0.17 Hz) induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in parallel with phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9. Inhibiting Akt (Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor treatment or Akt knockdown) prevented strain-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9. Inhibition of PI3K prevented Thr-308 phosphorylation, but strain-induced Ser-473 phosphorylation was measurable and induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, suggesting that Ser-473 phosphorylation is sufficient for the downstream mechanoresponse. As Rictor/mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2) is known to transduce phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 by insulin, we investigated whether it contributes to strain-induced Ser-473 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser-473 by both mechanical and insulin treatment in MSC was prevented by the mTOR inhibitor KU0063794. When mTORC2 was blocked, mechanical GSK3β inactivation was prevented, whereas insulin inhibition of GSK3β was still measured in the absence of Ser-473 phosphorylation, presumably through phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308. In sum, mechanical input initiates a signaling cascade that is uniquely dependent on mTORC2 activation and phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473, an effect sufficient to cause inactivation of GSK3β. Thus, mechanical regulation of GSK3β downstream of Akt is dependent on phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in a manner distinct from that of growth factors.

The Akt protein contains three domains, an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain that contains a hydrophobic motif (13Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Full activation of Akt is a multistep process that requires recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin homology domain coupled with phosphorylation of two keys sites, Thr-308 in the kinase domain and Ser-473 in the hydrophobic motif (14Liao Y. Hung M.C. Am. J. Transl. Res. 2010; 2: 19-42PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane recruitment of Akt is dependent on the PI3K second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) localized at the membrane in response to PIP3 synthesis then phosphorylates Akt at Thr-308. The kinase responsible for Ser-473 phosphorylation appears to be cell- and process-specific. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) can modulate Akt activation (15Troussard A.A. Mawji N.M. Ong C. Mui A.

Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a005066Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), suggests that it could be regulated by mechanical stimuli. PKC, which can be activated by mechanical signals (18Bullard T.A. Hastings J.L. Davis J.M. Borg T.K. Price R.L. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2007; 85: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Carvalho R.S. Scott J.E. Suga D.M. Yen E.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 999-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), has been implicated in the regulation of Akt activity by growth factors (20Sampson S.R. Cooper D.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2006; 89: 32-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2) was shown to have a unique role in Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation (21Gan X. Wang J. Su B. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10998-11002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), an effect that appears to be consequent to PI3K activation, causing Akt relocation to the plasma membrane (22Foster K.G. Fingar D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14071-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In this work, we used undifferentiated marrow-derived MSC (mdMSC) to demonstrate that mechanical inhibition of GSK3β is dependent on activation of Akt through Ser-473 phosphorylation. Mechanical strain-dependent phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 required both PKC and mTORC2 but was independent of signaling through either PI3K or ILK. Furthermore, the dependence of GSK3β inhibition on Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation downstream of mTORC2 was found to be specific to the mechanical effect, as insulin could inactivate GSK3β despite disruption of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. These differences indicate that mechanical inhibition of GSK3β downstream of Akt activation is distinct from inhibition by insulin and suggest how unique cellular responses can be regulated through a common kinase. FBS was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). Culture medium, glutamine, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. LY294002, Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor (Akti-1/2), and rapamycin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. KU0063794 was obtained from Selleck Chemicals LLC (Houston, TX). Calphostin C was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO), and Gö6976 was from Calbiochem. The siRNA transfection reagent PepMute Plus was purchased from SignaGen Laboratories (Ijamsville, MD). mdMSC were generated from C57BL/6 wild-type mice using the procedure of Peister et al. (23Peister A. Mellad J.A. Larson B.L. Hall B.M. Gibson L.F. Prockop D.J. Blood. 2004; 103: 1662-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). mdMSC were then plated at 3000 cells/cm2 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% FBS and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin for expansion from passages 5 to 15. For experiments, mdMSC were seeded at 5000–10,000 cells/cm2 in growth medium (α-minimal essential medium, 10% FBS, and antibiotics). The following pharmacologic agents were used: the Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2 (40 μm), the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm), the PKC inhibitors calphostin C (1 μm) and Gö6976 (0.1–2.5 μm), and the mTOR inhibitors KU0063794 (2 μm) and rapamycin (30 nm). Akti-1/2, also known as Akt inhibitor VIII, is a pleckstrin homology domain-dependent inhibitor that is selective for Akt isoforms 1 and 2. Each agent or its appropriate vehicle was added to cultures 1 h prior to strain initiation or insulin addition and remained in the culture medium throughout the experiment. For experiments using calphostin C, cells were exposed to 1 h of light following addition of this agent. For experiments using LY294002, KU006379, or rapamycin, growth medium was replaced with serum-free medium for 4 h prior to addition of the agent. siRNAs targeting murine ILK and Akt were purchased from Invitrogen. mdMSC were transfected with specific siRNA or a control siRNA (scrambled siRNA) at a concentration of 20 nm using the PepMute Plus reagent in growth medium for 6–18 h, followed by replacement with fresh growth medium. Experiments were initiated 72 h after transfection. mdMSC were plated on 6-well Bioflex collagen I-coated plates (Flexcell International Corp., Hillsborough, NC). Uniform biaxial strain was applied (2% magnitude, 0.17 Hz) using the Flexcell FX-4000 system. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (4Sen B. Xie Z. Case N. Ma M. Rubin C. Rubin J. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Case N. Ma M. Sen B. Xie Z. Gross T.S. Rubin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29196-29205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and protein (5–20 μg) was separated on a polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to PVDF membrane. The following antibodies were used: GSK3β (Chemicon, Billerica, MA) and phospho-GSK3β Ser-9, phospho-Akt Ser-473, phospho-Akt Thr-308, Akt, and ILK1 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was detected by chemiluminescence. Images were acquired with a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet, and densitometry was determined using NIH ImageJ 1.37v. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Significance was determined by Student's t test or two-way analysis of variance where appropriate (GraphPad Prism). All experiments were replicated at least once. Densitometry data were compiled from three separate experiments. Mechanical regulation of Akt and GSK3β was evaluated in undifferentiated mdMSC. Phosphorylation of Akt at two key sites, Thr-308 and Ser-473, consistent with enhanced activation, was measured 30 min after beginning strain (Fig. 1A). Akt phosphorylation returned to basal levels by 2 h despite continued mechanical input. Phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9, which causes its inactivation and was shown to be a necessary step for mechanical activation of β-catenin (10Sen B. Styner M. Xie Z. Case N. Rubin C.T. Rubin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34607-34617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), increased during strain application in parallel with changes in phosphorylated Akt. To confirm the strain-induced changes in Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, densitometry was performed in a series of experiments after 45 min of strain application. Strain significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 to 218 ± 17% above the unstrained control level and that of GSK3β at Ser-9 to 161 ± 12% above the control level (Fig. 1B). We next queried whether insulin stimulation would promote activation of Akt and consequent GSK3β inhibition in mdMSC similar to accepted insulin-responsive tissues (11Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar, 24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Insulin increased phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr-308 and Ser-473, as well as phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9, at 30 min (Fig. 1C). Contrasting with the mechanical response, Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation was more intensely activated by insulin and remained elevated at 2 h of insulin treatment. To demonstrate a role for Akt in mechanical inactivation of GSK3β, mdMSC were treated with the allosteric inhibitor Akti-1/2. Akti-1/2 (40 μm) decreased basal phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 2A). Mechanical phosphorylation of Akt was disrupted in the presence of Akti-1/2, and, importantly, phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9 in response to strain also did not occur. Densitometry showed that strain significantly increased phospho-GSK3β/total GSK3β to 153 ± 15% of the unstrained control level in vehicle-treated mdMSC (Fig. 2B) but did not significantly change the level in Akti-1/2-treated cells (69 ± 20% of the control level). To confirm the critical function of Akt, the protein was knocked down using siRNA (Fig. 2C). In cells where total Akt protein was reduced by 70%, mechanical strain failed to phosphorylate GSK3β. This was verified by densitometry (Fig. 2D). PI3K mediates insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt by inducing its membrane recruitment via the second messenger PIP3; in contrast, inhibition of PI3K does not prevent mechanical inactivation of GSK3β in osteoblasts (7Case N. Ma M. Sen B. Xie Z. Gross T.S. Rubin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29196-29205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm) reduced basal levels of phosphorylated Akt in mdMSC, leaving total Akt unchanged (Fig. 3A). LY294002 prevented strain-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 but not at Ser-473. Importantly, mechanical inactivation of GSK3β was unaffected by PI3K inhibition. This indicates that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 is sufficient for downstream mechanical effects. In contrast, phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser-473 and Thr-308 in response to insulin stimulation was blocked in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 3B), reflecting the known dependence of Ser-473 phosphorylation on PI3K (22Foster K.G. Fingar D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14071-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and distinguishing growth factor-induced from mechanically induced signaling paradigms. As the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was found to be of primary importance for mechanical inhibition of GSK3β, ILK was considered as a candidate kinase (16Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Knockdown of ILK by siRNA (>60% at 72 h) did not prevent mechanical activation of Akt or downstream GSK3β phosphorylation in mdMSC (Fig. 4A). Densitometry showed that strain applied for 60 min increased phospho-Akt Ser-473/total Akt to 197 ± 23 and 206 ± 44% of the unstrained control level in mdMSC treated with scrambled and ILK siRNAs, respectively, and increased phospho-GSK3β/total GSK3β to 221 ± 54 and 254 ± 11% of the control level in scrambled and ILK siRNA-transfected cells, respectively (Fig. 4B). Similarly, ILK was not necessary for an insulin response. Addition of insulin increased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β in mdMSC transfected with siRNA to ILK (data not shown). PKC has been shown to influence Akt activation by growth factors (20Sampson S.R. Cooper D.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2006; 89: 32-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and mechanical stimulation activates specific PKC isoforms (18Bullard T.A. Hastings J.L. Davis J.M. Borg T.K. Price R.L. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2007; 85: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The global PKC inhibitor calphostin C was used to evaluate a role for PKC in strain activation of Akt in mdMSC. Treatment with light-activated calphostin C (1 μm) reduced basal Ser-473 phosphorylation, whereas total Akt was unchanged (Fig. 5A). Calphostin C disrupted strain-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 but not at Thr-308. Importantly, mechanical inhibition of GSK3β was blocked by calphostin C treatment, as verified by densitometry (Fig. 5B), confirming that Ser-473 of Akt is essential for mechanical inhibition of GSK3β. Strain significantly increased phospho-GSK3β/total GSK3β to 164 ± 4% of the unstrained control level in vehicle-treated mdMSC but did not significantly change the level in calphostin C-treated cells (79 ± 10% of the control level). The inhibitor Gö6976 was used to specifically inactivate conventional PKC isoforms. Phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3β was increased by mechanical strain in the presence of Gö6976 (Fig. 5C) at all concentrations (0.1–2.5 μm) tested, suggesting that a novel or atypical PKC isoform, rather than a conventional isoform, is involved in mechanically induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. Rictor/mTORC2 is known to specifically transduce insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 (21Gan X. Wang J. Su B. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10998-11002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Here, the mTOR inhibitor KU0063794 (2 μm) reduced basal levels of phosphorylated Akt in mdMSC, leaving total Akt unchanged (Fig. 6A). KU0063794 prevented strain-induced phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser-473 and Thr-308. Importantly, mechanical inactivation of GSK3β was disrupted with mTOR inhibition, as confirmed by densitometry (Fig. 6B). Strain significantly increased phospho-GSK3β/total GSK3β to 147 ± 12% of the unstrained control level in vehicle-treated mdMSC but did not significantly change the level in KU0063794-treated cells (94 ± 6% of the control level). To distinguish between possible contributions of Raptor/mTORC1 and Rictor/mTORC2 to strain-induced phosphorylation of Akt, mdMSC were treated acutely with rapamycin (30 nm) to specifically inhibit Raptor/mTORC1. Both mechanical activation of Akt and downstream GSK3β phosphorylation occurred in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 6C), underlining the importance of the Ser-473 activation site for the mechanical effect. mTOR inhibition with KU0063794 disrupted insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 (Fig. 6D), but an increase in Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 did occur, although it was less than the insulin-induced increase when the mTOR inhibitor was absent. In contrast to disruption of strain-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β by KU0063794, insulin inactivation of GSK3β was unaffected by mTOR inhibition, presumably due to a predominant effect of Thr-308 phosphorylation. Insulin-induced changes in Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation also proceeded despite Raptor/mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 6E). Akt is known to be a critical signaling molecule, in part because of its involvement in multiple diseases, as well as its role in transducing diverse incoming information, including growth factors, cytokines, and biophysical stimuli (12Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4763) Google Scholar). Mechanical activation of Akt has been associated with increased proliferation in multiple cell models (25Hasaneen N.A. Zucker S. Lin R.Z. Vaday G.G. Panettieri R.A. Foda H.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2007; 293: L1059-L1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Sedding D.G. Hermsen J. Seay U. Eickelberg O. Kummer W. Schwencke C. Strasser R.H. Tillmanns H. Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that Akt is subject to mechanical control in undifferentiated mdMSC and acts as the definitive upstream regulator of mechanical inhibition of GSK3β. Mechanical regulation of Akt in mdMSC was uniquely dependent on transient phosphorylation of Ser-473 downstream of mTORC2, which was sufficient to cause GSK3β inactivation. As GSK3β is a control node for adipogenic differentiation of MSC (10Sen B. Styner M. Xie Z. Case N. Rubin C.T. Rubin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34607-34617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), an understanding of this mechanical signaling pathway may suggest new strategies for controlling adipogenesis and preserving MSC potential for higher order tissues. Although application of mechanical strain led to a transient phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr-308 and Ser-473, it was determined that mechanically induced phosphorylation of these two sites was separable and could be independently regulated. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-473 did not require concomitant phosphorylation of Thr-308 by PI3K, as reported previously for Akt activation by growth factors (27Guertin D.A. Stevens D.M. Thoreen C.C. Burds A.A. Kalaany N.Y. Moffat J. Brown M. Fitzgerald K.J. Sabatini D.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 28McManus E.J. Collins B.J.

Although maximal Akt activation requires phosphorylation of both sites (24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar), recent studies demonstrate that phosphorylation of Thr-308 enables sufficient activation of Akt to allow it to modulate a subset of its downstream targets, including GSK3β (27Guertin D.A. Stevens D.M. Thoreen C.C. Burds A.A. Kalaany N.Y. Moffat J. Brown M. Fitzgerald K.J. Sabatini D.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 29Jacinto E. Facchinetti V. Liu D. Soto N. Wei S. Jung S.Y. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. Cell. 2006; 127: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). In mdMSC, mechanical inactivation of GSK3β was dependent primarily on strain-induced phosphorylation of Ser-473. Conversely, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 was sufficient to phosphorylate GSK3β when phosphorylation at Ser-473 was prevented by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor KU0063794. Interestingly, the basal GSK3β Ser-9 level was insensitive to conditions that caused a marked reduction in the basal phospho-Akt Ser-473 level, such as treatment with Akti-1/2 or calphostin C. This suggests that other kinases are involved in regulating basal phosphorylation of GSK3β in mdMSC; indeed, protein kinase A and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase have been suggested to phosphorylate Ser-9 of GSK3β (30Fang X. Yu S.X. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 31Armstrong J.L. Bonavaud S.M. Toole B.J. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 952-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well described phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 by PDK1, multiple kinases have been implicated in regulation of Ser-473 (13Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). ILK, considered a candidate due to its association with integrins (32Wickström S.A. Lange A. Montanez E. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and its ability to enhance Akt activation via Ser-473 (15Troussard A.A. Mawji N.M. Ong C. Mui A. St.-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22374-22378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), did not play a role in the mechanoresponse studied here. Rather, we found that mTORC2 was responsible for strain-induced Ser-473 phosphorylation. This novel finding is one of the first showing independent activation of mTORC2 (22Foster K.G. Fingar D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14071-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and adds to the repertoire of mechanical targets. That KU0063794 blocked mechanical phosphorylation at Thr-308 contrasts with effects in an mTORC2 knock-out mouse model, where Thr-308 phosphorylation was unaffected (27Guertin D.A. Stevens D.M. Thoreen C.C. Burds A.A. Kalaany N.Y. Moffat J. Brown M. Fitzgerald K.J. Sabatini D.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). However, our result is consistent with a prior report demonstrating that pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC2 function did disrupt Akt Thr-308 phosphorylation (33García-Martínez J.M. Moran J. Clarke R.G. Gray A. Cosulich S.C. Chresta C.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2009; 421: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), confirming a cooperativity between phosphorylation at sites 308 and 473 (34Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Because the site at which mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt was shown to be sufficient for downstream GSK3β inactivation, we have established this kinase as a novel and critical regulator of the mechanical response in mdMSC. The PKC family has been linked to regulation of Akt activity (20Sampson S.R. Cooper D.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2006; 89: 32-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), with multiple PKC isoforms involved. In mdMSC, we found that PKC inhibition led to a loss of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation by strain, suggesting that PKC could be a necessary cofactor for activation of mTORC2 in mdMSC. Alternatively, PKC modulation of Ser-473 phosphorylation could occur downstream of mTORC2 activation, as suggested by a recent report on PKCβII effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (35Kleiman E. Carter G. Ghansah T. Patel N.A. Cooper D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 388: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). mdMSC exhibited a robust response to insulin stimulation with respect to Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation. The signaling pathway upstream of these phosphorylation events was consistent with insulin signaling in other cell types, as Akt phosphorylation was dependent on both PI3K activity and mTORC2. Although phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was similarly dependent on mTORC2 in response to strain, the mechanical effect did not require activation of PI3K. A recent finding demonstrated that full-length Akt binds to phosphatidylserine, enriched in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, even in the absence of PIP3 (36Huang B.X. Akbar M. Kevala K. Kim H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism for this binding involves electrostatic interaction, which has been shown to mediate cellular localization of proteins to phosphatidylserine (37Yeung T. Gilbert G.E. Shi J. Silvius J. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Science. 2008; 319: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction of Akt with membrane-associated phosphatidylserine may be sufficient to mediate strain-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 by mTORC2 in the absence of PI3K activation. The differential dependence on PI3K of insulin and strain could further suggest that these two stimuli activate distinct pools of Akt in mdMSC. In contrast to membrane translocation of Akt facilitated by PIP3 binding that precedes its activation by insulin, mechanical strain may activate Akt localized at the membrane. The involvement of Akt in focal adhesions, proposed sites for transduction of mechanical stimuli (38Bershadsky A.D. Balaban N.Q. Geiger B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), supports this possibility. In sum, mechanical input initiates a signaling cascade that requires mTORC2 activation to phosphorylate Akt at Ser-473, which in turn induces phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9 even in the absence of Akt Thr-308 phosphorylation. Our data indicate that the mechanical regulation of GSK3β downstream of Akt is uniquely dependent on Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 in a manner distinct from that of insulin signaling, suggesting that mechanical Akt/GSK3β coupling involves molecules already present at the membrane. These differences provide clues as to the unique processes by which mechanical input, conscripting common signaling pathways, regulates MSC function."
https://openalex.org/W2108350538,"Protected areas are effective at stopping biodiversity loss, but their placement is constrained by the needs of people. Consequently protected areas are often biased toward areas that are unattractive for other human uses. Current reporting metrics that emphasise the total area protected do not account for this bias. To address this problem we propose that the distribution of protected areas be evaluated with an economic metric used to quantify inequality in income--the Gini coefficient. Using a modified version of this measure we discover that 73% of countries have inequitably protected their biodiversity and that common measures of protected area coverage do not adequately reveal this bias. Used in combination with total percentage protection, the Gini coefficient will improve the effectiveness of reporting on the growth of protected area coverage, paving the way for better representation of the world's biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2033644126,"Under homeostatic conditions, a proportion of senescent CXCR4hi neutrophils home from the circulation back to the bone marrow, where they are phagocytosed by bone marrow macrophages. In this study, we have identified an unexpected role for the anti-inflammatory molecule annexin A1 (AnxA1) as a critical regulator of this process. We first observed that AnxA1−/− mice have significantly increased neutrophil numbers in their bone marrow while having normal levels of GM and G colony-forming units, monocytes, and macrophages. Although AnxA1−/− mice have more neutrophils in the bone marrow, a greater proportion of these cells are senescent, as determined by their higher levels of CXCR4 expression and annexin V binding. Consequently, bone marrow neutrophils from AnxA1−/− mice exhibit a reduced migratory capacity in vitro. Studies conducted in vitro also show that expression of AnxA1 is required for bone marrow macrophages, but not peritoneal macrophages, to phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils.

https://openalex.org/W2003837645,"Cancer cells adopt glycolysis as the major source of metabolic energy production for fast cell growth. The HIF-1-induced PFKFB3 plays a key role in this adaptation by elevating the concentration of Fru-2,6-BP, the most potent glycolysis stimulator. As this metabolic conversion has been suggested to be a hallmark of cancer, PFKFB3 has emerged as a novel target for cancer chemotherapy. Here, we report that a small molecular inhibitor, N4A, was identified as an initial lead compound for PFKFB3 inhibitor with therapeutic potential. In an attempt to improve its potency, we determined the crystal structure of the PFKFB3•N4A complex to 2.4 Å resolution and, exploiting the resulting molecular information, attained the more potent YN1. When tested on cultured cancer cells, both N4A and YN1 inhibited PFKFB3, suppressing the Fru-2,6-BP level, which in turn suppressed glycolysis and, ultimately, led to cell death. This study validates PFKFB3 as a target for new cancer therapies and provides a framework for future development efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2060852391,"Over the last decade, small noncoding RNA molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in the expression and function of eukaryotic genomes. It has been suggested that viral infections and neurological disease outcome may also be shaped by the influence of small RNAs. This has prompted us to suggest that HIV infection alters the endogenous miRNA expression patterns, thereby contributing to neuronal deregulation and AIDS dementia. Therefore, using primary cultures and neuronal cell lines, we examined the impact of a viral protein (HIV-1 Tat) on the expression of miRNAs due to its characteristic features such as release from the infected cells and taken up by noninfected cells. Using microRNA array assay, we demonstrated that Tat deregulates the levels of several miRNAs. Interestingly, miR-34a was among the most highly induced miRNAs in Tat-treated neurons. Tat also decreases the levels of miR-34a target genes such as CREB protein as shown by real time PCR. The effect of Tat was neutralized in the presence of anti-miR-34a. Using in situ hybridization assay, we found that the levels of miR-34a increase in Tat transgenic mice when compared with the parental mice. Therefore, we conclude that deregulation of neuronal functions by HIV-1 Tat protein is miRNA-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2147301250,"Exposure to early postnatal stress is known to hasten the progression of kindling epileptogenesis in adult rats. Despite the significance of this for understanding mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and its associated psychopathology, research findings regarding underlying mechanisms are sparse. Of several possibilities, one important candidate mechanism is early life 'programming' of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by postnatal stress. Elevated corticosterone (CORT) in turn has consequences for neurogenesis and cell death relevant to epileptogenesis. Here we tested the hypotheses that MS would augment seizure-related corticosterone (CORT) release and enhance neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus.Eight-week old Wistar rats, previously exposed on postnatal days 2-14 to either maternal separation stress (MS) or control brief early handling (EH), underwent rapid amygdala kindling. We measured seizure-induced serum CORT levels and post-kindling neurogenesis (using BrdU). Three weeks post-kindling, rats were euthanized for histology of the hippocampal CA3c region (pyramidal cell counts) and dentate gyrus (DG) (to count BrdU-labelled cells and measure mossy fibre sprouting). As in our previous studies, rats exposed to MS had accelerated kindling rates in adulthood. Female MS rats had heightened CORT responses during and after kindling (p<0.05), with a similar trend in males. In both sexes total CA3c pyramidal cell numbers were reduced in MS vs. EH rats post-kindling (p = 0.002). Dentate granule cell neurogenesis in female rats was significantly increased post-kindling in MS vs. EH rats.These data demonstrate that early life stress results in enduring enhancement of HPA axis responses to limbic seizures, with increased hippocampal CA3c cell loss and augmented neurogenesis, in a sex-dependent pattern. This implicates important candidate mechanisms through which early life stress may promote vulnerability to limbic epileptogenesis in rats as well as to human MTLE and its associated psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2115883129,"The human voice provides a rich source of information about individual attributes such as body size, developmental stability and emotional state. Moreover, there is evidence that female voice characteristics change across the menstrual cycle. A previous study reported that women speak with higher fundamental frequency (F0) in the high-fertility compared to the low-fertility phase. To gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying this variation in perceived attractiveness and the relationship between vocal quality and the timing of ovulation, we combined hormone measurements and acoustic analyses, to characterize voice changes on a day-to-day basis throughout the menstrual cycle. Voice characteristics were measured from free speech as well as sustained vowels. In addition, we asked men to rate vocal attractiveness from selected samples. The free speech samples revealed marginally significant variation in F0 with an increase prior to and a distinct drop during ovulation. Overall variation throughout the cycle, however, precluded unequivocal identification of the period with the highest conception risk. The analysis of vowel samples revealed a significant increase in degree of unvoiceness and noise-to-harmonic ratio during menstruation, possibly related to an increase in tissue water content. Neither estrogen nor progestogen levels predicted the observed changes in acoustic characteristics. The perceptual experiments revealed a preference by males for voice samples recorded during the pre-ovulatory period compared to other periods in the cycle. While overall we confirm earlier findings in that women speak with a higher and more variable fundamental frequency just prior to ovulation, the present study highlights the importance of taking the full range of variation into account before drawing conclusions about the value of these cues for the detection of ovulation."

Given the critical position of caspase 8 at the crossroads of cell death pathways, we generated a new viable mouse line (Ncasp8(-/-)), in which the gene encoding caspase 8 was selectively deleted in neurons by cre-lox system.Caspase 8 deletion reduced rates of neuronal cell death in primary neuronal cultures and in whole brain organotypic coronal slice cultures prepared from 4 and 8 month old mice and cultivated up to 14 days in vitro. Treatments of cultures with recombinant murine TNFα (100 ng/ml) or TRAIL (250 ng/mL) plus cyclohexamide significantly protected neurons against cell death induced by these apoptosis-inducing ligands. A protective role of caspase 8 deletion in vivo was also demonstrated using a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and seizure-induced brain injury caused by kainic acid (KA). Morphometric analyses were performed using digital imaging in conjunction with image analysis algorithms. By employing virtual images of hundreds of brain sections, we were able to perform quantitative morphometry of histological and immunohistochemical staining data in an unbiased manner. In the TBI model, homozygous deletion of caspase 8 resulted in reduced lesion volumes, improved post-injury motor performance, superior learning and memory retention, decreased apoptosis, diminished proteolytic processing of caspases and caspase substrates, and less neuronal degeneration, compared to wild type, homozygous cre, and caspase 8-floxed control mice. In the KA model, Ncasp8(-/-) mice demonstrated superior survival, reduced seizure severity, less apoptosis, and reduced caspase 3 processing. Uninjured aged knockout mice showed improved learning and memory, implicating a possible role for caspase 8 in cognitive decline with aging.Neuron-specific deletion of caspase 8 reduces brain damage and improves post-traumatic functional outcomes, suggesting an important role for this caspase in pathophysiology of acute brain trauma."

Most studies have placed the mitochondria ancestor within the Rickettsiales order. Ten years ago, the bacterium Odyssella thessalonicensis was isolated from Acanthamoeba spp., and the 16S rDNA phylogeny placed it within the Rickettsiales. Recently, the whole genome of O. thessalonicensis has been sequenced, and 16S rDNA phylogeny and more robust and accurate phylogenomic analyses have been performed with 65 highly conserved proteins.The results suggested that the O. thessalonicensis emerged between the Rickettsiales and other Alphaproteobacteria. The mitochondrial proteins of the Reclinomonas americana have been used to locate the phylogenetic position of the mitochondrion ancestor within the Alphaproteobacteria tree. Using the K tree score method, nine mitochondrion-encoded proteins, whose phylogenies were congruent with the Alphaproteobacteria phylogenomic tree, have been selected and concatenated for Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenies. The Reclinomonas americana mitochondrion is a sister taxon to the free-living bacteria Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique, and together, they form a clade that is deeply rooted in the Rickettsiales clade.The Reclinomonas americana mitochondrion phylogenomic study confirmed that mitochondria emerged deeply in the Rickettsiales clade and that they are closely related to Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique."
https://openalex.org/W2102646523,"Fibroblasts are important in orchestrating various functions necessary for maintaining normal tissue homeostasis as well as promoting malignant tumor growth. Significant evidence indicates that fibroblasts are functionally heterogeneous with respect to their ability to promote tumor growth, but markers that can be used to distinguish growth promoting from growth suppressing fibroblasts remain ill-defined. Here we show that human breast fibroblasts are functionally heterogeneous with respect to tumor-promoting activity regardless of whether they were isolated from normal or cancerous breast tissues. Rather than significant differences in fibroblast marker expression, we show that fibroblasts secreting abundant levels of prostaglandin (PGE2), when isolated from either reduction mammoplasty or carcinoma tissues, were both capable of enhancing tumor growth in vivo and could increase the number of cancer stem-like cells. PGE2 further enhanced the tumor promoting properties of fibroblasts by increasing secretion of IL-6, which was necessary, but not sufficient, for expansion of breast cancer stem-like cells. These findings identify a population of fibroblasts which both produce and respond to PGE2, and that are functionally distinct from other fibroblasts. Identifying markers of these cells could allow for the targeted ablation of tumor-promoting and inflammatory fibroblasts in human breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2007846065,"The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), the world's largest marsupial carnivore, is under threat of extinction following the emergence of an infectious cancer. Devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is spread between Tasmanian devils during biting. The disease is consistently fatal and devils succumb without developing a protective immune response. The aim of this study was to determine if Tasmanian devils were capable of forming cytotoxic antitumour responses and develop antibodies against DFTD cells and foreign tumour cells. The two Tasmanian devils immunised with irradiated DFTD cells did not form cytotoxic or humoral responses against DFTD cells, even after multiple immunisations. However, following immunisation with xenogenic K562 cells, devils did produce cytotoxic responses and antibodies against this foreign tumour cell line. The cytotoxicity appeared to occur through the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in an antibody dependent manner. Classical NK cell responses, such as innate killing of DFTD and foreign cancer cells, were not observed. Cells with an NK-like phenotype comprised approximately 4 percent of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results of this study suggest that Tasmanian devils have NK cells with functional cytotoxic pathways. Although devil NK cells do not directly recognise DFTD cancer cells, the development of antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity presents a potential pathway to induce cytotoxic responses against the disease. These findings have positive implications for future DFTD vaccine research."
https://openalex.org/W2088473907,"The antiviral and antiproliferative responses mediated by type I interferons (IFNs) depend on JAK/STAT signaling and ISGF3 (STAT1:STAT2: IRF9)-dependent transcription. In addition, type I IFNs stimulate STAT3 activation in many cell types, an event generally associated with cell cycle progression, survival, and proliferation. To gather more insight into this functionally contradictive phenomenon, we studied the regulation of STAT3 transcriptional activity upon type I IFN treatment. We show that IFNα2 stimulation strongly induces STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and promoter binding, yet the activation of transcription of a STAT3-dependent reporter and endogenous genes, such as SOCS3 and c-FOS, is impaired. Simultaneous treatment with IFNα2 and trichostatin A, as well as combined HDAC1/HDAC2 silencing, restores STAT3-dependent reporter gene and endogenous gene expression, strongly suggesting that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are directly involved in repressing IFNα2-activated STAT3. Of note, single silencing of only one of the two HDACs does not lead to enhanced STAT3 activity, supporting a functional redundancy between these two enzymes. In sharp contrast, HDAC1 and HDAC2 activities are required for ISGF3-dependent gene expression. We conclude that HDAC1 and HDAC2 differentially modulate STAT activity in response to IFNα2: while they are required for the induction of ISGF3-responsive genes, they impair the transcription of STAT3-dependent genes.—Icardi, L., Lievens, S., Mori, R., Piessevaux, J., De Cauwer, L., De Bosscher, K., Tavernier, J.

https://openalex.org/W2095888274,"Background While fluid intelligence has proved to be central to executive functioning, logical reasoning and other frontal functions, the role of this ability in psychosocial adaptation has not been well characterized. Methodology/Principal Findings A random-probabilistic sample of 2370 secondary school students completed measures of fluid intelligence (Raven's Progressive Matrices, RPM) and several measures of psychological adaptation: bullying (Delaware Bullying Questionnaire), domestic abuse of adolescents (Conflict Tactic Scale), drug intake (ONUDD), self-esteem (Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale) and the Perceived Mental Health Scale (Spanish adaptation). Lower fluid intelligence scores were associated with physical violence, both in the role of victim and victimizer. Drug intake, especially cannabis, cocaine and inhalants and lower self-esteem were also associated with lower fluid intelligence. Finally, scores on the perceived mental health assessment were better when fluid intelligence scores were higher. Conclusions/Significance Our results show evidence of a strong association between psychosocial adaptation and fluid intelligence, suggesting that the latter is not only central to executive functioning but also forms part of a more general capacity for adaptation to social contexts."

https://openalex.org/W2092718418,"Cystatin F is an unusual member of the cystatin family of protease inhibitors, which is made as an inactive dimer and becomes activated by proteolysis in the endo/lysosome pathway of the immune cells that produce it. However a proportion is secreted and can be taken up and activated by other cells. We show here that cystatin F acquired in this way induces a dramatic accumulation of the single-chain form of cathepsin L (CatL). Cystatin F was observed in the same cellular compartments as CatL and was tightly complexed with CatL as determined by co-precipitation studies. The observed accumulation of single-chain CatL was partly due to cystatin F-mediated inhibition of the putative single-chain to two-chain CatL convertase AEP/legumain and partly to general suppression of cathepsin activity. Thus, cystatin F stabilizes CatL leading to the dramatic accumulation of an inactive complex composed either of the single-chain or two-chain form depending on the capacity of cystatin F to inhibit AEP. Cross-transfer of cystatin F from one cell to another may therefore attenuate potentially harmful effects of excessive CatL activity while paradoxically, inducing accumulation of CatL protein. Finally, we confirmed earlier data (Beers, C., Honey, K., Fink, S., Forbush, K., and Rudensky, A. (2003) J. Exp. Med. 197, 169-179) showing a loss of CatL activity, but not of CatL protein, in macrophages activated with IFNγ. However, we found equivalent loss of CatL activity in wild type and cystatin F-null macrophages suggesting that an inhibitory activity other than cystatin F quenches CatL activity in activated macrophages."

By using all-atom explicit solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidated at the atomic level the intrinsic determinants of the pH-dependent dimerization of the central hydrophobic segment Aβ(12-24) and related these with the propensity to form amyloid fibrils measured by experimental tools such as atomic force microscopy and fluorescence. The process of Aβ(12-24) dimerization was evaluated in terms of free energy landscape, side-chain two-dimensional contact probability maps, β-sheet registries, potential mean force as a function of inter-chain distances, secondary structure development and radial solvation distributions. We showed that dimerization is a key event in Aβ(12-24) amyloid formation; it is highly prompted in the order of pH 5.0>2.9>>8.4 and determines further amyloid growth. The dimerization is governed by a dynamic interplay of hydrophobic, electrostatic and solvation interactions permitting some variability of β-sheets at each pH. These results provide atomistic insight into the complex process of molecular recognition detrimental for amyloid growth and pave the way for better understanding of the molecular basis of amyloid diseases."

Here we analyzed in vitro the role of KGFR in the early differentiation of keratinocytes modulating its expression by KGFR cDNA transient transfection or KGFR siRNA microinjection and inducing a synchronous wave of differentiation in pre-confluent cells. Immunofluorescence, biochemical and molecular approaches demonstrated that KGFR overexpression increased the early differentiation marker keratin 1 at both transcriptional and translational levels, while receptor depletion reduced it. Ligand-dependent receptor activation and signaling were required for this differentiative effect. Overexpression of kinase negative KGFR mutant or Tyr769 KGFR signaling mutant, which is not able to recruit and activate PLC-γ, showed that the receptor kinase activity, but not its PLCγ-mediated signaling, is required for differentiation. Reduction of K1 expression, obtained by AKT inhibition, demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the control of KGFR-mediated keratinocyte differentiation.

Here we present a comprehensive structural investigation of the effects of phosphorylation on the conformational as well as functional states of a crucial cell surface receptor, α(IIb)β(3) integrin. We have analyzed phosphorylated (Tyr(747) and Tyr(759)) β(3) integrin cytoplasmic tail (CT) primarily by NMR, and our data demonstrate that under both aqueous and membrane-mimetic conditions, phosphorylation causes substantial conformational rearrangements. These changes originate from novel ionic interactions and revised phospholipid binding. Under aqueous conditions, the critical Tyr(747) phosphorylation prevents β(3)CT from binding to its heterodimer partner α(IIb)CT, thus likely maintaining an activated state of the receptor. This conclusion was tested in vivo and confirmed by integrin-dependent endothelial cells adhesion assay. Under membrane-mimetic conditions, phosphorylation results in a modified membrane embedding characterized by significant changes in the secondary structure pattern and the overall fold of β(3)CT.

Despite low amino acid homology (20.5%) between IgD Fc and IgG4 Fc, EPO-hyFc retained ""Y-shaped"" structure and repeated intravenous administrations of EPO-hyFc into monkeys did not generate EPO-hyFc-specific antibody responses. Furthermore, EPO-hyFc could not bind to FcγR I and C1q in contrast to EPO-IgG1 Fc. In addition, EPO-hyFc exhibited better in vitro bioactivity and in vivo bioactivity in rats than EPO-IgG1 Fc, presumably due to the high flexibility of IgD. Moreover, the mean serum half-life of EPO-hyFc(H), a high sialic acid content form of EPO-hyFc, was approximately 2-fold longer than that of the heavily glycosylated EPO, darbepoetin alfa, in rats. More importantly, subcutaneous injection of EPO-hyFc(H) not only induced a significantly greater elevation of serum hemoglobin levels than darbepoetin alfa in both normal rats and cisplatin-induced anemic rats, but also displayed a delayed time to maximal serum level and twice final area-under-the-curve (AUC(last)). Taken together, hyFc might be a more attractive Fc conjugate for agonistic proteins/peptides than IgG1 Fc due to its capability to elongate their half-lives without inducing host effector functions and hindering bioactivity of fused molecules. Additionally, a head-to-head comparison demonstrated that hyFc-fusion strategy more effectively improved the in vivo bioactivity of EPO than the hyperglycosylation approach."

There is equivocal evidence that children of older fathers are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and reduced IQ. We therefore report here on the relationship between paternal age and a composite indicator of scholastic achievement during adolescence, i.e. compulsory school leaving grades, among recent birth cohorts in Stockholm County where delayed paternity is notably common. We performed a record-linkage study comprising all individuals in Stockholm County who finished 9 years of compulsory school from 2000 through 2007 (n = 155,875). Data on school leaving grades and parental characteristics were retrieved from administrative and health service registers and analyzed using multiple linear regression. Advancing paternal age at birth was not associated with a decrease in school leaving grades in adolescent offspring. After adjustment for year of graduation, maternal age and parental education, country of birth and parental mental health service use, offspring of fathers aged 50 years or older had on average 0.3 (95% CI −3.8, 4.4) points higher grades than those of fathers aged 30–34 years. In conclusion, advancing paternal age is not associated with poorer school performance in adolescence. Adverse effects of delayed paternity on offspring cognitive function, if any, may be counterbalanced by other potential advantages for children born to older fathers."

These mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy [end-diastolic left ventricular diameter at 18 wk of age: wild-type (WT) mice, 4.2 mm ± 0.3; Sca-1-knockout (Sca-1-KO) mice, 4.6 mm ± 0.1; ejection fraction: WT mice, 51.1 ± 2.7%; Sca-1-KO mice, 42.9 ± 2.7%]. Furthermore, the hearts of mice lacking Sca-1 demonstrated exacerbated susceptibility to pressure overload [ejection fraction after transaortic constriction (TAC): WT mice, 43.5 ± 3.2%; Sca-1-KO mice, 30.8% ± 4.0] and increased apoptosis, as shown by the 2.5-fold increase in TUNEL(+) cells in Sca-1-deficient hearts under stress. Sca-1 deficiency affected primarily the nonmyocyte cell fraction. Indeed, the number of Nkx2.5(+) nonmyocyte cells, which represent a population of cardiac precursor cells (CPCs), was 2-fold smaller in Sca-1 deficient neonatal hearts. In vitro, the ability of CPCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes was not affected by Sca-1 deletion. In contrast, these cells demonstrated unrestricted differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, proliferation of cardiac nonmyocyte cells in response to stress, as judged by BrdU incorporation, was higher in mice lacking Sca-1 (percentages of BrdU(+) cells in the heart after TAC: WT mice, 4.4 ± 2.1%; Sca-1-KO mice, 19.3 ± 4.2%). These data demonstrate the crucial role of Sca-1 in the maintenance of cardiac integrity and suggest that Sca-1 restrains spontaneous differentiation in the precursor population. The absence of Sca-1 results in uncontrolled precursor recruitment, exhaustion of the precursor pool, and cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2030632676,"The causes of socioeconomic inequality have been debated since the time of Plato. Many reasons for the development of stratification have been proposed, from the need for hierarchical control over large-scale irrigation systems to the accumulation of small differences in wealth over time via inheritance processes. However, none of these explains how unequal societies came to completely displace egalitarian cultural norms over time. Our study models demographic consequences associated with the unequal distribution of resources in stratified societies. Agent-based simulation results show that in constant environments, unequal access to resources can be demographically destabilizing, resulting in the outward migration and spread of such societies even when population size is relatively small. In variable environments, stratified societies spread more and are also better able to survive resource shortages by sequestering mortality in the lower classes. The predictions of our simulation are provided modest support by a range of existing empirical studies. In short, the fact that stratified societies today vastly outnumber egalitarian societies may not be due to the transformation of egalitarian norms and structures, but may instead reflect the more rapid migration of stratified societies and consequent conquest or displacement of egalitarian societies over time."
https://openalex.org/W2053778356,"Transmembrane adaptor proteins (TRAPs) organize signaling complexes at the plasma membrane, and thus function as critical linkers and integrators of signaling cascades downstream of antigen receptors. We have previously shown that the transmembrane adaptor protein SIT regulates the threshold for thymocyte selection. Moreover, T cells from SIT-deficient mice are hyperresponsive to CD3 stimulation and undergo enhanced lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation, thus indicating that SIT inhibits TCR-mediated signaling. Here, we have further addressed how SIT regulates signaling cascades in T cells. We demonstrate that the loss of SIT enhances TCR-mediated Akt activation and increased phosphorylation/inactivation of Foxo1, a transcription factor of the Forkhead family that inhibits cell cycle progression and regulates T-cell homeostasis. We have also shown that CD4(+) T cells from SIT-deficient mice display increased CD69 and CD40L expression indicating an altered activation status. Additional biochemical analyses further revealed that suppression of SIT expression by RNAi in human T cells resulted in an enhanced proximal TCR signaling. In summary, the data identify SIT as an important modulator of TCR-mediated signaling that regulates T-cell activation, homeostasis and tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1998839451,"The cohesin complex is required for the cohesion of sister chromatids and for correct segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Crossover recombination, together with cohesion, is essential for the disjunction of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. Cohesin has been implicated in facilitating recombinational repair of DNA lesions via the sister chromatid. Here, we made use of a new temperature-sensitive mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans SMC-3 protein to study the role of cohesin in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and hence in meiotic crossing over. We report that attenuation of cohesin was associated with extensive SPO-11-dependent chromosome fragmentation, which is representative of unrepaired DSBs. We also found that attenuated cohesin likely increased the number of DSBs and eliminated the need of MRE-11 and RAD-50 for DSB formation in C. elegans, which suggests a role for the MRN complex in making cohesin-loaded chromatin susceptible to meiotic DSBs. Notably, in spite of largely intact sister chromatid cohesion, backup DSB repair via the sister chromatid was mostly impaired. We also found that weakened cohesins affected mitotic repair of DSBs by homologous recombination, whereas NHEJ repair was not affected. Our data suggest that recombinational DNA repair makes higher demands on cohesins than does chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2026598905,"Neurons in the caudalmost ventrolateral medulla (cmVLM) respond to noxious stimulation. We previously have shown most efferent projections from this locus project to areas implicated either in the processing or modulation of pain. Here we show the cmVLM of the rat receives projections from superficial laminae of the medullary dorsal horn (MDH) and has neurons activated with capsaicin injections into the temporalis muscle. Injections of either biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the MDH or fluorogold (FG)/fluorescent microbeads into the cmVLM showed projections from lamina I and II of the MDH to the cmVLM. Morphometric analysis showed the retrogradely-labeled neurons were small (area 88.7 µm(2)±3.4) and mostly fusiform in shape. Injections (20-50 µl) of 0.5% capsaicin into the temporalis muscle and subsequent immunohistochemistry for c-Fos showed nuclei labeled in the dorsomedial trigeminocervical complex (TCC), the cmVLM, the lateral medulla, and the internal lateral subnucleus of the parabrachial complex (PBil). Additional labeling with c-Fos was seen in the subnucleus interpolaris of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, the rostral ventrolateral medulla, the superior salivatory nucleus, the rostral ventromedial medulla, and the A1, A5, A7 and subcoeruleus catecholamine areas. Injections of FG into the PBil produced robust label in the lateral medulla and cmVLM while injections of BDA into the lateral medulla showed projections to the PBil. Immunohistochemical experiments to antibodies against substance P, the substance P receptor (NK1), calcitonin gene regulating peptide, leucine enkephalin, VRL1 (TPRV2) receptors and neuropeptide Y showed that these peptides/receptors densely stained the cmVLM. We suggest the MDH- cmVLM projection is important for pain from head and neck areas. We offer a potential new pathway for regulating deep pain via the neurons of the TCC, the cmVLM, the lateral medulla, and the PBil and propose these areas compose a trigeminoreticular pathway, possibly the trigeminal homologue of the spinoreticulothalamic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2071597048,"Heparin acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (N-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.78) is an integral lysosomal membrane protein containing 11 transmembrane domains, encoded by the HGSNAT gene. Deficiencies of N-acetyltransferase lead to mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC. We demonstrate that contrary to a previous report, the N-acetyltransferase signal peptide is co-translationally cleaved and that this event is required for its intracellular transport to the lysosome. While we confirm that the N-acetyltransferase precursor polypeptide is processed in the lysosome into a small amino-terminal alpha- and a larger ß- chain, we further characterize this event by identifying the mature amino-terminus of each chain. We also demonstrate this processing step(s) is not, as previously reported, needed to produce a functional transferase, i.e., the precursor is active. We next optimize the biochemical assay procedure so that it remains linear as N-acetyltransferase is purified or protein-extracts containing N-acetyltransferase are diluted, by the inclusion of negatively charged lipids. We then use this assay to demonstrate that the purified single N-acetyltransferase protein is both necessary and sufficient to express transferase activity, and that N-acetyltransferase functions as a monomer. Finally, the kinetic mechanism of action of purified N-acetyltransferase was evaluated and found to be a random sequential mechanism involving the formation of a ternary complex with its two substrates; i.e., N-acetyltransferase does not operate through a ping-pong mechanism as previously reported. We confirm this conclusion by demonstrating experimentally that no acetylated enzyme intermediate is formed during the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2046574142,"Background The limited capacity of visual working memory (VWM) requires us to select the task relevant information and filter out the irrelevant information efficiently. Previous studies showed that the individual differences in VWM capacity dramatically influenced the way we filtered out the distracters displayed in distinct spatial-locations: low-capacity individuals were poorer at filtering them out than the high-capacity ones. However, when the target and distracting information pertain to the same object (i.e., multiple-featured object), whether the VWM capacity modulates the feature-based filtering remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We explored this issue mainly based on one of our recent studies, in which we asked the participants to remember three colors of colored-shapes or colored-landolt-Cs while using two types of task irrelevant information. We found that the irrelevant high-discriminable information could not be filtered out during the extraction of VWM but the irrelevant fine-grained information could be. We added 8 extra participants to the original 16 participants and then split the overall 24 participants into low- and high-VWM capacity groups. We found that regardless of the VWM capacity, the irrelevant high-discriminable information was selected into VWM, whereas the irrelevant fine-grained information was filtered out. The latter finding was further corroborated in a second experiment in which the participants were required to remember one colored-landolt-C and a more strict control was exerted over the VWM capacity. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that VWM capacity did not modulate the feature-based filtering in VWM."
https://openalex.org/W2070466050,"Polysialic acid (PSA) is a unique carbohydrate composed of a linear homopolymer of α-2,8 linked sialic acid, and is mainly attached to the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in vertebrate neural system. In the brain, PSA is exclusively synthesized by the two polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII (also known as STX) and ST8SiaIV (also known as PST). By modulating adhesive property of NCAM, PSA plays a critical role in several neural development processes such as cell migration, neurite outgrowth, axon pathfinding, synaptogenesis and activity-dependent plasticity. The expression of PSA is temporally and spatially regulated during neural development and a tight regulation of PSA expression is essential to its biological function. In mouse visual cortex, PSA is downregulated following eye opening and its decrease allows the maturation of GABAergic synapses and the opening of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. Relatively little is known about how PSA levels are regulated by sensory experience and neuronal activity. Here, we demonstrate that while both ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV mRNA levels decrease around the time of eye opening in mouse visual cortex, only ST8SiaII mRNA level reduction is regulated by sensory experience. Using an organotypic culture system from mouse visual cortex, we further show that ST8SiaII gene expression is regulated by spiking activity and NMDA-mediated excitation. Further, we show that both ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV mRNA levels are positively regulated by PKC-mediated signaling. Therefore, sensory experience-dependent ST8SiaII gene expression regulates PSA levels in postnatal visual cortex, thus acting as molecular link between visual activity and PSA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2023724645,"Enzymes of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway have been identified as essential for the growth and survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and thus have potential for the development of anti-tuberculosis drugs. The final two steps of this pathway are carried out by the bifunctional enzyme 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC), also known as PurH. This enzyme has already been the target of anti-cancer drug development. We have determined the crystal structures of the M. tuberculosis ATIC (Rv0957) both with and without the substrate 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, at resolutions of 2.5 and 2.2 Å, respectively. As for other ATIC enzymes, the protein is folded into two domains, the N-terminal domain (residues 1-212) containing the cyclohydrolase active site and the C-terminal domain (residues 222-523) containing the formyltransferase active site. An adventitiously bound nucleotide was found in the cyclohydrolase active site in both structures and was identified by NMR and mass spectral analysis as a novel 5-formyl derivative of an earlier intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway 4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide. This result and other studies suggest that this novel nucleotide is a cyclohydrolase inhibitor. The dimer formed by M. tuberculosis ATIC is different from those seen for human and avian ATICs, but it has a similar ∼50-Å separation of the two active sites of the bifunctional enzyme. Evidence in M. tuberculosis ATIC for reactivity of half-the-sites in the cyclohydrolase domains can be attributed to ligand-induced movements that propagate across the dimer interface and may be a common feature of ATIC enzymes."
