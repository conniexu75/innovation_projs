https://openalex.org/W2031365272,"Parkinson's disease (PD), an adult neurodegenerative disorder, has been clinically linked to the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD), but the mechanistic connection is not known. Here, we show that functional loss of GD-linked glucocerebrosidase (GCase) in primary cultures or human iPS neurons compromises lysosomal protein degradation, causes accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn), and results in neurotoxicity through aggregation-dependent mechanisms. Glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the GCase substrate, directly influenced amyloid formation of purified α-syn by stabilizing soluble oligomeric intermediates. We further demonstrate that α-syn inhibits the lysosomal activity of normal GCase in neurons and idiopathic PD brain, suggesting that GCase depletion contributes to the pathogenesis of sporadic synucleinopathies. These findings suggest that the bidirectional effect of α-syn and GCase forms a positive feedback loop that may lead to a self-propagating disease. Therefore, improved targeting of GCase to lysosomes may represent a specific therapeutic approach for PD and other synucleinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2014658441,"When dielectric materials are brought into contact and then separated, they develop static electricity. For centuries, it has been assumed that such contact charging derives from the spatially homogeneous material properties (along the material's surface) and that within a given pair of materials, one charges uniformly positively and the other negatively. We demonstrate that this picture of contact charging is incorrect. Whereas each contact-electrified piece develops a net charge of either positive or negative polarity, each surface supports a random ""mosaic"" of oppositely charged regions of nanoscopic dimensions. These mosaics of surface charge have the same topological characteristics for different types of electrified dielectrics and accommodate significantly more charge per unit area than previously thought."

https://openalex.org/W2011083779,"Synthetic biology has advanced the design of genetic devices that can be used to reprogram metabolic activities in mammalian cells. By functionally linking the signal transduction of melanopsin to the control circuit of the nuclear factor of activated T cells, we have designed a synthetic signaling cascade enabling light-inducible transgene expression in different cell lines grown in culture or bioreactors or implanted into mice. In animals harboring intraperitoneal hollow-fiber or subcutaneous implants containing light-inducible transgenic cells, the serum levels of the human glycoprotein secreted alkaline phosphatase could be remote-controlled with fiber optics or transdermally regulated through direct illumination. Light-controlled expression of the glucagon-like peptide 1 was able to attenuate glycemic excursions in type II diabetic mice. Synthetic light-pulse-transcription converters may have applications in therapeutics and protein expression technology."
https://openalex.org/W2043468320,"Sleep is believed to play an important role in memory consolidation. We induced sleep on demand by expressing the temperature-gated nonspecific cation channel Transient receptor potential cation channel (UAS-TrpA1) in neurons, including those with projections to the dorsal fan-shaped body (FB). When the temperature was raised to 31°C, flies entered a quiescent state that meets the criteria for identifying sleep. When sleep was induced for 4 hours after a massed-training protocol for courtship conditioning that is not capable of inducing long-term memory (LTM) by itself, flies develop an LTM. Activating the dorsal FB in the absence of sleep did not result in the formation of LTM after massed training."

https://openalex.org/W2081610458,"The functions of sleep remain elusive, but a strong link exists between sleep need and neuronal plasticity. We tested the hypothesis that plastic processes during wake lead to a net increase in synaptic strength and sleep is necessary for synaptic renormalization. We found that, in three Drosophila neuronal circuits, synapse size or number increases after a few hours of wake and decreases only if flies are allowed to sleep. A richer wake experience resulted in both larger synaptic growth and greater sleep need. Finally, we demonstrate that the gene Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) plays an important role in sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization."

https://openalex.org/W2052888535,"Matter described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, may undergo phase transitions when its temperature and the chemical potentials are varied. QCD at finite temperature is studied in the laboratory by colliding heavy-ions at varying beam energies. We present a test of QCD in the non-perturbative domain through a comparison of thermodynamic fluctuations predicted in lattice computations with the experimental data of baryon number distributions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This study provides evidence for thermalization in these collisions, and allows us to find the crossover temperature between normal nuclear matter and a deconfined phase called the quark gluon plasma. This value allows us to set a scale for the phase diagram of QCD."
https://openalex.org/W1988309816,"The Genesis mission sampled solar wind ions to document the elemental and isotopic compositions of the Sun and, by inference, of the protosolar nebula. Nitrogen was a key target element because the extent and origin of its isotopic variations in solar system materials remain unknown. Isotopic analysis of a Genesis Solar Wind Concentrator target material shows that implanted solar wind nitrogen has a (15)N/(14)N ratio of 2.18 ± 0.02 × 10(-3) (that is, ≈40% poorer in (15)N relative to terrestrial atmosphere). The (15)N/(14)N ratio of the protosolar nebula was 2.27 ± 0.03 × 10(-3), which is the lowest (15)N/(14)N ratio known for solar system objects. This result demonstrates the extreme nitrogen isotopic heterogeneity of the nascent solar system and accounts for the (15)N-depleted components observed in solar system reservoirs."

https://openalex.org/W2094734008,"Although Campylobacter jejuni-infections have a high prevalence worldwide and represent a significant socioeconomic burden, it is still not well understood how C. jejuni causes intestinal inflammation. Detailed investigation of C. jejuni-mediated intestinal immunopathology is hampered by the lack of appropriate vertebrate models. In particular, mice display colonization resistance against this pathogen.To overcome these limitations we developed a novel C. jejuni-infection model using gnotobiotic mice in which the intestinal flora was eradicated by antibiotic treatment. These animals could then be permanently associated with a complete human (hfa) or murine (mfa) microbiota. After peroral infection C. jejuni colonized the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic and hfa mice for six weeks, whereas mfa mice cleared the pathogen within two days. Strikingly, stable C. jejuni colonization was accompanied by a pro-inflammatory immune response indicated by increased numbers of T- and B-lymphocytes, regulatory T-cells, neutrophils and apoptotic cells, as well as increased concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 in the colon mucosa of hfa mice. Analysis of MyD88(-/-), TRIF(-/-), TLR4(-/-), and TLR9(-/-) mice revealed that TLR4- and TLR9-signaling was essential for immunopathology following C. jejuni-infection. Interestingly, C. jejuni-mutant strains deficient in formic acid metabolism and perception induced less intestinal immunopathology compared to the parental strain infection. In summary, the murine gut flora is essential for colonization resistance against C. jejuni and can be overcome by reconstitution of gnotobiotic mice with human flora. Detection of C. jejuni-LPS and -CpG-DNA by host TLR4 and TLR9, respectively, plays a key role in immunopathology. Finally, the host immune response is tightly coupled to bacterial formic acid metabolism and invasion fitness.We conclude that gnotobiotic and ""humanized"" mice represent excellent novel C. jejuni-infection and -inflammation models and provide deep insights into the immunological and molecular interplays between C. jejuni, microbiota and innate immunity in human campylobacteriosis."

We show that in budding yeast resetting of life span occurs during gametogenesis. Gametes (spores) generated by aged cells show the same replicative potential as gametes generated by young cells. Age-associated damage is no longer detectable in mature gametes. Furthermore, transient induction of a transcription factor essential for later stages of gametogenesis extends the replicative life span of aged cells. Our results indicate that gamete formation brings about rejuvenation by eliminating age-induced cellular damage."

https://openalex.org/W2028905073,"Centrosomes organize the bipolar mitotic spindle, and centrosomal defects cause chromosome instability. Protein phosphorylation modulates centrosome function, and we provide a comprehensive map of phosphorylation on intact yeast centrosomes (18 proteins). Mass spectrometry was used to identify 297 phosphorylation sites on centrosomes from different cell cycle stages. We observed different modes of phosphoregulation via specific protein kinases, phosphorylation site clustering, and conserved phosphorylated residues. Mutating all eight cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-directed sites within the core component, Spc42, resulted in lethality and reduced centrosomal assembly. Alternatively, mutation of one conserved Cdk site within γ-tubulin (Tub4-S360D) caused mitotic delay and aberrant anaphase spindle elongation. Our work establishes the extent and complexity of this prominent posttranslational modification in centrosome biology and provides specific examples of phosphorylation control in centrosome function."
https://openalex.org/W2066272135,"The directional flow generated by motile cilia and flagella is critical for many processes, including human development and organ function. Normal beating requires the control and coordination of thousands of dynein motors, and the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) has been identified as an important regulatory node for orchestrating dynein activity. The nexin link appears to be critical for the transformation of dynein-driven, linear microtubule sliding to flagellar bending, yet the molecular composition and mechanism of the N-DRC remain largely unknown. Here, we used proteomics with special attention to protein phosphorylation to analyze the composition of the N-DRC and to determine which subunits may be important for signal transduction. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of WT and mutant flagellar axonemes from Chlamydomonas identified 12 N-DRC-associated proteins, including all seven previously observed N-DRC components. Sequence and PCR analyses identified the mutation responsible for the phenotype of the sup-pf-4 strain, and biochemical comparison with a radial spoke mutant revealed two components that may link the N-DRC and the radial spokes. Phosphoproteomics revealed eight proteins with phosphorylated isoforms for which the isoform patterns changed with the genotype as well as two components that may play pivotal roles in N-DRC function through their phosphorylation status. These data were assembled into a model of the N-DRC that explains aspects of its regulatory function."
https://openalex.org/W1999981342,"Progranulin haplo-insufficiency is a main cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 aggregates. Previous studies have shown that sortilin regulates progranulin trafficking and is a main determinant of progranulin level in the brain. In this study, we mapped the binding site between progranulin and sortilin. Progranulin binds to the beta-propeller region of sortilin through its C-terminal tail. The C-terminal progranulin fragment is fully sufficient for sortilin binding and progranulin C-terminal peptide displaces progranulin binding to sortilin. Deletion of the last 3 residues of progranulin (QLL) abolishes its binding to sortilin and also sortilin dependent regulation of progranulin trafficking. Since progranulin haplo-insufficiency results in FTLD, these results may provide important insights into future studies of progranulin trafficking and signaling and progranulin based therapy for FTLD."
https://openalex.org/W2009811887,"Based on its selective cell surface expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1 has recently emerged as a promising target for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). To further assess the suitability of ROR1 for targeted therapy of CLL and MCL, a panel of mAbs was generated and its therapeutic utility was investigated.A chimeric rabbit/human Fab library was generated from immunized rabbits and selected by phage display. Chimeric rabbit/human Fab and IgG1 were investigated for their capability to bind to human and mouse ROR1, to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and internalization, and to agonize or antagonize apoptosis using primary CLL cells from untreated patients as well as MCL cell lines. A panel of mAbs demonstrated high affinity and specificity for a diverse set of epitopes that involve all three extracellular domains of ROR1, are accessible on the cell surface, and mediate internalization. The mAb with the highest affinity and slowest rate of internalization was found to be the only mAb that mediated significant, albeit weak, ADCC. None of the mAbs mediated CDC. Alone, they did not enhance or inhibit apoptosis.Owing to its relatively low cell surface density, ROR1 may be a preferred target for armed rather than naked mAbs. Provided is a panel of fully sequenced and thoroughly characterized anti-ROR1 mAbs suitable for conversion to antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins, chimeric antigen receptors, and other armed mAb entities for preclinical and clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2075251669,"Dacarbazine (DTIC) is the treatment of choice for metastatic melanoma, but its response in patients remains very poor. Ceramide has been shown to be a death effector and to play an important role in regulating cancer cell growth upon chemotherapy. Among ceramidases, the enzymes that catabolize ceramide, acid ceramidase (aCDase) has been implicated in cancer progression. Here we show that DTIC elicits a time- and dose-dependent decrease of aCDase activity and an increase of intracellular ceramide levels in human A375 melanoma cells. The loss of enzyme activity occurred as a consequence of reactive oxygen species-dependent activation of cathepsin B-mediated degradation of aCDase. These events preceded autophagic features and loss of cell viability. Down-regulation of acid but not neutral or alkaline ceramidase 2 resulted in elevated levels of ceramide and sensitization to the toxic effects of DTIC. Conversely, inducible overexpression of acid but not neutral ceramidase reduced ceramide levels and conferred resistance to DTIC. In conclusion, we report that increased levels of ceramide, due to enhanced degradation of aCDase, are in part responsible for the cell death effects of DTIC. These results suggest that down-regulation of aCDase alone or in combination with DTIC may represent a useful tool in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer that originates from melanocytes, the melanin-producing cells located in the basal layer of the epidermis. The incidence of melanoma has been increasing over decades, especially among fair-skinned people (1Gandini S. Sera F. Cattaruzza M.S. Pasquini P. Zanetti R. Masini C. Boyle P. Melchi C.F. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2040-2059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Early-stage melanoma can be readily cured by surgical excision of the primary lesion, but advanced melanoma, often a metastatic disease, has a poor median survival, ranging from 2 to 8 months, with only 5% surviving >5 years (2Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Murray T. Thun M.J. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2008; 58: 71-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10233) Google Scholar). Metastatic melanoma is very resistant to many forms of traditional chemotherapy. To date, dacarbazine (DTIC) 3The abbreviations used are: DTICdacarbazineaCDaseacid ceramidaseAMC7-amino-4-methylcoumarinNACN-acetylcysteineROSreactive oxygen speciesS1Psphingosine 1-phosphatezbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketone. is considered to be the reference single agent for the management of advanced melanoma, with objective tumor responses in ∼15–25% of patients. However, >95% of the responses are partial, with a 6-year median survival of 2% (3Mouawad R. Sebert M. Michels J. Bloch J. Spano J.P. Khayat D. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2010; 74: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Temozolomide is an orally available DTIC analog that has shown efficacy in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors, with the advantage of central nervous system penetration. Temozolomide and DTIC have demonstrated equal efficacy in terms of objective response rate and overall survival for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma (4Middleton M.R. Grob J.J. Aaronson N.

Since the original approval of DTIC in 1975 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, considerable effort has been expended in attempts to improve survival. However, treatments based on the combination of these agents with other cytotoxics or immunotherapy have not resulted in response rates of durable remission, enough to increase the median survival of the patients (3Mouawad R.

Sphingolipids are a complex family of bioactive lipids that play important structural and second messenger roles (5Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Ceramide is the central molecule to both metabolism and signaling of sphingolipids. It has been implicated in several cellular processes like cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell senescence (6Saddoughi S.A. Song P. Ogretmen B. Subcell. Biochem. 2008; 49: 413-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). Therefore, dysregulated ceramide metabolism is linked to numerous human diseases, including cancer (6Saddoughi S.A. Song P. Ogretmen B. Subcell. Biochem. 2008; 49: 413-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, many anticancer agents have been shown to modulate ceramide synthesis by regulating individual components of the de novo pathway. For example, daunorubicin stimulates both de novo ceramide synthesis and sphingomyelin hydrolysis (8Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 9Jaffrézou J.P. Levade T. Bettaïeb A. Andrieu N. Bezombes C. Maestre N. Vermeersch S. Rousse A. Laurent G.

Manfait M. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 20: 855-863PubMed Google Scholar), and etoposide enhances serine palmitoyltransferase in leukemia cells (11Perry D.K. Carton J. Shah A.K. Meredith F. Uhlinger D.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Other cytotoxic drugs such as cytosine arabinoside are able to activate neutral sphingomyelinase to generate ceramide in leukemic cells (12Strum J.C. Small G.W. Pauig S.B. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15493-15497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the actions of ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), generated from ceramide hydrolysis and further phosphorylation of the resulting sphingosine, is known as a regulator of cell proliferation, inflammation, vasculogenesis, and resistance to apoptotic cell death (13Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Hence, the relative balance between ceramide and S1P has been proposed to influence the cell fate in response to cytotoxic stimuli. Ceramidases are the enzymes that catalyze ceramide hydrolysis to release sphingosine and the corresponding fatty acid. According to their pH optima of activity, acid, neutral, and alkaline ceramidases can be distinguished (14Mao C. Obeid L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Among these ceramidases, acid ceramidase (aCDase), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, appears to play an important role in cancer progression. For instance, aCDase is up-regulated in prostate cancer (15Seelan R.S. Qian C. Yokomizo A. Bostwick D.G. Smith D.I. Liu W.

In addition, down-regulation of ASAH1 using specific siRNA reduced tumor growth in an in vivo model of hepatocellular carcinoma (20Morales A. París R. Villanueva A. Llacuna L. Garcia-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given that cytotoxic drugs regulate the metabolism of sphingolipids, we have explored the effects of DTIC in human A375 melanoma cells. This work shows for the first time that DTIC promotes aCDase degradation in lysosomes and the subsequent increase of intracellular ceramide levels in A375 cells. We also demonstrate that the modulation of aCDase expression affects the sensitivity of these tumor cells to DTIC treatment. The human melanoma cell line A375 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The A375 cell line that stably expresses the tetracycline repressor was obtained by transfection of the pcDNA6/TR vector with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and further selection with blasticidin (3 μg/ml). The cDNA of ASAH1 was subcloned into pcDNA5/TO, and the sequence was verified. This vector was transfected into pcDNA6/TR A375 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 to obtain a new cell line (A375 ASAH1) that overexpresses ASAH1 under the control of a tetracycline/doxycycline-responsive promoter. The antibiotic selection of this new cell line was performed with blasticidin (3 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (250 μg/ml). Ectopic expression of ASAH1 was induced with doxycycline at 1 μg/ml for 24 h before treatment with DTIC. Cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in DMEM medium containing Glutamax (Invitrogen). The cDNA coding for human ASAH1 was kindly provided by Dr. J. A. Medin (University of Toronto, Canada). The pcDNA6/TR and pcDNA5/TO plasmids belong to the T-RExTM system from Invitrogen. The pEGFP-LC3 vector was kindly provided by Dr. T. Yoshimori (Osaka University, Japan). siRNA against ASAH1, Atg7, and emerin (ON-TARGETplus SMART pool) were purchased from Dharmacon Thermo Scientific, and their transfection was performed at 10 nm using the Hi Perfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Dacarbazine, doxycycline, N-acetylcysteine, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and monodansylcadaverine were supplied from Sigma, blasticidin and hygromycin B were from Invitrogen, CA074-Me was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences, z-VAD-fmk was from Bachem, Ac-DEVD-AMC from Alexis, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide substrate was purchased from Euromedex. Enzyme substrates included Rbm14-12 (aCDase substrate) produced in our laboratories (21Bedia C. Camacho L. Abad J.L. Fabriàs G. Levade T. J.

Sphingolipid extracts, fortified with internal standards (N-dodecanoylsphingosine, N-dodecanoylglucosylsphingosine, d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine, N-dodecanoylsphingosylphosphorylcholine, and C17 d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, 0.2 nmol each), were prepared as described (22Merrill Jr., A.H. Sullards M.C. Allegood J.C. Kelly S. Wang E. Methods. 2005; 36: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and analyzed. The LC/MS analysis consisted of a Waters Aquity UPLC system connected to a Waters LCT Premier orthogonal accelerated time of flight mass spectrometer (Waters), operated in positive electrospray ionization mode. Full scan spectra from 50 to 1500 Da were acquired, and individual spectra were summed to produce data points each of 0.2 s. Mass accuracy and reproducibility were maintained by using an independent reference spray via the LockSpray interference. The analytical column was a 100 × 2.1-mm inner diameter, 1.7-μm C8 Acquity UPLC bridged ethylene hybrid (Waters). The two mobile phases were phase A: MeOH/H2O/HCOOH (74:25:1, v/v) and phase B: MeOH/HCOOH (99:1, v/v); both contained 5 mm ammonium formate. The column was held at 30 °C. Quantification was carried out using the extracted ion chromatogram of each compound, using 50 mDa windows. The linear dynamic range was determined by injecting standard mixtures. Positive identification of compounds was based on the accurate mass measurement with an error of <5 ppm and its LC retention time, compared with that of a standard (±2%). For lysosphingolipid quantification, analysis of the extracts was performed by LC/MS/MS with a system consisting of a Waters Alliance 2690 LC pump equipped with an autosampler and connected to a Quattro LC triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer from Micromass (Manchester, UK). Separation was achieved on a Purospher STAR-RP-18 column (125 × 2 mm, 5 μm) (Merck, Darmstadt). The two mobile phases were phase A and phase B as described above. A gradient was programmed: 0.0 min, 50% B; 2 min, 50% B; 7 min, 100% B; 17 min, 100% B; 19 min, 50% B; and 26 min, 50% B. The flow rate was 0.3 ml min−1. MS/MS detection was performed with an electrospray interface operating in the positive ion mode acquiring the following selected reaction monitoring transitions: C17 d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, 368–252, collision energy 18 eV; and S1P, 380–264 Da, collision energy 16 eV. To measure aCDase activity, cultured cells were collected and washed twice with PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of a cold 0.2 m sucrose solution and then sonicated. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was collected and used for protein quantification (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217317) Google Scholar) to work with equal amounts of protein. The enzymatic assay was carried out in 96-well plates (21Bedia C. Camacho L. Abad J.L. Fabriàs G. Levade T. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 3542-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Each well contained a mixture of 74.5 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.5 μl of a 4 mm Rbm14-12 substrate solution in ethanol, and a fixed amount of protein (20 μg) in a volume of 25 μl of a 0.2 m sucrose solution. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of methanol and 100 μl of a 2.5 mg/ml NaIO4 fresh solution in 100 mm glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.6, in each well. The plate was protected from light for 2 h, and then the released fluorescence was quantified using a microplate fluorescence reader (λex, 360 nm; λem, 446 nm). The amount of umbelliferone released was calculated from the fluorescence intensity by using calibration curves with umbelliferone in the range from 0 to 3000 pmol. The acid β-galactosidase activity was determined on the same cell lysates used for aCDase activity assay. This assay is based on a published fluorometric method (24Wenger D.A.C.W. Hommes F.A. Techniques in Diagnostic Human Biochemical Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Willey-Liss, Inc., New York1991: 587-617Google Scholar) with some modifications to adapt it to the 96-well plate format. Briefly, each well contained 20 μl of a 0.5 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 20 μl of a 20 mm EDTA solution, 40 μl of a 3 mm solution of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 1.2 mm), 10 μl of lysate, and 10 μl of ultrapure water. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of a 100 mm glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.6. The fluorescence released was quantified using a microplate fluorescence reader (λex, 360 nm; λem, 446 nm) as described above. The cathepsin B activity was measured using the fluorogenic substrate z-Arg-Arg-AMC. The assay was carried out in 96-well plates. The incubation mixture of each well consisted of 95 μl of 0.4 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 30 μg of protein extracts prepared as described above, and 5 μl of a 1 mm ethanolic solution of the substrate (final concentration, 50 μm). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of a 100 mm glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.6. The amount of the released product was measured by fluorometry as described for the above assays. Cell viability was determined by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions. A375 cells stably transfected with pEGFP-LC3 vector were treated at different times with DTIC, and then stained with monodansylcadaverine (50 μm) for 30 min and fixed with paraformaldehyde. Cells were examined under a fluorescence Leica DMR microscope equipped with a digital camera. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and further lysed by brief sonication. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected, and protein content was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Proteins (30–50 μg of cell lysates) were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. After transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore), immunoblotting was performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-acid ceramidase antibody (a kind gift from Dr. K. Sandhoff, Bonn, Germany), rabbit anti-SphK1 (Sigma), rabbit anti-β-actin, or rabbit anti-Atg7 (Cell Signaling). Density of the bands was quantified with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Non-confluent melanoma cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and treated with DNase (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by automated gel electrophoresis (Experion, Bio-Rad). RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) and used as a template for quantitative PCR. The reactions were done in duplicate on the StepOne instrument (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR kit and primer assay (QuantiTect, Qiagen). Results were quantified using the system software. mRNA of TATA box binding protein, transferrin receptor, and β-actin were analyzed for normalization. Cells were washed and harvested by trypsinization. The analysis of LC3-EGFP fluorescence was assessed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) cytometer as described previously (25Shvets E. Elazar Z. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity observed on the FL1-H histogram inversely correlated with autophagic flux. Means ± S.E. were calculated in the different assays. Statistical significance between groups was assessed using the Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. We first investigated the effects of DTIC treatment on the cellular levels of sphingolipids. To do this, A375 melanoma cells were treated with DTIC at 100 μg/ml for 48 h, the concentration corresponding to its IC50 in vitro (see supplementary Table S1). Mass spectrometry analysis of the lipidic extracts revealed an increase of ceramide levels, especially those of 16- and 18-carbon chain length (∼1.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively) (Fig. 1, A and B). This is particularly relevant in the case of C16:0 ceramide, because it is one of the major ceramide species in mammalian cells. 4A significant increase in total ceramide levels was observed after quantification using the DAG kinase method (984 ± 161 pmol/mg of protein in DTIC-treated cells versus 500 ± 144 pmol/mg of protein in control cells; n = 7; p < 0.001). Also, we found that sphingosine and S1P levels were reduced by 50 and 75%, respectively (Fig. 1C). Whereas glucosylceramide species were slightly increased, ∼1.3-fold, sphingomyelin levels remained unaltered (data not shown). These observations on the sphingolipid profile focused our attention to ceramidases, because these degrading enzymes are responsible for the catabolism of ceramides to sphingosine. We centered our efforts on the study of aCDase, because several studies have connected this enzyme to cancer promotion and resistance to therapy, particularly of prostate cancer (15Seelan R.S.

Likewise, a bioinformatic approach has found aCDase to be among the most important marker genes for melanoma (26Musumarra G. Barresi V. Condorelli D.F. Scirè S. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These precedents and the above results of mass spectrometry led us to explore a possible relationship between this enzyme and the sensitivity of A375 melanoma cells to DTIC. Interestingly, time-course experiments revealed a time-dependent decrease of aCDase activity after treatment with DTIC. After 48 h of treatment, cells lost ∼80% of aCDase basal levels (Fig. 2A). Cell viability was also reduced with time after treatment, being significantly affected from 16 h onwards, when aCDase activity was reduced by 50% (Fig. 2B). Also, the degradation of aCDase activity showed to be dose-dependent with a loss of >50% already at a 25 μg/ml concentration (Fig. 2C). However, under the same conditions, lysosomal β-galactosidase activity was not decreased, meaning that the integrity of lysosomes was not compromised. Western blot experiments revealed a lower aCDase protein content in cells treated with DTIC, 5Any molecular mass species smaller than 13 kDa were not observed, possibly due to the lack of recognition of such fragments by the antibody used. whereas levels of sphingosine kinase 1 remained unchanged (Fig. 2D). However, levels of ASAH1 transcripts after treatment remained unchanged (data not shown), thus pointing to a post-transcriptional degradation of aCDase. Of note, aCDase activity was not decreased in A375 cells treated with cytotoxic concentrations of cisplatin (80 μm, data not shown), meaning that aCDase degradation is not a common response to cytotoxics. To investigate the mechanism responsible for aCDase degradation, A375 cells were preincubated with protease inhibitors, including the cysteine and serine protease inhibitor leupeptin and the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A. As a result, we observed that only leupeptin was able to protect cells from aCDase degradation elicited by low doses of DTIC (Fig. 3A). Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease that has been shown to be implicated in aCDase degradation after treatment with desipramine (27Elojeimy S. Holman D.H. Liu X. El-Zawahry A. Villani M. Cheng J.C. Mahdy A. Zeidan Y. Bielwaska A. Hannun Y.A. Norris J.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, this enzyme was tested as a possible cause for aCDase degradation. Preincubation of A375 melanoma cells with the cathepsin B inhibitor CA074-Me resulted in a near total protection of aCDase activity from DTIC-induced degradation (Fig. 3B). Next, we wanted to explore whether aCDase degradation was the consequence of caspase activation, as the activity of effector caspases measured using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC increased at 48 h after DTIC treatment (data not shown). To check this, A375 melanoma cells were preincubated with z-VAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor, and then treated with DTIC. We observed that aCDase activity was not protected from degradation, meaning that caspases were not involved in this activity loss (Fig. 3C). Cellular metabolism of DTIC is believed to lead to the production of ROS in the cytoplasm giving H2O2, that diffuses to the lysosomes causing cell damage (28Pourahmad J. Amirmostofian M. Kobarfard F. Shahraki J. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2009; 65: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Also, it has been reported that temozolomide is able to induce autophagy in cells (29Kanzawa T. Germano I.M. Komata T. Ito H. Kondo Y. Kondo S. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), although the relationship between production of ROS, lysosomal damage, and autophagy has not been clarified yet for DTIC. To investigate the role of ROS in aCDase degradation, possibly through cathepsin B activation, we preincubated A375 cells with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione, a major intracellular antioxidant. As shown in Fig. 4A, NAC protected A375 cells from aCDase degradation, triggered by low doses of DTIC (from 5 to 25 μg/ml). As a consequence, after DTIC treatment at 10 μg/ml, the increase of ceramide levels was only 20% to that of cells not preincubated with NAC (data not shown). Regarding cathepsin B activity, a considerable increase of its activity was observed after DTIC treatment, which peaked at 24 h, and was completely abrogated in the presence of NAC (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that the production of ROS after DTIC treatment leads to aCDase degradation, probably through cathepsin B activation. Cell death after treatment with low doses of DTIC was also attenuated in the presence of NAC (Fig. 4C). Next, DTIC-induced autophagy of A375 melanoma cells was investigated. It was assessed by flow cytometry of A375 cells stably transfected with pEGFP-LC3. This method is based on the fact that the EGFP molecule is sensitive to low pH, making its fluorescence disappear when LC3-EGFP is delivered into lysosomes, i.e. when autophagolysosomes are formed (25Shvets E. Elazar Z. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using this method we observed that, although A375 cells lost 10% of fluorescence intensity under DTIC treatment, preincubation with NAC totally prevented the fluorescence loss (data not shown). Thus, protection by NAC from DTIC-induced autophagy is mediated by ROS formation. However, it was still unclear whether the DTIC-induced loss of aCDase activity was involved in the autophagy and the ensuing cell death observed. To further explore these mechanisms, the onset of autophagy was assessed by EGFP-LC3 dot formation and monodansylcadaverine staining (30Vázquez C.L. Colombo M.I. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). When A375 melanoma cells were treated with DTIC (100 μg/ml), we observed that the punctuate structures, corresponding to autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes, appeared between 8 and 16 h (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, occurrence of the autophagic features was concomitant to the decrease of aCDase activity after DTIC treatment (Fig. 2A). Also, C16:0 and C18:0 ceramide levels, assessed by mass spectrometry, started to increase between 8 and 16 h after treatment (Fig. 5B). These observations suggest that there is a temporal relationship between aCDase degradation, ceramide accumulation and the onset of autophagy. To investigate whether aCDase degradation was a consequence of the autophagic process triggered by DTIC, A375 melanoma cells were transfected with an siRNA against Atg7, to inhibit autophagy (31Eisenberg-Lerner A. Bialik S. Simon H.U. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 966-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Despite efficient Atg7 silencing, aCDase degradation was still taking place, meaning that aCDase degradation likely occurred upstream of autophagy induced by DTIC (Fig. 5C). To fur"

In the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, GlcNAc stimulates hyphal cell morphogenesis, virulence genes, and the genes needed to catabolize GlcNAc. Previous studies on the GlcNAc transporter (NGT1) indicated that GlcNAc has to be internalized to induce signaling. Therefore, the role of GlcNAc catabolism was examined by deleting the genes required to phosphorylate, deacetylate, and deaminate GlcNAc to convert it to fructose-6-PO(4) (HXK1, NAG1, and DAC1). As expected, the mutants failed to utilize GlcNAc. Surprisingly, GlcNAc inhibited the growth of the nag1Δ and dac1Δ mutants in the presence of other sugars, suggesting that excess GlcNAc-6-PO(4) is deleterious. Interestingly, both hxk1Δ and an hxk1Δ nag1Δ dac1Δ triple mutant could be efficiently stimulated by GlcNAc to form hyphae. These mutants could also be stimulated to express GlcNAc-regulated genes. Because GlcNAc must be phosphorylated by Hxk1 to be catabolized, and also for it to enter the anabolic pathways that form chitin, N-linked glycosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, the mutant phenotypes indicate that GlcNAc metabolism is not needed to induce signaling in C. albicans. Thus, these studies in C. albicans reveal a novel role for GlcNAc in cell signaling that may also regulate critical pathways in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2049699095,"Background Double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a key regulator of the anti-viral innate immune response in mammalian cells. PKR activity is regulated by a 58 kilo Dalton cellular inhibitor (P58IPK), which is present in inactive state as a complex with Hsp40 under normal conditions. In case of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, P58IPK is known to dissociate from Hsp40 and inhibit PKR activation. However the influenza virus component responsible for PKR inhibition through P58IPK activation was hitherto unknown. Principal Findings Human heat shock 40 protein (Hsp40) was identified as an interacting partner of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (IAV NP) using a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies from mammalian cells transfected with IAV NP expressing plasmid. Further, the IAV NP-Hsp40 interaction was validated in mammalian cells infected with various seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza viruses. Cellular localization studies showed that NP and Hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus. During IAV infection in mammalian cells, expression of NP coincided with the dissociation of P58IPK from Hsp40 and decrease PKR phosphorylation. We observed that, plasmid based expression of NP in mammalian cells leads to decrease in PKR phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of NP expression during influenza virus replication led to PKR activation and concomitant increase in eIF2α phosphorylation. Inhibition of NP expression also led to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation, enhanced IFN β production and concomitant reduction of virus replication. Taken together our data suggest that NP is the viral factor responsible for P58IPK activation and subsequent inhibition of PKR-mediated host response during IAV infection. Significance Our findings demonstrate a novel role of IAV NP in inhibiting PKR-mediated anti-viral host response and help us understand P58IPK mediated inhibition of PKR activity during IAV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2094520151,"Demetallation of the homodimeric enzyme Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is known to unleash pronounced dynamic motions in the long active-site loops that comprise almost a third of the folded structure. The resulting apo species, which shows increased propensity to aggregate, stands out as the prime disease precursor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Even so, the detailed structural properties of the apoSOD1 framework have remained elusive and controversial. In this study, we examine the structural interplay between the central apoSOD1 barrel and the active-site loops by simply cutting them off; loops IV and VII were substituted with short Gly-Ala-Gly linkers. The results show that loop removal breaks the dimer interface and leads to soluble, monomeric β-barrels with high structural integrity. NMR-detected nuclear Overhauser effects are found between all of the constituent β-strands, confirming ordered interactions across the whole barrel. Moreover, the breathing motions of the SOD1 barrel are overall insensitive to loop removal and yield hydrogen/deuterium protection factors typical for cooperatively folded proteins (i.e. the active-site loops act as a ""bolt-on"" domain with little dynamic influence on its structural foundation). The sole exceptions are the relatively low protection factors in β-strand 5 and the turn around Gly-93, a hot spot for ALS-provoking mutations, which decrease even further upon loop removal. Taken together, these data suggest that the cytotoxic function of apoSOD1 does not emerge from its folded ground state but from a high energy intermediate or even from the denatured ensemble."
https://openalex.org/W1994890449,"It has long been suggested that the import of nuclease colicins requires protein processing; however it had never been formally demonstrated. Here we show that two RNase colicins, E3 and D, which appropriate two different translocation machineries to cross the outer membrane (BtuB/Tol and FepA/TonB, respectively), undergo a processing step inside the cell that is essential to their killing action. We have detected the presence of the C-terminal catalytic domains of these colicins in the cytoplasm of target bacteria. The same processed forms were identified in both colicin-sensitive cells and in cells immune to colicin because of the expression of the cognate immunity protein. We demonstrate that the inner membrane protease FtsH is necessary for the processing of colicins D and E3 during their import. We also show that the signal peptidase LepB interacts directly with the central domain of colicin D in vitro and that it is a specific but not a catalytic requirement for in vivo processing of colicin D. The interaction of colicin D with LepB may ensure a stable association with the inner membrane that in turn allows the colicin recognition by FtsH. We have also shown that the outer membrane protease OmpT is responsible for alternative and distinct endoproteolytic cleavages of colicins D and E3 in vitro, presumably reflecting its known role in the bacterial defense against antimicrobial peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2000598040,"Background Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders that include primary myelofibrosis (PMF), polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). Although the pathogenesis of MPNs is still incompletely understood, an involvement of the megakaryocyte lineage is a distinctive feature. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed the in vitro megakaryocyte differentiation and proplatelet formation in 30 PMF, 8 ET, 8 PV patients, and 17 healthy controls (CTRL). Megakaryocytes were differentiated from peripheral blood CD34+ or CD45+ cells in the presence of thrombopoietin. Megakaryocyte output was higher in MPN patients than in CTRL with no correlation with the JAK2 V617F mutation. PMF-derived megakaryocytes displayed nuclei with a bulbous appearance, were smaller than ET- or PV-derived megakaryocytes and formed proplatelets that presented several structural alterations. In contrast, ET- and PV-derived megakaryocytes produced more proplatelets with a striking increase in bifurcations and tips compared to both control and PMF. Proplatelets formation was correlated with platelet counts in patient peripheral blood. Patients with pre-fibrotic PMF had a pattern of megakaryocyte proliferation and proplatelet formation that was similar to that of fibrotic PMF and different from that of ET. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, MPNs are associated with high megakaryocyte proliferative potential. Profound differences in megakaryocyte morphology and proplatelet formation distinguish PMF, both fibrotic and prefibrotic, from ET and PV."
https://openalex.org/W2169548225,"Conservation strategies for African elephants would be advanced by resolution of conflicting claims that they comprise one, two, three or four taxonomic groups, and by development of genetic markers that establish more incisively the provenance of confiscated ivory. We addressed these related issues by genotyping 555 elephants from across Africa with microsatellite markers, developing a method to identify those loci most effective at geographic assignment of elephants (or their ivory), and conducting novel analyses of continent-wide datasets of mitochondrial DNA. Results showed that nuclear genetic diversity was partitioned into two clusters, corresponding to African forest elephants (99.5% Cluster-1) and African savanna elephants (99.4% Cluster-2). Hybrid individuals were rare. In a comparison of basal forest ""F"" and savanna ""S"" mtDNA clade distributions to nuclear DNA partitions, forest elephant nuclear genotypes occurred only in populations in which S clade mtDNA was absent, suggesting that nuclear partitioning corresponds to the presence or absence of S clade mtDNA. We reanalyzed African elephant mtDNA sequences from 81 locales spanning the continent and discovered that S clade mtDNA was completely absent among elephants at all 30 sampled tropical forest locales. The distribution of savanna nuclear DNA and S clade mtDNA corresponded closely to range boundaries traditionally ascribed to the savanna elephant species based on habitat and morphology. Further, a reanalysis of nuclear genetic assignment results suggested that West African elephants do not comprise a distinct third species. Finally, we show that some DNA markers will be more useful than others for determining the geographic origins of illegal ivory. These findings resolve the apparent incongruence between mtDNA and nuclear genetic patterns that has confounded the taxonomy of African elephants, affirm the limitations of using mtDNA patterns to infer elephant systematics or population structure, and strongly support the existence of two elephant species in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W1984635551,"In critically ill patients, mechanisms underlying diaphragm muscle remodeling and resultant dysfunction contributing to weaning failure remain unclear. Ventilator-induced modifications as well as sepsis and administration of pharmacological agents such as corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents may be involved. Thus, the objective of the present study was to examine how sepsis, systemic corticosteroid treatment (CS) and neuromuscular blocking agent administration (NMBA) aggravate ventilator-related diaphragm cell and molecular dysfunction in the intensive care unit. Piglets were exposed to different combinations of mechanical ventilation and sedation, endotoxin-induced sepsis, CS and NMBA for five days and compared with sham-operated control animals. On day 5, diaphragm muscle fibre structure (myosin heavy chain isoform proportion, cross-sectional area and contractile protein content) did not differ from controls in any of the mechanically ventilated animals. However, a decrease in single fibre maximal force normalized to cross-sectional area (specific force) was observed in all experimental piglets. Therefore, exposure to mechanical ventilation and sedation for five days has a key negative impact on diaphragm contractile function despite a preservation of muscle structure. Post-translational modifications of contractile proteins are forwarded as one probable underlying mechanism. Unexpectedly, sepsis, CS or NMBA have no significant additive effects, suggesting that mechanical ventilation and sedation are the triggering factors leading to diaphragm weakness in the intensive care unit."
https://openalex.org/W2011330729,"Background Comprehensive smoke-free legislation covering all enclosed public places and workplaces was implemented in England on 1 July 2007. This study examines the impact of this legislation on smoking prevalence, number of cigarettes smoked and location of smoking, controlling for secular trends through the end of 2008. Method and Findings Repeat cross sectional survey using nationally representative data from the Health Survey for England (HSE). In total there are 54,333 respondents from 2003–2008. Logit and linear regression models were used to examine the effect of the legislation on smoking prevalence and the number of cigarettes smoked daily among continuing smokers which took the underlying trend into account. Our finding suggest that smoking prevalence (current smoker) decreased from 25% in 2003 to 21% in 2008 (AOR = 0.96 per year, 95% CI = 0.95–0.98, P<0.01) and the mean number of cigarettes consumed daily by smokers decreased from 14.1 in 2003 to 13.1 in 2008 (coefficient for time trend = −0.28±0.06 SE cig/day per year, P<0.01). After adjusting for these trends the introduction of smoke-free legislation was not associated with additional reductions in smoking prevalence (AOR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.94–1.11, P = 0.596) or daily cigarette use in smokers (0.42±0.28 SE; P = 0.142). The percentage of respondents reporting smoking ‘at work’ and ‘inside pubs or bars’ decreased significantly from 14% to 2% (p<0.001) and from 34% to 2% (p<0.001), respectively, after the legislation. The percentage reporting smoking ‘inside restaurants, cafes, or canteens’ decreased significantly from 9% to 1% (p<0.001) and ‘inside their home’ decreased significantly from 65% to 55% (p<0.01). Conclusion There is widespread compliance with the smoke-free legislation in England, which has led to large drops in indoor smoking in all venues, including at home. Declines in smoking prevalence and consumption continued along existing trends; they did not accelerate during the 18 months immediately following implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2091637792,"DNA repair protects neurons against spontaneous or disease-associated DNA damage. Dysfunctions of this mechanism underlie a growing list of neurodegenerative disorders. The Purkinje cell (PC) degeneration mutation causes the loss of nna1 expression and is associated with the postnatal degeneration of PCs. This PC degeneration dramatically affects nuclear architecture and provides an excellent model to elucidate the nuclear mechanisms involved in a whole array of neurodegenerative disorders. We used immunocytochemistry for histone variants and components of the DNA damage response, an in situ transcription assay, and in situ hybridization for telomeres to analyze changes in chromatin architecture and function. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation of H2AX, a DNA damage signal, and the trimethylation of the histone H4K20, a repressive mark, in extensive domains of genome are epigenetic hallmarks of chromatin in degenerating PCs. These histone modifications are associated with a large scale reorganization of chromatin, telomere clustering, and heterochromatin-induced gene silencing, all of them key factors in PC degeneration. Furthermore, ataxia telangiectasia mutated and 53BP1, two components of the DNA repair pathway, fail to be concentrated in the damaged chromatin compartments, even though the expression levels of their coding genes were slightly up-regulated. Although the mechanism by which Nna1 loss of function leads to PC neurodegeneration is undefined, the progressive accumulation of DNA damage in chromosome territories irreversibly compromises global gene transcription and seems to trigger PC degeneration and death. DNA repair protects neurons against spontaneous or disease-associated DNA damage. Dysfunctions of this mechanism underlie a growing list of neurodegenerative disorders. The Purkinje cell (PC) degeneration mutation causes the loss of nna1 expression and is associated with the postnatal degeneration of PCs. This PC degeneration dramatically affects nuclear architecture and provides an excellent model to elucidate the nuclear mechanisms involved in a whole array of neurodegenerative disorders. We used immunocytochemistry for histone variants and components of the DNA damage response, an in situ transcription assay, and in situ hybridization for telomeres to analyze changes in chromatin architecture and function. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation of H2AX, a DNA damage signal, and the trimethylation of the histone H4K20, a repressive mark, in extensive domains of genome are epigenetic hallmarks of chromatin in degenerating PCs. These histone modifications are associated with a large scale reorganization of chromatin, telomere clustering, and heterochromatin-induced gene silencing, all of them key factors in PC degeneration. Furthermore, ataxia telangiectasia mutated and 53BP1, two components of the DNA repair pathway, fail to be concentrated in the damaged chromatin compartments, even though the expression levels of their coding genes were slightly up-regulated. Although the mechanism by which Nna1 loss of function leads to PC neurodegeneration is undefined, the progressive accumulation of DNA damage in chromosome territories irreversibly compromises global gene transcription and seems to trigger PC degeneration and death. The cell nucleus is highly organized in nuclear compartments mainly involved in transcription and RNA processing. The first level of nuclear compartmentalization includes chromosome territories and the interchromatin compartment. Each interphase chromosome occupies a distinct nuclear subvolume, the chromosome territory, which includes active euchromatin and inactive heterochromatin domains (1Cremer T. Cremer C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). The nonrandom organization of chromosome territories is an essential component of nuclear architecture and function (1Cremer T.

The predominant euchromatic nuclear architecture and the high density of nuclear pores in PCs (3Palay S.L. Chan-Palay V. Cytology and Organization.

Chan-Palay V. Cytology and Organization. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1974Google Scholar). However, the euchromatic open configuration of chromatin and high oxidative phosphorylation activity render PCs particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and genotoxic agents that can induce DNA damage during the life span and in neurodegenerative disorders (8Rutten B.P.

The autosomal recessive mouse mutation known as PC degeneration (pcd) was first reported by Mullen et al. (10Mullen R.J. Eicher E.M. Sidman R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The spontaneous specific neuronal degeneration of PCs starts around postnatal day 20 (P20) and progresses rapidly over a 2-week period, resulting in a massive loss of PCs, together with neurological manifestations of cerebellar ataxia (11Landis S.C. Mullen R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 177: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Wang T. Parris J. Li L. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, retinal photoreceptors, mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, and a discrete population of thalamic neurons undergo late degeneration (13Blanks J.C. Mullen R.J. LaVail M.M. J. Comp.

Neurosci. 2006; 33: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In pcd mice, only the nna1 gene is affected (17Fernandez-Gonzalez A. La Spada A.R. Treadaway J. Higdon J.C. Harris B.S.

This gene encodes a protein, Nna1, with a putative zinc carboxypeptidase domain, which is essential for PC survival (12Wang T. Parris J. Li L. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Wang T. Morgan J.I. Brain Res. 2007; 1140: 26-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nna1 contains nuclear localization signals and is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (19Harris A. Morgan J.I. Pecot M. Soumare A. Osborne A. Soares H.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 578-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The primary function of Nna1 in nuclear processes remains elusive, although it has been suggested that it could play a role in chromatin remodeling, in particular during the motoneuron response to axotomy (19Harris A. Morgan J.I. Pecot M. Soumare A. Osborne A. Soares H.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 578-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the molecular pathways through which the loss of Nna1 function leads to PC degeneration and death in pcd mice remain undefined, recent studies on pcd mice have proposed the participation of several cellular mechanisms in neurodegeneration. They include endoplasmic reticulum stress (20Kyuhou S. Kato N. Gemba H. Neurosci. Lett. 2006; 396: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), decreased peptide turnover downstream from the proteasome (21Berezniuk I. Sironi J. Callaway M.B. Castro L.M. Hirata I.Y. Ferro E.S. Fricker L.D. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), mitochondrial dysfunction and altered proteolytic processing of Nna1-interacting proteins (22Chakrabarti L.

Berciano M.T. Lafarga M. Brain Pathol. 2011; 21: 374-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our previous studies have demonstrated that the pcd mutation induces the formation of nuclear foci of DNA damage in both mitral and Purkinje cells (16Valero J. Berciano M.T. Weruaga E. Lafarga M. Alonso J.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Baltanás F.C. Casafont I. Weruaga E. Alonso J.R. Berciano M.T. Lafarga M. Brain Pathol. 2011; 21: 374-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, defects in DNA repair pathways have recently emerged as a new fundamental pathology linked to several spinocerebellar ataxias, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders (9Brasnjevic I. Hof P.R. Steinbusch H.W. Schmitz C. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Caldecott K.W.

Cell. 2007; 130: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because of their post-mitotic nature and long life span, neurons are particularly prone to the progressive accumulation of unrepaired DNA lesions, which lead to cell death (28Nouspikel T. Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PC degeneration in pcd mice provides a relevant neuronal system for investigating the nuclear mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration. In this study, we analyze the chromatin remodeling that accompanies PC degeneration in pcd mice. In particular, we investigate the epigenetic marks of nucleosomal histones, with their associated changes in transcriptional activity, the structural and spatial reorganization of chromatin and telomeres, and the participation of a DNA damage response (DDR) in the mechanism of PC death. Our results demonstrate that the expression of repressive and DNA damage histone marks is associated with a profound large scale reorganization of chromatin and telomeres. The propagation of DNA damage to extensive domains of the genome irreversibly compromises gene transcription and seems to trigger PC death. C57BL/6J male mice heterozygous for the pcd1J mutated gene were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Because the exact location of the mutation remains unknown, the pcd allele must be associated with a known genetic background. Therefore, male pcd1J mice were mated with DBA/2J females without the pcd mutation. The pcd1J allele was secluded with the genetic background of the C57BL/6J strain, whereas the normal allele was associated with the genetic background of the DBA/2J strain. This differential segregation of both pcd and normal alleles allowed the control and heterozygous mice to be differentiated to expand the colony and genetically typify the experimental and control animals from the same litters. Male pcd mice are infertile (11Landis S.C. Mullen R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 177: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and hence heterozygous mice were crossed to obtain mutant mice under Mendelian inheritance. To identify and avoid the backcross phenomena, we characterized two different microsatellite regions that are located close to the mutated region. DNA was extracted from the tail of the mice, and PCR was performed using the primers proposed for the markers D13Mit250 and D13Mit283 in the web resource of The Jackson Laboratory. The primers used were as follows: D13Mit250, forward, 5′-ACACTCATTTCCATGCACGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGGTCCTCAAATCTCACAAGTAGG-3′; D13Mit283, forward, 5′-GGAAGCAGTCTCCTGCCTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAGAGGTGGCACATGAGGTT-3′. The PCR products of the microsatellite regions D13Mit250 and D13Mit283, which are of different sizes in both the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains, were resolved by electrophoresis in a 3% agarose gel. The animals were kept, handled, and sacrificed in accordance with the directives of Council of the European Communities and current Spanish legislation, and the experiments were approved by the Bioethical Committee of the University of Salamanca. To check the gene expression changes in pcd1J mice, we compared the gene expression profiles of control and pcd mice. Three control and three 20-day-old pcd mice were used. The mice were decapitated, and the vermis of the cerebellum was rapidly removed. Total RNA from the vermis was extracted with TRIzol and was purified using the RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen 74104, Valencia, CA) and RNase-free DNase I digestion. Once the samples of total RNA had been obtained, its integrity and purity were determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The messengers (mRNA) were retrotranscripted to afford cDNA using a commercial kit from Invitrogen (Superscript Choice System for cDNA synthesis). Then the cDNA was placed under in vitro transcription in the presence of biotin-labeled nucleotides to generate cRNA using the IVT kit (Affymetrix, Charleroi, Belgium). cRNAs were degraded by alkaline digestion and were used for hybridizations with commercial chips, but only after having been subjected to a second quality control with an Affymetrix biochip test (TestArray 3). The hybridizations were performed with the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array from Affymetrix. The signal level was calculated using the Robust Microarray Analysis algorithm (29Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8472) Google Scholar), and differential expression was calculated using the significance analysis of microarrays, which includes an estimation of the error by means of the false discovery rate. The Rota-rod test was used to assess the motor coordination of both P20 control (n = 10) and P20 pcd male mice (n = 10). The experiment was always performed under the same conditions, at 9.00 a.m., and in silence to avoid the startle reflex. The animals were initially habituated to the experimental room for 10 min. They were then placed on a rota-rod (Rota-rod LE 8200, Letica Scientific Instruments, Barcelona, Spain), at initial speed of 4 rpm and at an acceleration of 0.6 rpm/s (from 4 to 40 rpm in 10 min). The speed and the time taken to fall were annotated. This procedure was repeated seven times for each animal, with an interval of 20 min each. Values are means ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test were used to compare both groups. Significant differences were considered at ***, p < 0.001. Exogenous DNA damage was induced by x-ray irradiation using an x-ray generator system (MaxiShot-d, Yxlon International) equipped with an x-ray tube working at 200 kV and 4.5 mA. The animals, deeply anesthetized, were placed at 25 cm away from the x-ray source that generated an x-ray beam with an absorbed dose rate of ∼0.9 Gy/min. The body of the animal was protected with a lead tube, exposing only the head, and the beam was focused on the head to avoid adverse effects on the bone marrow, spinal cord, and any other tissues, caused by global animal radiation. The animals were exposed to ionizing radiation for 4 min and 20 s to administer a sublethal dose of 4 Gy, which is a reference dose in DNA damage/repair experiments. For this work, we used wild-type and pcd mice at 3 h post-irradiation (n = 3 for each group). After this period, the animals were sacrificed, and the cerebellar cortex was processed for immunofluorescence studies. After deep anesthesia with a mixture of xylazine (Rompum, Bayer, Kiel, Germany) and ketamine hydrochloride (Imalgene, Merial, Lyon, France), mice were perfused with heparinized saline for 1 min and fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% saturated picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (PB), for 15 min. After perfusion, the vermis of the cerebellum was dissected out and post-fixed in the same solution for 2 h at room temperature. The tissue blocks were washed in PB and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C until they sank. Thirty-μm-thick sagittal sections were cut using a freezing-sliding microtome (Leica Frigomobil, Jung SM 2000, Nussloch, Germany), and the slices were collected in PB and stored at −20 °C in a freezing mixture containing 30% glycerol and 30% polyethylene glycol in PB, until their use. The number of PCs per mm of the PC layer was estimated in sagittal sections of the vermis by means of confocal images of P15, P20, and P25 control and pcd mice (n = 3 animals for each group). The nna1 mutation causes a reduction in the volume of the cerebellum (11Landis S.C. Mullen R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 177: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Valero J. Berciano M.T. Weruaga E. Lafarga M. Alonso J.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and hence the effect of size reduction was considered, and the densities were estimated for this “shrinkage effect” in all comparisons, as described previously (16Valero J. Berciano M.T. Weruaga E. Lafarga M. Alonso J.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The data are expressed according to “corrected” conditions. The percentage of PCs showing DNA damage (calbindin- and γH2AX-positive) was estimated in comparable sagittal sections of the vermis from P20 control (n = 3) and P20 pcd mice (n = 3). A minimum of 300 PCs for each wild-type and pcd animal group was examined. Statistical analyses were carried out using one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test to compare both groups. Significant differences were considered at *, p < 0.05, and **, p < 0.01. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Cryo-cut sections from the vermis of control and mutant mice of 15, 20, and 25 days of age were treated with 1% NaBH4 in PB for 20 min at room temperature as described previously (30Weruaga-Prieto E. Eggli P. Celio M.R. Glia. 1996; 16: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), rinsed in PB (three times for 10 min), and incubated for 1 h in blocking serum (5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100). The primary rabbit polyclonal anti-calbindin antibody (1:7,000; Swant, Switzerland) was incubated in the same solution overnight at 4 °C. Cy3-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; The Jackson Laboratory) was then applied for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, mounted, and coverslipped with antifade solution. The resulting material was examined with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). Squash preparations of PCs from fragments of the cerebellum were obtained as described below. This technique provides an excellent preservation of neuronal perikarya and allows the examination of the spatial organization of nuclear compartments in the whole neuronal nucleus by direct examination of samples or with confocal microscopy (31Pena E. Berciano M.T. Fernández R. Ojeda J.L. Lafarga M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 430: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The animals were perfused with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The vermis was removed and post-fixed in the same solution for 20 min at room temperature. The small blocks containing the PC layer were isolated and cut into small fragments. Each cerebellar portion was transferred to a drop of PBS on a siliconized slide (SuperFrostPlus, Menzel-Gläser, Germany). A coverslip was then applied to the top of the slide, and the tissue was squashed by mechanical pressure with a histological needle to dissociate neuronal perikarya. The preparation was then frozen in dry ice, and the coverslip was removed using a razor blade. With this procedure, most Purkinje neurons remained adhered to the slide. Cell samples were then sequentially processed in 96% ethanol at 4 °C for 10 min and PBS at 4 °C. Finally, the samples were stored at 4 °C until use. To perform immunocytochemical studies of the dissociated PCs, the samples were sequentially treated with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 15 min and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min. Then they were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, incubated for 45 min in the specific secondary antibody conjugated with FITC or Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), rinsed in PBS, and counterstained with propidium iodide (1:2,000) for 15 min. Double immunofluorescence experiments were also carried out. Finally, the samples were mounted with the Vectashield antifade medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). They were examined with a laser confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) using a 63× plan-apochromatic objective (1.4 NA) and argon ion (488 nm) and HeNe (543 nm) lasers. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-53BP1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO); anti-ATM pS1981 (Rockland, PA); anti-lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-histone H4k20me3 (Upstate); and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-γH2AX (Upstate). Active transcription sites were labeled by the incorporation of 5′-FU into nascent RNA, as reported previously (35Fernandez-Capetillo O. Lee A. Nussenzweig M. Nussenzweig A. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Briefly, under anesthesia (pentobarbital 60 mg/kg) mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 5′-FU (Sigma) at doses of 5 μl/g of a stock solution of 0.4 m 5′-FU in 0.9% saline. The mice were killed at 60 min post-injection. The animals were fixed by perfusion with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in HPEM buffer (2× HPEM: 60 mm Hepes, 130 mm Pipes, 20 mm EGTA, and 4 mm MgCl2·6H2O) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The vermis were removed, post-fixed in the same solution for 20 min, washed in HPEM buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and cut into small fragments. Mechanical PC dissociation was performed as described previously. Then the samples were sequentially treated with proteinase K (0.25 μg/ml in 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8) for 1 min at 25 °C, 0.1 m glycine in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 min, and 0.01% Tween 20 in PBS for 5 min. The incorporation of 5′-FU into nascent RNA was detected with a mouse monoclonal (clone BU-33) anti-BrdU antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:50 in PBS (overnight at 4 °C). Then the samples were washed with 0.01% Tween 20 in PBS, incubated for 45 min with an anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), washed in PBS, and mounted with the Vectashield antifade medium. Some samples were either counterstained with propidium iodide or processed for a double labeling with immunofluorescence. An in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) was employed to detect apoptotic bodies. Dissociated Purkinje neurons were obtained as described previously. Then they were rinsed in PBS (three times for 10 min) and permeabilized at room temperature for 30 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS. Dissociated PCs were incubated at 37 °C with the TUNEL reaction mixture containing Cy3-conjugated terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and nucleotide mixture for 45 min. The samples were then washed with PBS and mounted with antifade solution. TUNEL staining was also conjugated with the immunocytochemistry technique. In this case, the best resolution was obtained by performing the immunocytochemistry before the TUNEL assay. The percentage of apoptotic PCs (calbindin- and TUNEL-positive) was determined in squash preparations of the vermis in both control (n = 3) and pcd P20 mice (n = 3). At least 100 PCs per animal were counted. Values are means ± S.D. Three controls and three pcd 15- and 20-day-old mice were used to analyze the ultrastructure of PCs. Mice were perfused with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The cerebellum was removed, and the vermis was isolated. 500-μm-thick sagittal sections were obtained using a vibratome (Leica). Then the sections were rinsed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide diluted in double-strength buffer (containing 3.5% dextrose in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Araldite (Durcupan, Fluka, Switzerland). Ultrathin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate were examined with a Philips EM-208 electron microscope operated at 60 kV. For immunoelectron microscopy, the animals were perfused with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Small tissue fragments of the vermis were washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of methanol at −20 °C, embedded in Lowicryl K4M at −20 °C, and polymerized with ultraviolet irradiation. Ultrathin sections were mounted on nickel grids and sequentially incubated with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 15 min, 5% BSA in PBS for 30 min, and the primary mouse monoclonal anti-γH2AX antibody (1:25) and rabbit polyclonal anti-H4K20me3 (1:50), both diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1% BSA and 0.1 m glycine for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, the sections were incubated with the goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to 10-nm gold particles (BioCell, UK; diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Following immunogold labeling, the grids were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and examined with a Phillips EM208 electron microscope operated at 60 kV. As controls, ultrathin sections were treated as described above but with the primary antibodies omitted. Samples of dissociated PCs were processed for in situ hybridization of telomeric DNA using the Cy3-labeled telomere-specific peptide nucleic acid probe (DakoCytomation, Denmark). Slides were placed in deionized water (3 min) and 70, 96, and 100% ethanol for 1 min each and then air-dried. Ten microliters of a fluorescent Cy3-labeled telomere-specific probe was applied to each sample, which was then covered with an 18 × 18-mm coverslip, and denatured on a heat block at 80 °C for 3 min. The slides were then moved to a dark humidity chamber at room temperature for 2 h. Following this, the coverslips were carefully removed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST), and the slides were washed with 70% formamide in TBST. They were then dehydrated in an alcohol series, air-dried, and mounted with Vectashield. For quantitative analysis of telomeres, squash preparations of PCs from both P20 control (n = 50) and mutant mice (n = 50) were double-stained for telomeric DNA and DAPI. Serial sections of whole neuronal nuclei, with an interval of 0.3 μm between optical sections, were captured with a laser confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP, Germany). The number of telomeric spots and their diameter were estimated using ImageJ (Version 1.38x, Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health). Values are means ± S.D. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student's t test to compare both experimental groups. For the preparation of nuclear extracts from the cerebellar vermis of wild-type and pcd mice, tissue samples were lysed using a pellet-pestle motor (Sigma) on ice in cold extraction buffer RSB (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (HaltTM protease and phosphatase inhibitor single use mixture, Thermo Scientific) and incubated for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation (5 min at 1,000 rpm), the pellets were washed with RSB buffer (without Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was discarded.

A number of reports have suggested that cancer patients who smoke while receiving treatment have lower rates of response and decreased efficacy of cancer therapies.In this study, we investigated the effect of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) vapor on cisplatin toxicity in urothelial cell lines SV-HUC-1 and SCaBER cells. We showed that chronic exposure to CSC vapor induced cisplatin resistance in both cell lines. In addition, we found that the expression of mitochondrial-resident protein adenylate kinase-3 (AK3) is decreased by CSC vapor. We further observed that chronic CSC vapor-exposed cells displayed decreased cellular sensitivity to cisplatin, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and increased basal cellular ROS levels compared to unexposed cells. Re-expression of AK3 in CSC vapor-exposed cells restored cellular sensitivity to cisplatin. Finally, CSC vapor increased the growth of the tumors and also curtail the response of tumor cells to cisplatin chemotherapy in vivo.The current study provides evidence that chronic CSC vapor exposure affects AK3 expression and renders the cells resistant to cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W2063272966,"Numerous studies have described the process of senescence associated with accumulation of oxidative damage, mutations and decline in proliferative potential. Although the changes observed in senescent cells are likely to result in significant phenotypic alterations, the studies on consequences of endothelial senescence, especially in relation to aging-associated diseases, are scarce. We have analyzed effects of senescence on the functions of endothelial cells relevant to the development of atherosclerosis including angiogenesis, adhesion, apoptosis and inflammation. In the course of progressing through the passages, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) displayed significant increase in size (+36% passage 12 vs. passage 4 , p<0.001) and reduction in both basal and VEGF-stimulated tube formation. The analysis of a scavenger receptor LOX-1, a key molecule implicated in atherogenesis, revealed a significant decline of its message (mRNA) and protein content in senescent endothelial cells (−33%) and in aortas of 50 wk (vs. 5 wk) old mice (all p<0.01). These effects were accompanied by a marked reduction of the basal expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Compared to early cultures, late passage HUVECs also exhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB (p65) and reciprocal shifts in BAX and BCL2 protein content resulting in almost 2-fold increase in BAX/BCL2 ratio and 3-fold increase in apoptotic response to TNFα exposure (p<0.04). These changes in senescent endothelial cells are suggestive of aberrant responses to physiological stimuli resulting in a less permissive environment for tissue remodeling and progression of diseases requiring angiogenesis and cell adhesion in elderly, possibly, mediated by LOX-1."
https://openalex.org/W1982877290,"Background Phosphorus is one of the macronutrients essential for plant growth and development. The acquisition and translocation of phosphate are pivotal processes of plant growth. In a large number of plants, phosphate uptake by roots and translocation within the plant are presumed to occur via a phosphate/proton cotransport mechanism. Principal Findings We cloned two cDNAs from soybean (Glycine max), GmPT1 and GmPT2, which show homology to the phosphate/proton cotransporter PHO84 from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The amino acid sequence of the products predicted from GmPT1 and GmPT2 share 61% and 63% identity, respectively, with the PHO84 in amino acid sequence. The deduced structure of the encoded proteins revealed 12 membrane-spanning domains with a central hydrophilic region. The molecular mass values are ∼58.7 kDa for GmPT1 and ∼58.6 kDa for GmPT2. Transiently expressed GFP–protein fusions provide direct evidence that the two Pi transporters are located in the plasma membrane. Uptake of radioactive orthophosphate by the yeast mutant MB192 showed that GmPT1 and GmPT2 are dependent on pH and uptake is reduced by the addition of uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. The Km for phosphate uptake by GmPT1 and GmPT2 is 6.65 mM and 6.63 mM, respectively. A quantitative real time RT-PCR assay indicated that these two genes are expressed in the roots and shoots of seedlings whether they are phosphate-deficient or not. Deficiency of phosphorus caused a slight change of the expression levels of GmPT1 and GmPT2. Conclusions The results of our experiments show that the two phosphate transporters have low affinity and the corresponding genes are constitutively expressed. Thereby, the two phosphate transporters can perform translocation of phosphate within the plant."

Here we altered phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol synthesis for a short period of time in CHO cells to evaluate the changes in DAG and its effects in membrane trafficking at the Golgi. We found that cellular DAG rapidly increased when PC synthesis was inhibited at the non-permissive temperature for the rate-limiting step of PC synthesis in CHO-MT58 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2055421563,"Macrophages play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. These cells express cathepsin L (CatL), a cysteine protease that has been implicated in atherogenesis and the associated arterial remodeling. In addition, macrophages highly express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, a transcription factor that regulates numerous genes important for lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, for glucose homeostasis, and inflammation. Hence, PPARγ might affect macrophage function in the context of chronic inflammation such as atherogenesis. In the present study, we examined the effect of PPARγ activation on the expression of CatL in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM). Activation of PPARγ by the specific agonist GW929 concentration-dependently increased the levels of CatL mRNA and protein in HMDM. By promoter analysis, we identified a functional PPAR response element-like sequence that positively regulates CatL expression. In addition, we found that PPARγ-induced CatL promotes the degradation of Bcl2 without affecting Bax protein levels. Consistently, degradation of Bcl2 could be prevented by a specific CatL inhibitor, confirming the causative role of CatL. PPARγ-induced CatL was found to decrease autophagy through reduction of beclin 1 and LC3 protein levels. The reduction of these proteins involved in autophagic cell death was antagonized either by the CatL inhibitor or by CatL knockdown. In conclusion, our data show that PPARγ can specifically induce CatL, a proatherogenic protease, in HMDM. In turn, CatL inhibits autophagy and induces apoptosis. Thus, the proatherogenic effect of CatL could be neutralized by apoptosis, a beneficial phenomenon, at least in the early stages of atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2088343196,"One of the master regulators of adipogenesis and macrophage function is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Here, we report that a deficiency of β-arrestin-1 expression affects PPARγ-mediated expression of lipid metabolic genes and inflammatory genes. Further mechanistic studies revealed that β-arrestin-1 interacts with PPARγ. β-Arrestin-1 suppressed the formation of a complex between PPARγ and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor-α through its direct interaction with PPARγ. The interaction of β-arrestin-1 with PPARγ repressed PPARγ/9-cis-retinoic acid receptor-α function but promoted PPARγ/nuclear receptor corepressor function in PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis and inflammatory gene expression. Consistent with these results, a deficiency of β-arrestin-1 binding to PPARγ abolished its suppression of PPARγ-dependent adipogenesis and inflammatory responses. These results indicate that the regulation of PPARγ by β-arrestin-1 is critical. Furthermore, in vivo expression of β-arrestin-1 (but not the binding-deficient mutant) significantly repressed adipogenesis, macrophage infiltration, and diet-induced obesity and improved glucose tolerance and systemic insulin sensitivity. Therefore, our findings not only reveal a molecular mechanism for the modulation of obesity by β-arrestin-1 but also suggest a potential tactical approach against obesity and its associated metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2046284605,"Multiglycosides of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f (GTW), a Chinese herb-derived medicine used as a remedy for rheumatoid arthritis, are considered to be a reversible anti-fertility drug affecting the mammalian spermatids. However, the mechanism behind this effect is still unknown. To study the possible mechanism behind the impact of GTW on spermatogenesis, we administered 4 groups of 4-week-old male mice with different doses of GTW. We found a dose-dependent decrease in the number of germ cells after 40 days of GTW treatment, and an increase in apoptotic cells from the low-dose to the high-dose group. During this same period the dimethylated level of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) in GTW-treated testes germ cells declined. Additionally, spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) from 6-day-old mice were isolated to evaluate the possible effect of GTW or triptolide on development of SSCs. We found a significantly higher incidence of apoptosis and lower dimethylation level of H3K9me2 in the SSCs of GTW or triptolide treatment than in controls. Thus, these data suggest that the GTW-induced apoptosis might be responsible for the fertility impairment in mice. This damage could be traced back to the early stages of spermatogenesis. GTW also affected the epigenetic modification of H3K9 in spermatogenesis. Molecular dynamics simulation suggested that triptolide and dimethylated or trimethylated H3K9 might have similar interaction mechanisms with EED (embryonic ectoderm development). These candidate activation mechanisms provide the first glimpse into the pathway of GTW-induced gonad toxicity, which is crucial for further research and clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2040982134,"Insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) plays a critical role in the survival and function of pancreatic β-cells. Gene disruption of IRS-2 results in failure of the β-cell compensatory mechanism and diabetes. Nonetheless, the regulation of IRS-2 protein expression in β-cells remains largely unknown. Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), a major mediator of inflammation, has been implicated in β-cell damage in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The effects of iNOS on IRS-2 expression have not yet been investigated in β-cells. Here, we show that iNOS and NO donor decreased IRS-2 protein expression in INS-1/832 insulinoma cells and mouse islets, whereas IRS-2 mRNA levels were not altered. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), alone or in combination with interferon-γ (IFN-γ), reduced IRS-2 protein expression in an iNOS-dependent manner without altering IRS-2 mRNA levels. Proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin, blocked the NO donor-induced reduction in IRS-2 protein expression. Treatment with NO donor led to activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK/SAPK) in β-cells.

Islets were isolated from male wild-type C57BL/6 mice, iNOS knock-out (−/−) mice on C57BL/6 background, wild-type BKS mice, and obese, diabetic (db/db) mice on BKS background (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) at 9–12 weeks of age by collagenase digestion followed by centrifugation over a Histopaque (Sigma) gradient, as described previously (44Kitamura T.

Upper laparotomy was performed by midline incision, and after clamping the common bile duct at its entrance to the duodenum, 3 ml of M199 medium containing collagenase P (1 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) was injected into the duct. The swollen pancreas was surgically removed. Human islets from two non-diabetic subjects (male aged 39 years; female aged 45 years) and two type 2 diabetes patients (male aged 63 years on anti-diabetic medication for 5 years; male age 42 years on anti-diabetic medication for 4 years) were provided by the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA). Islets isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and from non-diabetic subjects were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The islets were treated with and without GSNO (400 or 500 μm) for 5 h in the presence or absence of SB216763 (10 μm) or lactacystin (1 μm) or with and without IL-1β (10 units/ml) and IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 units/ml), IFN-γ (100 ng/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 3 μg/ml; Sigma) as indicated in the figure legends for 20 h in the presence or absence of l-NIL (200 μm). Cells or islets were lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), as described previously (45Yasukawa T.

The protein samples were denatured by boiling for 5 min and separated in a 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in 2% ECL advance blocking agent (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence method using an ECL advance Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare). Bands of interest were scanned using an HP Scanjet 4850 and were quantified by NIH ImageJ 1.410 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Lysates were preincubated with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C to minimize nonspecific absorption. The supernatants were then incubated with 2 μg of anti-IRS-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the pellets were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and dissolved in 30 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Total RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR reactions were performed using 10 ng of cDNA and TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) for IRS-2 (Rn01482270_s1 or Hs0065185_m1) and 18 S ribosomal RNA (Hs99999901_s1), conducted with Mastercycler® ep realplex (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). Results were normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA as an endogenous reference gene, and the relative amount of each mRNA was calculated by the comparative Ct (threshold cycle) method. iNOS mRNA content in the islets was evaluated by RT-PCR, as described previously (46Bellenger J.

Cell viability of INS-1/832 cells and islet cells was assessed using Sytox Green (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and TOX-8 (Sigma) according to the manufacturers' instructions. For Sytox staining, cells were incubated with Sytox Green (1 μm) for 20 min in the dark and observed under a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-5 inverted fluorescence microscope. Nitrite accumulation in culture medium was determined by Griess reagent (Sigma). 50 μl of culture medium was mixed and incubated with 50 μl of Griess reagent for 15 min at room temperature, and absorbance at 540 nm was measured in a microplate reader. Serial dilutions of sodium nitrite were used as standards. The data were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's least significant difference test or unpaired Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Treatment with IL-1β or with IL-1β plus interferon-γ (IFN-γ) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent induction of iNOS expression and nitrite accumulation in the culture medium in INS-1/832 cells. The induction of iNOS paralleled the reduction in IRS-2 protein expression (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Treatment with IL-1β for 24 h significantly decreased IRS-2 protein expression starting at a dose of 2.5 units/ml, and the maximum level of the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on IRS-2 was observed at 10 and 25 units/ml (Fig. 1C). The suppression of IRS-2 protein expression by IL-1β or IL-1β plus IFN-γ was prevented by a specific inhibitor of iNOS, l-NIL, in INS-1/832 cells, along with the reversal of accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). The protein expression of GAPDH was not affected by IL-1β, IL-1β plus IFN-γ, or l-NIL. Likewise, siRNA-mediated knockdown of iNOS inhibited IL-1β-induced decreased protein expression of IRS-2 in INS-1/832 cells (Fig. 3F). In contrast to the decreased protein expression of IRS-2, IL-1β did not reduce mRNA expression of IRS-2 in INS-1/832 cells (IRS-2 mRNA level: control, 100 ± 11% (mean ± S.E.); IL-1β, 104 ± 5%. Treatment with neither IL-1β, IL-1β plus IFN-γ, nor l-NIL for up to 24 h increased cell death in INS-1/832 cells and mouse islets, as judged by Sytox staining (data not shown).FIGURE 2Time-dependent reduction in IRS-2 expression by cytokine and its reversal by iNOS inhibitor in β-cells. IL-1β (5 units/ml) alone and the combination of IL-1β (10 units/ml) and IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) time-dependently decreased IRS-2 protein expression in parallel with iNOS induction and nitrite accumulation in the culture medium in INS-1/832 cells (A–D). iNOS inhibitor, l-NIL (200 μm), blocked the cytokine-induced decreases in IRS-2 expression and nitrite accumulation.

IL-1β alone and IL-1β plus IFN-γ induced iNOS expression and reduced IRS-2 protein expression. l-NIL reverted decreased IRS-2 expression and nitrite accumulation in the culture medium in cytokine-treated cells. Likewise, siRNA-mediated knockdown prevented IL-1β-induced suppression of IRS-2 expression in β-cells in parallel with reversal of elevated nitrite concentration in the medium, as compared with control siRNA.

In the absence of IL-1β, l-NIL did not affect the phosphorylation status of IRS-2 and Akt. The protein expression of Akt was not altered by IL-1β or l-NIL. Similar to INS-1/832 cells, treatment with IL-1β alone or IL-1β plus IFN-γ decreased IRS-2 protein expression in cultured islets isolated from wild-type mice along with induction of iNOS expression (Fig. 5A), whereas mRNA content of IRS-2 was not decreased (mouse IRS-2 mRNA level: control, 100 ± 9%; IL-1β, 95 ± 14%) IL-1β plus IFN-γ induced more profound decrease in IRS-2 protein expression in association with greater increases in iNOS expression and nitrite accumulation in wild-type islets (Fig. 5B). In islets from iNOS-deficient mice, however, neither IL-1β alone nor IL-1β plus IFN-γ affected IRS-2 expression or increased nitrite concentration in the culture medium (Fig. 5). iNOS inhibitor, l-NIL (200 μm), blocked IL-1β plus IFN-γ-induced decrease in IRS-2 protein expression and nitrite accumulation in wild-type mouse islets (data not shown). NO donor, GSNO, decreased the protein expression of IRS-2 in a time-dependent manner in INS-1/832 cells (Fig. 6A). GSNO (300 μm) significantly decreased IRS-2 expression starting at 2 h after the addition of the NO donor. Treatment with GSNO for 5 h elicited the inhibitory effects on IRS-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. A significant reduction in IRS-2 protein expression was observed starting at a dose of 100 μm (Fig. 6B).

https://openalex.org/W2041901410,"Plant-pollinator mutualistic networks are asymmetric in their interactions: specialist plants are pollinated by generalist animals, while generalist plants are pollinated by a broad range involving specialists and generalists. It has been suggested that this asymmetric –or disassortative– assemblage could play an important role in determining the observed equal susceptibility of specialist and generalist plants under habitat destruction. At the core of the analysis of the phenomenon lies the observation that specialist plants, otherwise candidates to extinction, could cope with the disruption thanks to their interaction with a few generalist pollinators. We present a theoretical framework that supports this thesis. We analyze a dynamical model of a system of mutualistic plants and pollinators, subject to the destruction of their habitat. We analyze and compare two families of interaction topologies, ranging from highly assortative to highly disassortative ones, as well as real pollination networks. We found that several features observed in natural systems are predicted by the mathematical model. First, there is a tendency to increase the asymmetry of the network as a result of the extinctions. Second, an entropy measure of the differential susceptibility to extinction of specialist and generalist species show that they tend to balance when the network is disassortative. Finally, the disappearance of links in the network, as a result of extinctions, shows that specialist plants preserve more connections than the corresponding plants in an assortative system, enabling them to resist the disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2086103636,"Schizophrenia is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric disorder affecting ∼1% of the world's population. Linkage and association studies have identified multiple candidate schizophrenia susceptibility genes whose functions converge on the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system. One such susceptibility gene encoding d-amino acid oxidase (DAO), an enzyme that metabolizes the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist d-serine, has the potential to modulate NMDAR function in the context of schizophrenia. To further investigate its cellular regulation, we sought to identify DAO-interacting proteins that participate in its functional regulation in rat cerebellum, where DAO expression is especially high. Immunoprecipitation with DAO-specific antibodies and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis of co-precipitated proteins yielded 24 putative DAO-interacting proteins. The most robust interactions occurred with known components of the presynaptic active zone, such as bassoon (BSN) and piccolo (PCLO). The interaction of DAO with BSN was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays using DAO- and BSN-specific antibodies. Moreover, DAO and BSN colocalized with one another in cultured cerebellar granule cells and in synaptic junction membrane protein fractions derived from rat cerebellum. The functional consequences of this interaction were studied through enzyme assay experiments, where DAO enzymatic activity was significantly inhibited as a result of its interaction with BSN. Taking these results together, we hypothesize that synaptic d-serine concentrations may be under tight regulation by a BSN-DAO complex. We therefore predict that this mechanism plays a role in the modulation of glutamatergic signaling through NMDARs. It also furthers our understanding of the biology underlying this potential therapeutic entry point for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.

Mice with a naturally occurring mutation within the gene express a functionally inactive form of DAO due to mutation of glycine 181 with arginine (G181R). Studies of these mutant mice suggest that DAO is involved in regulating d-serine levels in vivo (28Konno R. Yasumura Y. Genetics. 1983; 103: 277-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sasaki M.

Levels of d-alanine, also a NMDAR co-agonist (4Sakata K. Fukushima T. Minje L. Ogurusu T. Taira H. Mishina M. Shingai R.

Zaitsu K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2005; 28: 1578-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The presence of elevated d-serine and d-alanine levels was accompanied by an increased occupancy of the NMDAR glycine modulatory site, as demonstrated by attenuated effects of L-701,324, a NMDAR glycine site antagonist (25Almond S.L. Fradley R.L. Armstrong E.J. Heavens R.B. Rutter A.R. Newman R.J. Chiu C.S. Konno R. Hutson P.H. Brandon N.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 32: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, the DAO G181R mutant mice display behavioral phenotypes consistent with altered NMDA receptor signaling, including diminution of stereotypy and ataxia elicited by MK-801 (24Hashimoto A. Yoshikawa M. Niwa A. Konno R. Brain. Res. 2005; 1033: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and enhanced spatial learning and long term potentiation in the hippocampus (26Maekawa M. Watanabe M. Yamaguchi S. Konno R. Hori Y. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 53: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) compared with wild type mice. Consistent with these data, pharmacological inhibition of DAO with AS057278 (5-methylpyrazole-3-caroboxylic acid), CBIO (6-chlorobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-ol), or Merck Compound 8 (4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-carboxylic acid) in rodents increased d-serine levels and enhanced NMDAR function (31Hashimoto K.

Taken together, modulation of DAO activity impinges on NMDAR function in a manner that might be relevant for the treatment of schizophrenia. DAO expression and distribution has been extensively studied. DAO expression in humans shows predominant neuronal expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, neuronal and glial expression in substantia nigra pars compacta, and strong glial expression in cerebellum (12Verrall L. Walker M. Rawlings N. Benzel I. Kew J.N. Harrison P.J. Burnet P.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In rodents, DAO message and protein have been reported in the same brain regions as in humans (34Ono K. Shishido Y. Park H.K. Kawazoe T. Iwana S. Chung S.P. Abou El-Magd R.M. Yorita K. Okano M. Watanabe T. Sano N. Bando Y. Arima K. Sakai T. Fukui K. J. Neural Transm. 2009; 116: 1335-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On a subcellular level, DAO was first reported to be localized within liver peroxisomes, consistent with the presence of a peroxisomal targeting sequence located within the DAO polypeptide (35De Duve C. Baudhuin P. Physiol. Rev. 1966; 46: 323-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). However, in the brain, expression may not be limited to peroxisomes because in samples from rat dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, DAO exhibits pericellular immunolocalization (12Verrall L. Walker M. Rawlings N. Benzel I. Kew J.N. Harrison P.J. Burnet P.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which does not appear to overlap with peroxisomal markers (36Sacchi S. Bernasconi M. Martineau M. Mothet J.P. Ruzzene M. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22244-22256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Expression outside of the peroxisome may have very important consequences for the regulation of DAO because it exposes the protein to an alternative set of putative interacting proteins. An extraperoxisomal localization also suggests an altered function or regulatory role for DAO, which may be elucidated by the identification of its interacting proteins. To identify novel DAO-interacting proteins, we generated a DAO-specific antibody and conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments from rat cerebellar detergent extracts. Mass spectrometric analysis of anti-DAO immunoprecipitates resulted in the identification of 24 putative DAO-interacting proteins. Here, we report the identity of these novel DAO-interacting proteins as well as describing an investigation into the interaction of DAO with bassoon (BSN), a component of the presynaptic active zone and one of the most abundant proteins in these immunoprecipitates. Our data suggest a novel localization for DAO as a result of its interaction with BSN, which is likely to be relevant in influencing synaptic d-serine concentrations and in understanding more fully the role of DAO in normal neuronal function and in disease. The open reading frames of human and rat DAO were amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To purify hDAO protein, the cDNA encoding hDAO was cloned into pTYB2 (New England Biolabs) with XbaI (5′) and NotI (3′). The EGFP-BSN 95–3938 construct expressed GFP-bassoon under the control of the CMV promoter (37Dresbach T. Hempelmann A. Spilker C. tom Dieck S. Altrock W.D. Zuschratter W. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The BSN truncation mutants, including 95–609, 95–3263, 1692–3263, and 2715–3263, were amplified by PCR and cloned into fusion to EGFP under CMV promoter control with HindIII (5′) and SacII (3′). The primary antibodies used in this study for Western blotting include catalase (Sigma), BSN (StressGen), PSD-95 (NeuroMab), MAP2 (Sigma), GFP (Clontech), mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and rabbit IgG (Abcam). DAO antiserum was generated in rabbits immunized with the rat DAO peptide 49GLWQPYLSDPSNPQEAEWNQQ69 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (OpenBiosystems). The DAO antibody was affinity-purified from serum using a DAO peptide column and by adsorption to immobilized human DAO (hDAO). Dynal protein A and G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were used to capture rabbit and mouse antibody, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cerebellar lysate was used from approximately 6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The beads were washed with PBS and/or detergent-containing wash solutions (modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.2% SDS and 650 mm NaCl). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the indicated primary antibodies. Secondary fluorescent antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Blots were imaged with the Odyssey (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Immunoprecipitates were loaded and separated on 10–20% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Each gel lane was cut into 20 pieces of about 1 × 1 mm2. Proteins within the gel pieces were digested with trypsin and extracted from the gel and reconstituted in 20 μl of 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% fatty acid. An Agilent 1100 nanoflow system connected to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, ThermoFinnigan) was used for the mass spectrometric analysis. The peptides were eluted with a gradient from 4 to 60% solvent B (90% acetonitrile and 0.1% fatty acid) over 70 min with a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The fragment ion spectra (MS/MS scan) were acquired in a data-dependent manner in which each fragment ion scan was followed by consecutive MS/MS scan on the first three most intense ions from the MS scan. HEK293 were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transform cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested 24–72 h post-transfection. The HEK293 cells were transfected with 10 μg of total plasmid DNA containing an hDAO or rDAO insert by electroporation (400 V, 250 microfarads ohms). Transfected cells were cultured in the presence of hygromycin or G418. Individual colonies were screened for the presence of recombinant DAO. The DAO functional assays were carried out in 384-well Matrix plates (Thermo Scientific). DAO stable line activity was ascertained in wells containing 20,000 cells/well (in a 30-μl volume), which were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Subsequently, 10-μl samples of d-alanine (5 mm) (VWR International), Amplex Red (100 μm) (Invitrogen), HRP (1 unit/ml) (Sigma) solutions were added. Reactions took place in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescent signals were measured with a Victor2 plate reader (PerkinElmer) using 544-nm excitation and 590-nm emission filters. The subcellular fractionation procedure was synthesized from three published methods (38tom Dieck S. Sanmartí-Vila L. Langnaese K. Richter K. Kindler S. Soyke A. Wex H. Smalla K.H. Kämpf U.

Animal handling was in accordance with appropriate animal welfare regulations as outlined in the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Cerebella were dissected from postnatal day 14–21 rat pups. The tissue was dissociated using papain solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Worthington). The cells were plated at 50,000 cells/24-well poly-d-lysine-coated coverslip and incubated for 2 weeks in neurobasal complete medium (500 ml of neurobasal medium without l-glutamine, 10 ml of B27 supplement (50×), 0.75 g of KCl, 200 mm glutamine, 6.6 mg/ml aphidicolin, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin). The cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or 100% ice-cold methanol. The cells were washed with 1% sodium borohydride, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by a 1-h incubation in normal goat serum (Vector) containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were added to the blocking solution at a 1:100 dilution for 1–3 h. Secondary rabbit and mouse antibodies (Odyssey) at 1:200 dilution suspended in the blocking reagent were then applied to the coverslips for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted onto slides with ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) and visualized under fluorescence microscopy. To generate an antibody that recognizes rat DAO, an immunogenic peptide was chosen based on a previously published antibody raised against mouse DAO (25Almond S.L. Fradley R.L. Armstrong E.J. Heavens R.B. Rutter A.R. Newman R.J. Chiu C.S. Konno R. Hutson P.H. Brandon N.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 32: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The anti-rat DAO antibody was affinity-purified from crude serum against the immunogenic peptide and purified hDAO. Purified anti-DAO antibody detected two immunoreactive bands at the expected molecular masses of 37 and 40 kDa in immunoblots of lysates from HEK293 cells stably expressing human DAO. A single DAO band at 38 kDa was detected from rat cerebellum lysates (Fig. 1A), the brain region where DAO has been shown to be expressed at especially high levels (12Verrall L. Walker M. Rawlings N. Benzel I. Kew J.N. Harrison P.J. Burnet P.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 41Horiike K. Tojo H. Arai R. Nozaki M. Maeda T. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, no immunoreactive bands were detected by anti-DAO antibody in immunoblots of lysates from untransfected HEK293 or from rat spleen lysates (Fig. 1A), highlighting the specificity of the purified anti-DAO antibody because DAO is not expressed in spleen (42Wang L.Z. Zhu X.Z. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2003; 24: 965-974PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DAO-specific signal was completely blocked by preadsorption of 1.4 μg/ml immunogenic peptide (Fig. 1B). In order to assess the utility of this anti-DAO antibody for downstream interaction studies, we also determined that this anti-DAO antibody can specifically immunoprecipitate DAO from rat cerebellum (Fig. 1C). To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported DAO-interacting proteins identified to date other than the primate-specific protein G72 (14Chumakov I. Blumenfeld M. Guerassimenko O. Cavarec L. Palicio M. Abderrahim H. Bougueleret L. Barry C. Tanaka H. La Rosa P. Puech A. Tahri N. Cohen-Akenine A. Delabrosse S. Lissarrague S. Picard F.P. Maurice K. Essioux L. Millasseau P.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13675-13680Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Thus, in order to identify novel DAO-interacting proteins, we used the anti-DAO antibody to immunoprecipitate DAO-containing complexes from rat cerebellar lysates for mass spectrometric analysis. We initially used a “PBS-only” washing condition, which resulted in the identification of 198 distinct proteins that were co-immunoprecipitated by anti-DAO but not by rabbit IgG or by anti-DAO incubated with 1.4 μg/ml immunogenic peptide (supplemental Table S1). The latter two control immunoprecipitation conditions did not precipitate DAO from rat cerebellar lysate (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the 198 putative DAO interactors were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with DAO from rat cerebellar lysates. To limit the number of DAO-interacting proteins, the immunoprecipitation experiment was repeated with a high stringency washing condition utilizing modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Under these more stringent conditions, a total of 24 putative DAO-interacting proteins were revealed by mass spectrometric analysis (Table 1).TABLE 1DAO interactomeAbbreviationProtein nameDYNC1H1Dynein heavy chainBSNBassoonBAT2D1HBxAg transactivated protein 2PCLOPiccoloPRKCGProtein kinase C, γSNIPSNAP-25-interacting proteinPCPyruvate carboxylase, mitchondrialRAPGEF4Exchange factor directly activated by cAMP 2CEP97Centrosomal protein 97PHYHIPPhyhip proteinMAP1BMicrotubule-associated protein 1BPABPC1Poly(A)-binding protein, cytoplasmic 1YLPM1YLP motif-containing 1AP1B1Adopted-related protein complex 1, β1PPP1CBProtein phosphate 1CRMP1Crmp1 proteinERC1ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family memberCLINT1Clathrin interactor 1DYNLL2Dynein, light chainNCOA6Peroxisome proliferator activater receptor interacting proteinDSPDesmoplakin 1CHAINBChain B, perchloric acid-soluble protein-a translational inhibitorHRNRHomeric precursorPFN1Profilin 1 Open table in a new tab Based on the two immunoprecipitation experiments, presynaptic active zone proteins, including bassoon (BSN) and piccolo (PCLO) (supplemental Table S1), were found to be highly enriched among the pool of co-precipitating proteins because these proteins were represented by the greatest number of unique and total tryptic peptide fragments as well as by the largest percentage of protein coverage as revealed by mass spectrometric analysis of anti-DAO immunoprecipitates (supplemental Table S2). Of the presynaptic proteins identified, peptides corresponding to BSN were the most prevalent, with 29% of the entire BSN protein represented in the DAO immunoprecipitates, a value very close to that of DAO itself (30%; supplemental Table S2).

Some of the observed defects were attributed to impaired processing of the TGFβ-like growth differentiating factor 11 precursor (proGdf11). In this work we present evidence that the latent TGFβ-binding proteins 2 and 3 (LTBP-2 and -3) inhibit the extracellular processing of proGdf11 by PC5/6A. This is partly due to the binding of LTBPs in the endoplasmic reticulum to the zymogen proPC5/6A, thus allowing the complex to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and be sequestered as an inactive zymogen in the extracellular matrix but not at the cell surface. This results in lower levels of PC5/6A in the media, without affecting those of PACE4, Furin, or a soluble form of PC7. The secreted soluble protease-specific activity of PC5/6A or a variant lacking the C-terminal Cys-rich domain (PC5/6-ΔCRD) is significantly decreased when co-expressed with LTBPs in cells. A similar enzymatic inhibition seems to apply to PACE4 and Furin.

https://openalex.org/W2081041800,"Background Spermatogenesis is a complex cellular developmental process which involves diverse families of genes. The Xlr (X-linked, lymphocyte regulated) family includes multiple members, only a few of which have reported functions in meiosis, post-meiotic maturation, and fertilization of germ cells. Slx-like1 (Slxl1) is a member of the Xlr family, whose expression and function in spermatogenesis need to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings The mRNA and protein expression and localization of Slxl1 were investigated by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry in different tissues and at different stages of spermatogenesis. The interacting partner of SLXL1 was examined by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization. Assessment of the role of SLXL1 in capacitation, acrosome reaction, zona pellucida binding/penetration, and fertilization was carried out in vitro using blocking antisera. The results showed that Slxl1 mRNA and protein were specifically expressed in the testis. SLXL1 was exclusively located in the acrosome of post-meiotic germ cells and interacts with DKKL1 (Dickkopf-like1), which is an acrosome-associated protein and plays an important role in fertilization. The rates of zona pellucida binding/penetration and fertilization were significantly reduced by the anti-SLXL1 polyclonal antiserum. Conclusions/Significance SLXL1 is the first identified member of the XLR family that is associated with acrosome and is involved in zona pellucid binding/penetration and subsequent fertilization. These results, together with previous studies, suggest that Xlr family members participate in diverse processes from meiosis to fertilization during spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1985761039,"DNA polymerase and DNA helicase are essential components of DNA replication. The helicase unwinds duplex DNA to provide single-stranded templates for DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerase. In bacteriophage T7, movement of either the DNA helicase or the DNA polymerase alone terminates upon encountering a nick in duplex DNA. Using a minicircular DNA, we show that the helicase·polymerase complex can bypass a nick, albeit at reduced efficiency of 7%, on the non-template strand to continue rolling circle DNA synthesis. A gap in the non-template strand cannot be bypassed. The efficiency of bypass synthesis depends on the DNA sequence downstream of the nick. A nick on the template strand cannot be bypassed. Addition of T7 single-stranded DNA-binding protein to the complex stimulates nick bypass 2-fold. We propose that the association of helicase with the polymerase prevents dissociation of the helicase upon encountering a nick, allowing the helicase to continue unwinding of the duplex downstream of the nick.

https://openalex.org/W1986146506,"BWI-1 (buckwheat trypsin inhibitor), a member of the potato inhibitor I family, suppresses the growth of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and induces apoptosis in human solid tumor cell lines. Here, we report the crystal structure of rBTI (recombinant buckwheat trypsin inhibitor), a recombinant protein of BWI-1, at 1.84 Å resolution and the structure of rBTI in complex with bovine trypsin at 2.26 Å resolution. A conformational change of Trp53 at the P(8)' position in rBTI was observed upon its binding to trypsin, which is not seen in other members of the potato inhibitor I family reported previously. The role of the P(8)' residue in the potato inhibitor I family was examined by measuring the association and dissociation rates of four rBTI mutants with different substitutions at the P(2) and P(8)' positions when binding to trypsin. One of the mutants, P44T, was found to be a much stronger inhibitor than wild-type rBTI, with a picomolar (pM) dissociation constant. Our results could provide valuable insights for designing a new rBTI-based antitumor drug in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2140309328,"Recent studies suggest that binocular rivalry at stimulus onset, so called onset rivalry, differs from rivalry during sustained viewing. These observations raise the interesting question whether there is a relation between onset rivalry and rivalry in the presence of eye movements. We therefore studied binocular rivalry when stimuli jumped from one visual hemifield to the other, either through a saccade or through a passive stimulus displacement, and we compared rivalry after such displacements with onset and sustained rivalry. We presented opponent motion, orthogonal gratings and face/house stimuli through a stereoscope. For all three stimulus types we found that subjects showed a strong preference for stimuli in one eye or one hemifield (Experiment 1), and that these subject-specific biases did not persist during sustained viewing (Experiment 2). These results confirm and extend previous findings obtained with gratings. The results from the main experiment (Experiment 3) showed that after a passive stimulus jump, switching probability was low when the preferred eye was dominant before a stimulus jump, but when the non-preferred eye was dominant beforehand, switching probability was comparatively high. The results thus showed that dominance after a stimulus jump was tightly related to eye dominance at stimulus onset. In the saccade condition, however, these subject-specific biases were systematically reduced, indicating that the influence of saccades can be understood from a systematic attenuation of the subjects' onset rivalry biases. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a relation between onset rivalry and rivalry after retinal shifts and involvement of extra-retinal signals in binocular rivalry."
