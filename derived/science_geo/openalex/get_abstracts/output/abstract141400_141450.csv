https://openalex.org/W2055440970,"The β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) is a key cell surface signaling protein expressed in the heart and other organs that mediates the actions of catecholamines of the sympathetic nervous system. A polymorphism in the intracellular cytoplasmic tail near the seventh transmembrane-spanning segment of the human β1AR has been identified in a cohort of normal individuals. At amino acid position 389, Gly or Arg can be found (allele frequencies 0.26 and 0.74, respectively), the former previously considered as the human wild-type β1AR. Using site-directed mutagenesis to mimic the two variants, CHW-1102 cells were permanently transfected to express the Gly-389 and Arg-389 receptors. In functional studies with matched expression, the Arg-389 receptors had slightly higher basal levels of adenylyl cyclase activities (10.7 ± 1.2 versus 6.1 ± 0.4 pmol/min/mg). However, maximal isoproterenol-stimulated levels weremarkedly higher for the Arg-389 as compared to the Gly-389 receptor (63.3 ± 6.1 versus 20.9 ± 2.0 pmol/min/mg). Agonist-promoted [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) binding was also increased with the Arg-389 receptor consistent with enhanced coupling to Gsand increased adenylyl cyclase activation. In agonist competition studies carried out in the absence of guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate, high affinity binding could not be resolved with the Gly-389 receptor, whereas Arg-389 displayed an accumulation of the agonist high affinity receptor complex (R H = 26%). Taken together, these data indicate that this polymorphic variation of the human β1AR results in alterations of receptor-Gs interaction with functional signal transduction consequences, consistent with its localization in a putative G-protein binding domain. The genetic variation of β1AR at this locus may be the basis of interindividual differences in pathophysiologic characteristics or in the response to therapeutic βAR agonists and antagonists in cardiovascular and other diseases.

Like other members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, the amino terminus is extracellular, the protein is predicted to traverse the cell membrane seven times, and the carboxyl terminus is intracellular. In the adrenergic receptor family, agonists bind in a pocket formed by the transmembrane-spanning domains, and G-protein binding and activation occur at intracellular domains of the loops and tail, typically near the membrane (1Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). β1ARs couple to the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, activating adenylyl cyclase, as well as to non-cAMP pathways such as the activation of ion channels (2Yatani A. Brown A.M. Science. 1989; 245: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). β1ARs are expressed on a number of cell types including cardiomyocytes where they serve to increase cardiac inotropy and chronotropy, adipocytes where they mediate lypolysis, and juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney where they regulate renin secretion. It has been known for decades that these responses, as well as those of the β2AR, are somewhat variable in the human population (3Liggett S.B. Shah S.D. Cryer P.E. Am. J.

Indeed, we have recently found and characterized several β2AR polymorphisms that have altered signaling phenotypes compared with wild-type receptor (5Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M.

Here we report a common single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in a Gly to Arg switch at intracellular amino acid 389, within a region important for G-protein coupling. The resulting phenotype of the Arg-389 receptor is one of enhanced receptor-Gs interaction, functionally manifested as increased activation of the adenylyl cyclase effector.RESULTSSequencing results from DNA derived from 30 individuals from a defined healthy cohort revealed variance in the examined β1AR region (encompassing the coding block from the second transmembrane domain to the last amino acid in the carboxyl terminus of the receptor) in only one location (Fig. 1), at nucleotide 1165, where guanine or cytosine could be found, resulting in a Gly or Arg at amino acid 389. Using BsmF1 restriction digests, additional genotyping at this locus was carried out for a total of 50 samples. While the wild-type human β1AR had previously been reported (8Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) as Gly at amino acid 389, we found a higher frequency of Arg in our normal population. The allele frequencies were 0.74 for Arg and 0.26 for Gly.To ascertain whether the Arg in this position conferred a distinct phenotype compared with the Gly-389 receptor (which we (11Green S.A. Holt B.D. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 889-893PubMed Google Scholar) and others (16Rousseau G. Nantel F. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 752-760PubMed Google Scholar) had previously characterized), site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to mimic Arg-389, and the two cDNAs were subcloned into mammalian expression vectors. The final constructs were identical except for the single nucleotide difference. These constructs were used to establish permanent lines of transfected CHW cells, which endogenously lack βAR expression. As indicated, studies were carried out on several clonal lines from each transfection at matched levels of receptor expression. Radioligand binding studies (TableI) revealed essentially identical dissociation binding constants for 125I-CYP. Competition binding studies with isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in the presence of GTP showed no differences between the two receptors in binding affinities for these agonists.Table IRadioligand binding parameters of the two polymorphic β1ARsReceptor125I-CYPK DK iISONEEPIpmnmGly-38960.9 ± 2.025.9 ± 4.8131.7 ± 27.4457.5 ± 66.6Arg-38960.9 ± 8.926.8 ± 3.5136.0 ± 15.6385.4 ± 37.4Studies were carried out in the presence of 100 μm GTP. ISO, isoproterenol; NE, norepinephrine; EPI, epinephrine. Open table in a new tab Basal, isoproterenol-, and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were determined using membranes from lines expressing Gly-389 at 159 ± 14 fmol/mg and Arg-389 at 151 ± 13 fmol/mg (Fig. 2 A). As shown, basal activities were slightly higher with the Arg-389 receptor than with the Gly-389 receptor (10.7 ± 1.2 versus 6.1 ± 0.4 pmol/min/mg, n = 4, p < 0.02). The most dramatic differences, however, were seen with agonist stimulation. Maximal isoproterenol-stimulated activities were higher with the Arg-389 receptor than with the Gly-389 receptor (63.3 ± 6.1versus 20.9 ± 2.0 pmol/min/mg, n = 4,p < 0.01). Similarly, expressing the responses as -fold increases over basal levels, the Arg-389 receptor displayed a greater stimulation of adenylyl cyclase than the Gly-389 receptor (6.1- ± 0.3-fold versus 3.3- ± 0.1-fold). In contrast, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin was not consistently different between the lines (104 ± 11 versus 120 ± 10 pmol/min/mg). Thus, normalizing the data to the extent of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin still revealed a significantly greater agonist stimulation by the Arg-389 variant than the Gly-389 variant (Fig. 2 B). The EC50 values for isoproterenol stimulation of adenylyl cyclase for Gly-389 and Arg-389 receptors were not different (115 ± 5 versus132 ± 5 nm). Results from an additional set of studies carried out on other lines at higher expression levels are shown in Fig. 2, C and D (expression was 246 ± 32 and 255 ± 11 fmol/mg for Gly-389 and Arg-389, respectively). Again, the maximal extent of stimulation by agonist was greater with the Arg-389 variant. These differences in adenylyl cyclase stimulation between the two polymorphic receptors were also observed in responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine (data not shown).To investigate the basis of these differences between the two receptors, studies were undertaken to assess interactions between agonist, receptor, and Gs with [35S]GTPγS binding experiments and agonist competition studies in the absence and presence of Gpp(NH)p. For [35S]GTPγS binding, we found that adequate signals were reproducibly obtained with high levels of transient receptor expression (∼10 pmol/mg) in COS-7 cells, which were co-transfected with Gαs. Results of these studies are shown in Fig. 3. Maximal isoproterenol-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was found to be greater in membranes bearing the Arg-389 versus the Gly-389 receptor, consistent with the adenylyl cyclase studies, which also showed enhanced agonist-stimulated function with the Arg-389 receptor.Figure 3[35S]GTPγS binding to the two polymorphic β1ARs. COS-7 cells were transfected as described under “Materials and Methods.” Binding in the presence of 10 μm isoproterenol was greater (p < 0.05) with the Arg-389 than with the Gly-389 receptor. Because of day-to-day variation in the absolute levels of binding, data are presented as a percentage of binding to the wild-type (Gly389) receptor (mean absolute values were 7.7 ± 1.4 × 105 dpm/mg for Gly-389). Basal levels of binding were not different between the two receptors.nt, nontransfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A well recognized characteristic of agonist binding to receptors such as the β2AR is the increase in high affinity binding states, indicative of receptor/G-protein interactions (17De Lean A.

Interestingly, we have previously reported (13Green S. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that in competition studies carried out in the absence of Gpp(NH)p, agonist-promoted accumulation of a β1AR (Gly-389) high affinity fraction is not readily resolved. This result is likely because of the similar affinities of the high and low affinity sites consistent with relatively less free energy transfer during signal transduction. We wondered whether the Arg-389 receptor would in fact have enhanced agonist-promoted high affinity binding, because this receptor has increased functional coupling to Gs. Isoproterenol competition studies were thus carried out in parallel, in the absence and presence of Gpp(NH)p, with washed membranes from CHW cells expressing each receptor. These results are provided in Fig.4 and TableII. As shown, the displacement curves in the absence of a guanine nucleotide from the Gly-389 experiments were relatively steep (mean pseudo-Hill coefficient, 0.87 ± 0.03) and were best resolved statistically to a one-site model. Gpp(NH)p had no effect on agonist competition with the Gly-389 receptor (Fig. 4). In contrast, the displacement curves obtained with the Arg-389 receptor in the absence of Gpp(NH)p had mean pseudo-Hill coefficients of 0.73 ± 0.03, and the data were best resolved with a two-site model (composite p value < 0.001). The percentage of receptors in the high affinity state with the Arg-389 receptor was 26 ± 1% (Fig. 4 and Table II). As shown, with this receptor the presence of Gpp(NH)p in the reaction resulted in the expected rightward shift, with monophasic, steep curves consistent with a single low affinity agonist interaction.Figure 4Agonist competition curves from studies of the Gly-389 and Arg-389 receptors. Experiments were carried out with CHW membranes in the absence and presence of Gpp(NH)p. The Gly-389 data obtained in the absence of a guanine nucleotide was best fit to a one-site model, and the binding was unaffected by Gpp(NH)p. In contrast, studies with Arg-389 resulted in two-site fits with high and low affinity components (see text and Table II) when carried out in the absence of Gpp(NH)p, and curves were right-shifted and represented single-site binding in its presence. Results shown are the mean data from five independent experiments. Absent error bars denote that standard errors were less than the plotting symbol. (Because these experiments were performed at a higher temperature, theK i values for isoproterenol with Gpp(NH)p are ∼4-fold higher than those obtained in the experiments shown in TableI.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIResults of agonist (isoproterenol) competition binding studies in the absence and presence of Gpp(NH)p with the Gly-389 and Arg-389 β1ARsReceptor(+)Gpp(NH)p(−)Gpp(NH)pK iK LKHR Hnmnmnm%Gly-389116.6 ± 20.6NANANAArg-389108.4 ± 14.068.9 ± 13.63.30 ± 1.0326.2 ± 1.4The Gly-389 receptor could not be fit to a two-site model with greater significance than a one-site model (see text for details), and thus high and low affinity binding parameters were not obtained.R H, percent of receptors in high affinity states; NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThese findings reveal in the normal human population the presence of two β1AR genetic variants with significant differences in functional signaling. For purposes of consistency, and because of the fact that a number of structure/function studies have been published using the Gly-389 receptor (13Green S. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Frielle T. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9494-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we prefer to continue to designate this receptor as the “wild-type” human β1AR, although the Arg variant appears to be more common. This is analogous to the precedent that has been set with the common β2AR polymorphisms (5Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Green S. Turki J. Innis M. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9414-9419Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The site of the variability is ∼9 amino acids from the seventh transmembrane-spanning domain, in the intracellular portion of the tail prior to the proposed palmitoylated cysteine(s) (Fig. 5). This region is sometimes referred to as the fourth intracellular loop, but in this report will be termed the proximal portion of the cytoplasmic tail. By analogy with β2AR (21O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15985-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α2AR (23Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12826-12832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and other G-protein-coupled receptors, this region is considered important for receptor coupling to its cognate G-protein, Gs. Indeed, the difference between the Arg-389 and Gly-389 receptors is in functional coupling. Receptor-promoted binding of GTPγS to Gαs, another indicator of agonist-initiated coupling to Gs, was similarly different between the two polymorphic β1ARs. Consistent with these findings, agonist-promoted accumulation of the high affinity state in washed membrane preparations in the absence of a guanine nucleotide was detected with the Arg-389 receptor but could not be resolved in studies with the Gly-389 receptor. Based on the multistate model (18Costa T. Ogino Y. Munson P. Onaran H.O. Rodbard D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar, 19Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of receptor/G-protein interactions, as well as the above results, an elevated basal activity of adenylyl cyclase (i.e. spontaneous toggling to R* in the absence of agonist) should also be expected with the Arg-389 receptor if it has a greater efficiency of stabilizing the active conformation in the presence of agonist, which in fact was the case. The differences in basal activities that we observed were small but consistent, and the magnitude likely results from the relatively low (“physiologic”) levels of expression utilized in the functional studies. As such, we consider the functional phenotype as shown in Fig. 2, A andC, to be indicative of signaling in cells that endogenously express the two polymorphic β1ARs.Figure 5Alignment of amino acid residues of the proximal cytoplasmic tail of the β1AR from various species. Note the conservation at the position of the human Gly–Arg polymorphism. Amino acid numbers are from the human receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The residues in this region of the β1AR among other species are shown in Fig. 5. The amino acid analogous to position 389 of the human, as well as the surrounding residues, are highly conserved in species sequenced to date, with the only deviation at position 389 being found in the human, where Gly was originally reported. Whereas we know nothing regarding genetic variability in these other species, the high degree of consistency in this region, its importance in G-protein coupling, and the nonconservative (size and charge) nature of the Gly to Arg substitution are consistent with this variation having functional consequences.As introduced earlier, β1AR are expressed on a number of cell types in the body. In the heart, β1AR represent the predominant βAR subtype and is expressed on myocytes of the atria and ventricles, where they act to increase the force and frequency of contraction in response to sympathetic stimulation. It is intriguing to consider the potential role of the β1AR polymorphisms at position 389 in regulating cardiac function under pathologic conditions. As left ventricular failure develops, β1AR expression and function decrease in human heart failure (24Bristow M.R. Ginsberg R. Umans V. Fowler M. Minobe W. Rasmussen R. Zera P. Menlove R. Shah P. Jamieson S. Stinson E.B. Circ. Res. 1986; 59: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 25Bristow M.R. Hershberger R.E. Port J.D. Minobe W. Rasmussen R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 35: 295-303Google Scholar). This response is thought to be a protective mechanism, sparing the heart from sustained sympathetic stimulation in the face of limited metabolic reserves. In earlier phases of the disease, maintenance of β1AR function may contribute to improved ventricular function. Given the above circumstances, the dramatic differences in function between the two β1AR polymorphisms suggest that the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure may be influenced by the β1AR genotype. Indeed, there is unexplained interindividual variation in the progression of heart failure as well as the cardiac response to infused β-agonists used therapeutically during acute decompensation (26Kannel W.B. Belanger A.J. Am. Heart J. 1991; 121: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 27Ho K.K. Anderson K.M. Kannel W.B. Grossman W. Levy D.

Heart J. 1986; 112: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, βAR antagonists (β-blockers) are utilized in the chronic treatment of heart failure, the presumed basis of which is minimization of the aforementioned consequences of long term sympathetic stimulation. There is, however, significant interindividual variation in the clinical response to β-blockers in patients with heart failure (29van Campen L.C. Visser F.C. Visser C.A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 32 Suppl. 1: S31-S35PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our current results, it might be predicted that individuals bearing the Arg-389 receptor would be most responsive to β-blocker therapy because they would have a genetically determined β1AR that achieves a greater stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. A similar scenario might be present in the treatment of essential hypertension with β-blockers, where responders could be predicted by β1AR genotyping. These pharmacogenetic concepts will need to be explicitly tested in human studies. While we are unaware of therapeutic agents specifically targeting adipocyte β1ARs, the different functional properties of the two β1ARs may be the basis of these polymorphisms acting as disease modifiers in obesity. Finally, we have yet to delineate the frequencies of these β1AR polymorphisms in various disease groups. Given that both polymorphisms are common in the general population, however, it is unlikely that either represents the primary basis of disease. These polymorphisms may, however, represent small risk factors in common, multifactorial diseases such as heart failure, hypertension, and obesity.In conclusion, we have found polymorphic variation of the human β1AR at amino acid 389, where Gly (previously considered wild-type) or Arg can be found. This variation alters receptor-Gs coupling, manifested as significant differences between the two receptors in agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation. Such variation may represent a genetic basis for interindividual differences in disease susceptibility or phenotype, or the response to agents targeting the β1AR.

https://openalex.org/W2142692094,"Polymerization of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide into protease-resistant fibrils is a significant step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It has not been possible to obtain detailed structural information about this process with conventional techniques because the peptide has limited solubility and does not form crystals. In this work, we present experimental results leading to a molecular level model for fibril formation. Systematically selected Aβ-fragments containing the Aβ<sup>16–20</sup>sequence, previously shown essential for Aβ-Aβ binding, were incubated in a physiological buffer. Electron microscopy revealed that the shortest fibril-forming sequence was Aβ<sup>14–23</sup>. Substitutions in this decapeptide impaired fibril formation and deletion of the decapeptide from Aβ<sup>1–42</sup> inhibited fibril formation completely. All studied peptides that formed fibrils also formed stable dimers and/or tetramers. Molecular modeling of Aβ<sup>14–23</sup> oligomers in an antiparallel β-sheet conformation displayed favorable hydrophobic interactions stabilized by salt bridges between all charged residues. We propose that this decapeptide sequence forms the core of Aβ-fibrils, with the hydrophobic C terminus folding over this core. The identification of this fundamental sequence and the implied molecular model could facilitate the design of potential inhibitors of amyloidogenesis."

Pleiotrophin has been demonstrated to bind to protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ (PTPζ) with high affinity. In this study, we examined the binding of midkine to PTPζ by solid-phase binding assay. Midkine and pleiotrophin binding to PTPζ were equally inhibited by soluble pleiotrophin and also by some specific glycosaminoglycans. For both bindings, Scatchard analysis revealed low (3.0 nm) and high (0.58 nm) affinity binding sites. These results suggested that PTPζ is a common receptor for midkine and pleiotrophin. Midkine is structurally divided into the N- and C-terminal halves, and the latter exhibited full activity for PTPζ binding and neuronal migration induction. The C-terminal half contains two heparin-binding sites consisting of clusters of basic amino acids, Clusters I and II. A mutation at Arg78 in Cluster I resulted in loss of the high affinity binding and reduced neuronal migration-inducing activity, while mutations at Lys83 and Lys84 in Cluster II showed almost no effect on either activity. Chondroitinase ABC-treated PTPζ exhibited similar low affinity binding both to the native midkine and midkine mutants at Arg78.

PTPζ is composed of an N-terminal carbonic anhydrase-like domain, a fibronectin type III domain, a serine, glycine-rich domain that is thought to be chondroitin sulfate attachment region, a transmembrane segment, and two tyrosine phosphatase domains (1Krueger N.X.

We further demonstrated that pleiotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration were suppressed by chondroitin sulfate, polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of PTPζ, and sodium vanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. These findings suggested that PTPζ expressed on neurons is a signal transducing receptor for pleiotrophin (10Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol.

Cancer. 1997; 75: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that they use a common or highly related receptors. Midkine and pleiotrophin are structurally composed of two domains (the N- and C-terminal halves), each of which is tightly held through three or two disulfide bridges, respectively (20Fabri L. Maruta H. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Simpson R.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 646: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of midkine binds strongly to heparin and exhibits neurite outgrowth-promoting and plasminogen activator-enhancing activities (21Asai T. Watanabe K. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kaneda N.

On the other hand, the N-terminal half of midkine, which shows relatively weak heparin binding activity, does not promote neurite outgrowth or enhance plasminogen activator activity (21Asai T.

NMR spectroscopy revealed two clusters of basic amino acids in the C-terminal half of midkine, Clusters I and II, both of which interact with heparin oligosaccharides (23Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Experiments using various midkine mutants indicated that Cluster II plays an essential role in its plasminogen activator-enhancing effect (22Akhter S. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kojima S. Muramatsu H.

In this study, we examined the PTPζ-midkine interaction using various midkine mutants. Native PTPζ exhibited high affinity binding to midkine, and the binding properties were essentially the same as those of pleiotrophin. Moreover, PTPζ-midkine binding was inhibited by the presence of pleiotrophin. These observations suggested that midkine and pleiotrophin share a common binding site on PTPζ. PTPζ bound to the C-terminal half of midkine, but not to the N-terminal half. A mutation R78Q in Cluster I reduced the binding affinity, while mutations K83Q, K84Q, and K83Q/K84Q in Cluster II did not affect binding. Furthermore, in these midkine mutants, the strength of binding affinities and the neuronal migration-inducing activities were highly correlated. These findings suggested that basic amino acids in Cluster I of midkine and pleiotrophin are crucial for high affinity binding to PTPζ to transduce signals in neurons.

PTPζ-S was purified as reported elsewhere (24Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal half domains of human midkine (1–59 and 60–121, respectively) were synthesized as described previously (25Inui T. Bodi J. Kubo S. Nishio H. Kimura T. Kojima S. Maruta H.

Mouse midkine mutants, R78Q, K83Q, K84Q, K83Q/K84Q and R78Q/K83Q/K84Q were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (21Asai T. Watanabe K. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kaneda N. Kojima S. Iguchi A. Inagaki F.

Briefly, dried 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (100 μCi) was solubilized with samples (10 μg of protein in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0), followed by incubation for 3 h on ice and then mixed with 30 μl of 1 mglycine, pH 7.5. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, free125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent was removed by passing through a Chroma Spin 30 column equilibrated with 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The specific radioactivity of the sample thus prepared was 3.3 × 106 cpm/μg. Wells of Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplates were coated with 35 μl of 1∼5 μg/ml midkine or pleiotrophin in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then blocked with 1% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature.125I-PTPζ-S diluted in 0.5% BSA, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, was added to the coated wells. When inhibition experiments were performed, inhibitors (pleiotrophin or glycosaminoglycans) were premixed with 125I-PTPζ-S before addition to the wells. The plates were incubated for 5 h at room temperature and then the wells were washed three times with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The bound materials were released by adding 200 μl of 0.1 m NaOH, 0.2% SDS to the wells. The plates were shaken for 15 min at room temperature and then the eluted radioactivity was measured using a γ counter. 125I-Labeled PTPζ-S was digested with chondroitinase ABC as described previously (10Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-PTPζ-S was diluted with 100 μl of 0.5% BSA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Aliquots (5 milliunits) of protease-free chondroitinase ABC was added to the samples, and the solutions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C for use in binding assays. Boyden chamber cell migration assays were performed using cortical neurons from embryonic day-17 Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (11Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a Micro BCA kit using BSA as a standard. Fig.1 shows the binding profile of125I-labeled PTPζ-S to human midkine-coated ELISA plates. Scatchard analyses of the binding of PTPζ-S to midkine showed low (K d = 3.0 nm) and high (K d = 0.58 nm) affinity binding sites (Fig. 1 B), which were similar to those of pleiotrophin-PTPζ binding (10Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the C-terminal half of midkine exhibited exactly the same binding properties to PTPζ-S as native midkine. On the other hand, the N-terminal half of midkine showed no binding activity to PTPζ-S (Fig. 1). Soluble pleiotrophin premixed with PTPζ-S inhibited the binding of PTPζ-S to pleiotrophin-coated ELISA plates (Fig.2). In a similar dose-dependent manner, soluble pleiotrophin also inhibited the binding of PTPζ-S to midkine on the plates (Fig. 2), suggesting that pleiotrophin and midkine bind to the same binding site on PTPζ-S with a similar affinity. However, fairly high concentrations of pleiotrophin were required for inhibition (IC50 = ∼600 nm) compared with the K d values of midkine- or pleiotrophin-PTPζ-S binding obtained by solid-phase binding assay. These observations suggested that substrate-bound forms of midkine and pleiotrophin exhibit orders of stronger affinity to PTPζ-S than the soluble forms.Figure 2Pleiotrophin inhibits the binding of midkine to PTPζ-S. Binding of125I-PTPζ-S to midkine (●) or pleiotrophin (○) on ELISA plates was measured by solid-phase binding assay in the presence of various concentrations of soluble pleiotrophin. Soluble pleiotrophin inhibited midkine-PTPζ-S binding as well as pleiotrophin-PTPζ-S binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Midkine has two clusters of basic amino acids (Clusters I and II) located at the surface on one side of the C-terminal half domain, which are considered to be heparin binding sites (23Iwasaki W.

Cluster I contains Lys76, Arg78, and Lys99, and Cluster II contains Lys83, Lys84, and Arg86; amino acids were numbered according to mouse midkine. Among these, Lys76, Arg78, Lys83, and Lys99 are conserved in midkine and pleiotrophin of all species examined to date. On the other hand, Lys84 is conserved only in midkine of various species but is changed to Arg in pleiotrophin, and Arg86 is changed to Leu in pleiotrophin of various species and midkine of some species (23Iwasaki W.

Five mouse midkine mutants were prepared, in which some of the basic amino acids in the Cluster I and/or II were changed to glutamine: R78Q, K83Q, K84Q, K83Q/K84Q, and R78Q/K83Q/K84Q (21Asai T.

As shown in Fig.3, K83Q, K84Q, and K83Q/K84Q exhibited essentially the same binding activities to PTPζ-S as the native midkine, suggesting that Cluster II is not essential for midkine-PTPζ binding. In contrast, R78Q and R78Q/K83Q/K84Q exhibited only low affinity binding to PTPζ-S, suggesting that Cluster I plays an important role in the high affinity binding between PTPζ and midkine (Fig. 3 and Table I).Table IBinding of PTPζ to midkine mutantsMidkine mutantK d valueIntact PTPζ-SChase-treated PTPζ-SnmWild-type (human)0.58 and 3.0NDC-terminal half0.55 and 2.4NDN-terminal halfNONDWild-type (mouse)0.56 and 3.88.8R78Q2.88.0K83Q0.51 and 2.5NDK84Q0.61 and 3.6NDK83Q/K84Q0.84 and 4.6NDR78Q/K83Q/K84Q2.810.0NO, no binding; ND, not determined.

Chondroitinase ABC digestion of PTPζ-S reduced its affinity also to midkine (Fig. 4). In contrast to the intact PTPζ-S showing high (K d = ∼0.5 nm) and low (K d = ∼3 nm) affinity binding sites, chondroitinase ABC-digested PTPζ-S exhibited only a low affinity binding site (K d = 8.8 nm) (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, R78Q (Fig. 4, C and D) and R78Q/K83Q/K84Q (TableI), which have a mutation at Arg78, showed a single binding site to intact PTPζ-S with a K d value of 2.8 nm, in a similar affinity range to the chondroitinase ABC-digested PTPζ-S (∼8 nm). This suggested that Arg78 is involved in binding to chondroitin sulfate to make up the high affinity binding site. Previously, we reported that pleiotrophin-PTPζ-S binding is inhibited strongly by heparin, moderately by heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate C, and very weakly by chondroitin sulfate A (10Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans inhibited midkine-PTPζ-S interactions similarly (Fig. 5). Heparin strongly inhibited binding of PTPζ-S to midkine (IC50 = 10 ng/ml), heparan sulfate showed moderate inhibition (IC50 = 100 ng/ml), and keratan sulfate exerted almost no effect. On the other hand, various types of chondroitin sulfate exerted diverse influences on midkine-PTPζ-S binding. Chondroitin sulfate D and chondroitin sulfate E strongly inhibited binding (IC50 = ∼70 ng/ml for both types of chondroitin sulfate). Chondroitin sulfate B and chondroitin sulfate C showed moderate inhibitory effects (IC50 = 500 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml, respectively), but chondroitin sulfate A exerted almost no effect (IC50 > 100 μg/ml). Similar sensitivities to the various chondroitin sulfates were observed for pleiotrophin-PTPζ binding (data not shown; data partly shown in Ref. 10Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We reported previously that pleiotrophin induced cell migration of cortical neurons (11Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Midkine also induced neuronal migration in Boyden chamber cell migration assay with essentially the same dose dependence profile as that of pleiotrophin (data not shown; see Fig. 3A of Ref.11Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Boyden chamber cell migration assay indicated that the C-terminal half of midkine exhibited full cell migration-inducing activity but the N-terminal half was devoid of activity (Fig.6 A). Midkine mutants, K83Q, K84Q, and K83Q/K84Q, which have amino acid replacements in Cluster II, showed normal levels of activity. In contrast, R78Q and R78Q/K83Q/K84Q exhibited low cell migration-inducing activity (Fig. 6 B). These results suggested that Cluster I is sufficient for the neuronal migration-inducing activity of midkine. Midkine-induced neuronal migration was inhibited strongly by heparin, moderately by heparan sulfate, but not by keratan sulfate (Fig. 7). As in the case of midkine-PTPζ-S binding, various types of chondroitin sulfate exerted diverse effects on midkine-induced neuronal migration. Chondroitin sulfate A exhibited almost no effect (Fig. 7). On the other hand, midkine-induced neuronal migration was inhibited strongly by chondroitin sulfate E and moderately by chondroitin sulfates B, C, and D (Fig. 7). Similar inhibitory effects by chondroitin sulfates were observed for pleiotrophin-induced neuronal migration (data not shown; data partly shown in Ref. 11Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that midkine binds to PTPζ. The characteristics of binding of midkine to PTPζ were indistinguishable from those of pleiotrophin (10Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTPζ is a common receptor of midkine and pleiotrophin. Here, the C-terminal half of midkine was revealed to be sufficient for the binding. The C-terminal half domain of midkine exhibits various activities: strong heparin-binding activity, neurite promoting activity, and tissue plasminogen activator enhancing activity (21Asai T. Watanabe K. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kaneda N. Kojima S. Iguchi A. Inagaki F. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Akhter S. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Inui T. Kimura T. Kaneda N. Talukder A.H. Kadomatsu K. Inagaki F. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, specific functions have not been found for the N-terminal half of midkine, although it weakly binds to heparin (21Asai T. Watanabe K. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kaneda N. Kojima S. Iguchi A. Inagaki F. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Akhter S. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Inui T. Kimura T.

Song X.-J. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy indicated that there are two heparin-binding sites in the C-terminal half domain: Cluster I, which is composed of Lys76, Arg78, and Lys99, and Cluster II, which is composed of Lys83, Lys84, and Arg86 (23Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the N-terminal half domain, the basic amino acids do not form clusters which are expected to interact with the sulfate groups on heparin (23Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Muramatsu H. Inui T. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Song X.-J. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our data showed that PTPζ-midkine binding was significantly affected by the mutation of Arg78, but not by mutations of Lys83, Lys84, or Lys83 + Lys84. Here, mutation of Arg78 resulted in loss of high affinity binding between midkine and PTPζ (Fig. 3), and the chondroitin sulfate portion of PTPζ plays an essential role in formation of the high affinity binding site (Fig. 4). Therefore, it seems that Arg78 of midkine is involved in binding to chondroitin sulfate on PTPζ. In support of this idea, various chondroitin sulfate preparations differentially affected midkine-PTPζ binding (Fig. 5). Among various chondroitin sulfate species, there was a significant difference in the inhibiting activity. This finding suggested that there must be a specific structural motif of chondroitin sulfate that strongly inhibits midkine-PTPζ binding. However, the nature of this structure is not known at present because commercially available chondroitin sulfate samples contain considerable heterogeneity. Nevertheless, it is possible to speculate that Arg78 of midkine recognizes a specific structure of chondroitin sulfate on the PTPζ molecule, which is also present in chondroitin sulfates C, D, and E, but not in chondroitin sulfate A. An oversulfated structure is one of the candidates; however, the fine structure of chondroitin sulfate chains of PTPζ must be determined to further clarify this point. A similar finding was reported for DSD-1-PG, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expressed in the rodent central nervous system, that is recognized by a monoclonal antibody 473HD (27Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). DSD-1-PG exhibited neurite outgrowth-promoting activity, which was blocked by 473HD or by chondroitinase ABC digestion of this proteoglycan (27Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The binding of 473HD to DSD-1-PG was inhibited by chondroitin sulfates C and D, but not by chondroitin sulfates A or B (27Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 28Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that a specific structural motif of chondroitin sulfate plays an important physiological function in the brain. Chondroitinase ABC-treated PTPζ showed markedly reduced binding affinity to midkine. Mutations of midkine at Arg78, Lys83, and Lys84 did not influence binding to the chondroitinase ABC-treated PTPζ, suggesting that these amino acids do not play an essential role in binding to the core glycoprotein portion of PTPζ. In summary, there seems to be a hierarchy with three steps in the binding between PTPζ and midkine: 1) low affinity binding between midkine and core glycoprotein portion of PTPζ (K d = ∼8 nm); 2) medium affinity binding between midkine and PTPζ bearing general structure of chondroitin sulfate (K d = ∼3 nm); and 3) high affinity binding between midkine and PTPζ bearing a specific structural motif of chondroitin sulfate (K d = ∼0.6 nm), which involves a specific contribution of Arg78 of midkine. Boyden chamber cell migration assay indicated that the mutation of Arg78 of midkine significantly reduced the neuronal migration-inducing activity of this factor (Fig. 6). In contrast, mutations of Lys83 and Lys84 did not influence this activity. These observations suggested that the high affinity binding of midkine and PTPζ is important for the neuronal migration-inducing activity. Here, heparin strongly inhibited midkine- and pleiotrophin-induced neuronal migration, and only the substrate-bound forms of these factors exhibit this activity (11Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9590-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the finding that PTPζ exhibits very low affinity to soluble pleiotrophin (Fig. 2). In contrast, plasminogen activator-enhancing activity of midkine was markedly reduced by double mutation of Lys83 and Lys84, but not by the single mutation of Arg78, Lys83, or Lys84 (22Akhter S. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Inui T. Kimura T. Kaneda N. Talukder A.H. Kadomatsu K. Inagaki F. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The soluble forms of midkine and pleiotrophin enhance plasminogen activator activity. However, it has been suggested that enzymatic dimerization of midkine and pleiotrophin induced by heparin-like oligosaccharides (presumably endogenous heparan sulfate) is required for plasminogen activator-enhancing activity (17Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9590-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here, exogenously added heparin could substitute for endogenous heparan sulfate (17Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9590-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Taken together, these two activities of midkine and pleiotrophin are thought to be mediated by distinct receptors. Neurite-promoting activity of midkine was also markedly reduced by mutation of Arg78, while mutations of Lys83 and Lys84 were less effective (22Akhter S. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Inui T. Kimura T. Kaneda N. Talukder A.H. Kadomatsu K. Inagaki F. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the neurite-promoting and the neuronal migration-inducing activities of midkine are mediated at least partly by the same or similar receptor(s). Midkine binds to a syndecan family heparan sulfate proteoglycan, ryudocan, with high affinity (29Kojima T. Katsumi A. Yamazaki T. Muramatsu T. Nagasaka T. Ohsumi K. Saito H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5914-5920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Pleiotrophin/heparin-binding growth-associated molecule binds to N-syndecan, which is thought to be another pleiotrophin receptor involved in pleiotrophin-induced neurite extension (30Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would be helpful to examine the binding of syndecan family proteoglycans with midkine mutants to determine the physiological significance of these interactions.

In this study, we have examined the role of PI3K in FAK-promoted cell migration. We have demonstrated that the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, were able to inhibit FAK-promoted migration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a FAK mutant capable of binding Src but not PI3K was generated by a substitution of Asp residue 395 with Ala. When overexpressed in CHO cells, this differential binding mutant failed to promote cell migration although its association with Src was retained. Together, these results strongly suggest that PI3K binding is required for FAK to promote cell migration and that the binding of Src and p130Cas to FAK may not be sufficient for this event.

This 125-kDa nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) is localized to focal contacts in fibroblasts and represents the prototype of a distinct family of nonreceptor PTKs (4Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

In addition to its role in integrin signaling, FAK has also been suggested to be a point of convergence of signaling by other extracellular stimuli (10Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The ability of FAK to transmit signals to downstream targets is dependent on its ability to interact with several intracellular signaling molecules including Src family kinases (11Xing Z. Chen H.-C.

The proline-rich region of FAK (residues 712–718) has been identified as the major binding site for the SH3 domain of p130Cas (15Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mounting evidence suggests that FAK plays an important role in regulating cell migration in response to cell adhesion to ECM proteins (20Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N.

Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a substitution of Tyr-397 with Phe abolished FAK-promoted cell migration (21Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implicating a role for Src and/or PI3K in this phenomenon. PI3K is a heterodimer consisting of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85), and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) (23Escobedo J.A. Navankasattusas S. Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D. Fried V.A. William L.T.

In this report, we have found that a FAK mutant capable of binding to Src, but not to PI3K, failed to stimulate cell migration and that inhibition of PI3K decreases cell migration. Taken together, these results strongly implicate a role for PI3K in the facilitation of FAK-promoted cell migration and suggest that the binding of Src and p130Cas to FAK may not be sufficient for this process.

This was then subcloned into pCDM8-FAK from which the corresponding MscI-NheI fragment had been excised. The resulting plasmid was designated pCDM8-FAK D395A and used to transfect CHO cells. The cDNA encoding the p85 subunit of PI3K that was kindly provided by Dr. L. C. Cantley (Harvard University) was inserted into pKH3 at the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The pEVX plasmid encoding c-Src was kindly provided by Dr. D. Shalloway (Cornell University). HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). One day after plating 5 × 105 cells on 60-mm dishes, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pKH3 plasmids encoding FAK or its mutants using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some cases, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with pKH3-FAK or its mutants, pKH3-p85, and pEVX-Src. Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors as described previously (8Guan J.-L. Shalloway D.

Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) was cloned into pGEX2T at theBamHI and EcoRI sites to generate pGEX-Cas.SH3. GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated with HEK 293 cell lysates (∼10 μg) containing various HA epitope-tagged FAK proteins in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The complexes were washed four times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA. Attached cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing protease inhibitors. To detect the association of FAK with Src and p85 in HEK 293 cells, lysates (50 μg) from cells co-transfected with pKH3-FAK, pKH3-p85, and pEVX-Src were incubated with anti-Src (327) or anti-p85.

To determine the extent of p130Cas phosphorylation in CHO cells overexpressing WT FAK or mutants, lysates (800 μg) were incubated with anti-p130Cas as described (22Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were washed, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA (1:1000), KT3 (1:3000), anti-FAK (1:3000), anti-Src (327) (1:500), anti-p130Cas (1:1000), or anti-PY (1:1000) using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech chemiluminescence system for detection. In some experiments, equal amounts of lysates were analyzed directly by immunoblotting. To measure the tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitroautophosphorylation of ectopically expressed FAK proteins, HA epitope-tagged FAK proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA from HEK 293 cell lysates (50 μg) and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PY or to an in vitro kinase assay as described earlier (8Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). To measure the PI3K activity associated with ectopically expressed FAK proteins in CHO cells, epitope-tagged FAK proteins were immunoprecipitated with KT3 from CHO cell lysates (750 μg) and subjected to an in vitro PI3K assay as described previously (13Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). CHO cell migration assays in 48-well chemotaxis chambers were carried out as described previously (21Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (Sigma) (reconstituted in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C), cells were harvested and washed as described earlier and then resuspended in F-12 medium containing the indicated concentrations of inhibitor or Me2SO such that the final concentration of Me2SO was constant. The cells were pretreated with the inhibitor at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min before loading them onto the chemotaxis chamber. They were allowed to migrate on 12 μg/ml fibronectin for 6 h in the presence of the inhibitor and were then fixed and stained as described previously. For all cell migration assays, migrated cells were enumerated under a light microscope at ×200 magnification using the Image-Pro Plus software, Version 3.0. It is known that PI3K plays an important role in growth factor-induced cell migration (28Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 29Royal I. Park M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To examine the putative role of PI3K in FAK-promoted cell migration, CHO cells overexpressing WT FAK and control cells (Neo) were subjected to cell migration assays in the presence of specific PI3K inhibitors (Fig.1). Treatment of WT cells with either PI3K inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in the presence of either 100 nm wortmannin or 75 μm LY294002, the majority (∼80%) of cell migration promoted by FAK overexpression in WT cells was inhibited, with little effect on control cell migration. These results demonstrate that PI3K plays a role downstream of FAK in promoting CHO cell migration on fibronectin. However, from these results, it was not clear whether FAK-promoted cell migration is dependent on PI3K, either through direct binding at Tyr-397 of FAK or through another FAK-promoted signaling pathway. To determine whether the direct binding of PI3K to FAK is a prerequisite for its function in FAK-promoted cell migration, a FAK mutant deficient only in PI3K binding was generated by a substitution of Asp-395 with Ala (see below). Songyang et al. (32Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) suggested that residues both N- and C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine may contribute to the specific binding of the SH2 domain to its cognate phosphotyrosine and showed that the optimal binding sequence for the p85 N-terminal SH2 domain is EEDpYVEM. An examination of FAK sequences revealed that sequences flanking Tyr-397 (TDDpYAEI) conformed well with the binding motif for the p85 N-terminal SH2 domain. Based on these observations, two Asp residues upstream of Tyr-397 were mutated either singly or in combination to generate a PI3K binding-defective FAK mutant. These FAK mutants were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, and their ability to bind the SH2 domains of Src and p85 was examinedin vitro (Fig. 2 A). Similar to the mutation in Tyr-397, the mutation converting Asp-396 (or in combination with Asp-395) to Ala abolished FAK binding to the SH2 domains of Src and p85. Interestingly, a mutation in Asp-395 inhibited FAK binding to the SH2 domain of p85 but not Src. To examine if the FAK D395A mutant also selectively binds to Src but not p85 in intact cells, HEK 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged FAK or its mutants, c-Src, and p85. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed, and the association of FAK with Src or p85 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with the results from in vitro binding experiments, the mutation in Asp-396 abolished FAK association with both Src and p85, and importantly, the mutation in Asp-395 only prevented FAK association with p85 but not Src. To examine the effects of FAK mutations in Asp-395 and Asp-396 on its tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitro autophosphorylation, HA epitope-tagged WT FAK or its mutants were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PY or to an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3 A). The tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitro autophosphorylation of FAK mutants containing a substitution of Asp-396 with Ala were as low as those of the Y397F mutant, indicating that Asp-396 is essential for the phosphorylation event upon Tyr-397. This also reflects the inability of the FAK D396A mutant to bind the SH2 domains of Src and p85. In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitroautophosphorylation of FAK D395A mutant remained comparable with the WT. These results indicated that the inability of the D395A mutant to bind PI3K was most likely not because of an overall conformational change. To exclude the possibility that the mutation in Asp-395 causes a subtle change in protein conformation and thereby affects the binding of FAK to other proteins, the capacity of FAK D395A to bind to the SH3 domain of p130Cas was examined in vitro (Fig.3 B). The result clearly showed that the ability of FAK to bind the SH3 domain of p130Cas was not affected by mutating Asp-395. Together, these data suggest that the inability of FAK D395A to bind p85 is indeed because of the preference of the p85 SH2 domain for an aspartic acid at residue 395 in FAK. To determine whether PI3K binding is required for FAK-promoted cell migration, stable CHO cell lines overexpressing FAK D395A were established. The expression of FAK D395A was examined by immunoblotting with anti-FAK or KT3 (Fig.4 A). The expression levels of ectopic WT FAK and D395A mutant in CHO cells were comparable and severalfold higher than that of endogenous FAK. To examine the association of endogenous PI3K with WT and mutant FAK in CHO cells, ectopically expressed FAK proteins were immunoprecipitated by mAb KT3, and the immunocomplexes were subjected to an in vitro PI3K activity assay (Fig. 4 B). Approximately 10% of total cellular PI3K activity were found to associate with ectopic WT FAK (data not shown). As expected, the levels of PI3K activity associated with WT FAK and P712/715A mutant were similar. Surprisingly, approximately 15% of PI3K activity that WT FAKs had were co-precipitated with Y397F and D395A mutants. The cell migration assays indicated a marked increase (∼2.5-fold) in cell migration for WT cells compared with both Y397F and control (Neo) cells, which were similar in their rates of migration. Interestingly, both D395A clones failed to promote cell migration (Fig. 4 C). These results together suggest that the residual binding of PI3K to FAK Y397F or D395A mutant in CHO cells is not sufficient for promoting migration. Moreover, adhesion assays indicated that all clones had similar adhesive strength to fibronectin (data not shown), indicating that the decrease in migration observed in D395A clones was not because of an alteration in cell adhesion. We have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of Tyr-397 in FAK is required for binding the SH2 domains of Src and PI3K (17Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether the inability of FAK Y397F to promote cell migration is because of its inability to bind Src and/or PI3K. To clarify this, the association of FAK D395A with c-Src in CHO cells was examined. Both WT FAK and FAK D395A but not FAK Y397F co-precipitated with c-Src in CHO cells (Fig. 5 A). We have previously demonstrated that the association of p130Caswith FAK and FAK-promoted phosphorylation of p130Cas by Src are critical for FAK-promoted migration (22Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We examined the phosphorylation state of p130Cas in FAK D395A cells as an indicator of a FAK/Src-depending cell migration pathway as well as an indirect indicator of FAK/p130Cas association. Consistent with prior experiments (22Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), WT FAK exhibited a promotion of p130Cas phosphorylation compared with the FAK P712/715A (Fig. 5 B), which is unable to bind p130Cas or promote p130Cas phosphorylation (22Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). FAK D395A was able to promote p130Cas phosphorylation at an estimated 2-fold level above WT FAK, indicating that the FAK/Src specific pathway is still functioning in the D395A mutant. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that PI3K binding to FAK is required for FAK to promote cell migration and that FAK:Src association alone may be insufficient for this cellular function. In this report, we examined the role of PI3K in FAK-promoted cell migration. First we showed that two PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, were able to inhibit FAK-promoted migration in a dose-dependent manner. Our results are consistent with other work showing the importance of PI3K in increased cell motility stimulated by growth factors such as PDGF and hepatocyte growth factor (28Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 29Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 30Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B.M. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, these data do not indicate whether PI3K association with FAK is required for increased cell migration and cannot rule out the involvement of PI3K in a FAK-independent migration pathway. To address this, we next established stable cell lines overexpressing FAK and a mutant defective in PI3K binding. Using this system, we showed that the PI3K binding-deficient mutant failed to promote cell migration toward fibronectin. These results strongly suggest that FAK:PI3K association is required for FAK-promoted cell migration. We have previously identified that the autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 is the primary site for PI3K binding (17Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and is required for the function of FAK in promoting cell migration (21Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that the introduction of a mutation in Asp-395 completely abolishes FAK association with PI3K SH2 domain but not Src SH2 domain in vitro. The D395A mutant transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells also loses its ability to bind to intact p85 but not Src. However, in CHO cells some residual binding of PI3K to Y397F and D395A mutants can be detected, indicating that other mechanisms such as SH3 interaction may also be involved. This result is consistent with the previous report that the SH3 domain of p85 could bind to a proline-rich region (amino acids 875–884) of FAK in vitro (33Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Bacaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and suggest that an SH3 interaction besides SH2 interaction might also participate in FAK:PI3K interactions in response to certain stimuli in different cell types. Furthermore, together with our observation that FAK D395A mutant retained its tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitrophosphorylation to the same level as WT FAK, it appears that Asp-395 makes a major contribution for specific binding of the SH2 domains of PI3K to FAK. This finding also supports the notion that residues N-terminal of phosphotyrosine are critical for specific binding to certain SH2 domain-containing proteins. Previous results from our laboratory showed that a FAK mutant (P712/715A) deficient in p130Cas binding failed to promote cell migration (22Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that FAK D395A deficient in PI3K binding also failed to increase cell migration. Although a residual binding of PI3K to D395A mutant was detected in CHO cells, it was apparently not sufficient for promoting cell migration. In fact, an analogous situation has also been described that a residual binding of p130Cas to FAK P712/715A mutant possibly mediated by a second proline-rich region (amino acids 875–884) on FAK does not allow for FAK-promoted migration (22Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These results together suggest that thresholds of signals transmitted independently through the associations of p130Cas and PI3K with FAK have to be reached for enhanced cell migration. Lack of either one will not turn on an “intracellular machinery” for the induction of cell migration. Another possible interpretation is that the inability of FAK D395A to promote cell migration is because of a defect in p130Cas binding. This defect may result from a subtle conformation change by the D395A substitution, or a mutually dependent binding of PI3K and p130Cas to FAK. The latter possibility was excluded by our observation that the D395A mutant retained its ability to bind the SH3 domain of p130Cas in vitro and promote p130Cas phosphorylation in vivo. The tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and its subsequent association with the adapter protein Crk have been shown to play an important role in promoting cell migration (34Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In addition, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas has also been shown to be a result of binding to FAK (22Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that expression of FAK D395A increased p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation at a roughly 2-fold level above WT FAK in CHO cells. Although the reason for this elevation in p130Cas phosphorylation is unclear, this result supports our conclusion that p130Cas binding and phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for FAK-promoted cell migration. Furthermore, several studies have shown that Src is important for phosphorylation of p130Cas (35Vouri K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahtti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because FAK D395A still binds to Src, our results also suggest that FAK:Src association alone is not sufficient for the enhancement of cell migration. However, we cannot exclude the necessity of Src in FAK-promoted cell migration because of its function, at least, in phosphorylating p130Cas. Therefore, it is likely that FAK-promoted cell migration depends on the coordinate regulation of a number of these signaling events involving PI3K, p130Cas, and Src. We have previously shown that FAK:PI3K association is enhanced by cell adhesion to ECM proteins (13Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) or PDGF stimulation (31Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that this association is likely to be involved in cell migration upon cell adhesion to ECM proteins. However, it is not clear if this interaction is also involved in PDGF-stimulated cell migration. Furthermore, we do not know if FAK generally participates in growth factor-induced cell motility using a mechanism similar to that in ECM protein-induced cell migration. It is known that the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is stimulated by a number of growth factors (31Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,37Matsumoto K. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which growth factor receptors and integrins regulate FAK phosphorylation may be different (38Chen H.-C. Chan P.-C. Tang M.-J. Cheng C.-H. Chang T.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it is possible that phosphorylated FAK recruits the same set of intracellular signaling molecules to facilitate cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W1988841577,"The Sp100 and promyelocytic leukemia proteins (PML) are constituents of nuclear domains, known as nuclear dots (NDs) or PML bodies, and are both covalently modified by the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO-1. NDs play a role in autoimmunity, virus infections, and in the etiology of acute promyelocytic leukemia. To date, little is known about the function of the Sp100 protein. Here we analyzed Sp100 domains that determine its subcellular localization, dimerization, and SUMOylation. A functional nuclear localization signal and an ND-targeting region that coincides with an Sp100 homodimerization domain were mapped. Sequences similar to the Sp100 homodimerization/ND-targeting region occur in several other proteins and constitute a novel protein motif, termed HSR domain. The lysine residue of the Sp100 protein, to which SUMO-1 is covalently linked, was mapped within and may therefore modulate the previously described HP1 protein-binding site. A consensus sequence for SUMOylation of proteins in general is suggested. SUMOylation strictly depended on a functional nuclear localization signal but was not necessary for nuclear import or ND targeting. A three-dimensional structure of Sp100, which supports the mapping data and provides additional information on Sp100 structure/function relationships, was generated by computer modeling. Taken together, our studies indicate the existence of well defined Sp100 domains with functions in ND targeting, nuclear import, nuclear SUMOylation, and protein-protein interaction. The Sp100 and promyelocytic leukemia proteins (PML) are constituents of nuclear domains, known as nuclear dots (NDs) or PML bodies, and are both covalently modified by the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO-1. NDs play a role in autoimmunity, virus infections, and in the etiology of acute promyelocytic leukemia. To date, little is known about the function of the Sp100 protein. Here we analyzed Sp100 domains that determine its subcellular localization, dimerization, and SUMOylation. A functional nuclear localization signal and an ND-targeting region that coincides with an Sp100 homodimerization domain were mapped.

Modification of proteins by SUMO-1 resembles the ubiquitinylation pathway in that SUMO is attached to an internal lysine residue but requires a unique set of activating and conjugating enzymes (50Mahajan R.

Ottmann, and M. Ruthardt, submitted for publication.2T. Sternsdorf, E. Puccetti, K. Jensen, D. Hoelzer, H. Will, O. G. Ottmann, and M. Ruthardt, submitted for publication.In this study, we have performed a series of experiments in order to characterize further the Sp100 protein regarding nuclear localization, ND targeting, homomeric interaction, and the role of covalent modification of Sp100 by SUMO-1. We have demonstrated that SUMO modification of Sp100 strictly depends on nuclear import but does not affect or require ND localization. Finally, we have performed molecular modeling in order to generate a tertiary structure prediction for Sp100.DISCUSSIONIn our study, we have performed a detailed characterization of structural and functional sequence features of the Sp100 protein regarding subcellular localization, dimerization, and covalent modification by SUMO-1. We have mapped the Sp100 NLS, as well as a ND-targeting and dimerization sequence which defines a new protein motif, termed HSR domain, also present in other proteins. Furthermore, we have identified the lysine residue necessary for modification of Sp100 by SUMO-1 and demonstrated that a functional NLS is essential for modification of Sp100 by SUMO-1. We have shown that SUMOylation of Sp100 is not essential for ND targeting of Sp100 and, vice versa, that ND targeting is not necessary for SUMOylation. Finally, we propose a consensus sequence for SUMOylation of proteins based on the comparison of the known SUMOylation motifs on other proteins. A three-dimensional structural prediction of the Sp100 protein was generated by molecular modeling. Consistent with our mapping data in this model all functional sites of the Sp100 protein were found in surface-exposed regions.So far, separation of the ND-targeting and dimerization motif was not possible, because the shortest Sp100 fragment Sp-(1–75) could not be detected by immunofluorescence staining. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the ND targeting observed for the transiently expressed Sp100 polypeptides may be in part or even in toto be due to dimerization of the protein with endogenous Sp100 located at NDs. However, since our data provide indirect evidence that Sp100 can dimerize, but probably not multimerize, the ND targeting has to be, at least in part, due to a targeting toward the Sp100 docking site at NDs, independently of homodimerization. Another possibility is that the Sp100 multimerization capability is restricted to the fraction of Sp100 localized at NDs, possibly due to a changed conformation when compared with Sp100 in solution, as it is present in the cytoplasm of cells (42Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and in the cellular extracts used for our immunoprecipitation experiments. The fact that Sp100 with a mutated NLS exhibits a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution also argues against multimer formation of Sp100 alone. Accordingly, using Sp100 from solubilized cellular protein extracts, only the dimeric form would be observed. However, a definite answer as to whether Sp100 is capable of multimer formation requires additional experiments, like sucrose gradient analysis. Analysis of further Sp100 protein subfragments is required in order to separate homomeric interaction from ND targeting in order to confine the ND targeting signal of Sp100. As this signal would be expected to interact with novel ND components, the identification of the sequences necessary is of major interest for the isolation of these components. One has to keep in mind, however, that it is very well possible that homodimerization of the corresponding Sp100 domain might be required in order to generate a functional ND-targeting signal.An interesting finding in these studies was the discovery of a novel protein motif, the HSR domain, within this ND targeting/dimerization domain. It will be interesting to investigate whether the corresponding domains in the other members of the HSR domain family proteins have the same function. In fact, at least the LYSP100/Sp140 protein shows partial (38Dent A.L. Yewdell J. Puviondutilleul F. Koken M.H.M. de Thé H. Staudt L.M. Blood. 1996; 88: 1423-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or even complete (20Bloch D.B. de la Monte S.M. Guigaouri P. Filippov A. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29198-29204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) co-localization with NDs in lymphocytes, and also for the murine Sp100-rs protein an ND localization is likely (62Grötzinger T.

It could be hypothesized also that the AIRE protein and the AA431918 protein are novel ND proteins. Remarkably, three members of the HSR family share more extensive sequence similarity. The Sp100 splice variant Sp100-B (SpAlt-212), the LYSP100/Sp140 protein, and the AIRE protein share the N-terminal HSR domain and an additional protein motif toward the C terminus called the HNPP box (34Sternsdorf T.

Sternsdorf T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 749-759PubMed Google Scholar), also recently termed the SAND domain (69Gibson T.J. Ramu C. Gemund C. Aasland R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 242-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recent data from our laboratory argue that the HNPP box/SAND domain might direct proteins to nuclear domains different from NDs and therefore represent a targeting signal antagonistic to the HSR domain on the same molecule (41Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Schröder P. Matschl U. Jensen K. Lüders C. Will H. Sternsdorf T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 749-759PubMed Google Scholar). One could speculate that the genes encoding these proteins represent a family derived from a common ancestor gene and might fulfill similar functions in the cell. The AIRE protein is of special interest in this regard, as it is mutated in a monogenic hereditary autoimmune disease and appears to play a major role in control of the immune response (70Finnish-German APECED Consortium Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar).Another interesting observation in our studies is the redistribution of NDs caused by expression of the C-terminal Sp100 fragments Sp100-(208–480), Sp100-(326–480), and Sp100-(208–334). As these Sp100 fragments are diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm, redistribution of NDs is most likely due to an indirect effect, such as competition of the overexpressed Sp100 fragment for cellular factors. As this redistribution was also observed when a Sp100-(208–480) K297R mutant was expressed, it is most likely not due to competition for cellular SUMO-1 (data not shown). However, it is also conceivable that the Sp100 fragments compete for the corresponding SUMO-modifying enzyme, thereby leading to hypomodification of ND-located cellular Sp100 and/or PML, which may result in redistribution of NDs. Alternatively, competition for other cellular factors, such as kinases, could play a role. In fact, the region present on all three Sp100 constructs tested (aa 326–334) contains a consensus casein kinase 2 phosphorylation site.SUMO modification of proteins has recently been shown to be a novel cellular mechanism of general importance for a multitude of biological processes (reviewed in Ref. 66Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, the identification and mutational analysis of the Sp100 SUMOylation site as shown here is of general relevance. The strict dependence of SUMO modification of Sp100 on nuclear targeting raises the question whether SUMO modification is restricted to the nuclear compartment in general. In fact, most of the proteins for which covalent SUMOylation has been demonstrated so far,i.e. Sp100, PML, and IκB can be found, at least in part, inside the nucleus. For IκB translocation into the nucleus of the newly synthesized protein was demonstrated (71Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For RanGAP-1, staining at the mitotic spindle was reported (47Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Taking this into account, one could hypothesize that SUMOylation of proteins could involve nuclear import as an obligatory step. Whether the modification reaction itself occurs in the nucleoplasm, during nuclear import, or after docking at the nuclear pore at the outside of the nuclear pore in the cytoplasm remains to be shown. Since in our experiments the Sp100-(208–480) polypeptide with a diffuse nuclear localization still becomes SUMOylated, ND targeting is most likely not a prerequisite for SUMOylation. Another open question is whether the proteins (described in previous works) to interact with SUMO-1, such as the tumor necrosis factor receptor, Fas, Rad51, and Rad52, are indeed modified by SUMO-1 or only interact with the SUMO-1 modification of another protein, which in turn again could be modified in the nucleus. If so, SUMO-1 modification could very well be part of a signaling cascade.In our study, we found no effect of removal of SUMO modification of Sp100 by mutagenesis on nuclear import or ND targeting of the protein. In this regard, SUMO modification of Sp100 differs obviously from that of the PML protein, which was reported to be severely compromised in ND targeting when SUMO modification was abolished by mutagenesis (54Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Wada H. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26675-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, since one of the known functions of SUMO modification is protein targeting, as shown for the RanGAP1 protein, which is bound to the nuclear pore when modified by SUMO-1 (49Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 50Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), one may hypothesize that SUMOylation regulates protein-protein interaction also in the case of Sp100. A good candidate for such a SUMO-regulated association is the HP1 protein, which has been reported to interact directly with Sp100 (22Lehming N. Le Saux A. Schuller J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 40Seeler J.S. Marchio A. Sitterlin D. Transy C. Dejean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7316-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the interaction domain was mapped to amino acids 287–333. Given the relative size of SUMO-1 modification, which is similar to that of ubiquitin (shown in Fig. 10), one would expect that SUMO modification of Sp100 at amino acid position 297 will interfere with HP1 binding. This could either enhance binding, as in the case of RanGAP1, or on the other hand, prevent HP1 association through steric hindrance. Co-precipitation experiments in order to elucidate a possible role of SUMO-1 modification in regulation of HP1 binding to Sp100 are currently underway. On the other hand, SUMOylation was reported to act as a stabilizing factor by counteracting ubiquitin-mediated degradation (51Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 72Everett R.D. Freemont P. Saitoh H. Dasso M. Orr A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6581-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we currently have no evidence that Sp100 lacking the SUMOylation site is less stable than SUMO-modified Sp100 when transiently expressed. We also do not know whether the unmodified form of Sp100 is more rapidly degraded than the modified"

To understand better the functional role of KCC2 in the nervous system, we developed polyclonal antibodies to a KCC2 fusion protein and used these antibodies to characterize and localize KCC2 in the rat cerebellum.

The distinct postsynaptic localization of KCC2 and its colocalization with GABAA receptor in the cerebellum are consistent with the putative role of KCC2 in neuronal Cl− extrusion and postsynaptic inhibition. The K-Cl cotransporter mediates an obligatorily coupled, electroneutral movement of K+ and Cl− ions across the plasma membrane of many animal cells. The K-Cl cotransporter is normally a net efflux pathway, using the favorable K+chemical gradient maintained by the Na+,K+-ATPase, to drive Cl− out of the cell. The cotransporter, however, is bi-directional and can mediate a net efflux or influx, depending upon the prevailing K+and Cl− chemical gradients. The predominant function of this transporter is cellular ion and water homeostasis. For example, in red blood cells a K-Cl cotransporter is involved in cell volume regulation (1Dunham P.B. Reuss L. Russell J.M. Szabo G. Regulation of Potassium Transport across Biological Membranes. University of Texas Press, Austin1990: 331-360Google Scholar). Additionally, a K-Cl cotransporter may play an important role in salt transport across certain epithelia (2Reuss L. Nature. 1983; 305: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Yoshiyama N. Shiigai T. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In neurons, a K-Cl cotransporter appears to serve as the active Cl− extrusion mechanism responsible for maintaining the Cl− reversal potential (E Cl) less than the membrane potential (E m) as required for the proper function of GABAA 1The abbreviations used are: GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A; ABC, avidin-biotin complex; DAB, diaminobenzidine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GS/PBS, goat serum phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney; [Cl−]i, intracellular Cl− concentration; [K+]o, extracellular [K+]; KCC1, ubiquitous K-Cl cotransporter; KCC2, neuron-specific K-Cl cotransporter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1- bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineand glycine receptors in postsynaptic inhibition (for reviews see Refs. 4Alvarez-Leefmans F.J.

Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 489-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Recently, two isoforms of the K-Cl cotransporter have been identified and functionally characterized (KCC1, Ref. 6Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar and KCC2, Refs. 7Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F.

KCC1 has a ubiquitous tissue distribution, and functional expression studies demonstrated that it was activated by cell swelling as well as by application of N-ethylmaleimide. Both of these treatments are well known activators of the red blood cell K-Cl cotransport system (6Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Furthermore, like the K-Cl cotransporter studied in red blood cells, exogenously expressed KCC1 exhibited low transport affinity for both external K+ (K m >25 mm) and external Cl− (K m>50 mm). These data support the hypothesis that KCC1 represents the “housekeeping” isoform of the K-Cl cotransporter involved in cell volume regulation (6Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In contrast, KCC2 was determined to be neuron-specific and displayed unique functional characteristics, including the lack of swelling activation and a remarkably high apparent affinity for external K+(K m = 5 mm; Refs. 7Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar and 8Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These functional characteristics indicated that KCC2 may have a novel function in the nervous system, distinct from the volume regulatory role of KCC1. As KCC2 appears to be a neuron-specific isoform, we have hypothesized that it is involved in active Cl− extrusion. Based on thermodynamic considerations, an electroneutral K-Cl cotransporter can function to maintain very low intracellular [Cl−] ([Cl−]i; 5–7 mm) and E Cl more negative thanE m. However, with such a low [Cl−]i, the driving force for net K-Cl cotransport will be very close to thermodynamic equilibrium (8Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, KCC2 with its high affinity for external K+ can function as a very efficient neuronal K+ uptake system whenever external [K+] ([K+]o) becomes elevated (>5 mm) and reverses the driving force for net K-Cl cotransport from efflux to influx. With the driving force for net K-Cl cotransport poised at equilibrium, KCC2 will be very sensitive to subtle changes in both [Cl−]i and [K+]o, and therefore, it may function as a “dynamic buffer” of these two ion concentrations. This hypothesis is unifying as it provides a cellular mechanism to account for the functional link between increases in [K+]o and alterations in neuronal [Cl−]i and GABAA receptor function, all of which occur after repetitive stimulation (i.e. activity-dependent disinhibition). Previous in situ hybridization studies supported a neuron-specific localization of the KCC2 transcript in rat brain (7Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Cellular localization, however, of the KCC2 protein in the mammalian nervous system has not been performed. This may provide important information about the role of KCC2 in neuronal function. We hypothesized that if KCC2 is important in postsynaptic inhibition, it should colocalize with GABAA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. In the present report, we have prepared and characterized antibodies specific for the KCC2 protein and used these anti-KCC2 antibodies to characterize and localize the protein in the rat cerebellum. The rat cerebellum was chosen because of its very high expression of the KCC2 transcript (7Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The KCC2 protein was restricted to neuronal somata and dendrites, and in the granule cell layer of the rat cerebellum it exhibited a distinct colocalization with the β2/β3-subunits of the GABAAreceptor. These data are fully consistent with KCC2 having an important role in neuronal Cl− extrusion and postsynaptic inhibition. A KCC2 fusion protein (termed B22) was prepared, containing a 112-amino acid segment of the carboxyl terminus of rat KCC2 (amino acids 932–1043). The sequence encoding the fusion protein was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (forward primer—GAATTCAGCATCACAGATGAATCTCG; reverse primer—CTCGAGTTAGTTCAAGTTTTCCCACTCCG). The reaction volume of 50 μl contained 5 μl of template cDNA (ERB10 clone at 2 ng/μl; see Ref. 7Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), 0.2 μm of each primer, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25 °C), 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Thirty cycles of PCR were performed (each consisting of incubation of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The PCR product was cloned into the plasmid pCR2.1 following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Using the restriction sites engineered into the forward (EcoRI) and reverse (XhoI) PCR primers, the insert in the pCR2.1 vector was subcloned into pET28 and then sequenced in both directions. The fusion protein was produced in E. coli according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI). The B22 fusion protein was very soluble in 1× binding buffer (5 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 0.1% Triton X-100). It was purified using metal chelation chromatography following the manufacturer's instructions (His-Bind Resin; Novagen, Madison, WI). The B22 fusion protein was eluted from the column using a linear imidazole gradient (60 mm to 1m). Four of the 1-ml fractions containing most of the eluted protein were combined and concentrated by centrifugation in microconcentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). This method of purification yields relatively pure B22 fusion protein with no other visible bands on Coomassie-stained gels (data not shown). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against the purified B22 fusion protein by the Rabbit Antibody Production Program (Animal Resource Service of the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis). Purified B22 fusion protein (250–300 μg) was injected subcutaneously with complete Freund's adjuvant. All subsequent boost injections were performed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Preimmune serum was obtained prior to first injection. Immune sera used in the present study was harvested >30 days after the second boost injection. Immune antisera were purified using affinity chromatography. The B22 fusion protein was coupled to 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole-activated agarose beads following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Immune antisera was incubated 2 days at 4 °C with B22 fusion protein-coupled agarose beads. Specific antibodies were eluted from the beads with 50 mm glycine (pH 2.7). Purified antibodies were stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C. The NG-108 and N1E-115 cells were maintained in growth medium, containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT) supplement, and 2 mm l-glutamine. All other cultured cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A previous report described the development of HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing rat KCC2 protein (8Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These stable HEK-293 cell lines (KCC2–9 and KCC2–22T) were maintained in growth medium containing 900 μg/ml geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). A KCC1-KCC2 chimeric construct was produced by ligating rat KCC1 and rat KCC2 cDNA at a common BamHI site. This common BamHI site occurs 9 amino acids (i.e. 28 nucleotides) beyond the last predicted transmembrane segment of both proteins. The resulting construct had rat KCC2 encoding the hydrophilic amino-terminal region and transmembrane segments and rat KCC1 encoding the remaining large carboxyl-terminal domain. This rat KCC1-KCC2 chimeric construct (termed KCC2–1C) also contained a 10 amino acid c-myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) at the amino terminus of the protein. A stable HEK-293 cell line expressing the KCC2–1C construct was produced using previously described methods (9Payne J.A. Xu J.-C. Haas M. Lytle C.Y. Ward D. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17977-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Dispersed retinal cultures were prepared from embryonic chickens by methods previously described (10Gleason E. Borges S. Wilson M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 131: 2359-2370Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons from 8-day-old chick embryo retinas were dissociated in 0.1% trypsin. Cells were seeded into culture dishes containing poly-l-ornithine-coated glass coverslips. Cells were maintained in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 400 μm l-glutamine. Retinal cultures were incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cultured retinal cells were obtained for immunodetection after 16 days in culture. Membranes were prepared from freshly isolated tissue and from cultured cell lines using differential centrifugation. Briefly, tissue was dissected or scraped off of culture plates and homogenized in 10–40 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 10 mmHEPES, 1 mm EDTA; pH adjusted to 7.2 at 24 °C) containing protease inhibitors. Following 10 strokes in a glass-Teflon homogenizer, the homogenate was centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C (Sorval RC5, SS-34 rotor). The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The final pellet was resuspended in ∼100–500 μl of homogenization buffer with protease inhibitors and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a Micro-BCA protein kit (Pierce). Membrane proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 7.5% Tricine gel system. Gels were electrophoretically transferred from unstained gels to PVDF membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) in transfer buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), and 15% methanol) for ≥5 h at 50 V using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot tank apparatus. PVDF-bound protein was visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The PVDF membrane was blocked in PBS/milk (7% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (pH 7.4)) for 1 h and then incubated in PBS/milk with either preimmune serum, anti-KCC2 immune serum, affinity purified anti-KCC2 antibody, or c-mycmonoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at 24 °C. After three 10-min washes in PBS/milk, the PVDF membrane was incubated with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 2 h at 24 °C in PBS/milk. After three washes in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, bound antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (NEN Life Science Products). Deglycosylation experiments were performed on membranes (20 μg) isolated from whole rat brain and HEK-293 stable cells. Membranes were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a medium containing 0.5%n-octyl glucoside, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 50 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, andN-glycosidase F (20 units/ml; Boehringer Mannheim). Control samples were treated similarly, but incubation was carried out in the absence of N-glycosidase F. Enzymatic treatment was terminated by addition of electrophoresis sample buffer supplemented with 6 m urea. Control and deglycosylated membrane proteins were separated on 7.5% Tricine gels, and KCC2 protein was identified by Western blotting. Immunocytochemical detection of KCC2, GABAA receptor, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) employed affinity purified rabbit anti-KCC2 polyclonal antibodies, mouse anti-GABAA receptor β-subunit monoclonal antibody (Chemicon; Temecula, CA), and mouse anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). The anti-GABAA receptor antibody is specific for the β2/β3-subunits (11Richards J.G. Schoch P. Haring P. Takacs B. Mohler H. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1866-1886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ewert M. DeBlas A.L. Mohler H. Seeburg P.H. Brain Res. 1992; 569: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both an avidin-biotin complex (ABC)-horseradish peroxidase technique and fluorescent labeling were used for immunocytochemical detection in rat cerebellum. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–275 g) were anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/100 g intraperitoneally) and xylazine (0.1 mg/100 g intraperitoneally) and injected with heparin (10 units/100 g intraperitoneally). Their vasculature was immediately flushed with 200 ml of heparinized 0.9% saline and perfused with 500 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS via the ascending aorta. Brains were removed, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h, frozen in 2-methyl butane on dry ice, embedded in TBS mounting media (Fisher), and stored at −80 °C. A Bright Instruments cryostat produced 15–30-μm frozen coronal sections. For immunoperoxidase labeling, cerebellar sections were washed 3 times in PBS and then placed in 2% goat serum/PBS (GS/PBS; PBS containing 2% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated at 4 °C for 48 h with primary antibody diluted 1:200 in GS/PBS. After three PBS washes, sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either a biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 3 h in an avidin/horseradish peroxidase solution prepared from an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Following three washes in PBS, the horseradish peroxidase reaction was carried out using diaminobenzidine (DAB; 0.015% in PBS, Sigma) and 0.001% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were triple washed in PBS and mounted on silanized slides. Some sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Sections stained with DAB were taken through an ethanol/xylene dehydration series and coverslipped with Permount (Fisher). Photographs of DAB-stained sections were taken with a Zeiss 135 microscope. Double-labeled fluorescent immunocytochemical detection of KCC2 with either the β2/β3-subunits of GABAA receptor or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was conducted on 10–15-μm cryostat sections that were free-floated in 24-well tissue culture plates or mounted on slides. Sections were blocked in 20% GS/PBS (PBS containing 20% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 3 h at 24 °C and then incubated for 3 h at 24 °C with either anti-GABAA-receptor antibody or anti-GFAP antibody. After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 2 h at 24 °C with a fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200, Jackson Labs, West Grove, PA). Sections were washed 3 times in PBS and stored overnight in PBS at 4 °C. Sections were again blocked for 3 h in 20% GS/PBS and then incubated with anti-KCC2 antibodies (1:200) for 3 h at 24 °C. Following three PBS washes, sections were incubated for 2 h with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson Laboratories). Sections were then washed 3 times in PBS, once in distilled water, and mounted on acid-washed slides with Gel Mount (Biomedia, Foster City, CA). Cerebellar sections were examined, and digital images were obtained using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss 510 or Leica TCS-NT). Immunoperoxidase labeling of KCC2 in retinal cultures employed the same basic procedures outlined above with the following modifications. Retinal cultures grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 24 °C. They were washed 3 times in PBS and blocked with GS/PBS for 3 h at 24 °C. Cell cultures were incubated with anti-KCC2 antibodies for 3 h, washed 3 times in PBS, and then incubated at 24 °C for 2 h with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories). After 3 PBS washes, cells were incubated for 3 h in the avidin/horseradish peroxidase solution (ABC kit), and the DAB reaction was carried out as outlined above. Cultured cells were mounted on slides and then examined and photographed with a Zeiss 135 microscope. Two types of controls were performed for immunocytochemistry. For each experiment, every third slide was incubated without primary antibody. None of the control slides run without primary antibody showed significant staining or fluorescent signal. A second control was performed with the B22 fusion protein in an antigen adsorption experiment, similar to that presented in Fig. 2 B for Western blots. Various amounts of the B22 fusion protein (0, 300 ng, 1, 3, or 100 μg) were diluted into 490 μl of GS/PBS. Affinity purified anti-KCC2 polyclonal antibody (10 μl) was mixed with the B22 fusion protein samples and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the tubes were spun at 11,000 rpm for 10 min. A 250-μl aliquot of the supernatant was drawn off and diluted with GS/PBS to a 1-ml final volume. This was used as the diluted primary antibody for brain sections and paralleled the KCC2 polyclonal antibody dilution factor of 1:200 for immunocytochemistry. Five brain sections were incubated at 4 °C for 48 h or at 24 °C for 3 h with each fusion protein-KCC2 antibody reaction supernatant employing the immunocytochemical protocol outlined above. The B22 fusion protein (>1 μg) was able to prevent specific staining of the anti-KCC2 antibodies in rat brain sections (data not shown). We targeted the development of KCC2 antibodies to the predicted intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain, as this represents a large hydrophilic region of the protein containing a number of areas with high antigenicity (PEPTIDESTRUCTURE program, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Since both KCC1 and KCC2 are known to be present in the rat brain (6Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), our goal was to develop antibodies that were specific for the KCC2 protein. To this end, we generated a fusion protein (B22) that contained a small segment of the carboxyl terminus of KCC2. The 112 amino acids contained within the B22 fusion protein are very poorly conserved between the KCC1 and KCC2 isoforms as follows: 1) only 61 of the 112 amino acids align with KCC1 and they display very low identity to KCC1 (31%), and 2) the remaining 51 amino acids represent residues unique to the KCC2 sequence (i.e. deleted from KCC1). Therefore, use of this region of KCC2 as antigen had a high likelihood of producing KCC2-specific antibodies. Western blots of rat brain membranes using sera from animals immunized with the B22 fusion protein showed strong reactivity to a broad ∼140-kDa band that was not observed with preimmune sera (Fig.1). A number of additional bands were observed at high membrane loads; however, these bands were present at much lower intensity than the ∼140-kDa band. In order to purify the B22 antisera, we cross-linked the B22 fusion protein to agarose beads in an affinity column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Affinity purification of the B22 antisera completely removed all nonspecific bands on the Western blot of rat brain membranes, demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies for the ∼140-kDa band (Fig.2 A). These data provide strong evidence that the ∼140-kDa band represents the KCC2 protein. In all subsequent experiments, we refer to affinity purified antisera as anti-KCC2 antibodies. The specificity of the anti-KCC2 antibodies for the ∼140-kDa band was tested further in an immunoadsorption experiment. B22 fusion protein was incubated at increasing amounts with a fixed amount of antibody. The B22 fusion protein at levels ≥1 μg was able to prevent completely any reactivity of the anti-KCC2 antibodies when tested against rat brain membranes on strip blots (Fig.2 B). In order to provide further evidence of antibody specificity and to test potential antibody cross-reactivity with the KCC1 protein, we used the anti-KCC2 antibodies on Western blots of membranes prepared from various HEK-293 cell lines. Membranes were prepared from control untransfected HEK-293 cells and HEK-293 cells stably expressing either a full-length KCC2 construct (KCC2–22T) or a chimeric construct of KCC1 and KCC2 (KCC2–1C). We have previously described the development and functional expression of the KCC2–22T cell line that expresses the full-length KCC2 protein (8Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chimeric protein expressed by the KCC2–1C cell line contains the amino-terminal and transmembrane domains of KCC2 and the carboxyl-terminal domain of KCC1. In this chimera, the region over which the B22 fusion protein was prepared has now been replaced with KCC1 sequence. The KCC2–1C chimera is functional as the KCC2–1C cell line expressed a significantly elevated furosemide-sensitive 86Rb influx relative to control cells (data not shown). Both the KCC2 and KCC2–1C constructs were epitope-tagged with an amino-terminal c-myc peptide. The c-myc peptide monoclonal antibody displayed no reactivity in control HEK-293 cells but recognized a broad ∼150-kDa protein in the two stably transfected cell lines (Fig.3 A). The exogenously expressed KCC2 protein consistently ran ∼10 kDa larger than that from rat brain. Data presented below will show that this discrepancy in size is due to differences in glycosylation of the native and exogenously expressed KCC2 protein. The lower ∼125-kDa band observed in both stably transfected cell lines, but most prominently in the KCC2–22T cell line, represents intracellular protein prior to addition of oligosaccharides. This is commonly observed in overexpressing cells (9Payne J.A. Xu J.-C. Haas M. Lytle C.Y. Ward D. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17977-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In contrast to the c-myc peptide antibody, the anti-KCC2 antibodies displayed reactivity only with membranes prepared from cells stably expressing the full-length KCC2 protein (Fig.3 B). Immunocytochemical studies revealed similar specificity of the anti-KCC2 antibodies for the KCC2–22T cells (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate the specificity of the anti-KCC2 antibodies for the KCC2 isoform with no detectable KCC1 cross-reactivity. In the following studies, we used the anti-KCC2 antibodies purified from the B22 antisera to characterize the KCC2 protein in the rat nervous system. We have previously demonstrated that KCC2 is a glycoprotein when it is exogenously expressed in stably transfected HEK-293 cells (8Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deglycosylation experiments confirmed this post-translational modification of the native KCC2 protein in rat brain (Fig.4). As noted above, exogenously expressed KCC2 protein migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ∼10-kDa larger than from native tissue. The deglycosylation experiment presented in Fig. 4 demonstrates that this is the result of differences in N-linked glycosylation of the protein as both native and exogenously expressed KCC2 protein migrate at ∼125 kDa following treatment with N-glycosidase F. Significantly, this core ∼125-kDa KCC2 protein is similar in size to that predicted from the cDNA (7Payne J."
https://openalex.org/W2012561199,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion is well recognized as a major cause of apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes are intrinsically resistant to hypoxia-induced apoptosis, suggesting a protective role of energy-generating substrates. In the present report, a model of sustained hypoxia of primary cultures of Percoll-enriched neonatal rat cardiac myocytes was used to study specifically the modulatory role of extracellular glucose and other intermediary substrates of energy metabolism (pyruvate, lactate, propionate) as well as glycolytic inhibitors (2-deoxyglucose and iodoacetate) on the induction and maintenance of apoptosis. In the absence of glucose and other substrates, hypoxia (5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% N<sub>2</sub>) caused apoptosis in 14% of cardiac myocytes at 3 h and in 22% of cells at 6–8 h of hypoxia, as revealed by sarcolemmal membrane blebbing, nuclear fragmentation, and chromatin condensation (Hoechst staining), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and DNA laddering. This was accompanied by translocation of cytochrome <i>c</i> from the mitochondria to the cytosol and cleavage of the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA laddering were prevented by preincubation with the caspase inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zDEVD-fmk), indicating activation of caspases in the apoptotic process. The caspase inhibitor zDEVD-fmk also partially inhibited cytochrome <i>c</i> translocation. The presence of as little as 1 mm glucose, but not pyruvate, lactate, or propionate, before hypoxia prevented apoptosis. Inhibiting glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose or iodoacetate, in the presence of glucose, reversed the protective effect of glucose. This study demonstrates that glycolysis of extracellular glucose, and not other metabolic pathways, protects cardiac myocytes from hypoxic injury and subsequent apoptosis."

Caveolins and flotillins are two families of mammalian caveolae-associated integral membrane proteins. However, it remains unknown whether flotillins interact with caveolin proteins to form a stable caveolar complex or if expression of flotillins can drive vesicle formation. Here, we examine the cell type and tissue-specific expression of the flotillin gene family. For this purpose, we generated a novel monoclonal antibody probe that recognizes only flotillin-1. A survey of cell and tissue types demonstrates that flotillins 1 and 2 have a complementary tissue distribution. At the cellular level, flotillin-2 was ubiquitously expressed, whereas flotillin-1 was most abundant in A498 kidney cells, muscle cell lines, and fibroblasts. Using three different models of cellular differentiation, we next examined the expression of flotillins 1 and 2. Taken together, our data suggest that the expression levels of flotillins 1 and 2 are independently regulated and does not strictly correlate with known expression patterns of caveolin family members. However, when caveolins and flotillins are co-expressed within the same cell, as in A498 cells, they form a stable hetero-oligomeric “caveolar complex.” In support of these observations, we show that heterologous expression of murine flotillin-1 in Sf21 insect cells using baculovirus-based vectors is sufficient to drive the formation of caveolae-like vesicles. These results suggest that flotillins may participate functionally in the formation of caveolae or caveolae-like vesicles in vivo. Thus, flotillin-1 represents a new integral membrane protein marker for the slightly larger caveolae-related domains (50–200 nm) that are observed in cell types that fail to express caveolin-1. As a consequence of these findings, we propose the term “cavatellins” be used (instead of flotillins) to describe this gene family.

However, caveolin is only the first member of a growing gene family of caveolin proteins; caveolin has been re-termed caveolin-1. Three different caveolin genes (Cav-1, Cav-2, and Cav-3) encoding four different subtypes of caveolin have been described thus far (2Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.S. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There are two subtypes of caveolin-1 (Cav-1α and Cav-1β) that differ in their respective translation initiation sites (27Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Chun M.C. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J.

In striking contrast, caveolin-3 mRNA and protein is expressed mainly in muscle tissue types (skeletal, cardiac, and smooth) (28Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C.

Recently, we have identified another family of integral membrane proteins that may contribute to the structural organization of caveolae membranes (31Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P.

Micro-sequence analysis of purified caveolin-rich membrane domains isolated from lung tissue revealed a novel ∼45-kDa component of caveolae membranes termed flotillin (31Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E.

Molecular cloning of flotillin and analysis of the cDNA for this protein has provided new avenues by which to explore the structure and function of caveolae organelles. Interestingly, flotillin is a close homologue of ESA 1The abbreviations used are: ESA, epidermal surface antigen; mAb, monclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl(epidermalsurface antigen (33Schroeder W.T.

However, the study of flotillin-1 has been hampered by the lack of a flotillin-1 specific antibody probe. Previously, we generated a rabbit anti-peptide antibody against murine flotillin-1. This anti-peptide antibody did not recognize flotillin-1 well in crude extracts, precluding a detailed analysis of the tissue distribution and expression patterns of the flotillin protein (31Bickel P.E.

These antipeptide antibodies also recognized another protein of ∼27 kDa we termed flotillincross-reacting determinant (FCRD) (31Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The identity and significance of flotillin cross-reacting determinant remains unknown. Here, we examine the cell type and tissue-specific expression of the flotillins using a novel monoclonal antibody probe that recognizes only flotillin-1. A survey of cell and tissue types demonstrates that flotillins 1 and 2 have a complementary tissue distribution. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that flotillins 1 and 2 are part of a stable hetero-oligomeric complex that contains both caveolins 1 and 2. However, protein levels of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2/ESA remain unchanged in response to oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Our data suggest that the expression of the flotillins can be independently regulated from that of caveolin-1 and caveolae formation. Also, we show that flotillin-1 represents a new marker protein for the slightly larger caveolae-related domains (50–200 nm) that are observed in cell types that fail to express caveolin-1 and do not contain detectable caveolae. The cDNAs for murine flotillin-1 andDrosophila flotillin-1 were as we previously described (31Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

A monoclonal antibody to murine flotillin-1 was generated by multiple immunizations of Balb/c female mice with a fusion protein encoding the full-length flotillin protein. Mice showing the highest titer of anti-flotillin-1 immunoreactivity were used to create fusions with myeloma cells using standard protocols (35$$Google Scholar). Positive hybridomas were cloned twice by limiting dilution. These hybridomas were also screened against flotillin-2/ESA to prevent the selection of a cross-reacting monoclonal antibody. Positive hybridomas recognizing only flotillin-1, but not flotillin-2, were then injected into mice to produce ascites fluid. IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose.

These constructs (∼5–10 μg) were transiently transfected into 293T cells using standard calcium phosphate precipitation. Forty-eight h post-transfection, cells were scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside). Recombinant expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) followed by Western blotting. Epitope-tagged forms of flotillin-1 were detected using the monoclonal antibody, 9E10, that recognizes the myc-epitope (EQKLISEEDLN). Approximately 200 mg (wet weight) of various mouse tissues were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer and homogenized on ice with a Polytron tissue grinder, as described (4Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (100 μg of protein) were loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel (12% acrylamide). After transfer to nitrocellulose, the blot was probed with antibodies directed against flotillin-1 and flotillin-2/ESA. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, nitrocellulose sheets were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein bands and subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoblotting, incubation conditions were as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), except we supplemented our blocking solution with both 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% nonfat dry milk (Carnation). Flotillin-derived polypeptides were synthesized directly onto an activated polymeric membrane by Research Genetics. The peptide chemistry was standard Fmoc with coupling mediated through butyl alcohol/DIC and Fmoc removal with 1:3 piperidine/N,N-dimethylformamide. For final peptide protecting group removal, the membrane was placed in a bath of 50:47.5:2.5:1.5:1 DCM/trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/EDT/anisole for 1 h and, finally, washed and dried. These sheets were probed by immunoblotting as described above. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using protein-A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (38Lisanti M.P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl-glucoside and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-caveolin-1 pAb (directed against residues 2–21; Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc.). After extensive washing, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with IgGs directed against caveolin-1 (mAb 2297), caveolin-2 (mAb 65), flotillin-1 (mAb 18), and flotillin-2/ESA (mAb 29). C2C12–3 cells (39Cole F. Fasy T.M. Rao S. Peralta M. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were derived from a single colony of C2C12 cells (40Blau H. Chiu C.-P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) cultured at clonal density and display a more stable phenotype than the parental cell line. C2C12–3 myoblasts were cultured as described elsewhere (39Cole F. Fasy T.M. Rao S. Peralta M. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proliferating C2C12–3 cells were cultured in high mitogen medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% chicken embryo extract) and induced to differentiate at confluence in low mitogen medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% horse serum). Overt differentiation was indicated by the assembly of multinucleated syncytia, which commenced 36–48 h after the cells were switched to low mitogen media. PC 12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum. PC 12 cells were differentiated for 1–4 days by culturing the cells in low serum medium (RPMI 1640 with 1% horse serum) with nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) (41Jaiswal R.K. Weissinger E. Kolch W.

Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells were provided by Dr. Takashi Okamoto (Cleveland Clinic Foundation). Sf21 cells were grown in Ex-cell 401 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin) at 27 °C. The cDNA encoding murine flotillin-1 was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of a transfer plasmid vector, pBacPAK9. A mixture of 2 μg of recombinant plasmid pBacPAK 9-flotillin-1 DNA and 1 μg of purified engineered baculoviral vector DNA BacPAK 6 (Bsu36I digest) (CLONTECH) were transfected into insect Sf21 cells, as suggested by the manufacturer (42Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; Google Scholar). Four days later, culture supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. Clarified supernatants containing wild-type and recombinant baculoviruses were plaque-assayed on a monolayer of Sf21 cells. Occlusion negative plaques were picked and seeded onto 2.5 × 106 cells. After a 3-day incubation, cells and culture supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting analysis using anti-flotillin-1 antibodies or anti-myc tag mAb 9E10. Those plaques testing positive for the presence of flotillin-1 were selected for three rounds of plaque purification. The selected plaques with the highest yield of expression were used as recombinant baculovirus stock for producing protein by infecting insect Sf21 cells. Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously by our laboratory. Samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde, postfixed with osmium tetroxide, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, as detailed in Sargiacomo et al. (14Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) and Lisanti et al. (15Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z.-L. Hermanoski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.-H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Samples were examined under the Philips 410 TEM. A fusion protein carrying the full-length flotillin-1 protein was used to generate a flotillin-1-specific monoclonal antibody probe. This antibody does not recognize flotillin-2/ESA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, this antibody can be used in conjunction with other published antibodies to study the function and differential expression of distinct flotillin and caveolin family members. Fig. 1 demonstrates that this novel mAb probe recognizes both mammalian flotillin-1 (murine) andDrosophila flotillin-1 proteins. Immunoblotting with mAb 9E10 was also used in parallel to detect these C-terminal myc-tagged proteins. As this flotillin-1 mAb reacts with both murine andDrosophila forms of flotillin-1, it must recognize an evolutionarily conserved amino acid epitope. Thus, we performed epitope mapping by generating a series of 48 overlapping peptides that are derived from the sequence of murine flotillin-1 (listed in TableI). These peptides were synthesized as an immobilized array that can be probed by immunoblotting. Fig.2 shows the results of this epitope-mapping strategy. The flotillin-1 mAb only reacted with a single peptide (number 38 in Table I). As expected based on its reactivity with both mammalian and Drosophila flotillin-1, this epitope is highly conserved but is divergent in flotillin-2/ESA. An alignment of this region of flotillin-1 and other flotillin-related proteins is shown in Fig. 2 C.Table IPeptides derived from murine flotillin-1 used for epitope-mapping1.MFFTCGPNEAMVVS25.DYELKKATYDIEVN2.EAMVVSGFCRSPPV26.YDIEVNTRRAQADL3.RSPPVMVAGGRVFV27.AQADLAYQLQVAKT4.GRVFVLPCIQQIQR28.QVAKTKQQIEEQRV5.QQIQRISLNTLTLN29.EEQRVQVQVVERAQ6.TLTLNVKSEKVYTR30.VERAQQVAVQEQEI7.KVYTRHGVPISVTG31.QEQEIARREKELEA8.ISVTGIAQVKIQGQ32.KELEARVRKPAEAE9.KIQGQNKEMLAAAC33.PAEAERYRLERLAE10.LAAACQMFLGKTEA34.ERLAEAEKAQLIMQ11.GKTEAEIAHIALET35.QLIMQAEAEAESVR12.IALETLEGHQRAIM36.AESVRMRGEAEAFA13.QRAIMAHMTVEEIY37.AEAFAIGARARAEA14.TVEEIYKDRQKFSE38.RARAEA EQMAKKAE15.QKFSEQVFKVASSD39.AKKAEAFQMYQEAA16.VASSDLVNMGISVV40.YQEAAQLDMLLEKL17.GISVVSYTLKDIHD41.LLEKLPQVAEEISG18.KDIHDDQDYLHSLG42.EEISGPLTSANKIT19.LHSLGKARTAQVQK43.ANKITLVSSGSGTM20.AQVQKDARIGEAEA44.GSGTMGAAKVTGEV21.GEAEAKRDAGIREA45.VTGEVLDILSRLPE22.GIREAKAKQEKVSA46.SRLPESVERLTGVS23.EKVSAQCLSEIEMA47.LTGVSISQVNHNKP24.EIEMAKAQRDYELK48.SISQVNHNKPLRTA Open table in a new tab To establish the tissue distributions of flotillins 1 and 2, we prepared tissue extracts from a variety of different murine tissues (Fig. 3). Flotillin-1 is detected mainly in striated muscle tissues (heart, diaphragm, and psoas muscle), adipose tissue, and lung. In striking contrast, flotillin-2/ESA shows a much wider tissue distribution but is virtually absent in skeletal muscle (diaphragm and psoas muscle). Thus, flotillins 1 and 2 show a relative complementary tissue distribution. To identify model cell systems to study flotillins 1 and 2, we examined the expression of flotillins in a variety of commonly used cell lines and primary cultured cells (Fig. 4). Note that flotillin-2/ESA is most widely expressed, whereas flotillin-1 shows a more restricted distribution. More specifically, flotillin-1 was most abundant in A498 kidney cells, muscle cell lines (smooth muscle cells, L6 skeletal myoblasts, and BC3H1 myoblasts) and fibroblasts. Given that flotillins have been shown to co-fractionate with caveolin-1 using three independent fractionation schemes used to purify caveolae membranes, we wondered whether they form a complex with caveolins (31Bickel P.E.

To address this issue, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments using A498 cells; these cells co-express both flotillin 1 and 2 (See Fig. 4). Lysates from A498 cells were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-peptide antibody that recognizes the unique N terminus of caveolin-1 that is not found in other caveolin family members. These immunoprecipitates were then probed by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies directed against caveolin-1 (mAb 2297), caveolin-2 (mAb 65), flotillin-1 (mAb 18), and flotillin-2/ESA (mAb 29). Fig. 5 demonstrates that the anti-peptide antibody directed against the unique N terminus of caveolin-1 can be used to co-immunoprecipitate caveolin-2, flotillin-1, and flotillin-2. Thus, it appears that caveolins 1 and 2 and flotillins 1 and 2 form a stable complex in vivo. Caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression are reduced or absen"

Laccase (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, EC1.10.3.2) is a copper-containing oxidase that couples the oxidation of substrate (usually diphenols, aryl diamines, or amino phenols) with the reduction of dioxygen to water (1Mayer A.M.

The T1, or “blue,” copper is characterized by an intense (ε ∼ 5000m−1 cm−1) absorption band around 600 nm and an unusually small (<100 × 10−4cm−1) parallel hyperfine coupling in EPR. The T2, or normal, copper site does not exhibit a strong feature in the visible absorption spectrum, but has a parallel hyperfine coupling > 160 × 10−4 cm−1. The T3, or coupled binuclear, copper center consists of two copper atoms connected by a hydroxide bridge. This bridge provides a strong superexchange pathway and therefore mediates antiferromagnetic coupling. The T3 center is EPR-silent, but is characterized by an absorption band around 330 nm (ε ∼ 5000 m−1 cm−1). The T2 and T3 sites form a trinuclear copper cluster that is the site for O2 reduction (5Messerschmidt A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agro A. J.

Laccase is the simplest of the multicopper oxidases, containing one of each type of copper site for a total of 4 copper atoms.Based on a wide range of comparative studies, including sequence homology and crystal structure analysis, the copper site coordination is very similar among the multicopper oxidases. The main difference is in the coordination sphere of the T1 copper site. The typical T1 site, such as that found in the blue copper protein plastocyanin (Pc) and the multi-copper protein Zucchini ascorbate oxidase (zAO), contains two histidines (His), a cysteine (Cys) that forms a short S-Cu bond, and a methionine (Met) that forms a long S-Cu bond. These four ligands bind T1 copper in a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, most fungal laccases with known primary sequence have either a leucine (Leu) or phenylalanine (Phe) at the position corresponding to the axial Met ligand (3Solomon E.I. Machonkin T.E. Sundaram U.M. Messerschmidt A. Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific, Singapore1997: 103-128Crossref Google Scholar, 5Messerschmidt A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Neither Leu nor Phe would be expected to coordinate to the copper that would render a tri-coordinate T1 site. The recent crystal structure of Coprinus cinereus laccase (CcL) confirms this and shows that the T1 site has only three ligands (two His and one Cys) in a trigonal planar geometry (Fig.1 C) (7Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Østergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). An interesting question is how this difference in geometry is manifested in terms of differences in the electronic structure and the electron transfer function of the T1 site. The redox potential (E°) of fungal laccases ranges from 0.48 V to 0.78 V, whereas Pc and zAO haveE° in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 V (3Solomon E.I. Machonkin T.E. Sundaram U.M. Messerschmidt A. Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific, Singapore1997: 103-128Crossref Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the lack of an axial ligand might be responsible for the highE° observed in some fungal laccases (10Gray H.B. Malmström B.G. Commun. Inorg.

Mutation of Met-121 was found to tune the E° over a range of −0.105 V to 0.138 V with respect to the E° of the wild-type (wt) azurin at pH 7.0.The present study utilized site-directed mutagenesis to examine how the composition of the amino acid residues in the vicinity of the T1 copper affect the structure and E° of this copper in aTrametes villosa laccase (TvL) (16Yaver D.S.

The T1, or “blue,” copper is characterized by an intense (ε ∼ 5000m−1 cm−1) absorption band around 600 nm and an unusually small (<100 × 10−4cm−1) parallel hyperfine coupling in EPR. The T2, or normal, copper site does not exhibit a strong feature in the visible absorption spectrum, but has a parallel hyperfine coupling > 160 × 10−4 cm−1. The T3, or coupled binuclear, copper center consists of two copper atoms connected by a hydroxide bridge. This bridge provides a strong superexchange pathway and therefore mediates antiferromagnetic coupling. The T3 center is EPR-silent, but is characterized by an absorption band around 330 nm (ε ∼ 5000 m−1 cm−1). The T2 and T3 sites form a trinuclear copper cluster that is the site for O2 reduction (5Messerschmidt A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agro A. J.

Laccase is the simplest of the multicopper oxidases, containing one of each type of copper site for a total of 4 copper atoms. Based on a wide range of comparative studies, including sequence homology and crystal structure analysis, the copper site coordination is very similar among the multicopper oxidases. The main difference is in the coordination sphere of the T1 copper site. The typical T1 site, such as that found in the blue copper protein plastocyanin (Pc) and the multi-copper protein Zucchini ascorbate oxidase (zAO), contains two histidines (His), a cysteine (Cys) that forms a short S-Cu bond, and a methionine (Met) that forms a long S-Cu bond. These four ligands bind T1 copper in a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, most fungal laccases with known primary sequence have either a leucine (Leu) or phenylalanine (Phe) at the position corresponding to the axial Met ligand (3Solomon E.I. Machonkin T.E. Sundaram U.M. Messerschmidt A. Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific, Singapore1997: 103-128Crossref Google Scholar, 5Messerschmidt A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Neither Leu nor Phe would be expected to coordinate to the copper that would render a tri-coordinate T1 site. The recent crystal structure of Coprinus cinereus laccase (CcL) confirms this and shows that the T1 site has only three ligands (two His and one Cys) in a trigonal planar geometry (Fig.1 C) (7Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Østergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). An interesting question is how this difference in geometry is manifested in terms of differences in the electronic structure and the electron transfer function of the T1 site. The redox potential (E°) of fungal laccases ranges from 0.48 V to 0.78 V, whereas Pc and zAO haveE° in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 V (3Solomon E.I. Machonkin T.E. Sundaram U.M. Messerschmidt A. Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific, Singapore1997: 103-128Crossref Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the lack of an axial ligand might be responsible for the highE° observed in some fungal laccases (10Gray H.B. Malmström B.G. Commun. Inorg. Chem. 1983; 2: 203-209Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 11Guckert J.A. Lowery M.D. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2814-2844Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Eggert C.

Mutation of Met-121 was found to tune the E° over a range of −0.105 V to 0.138 V with respect to the E° of the wild-type (wt) azurin at pH 7.0. The present study utilized site-directed mutagenesis to examine how the composition of the amino acid residues in the vicinity of the T1 copper affect the structure and E° of this copper in aTrametes villosa laccase (TvL) (16Yaver D.S. Xu F. Golightly E.J. Brown K.M. Brown S.H. Rey M.W. Schneider P. Halkier T. Mondorf K. Dalbøge H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 834-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were also interested in determining how the mutations would impact the enzymatic properties,k cat, K m, and the pH dependence of enzymatic activity. TvL has a primary structure and redox/enzymatic properties very similar to the Trametes (Polyporus or Coriolus) versicolor laccase (PvL), an enzyme that has been extensively studied and is regarded as a representative high E° laccase (1Mayer A.M.

Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles with an acidic internal milieu containing hydrolytic enzymes for degradation of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and saccharides. The membrane limiting the lysosomal compartment has multiple functions. It is responsible for acidification of the interior, sequestration of the active lysosomal enzymes (1Mellmann I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transport of degradation products from the lysosomal lumen to the cytoplasm, and regulation of fusion and fission events between lysosomes themselves and other organelles (2Peters C. von Figura K.

LAMP-1 is composed of a large luminal portion, which is separated by a proline-rich hinge region in two disulfide-containing domains, a single transmembrane-spanning segment and a short cytoplasmic tail of 11 amino acids (9Viitala J. Carlsson S.R. Siebert P.D. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The latter contains a Gly-Tyr motif critical for transport to lysosomes (12Guarnieri F.G. Arterburn L.M. Penno M.B. Cha Y. August J.T. J. Biol.

The polypeptide of LAMP-1 contains 382 amino acids, corresponding to about 42 kDa. The apparent size of the newly synthesized LAMP-1 is 92,000. The increase in size is due to N- andO-glycosylation. The luminal portion of the polypeptide chain contains 16–20 potential N-glycosylation sites, most or all of which are utilized. Processing of the oligosaccharides converts the LAMP-1 precursor in a family of mature forms differing in size from 110 to 140 kDa. Part of the glycans are of the polylactosamine type, and LAMP-1 is one of the major carriers for poly-N-acetyllactosamines in cells. Interestingly, the content of poly-N-acetyllactosamines in LAMP-1 correlates with differentiation (14Lee N. Wang W.C. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

At present there are hardly any data as to the in vivofunctions of lysosomal membrane glycoproteins. To get an approach for the analysis of the physiological role of this group of proteins, we have inactivated the lamp-1 gene in the mouse by targeted disruption. Although LAMP-1-deficient mice lack an overt phenotype, an increased expression of the related LAMP-2 was observed in LAMP-1 homozygote and heterozygote deficient tissues. These findings strongly suggest that LAMP-2 can at least partially compensate for the loss of LAMP-1 and that the expression of both proteins is tightly regulatedin vivo. An EMBL3–129SV mouse phage library from Stratagene Inc. (La Jolla, CA) was screened with a 550-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); kbp, kilobase pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumingenomic amplification product of mouse lamp-1 corresponding to cDNA positions 118–350 (8Chen J.W. Cha Y. Yuksel K.U. Gracy R.W. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8754-8758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe contained exon 2 and exon 3 of mouselamp-1 interrupted by a small intron. The isolated mouselamp-1 phage clone mouse LAMP-1/1 contained the 5′-region of the gene with exons 2–5. DNA sequence analyses revealed complete sequence identity of four exons with the nucleotide sequence of the mouse lamp-1 cDNA (data not shown). For construction of a targeting vector, a 5.3-kbp KpnI DNA restriction fragment of lamp-1 covering exons 2 and 3 (see Fig. 1 A,II) was subcloned into the plasmid vector pBluescript SKII+ (Stratagene). The neo expression cassette from pMC1neopA (Ref. 29Thomas K.R. Cappechi M.R.

The insertion of the neo cassette introduces a premature translational stop codon into the open reading frame of thelamp-1 gene. Additionally, for negative selection with gancyclovir, a thymidine kinase cassette was inserted at the 3′ site of the KpnI fragment. The targeting vector was linearized withXhoI and introduced into the ES cell line E14–1 by electroporation. ES cells were cultured as described by Kösteret al. (30Köster A. Saftig P.

G418- and gancyclovir-resistant colonies were screened by Southern blot analysis of DNA digested withHindIII and hybridized with the 3′ probe (Fig.1 A). Two ES cell clones with homologous recombination were confirmed by digesting DNA with BglII and hybridization with the 5′ probe (Fig. 1 A). The mutated ES lines were microinjected into blastocysts of C57BL/6J mice. Chimeric males were mated to C57BL/6J females. Mice were genotyped for thelamp-1 gene mutation by Southern blot analysis ofHindIII-digested genomic DNA, using the 3′ probe or by PCR analyses using a neomycin-specific PCR (31Saftig P.

Homozygous mutant mice were obtained by mating heterozygous or homozygous mutant mice. For initial phenotype testing, littermates of the F2 and F3 generations were used.

Expression of LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and LIMP-2 (lysosomal membrane glycoprotein 85) was analyzed in tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, spleen, brain, heart, adult, and embryonic fibroblasts). Frozen tissues were homogenized in Tris-buffered saline (w/v; 1:9) at 4 °C using an Ultra-Turrax, analyzed for protein (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), adjusted to 1% Triton X-100, and used for enzyme determination (see below) and Western blot analysis. For LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and LIMP-2, 100 μg of protein of tissue homogenate was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide) under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher und Schüll, Dassel, Germany), which was subsequently blocked with 10 mmPBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5% milk powder (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. The blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal anti-mouse LAMP-1 antibody (1D4B, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) in a 1:250 dilution, an anti-mouse LAMP-2 antibody (Abl 93; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) in a 1:100 dilution, and a polyclonal anti-rat LIMP-2 (37Okazaki I. Himeno M. Ezaki J. Ishikawa T. Kato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) antibody in a 1:400 dilution, respectively. Membranes were washed six times for 5 min in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20. Subsequently, incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rat antibody (1:7500 for LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) or with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (1:20,000 for LIMP-2) was performed for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing six times for 5 min in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were finally analyzed using the ECL Detection System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantification was performed by densitometry (Hewlett-Packard Scan Jet 4c/T; WinCam 2.2). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mouse adult fibroblasts, and peritoneal macrophages were grown on glass coverslips for 1 day. The cells were fixed with methanol or paraformaldehyde with 0.5% saponin. Cathepsin-D was immunostained using a rabbit antiserum (38Pohlmann R. Boecker M.W.C. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 were immunostained using a monoclonal anti-mouse rat hybridoma medium (1D4B and Abl 93; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and LIMP-2 was immunostained using a polyclonal rabbit anti rat-lysosomal membrane glycoprotein 85 antiserum (37Okazaki I. Himeno M. Ezaki J. Ishikawa T. Kato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit Texas Red, goat anti-rat Texas Red, and goat anti-rat 5-(4,6-[dichlootriazin-2-yl]amino)fluorescein (Dianova, GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). After embedding in Mowiol (Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmbH), fluorescence was examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 2; ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany) with the filter combination described by Schulze-Garg et al. (39Schulze-Garg C. Boker C. Nadimpalli S.K. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Tissue homogenates of liver, kidney, and fibroblasts were prepared in 0.25m sucrose buffered with 3 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.4. 0.8 ml of a postnuclear supernatant was applied onto 11.2 ml of a 20% Percoll solution (40Lemanski P. Gieselmann V. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10129-10135PubMed Google Scholar) and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 rpm in the vertical rotor VTi 65.1 (Beckman). Density and β-hexosaminidase activity were determined in each of 12 fractions collected. Fractions corresponding to dense vesicles were pooled according to the distribution of β-hexosaminidase activity and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The membraneous layer (lysosome-enriched pellet) floating above the pelleted silica was collected (41Bresciani R. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 50 μl of the lysosome-enriched pellet were suspended in 250 μl of 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.0, and 0.25 m glucose, pH 7.0, respectively. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and samples (30 μl) were withdrawn for assay at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. Immediately after the withdrawal, the samples were suspended in 270 μl of ice-cold 0.25 msucrose solution and subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 30,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge. 150 μl of the resulting supernatants were collected and kept at −20 °C until β-hexosaminidase enzyme activity measurements. To calculate the total β-hexosaminidase activity (100% of the possible β-hexosaminidase enzyme activity), one sample was incubated in 0.25 msucrose in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. β-hexosaminidase activities in the supernatants were calculated as percentages of total activity. Lysosomal enzymes were detected using fluorimetric assays as described by Köster et al. (42Köster A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Arylsulfatase A was measured usingp-nitrocatechol sulfate as substrate (43Porter M.T. Fluharty A.L. Kihara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mouse adult fibroblasts were incubated in methionine-free medium for 1 h and then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the same medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. During the following chase for 1, 2, 4, and 6 h, the medium was supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml l-methionine. Immunoprecipitation from cells and media was carried out as described previously (44Waheed A. Gottschalk S. Hille A. Krentler C. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Hauser H. Geuze H. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with antisera specific for mouse cathepsin-D (38Pohlmann R. Boecker M.W.C. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For LAMP-2 immunoprecipitation cells were labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine and chased for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. Immunoprecipitation of cells was done as described for cathepsin-D with overnight incubation of 2 μg of monoclonal antibody Abl 93 and subsequent incubation for 1 h with 20 μg of a “goat anti-rat” bridge antibody. Densitometric quantification of cathepsin-D and LAMP-2 was done with a phosphor imager (Fuji) and the program MacBas. For standard light microscopic histology and immunohistochemistry, tissues were fixed by cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and shock-frozen or fixed by perfusion with Bouin's solution diluted 1:3 with 0.1m phosphate buffer and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 7 μm, dewaxed in xylene, passed through a graded series of alcohol, and washed in PBS. After blocking with 0.75% BSA and quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 in methanol, sections were incubated with antibodies against cathepsin-D (38Pohlmann R. Boecker M.W.C. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); glial fibrillary acidic protein (Dako, Hamburg, Germany); F4/80 (clone obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); LAMP-1 (clone obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); MHC-II (Pharmingen, Hamburg, Germany); and lectins RCA-1, GS-I B4, and Solanum tuberosum (all lectin reagents from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Detection of bound primary reagents was performed by either the avidin-biotin complex technique (reagents from Vector Laboratories), gold-labeled secondary antibodies followed by silver intensification (British BioCell), or tyramide signal amplification (all reagents from NEN Life Science Products, Bad Homburg, Germany). For transmission electron microscopy, animals were perfused with 6% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer and stored in fixative until further processing. Tissue blocks were rinsed in phosphate buffer, postfixed in OsO4 for 2 h, and embedded in Araldite or Epon 812 according to routine procedures. Ultrathin sections were collected on copper grids, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed with Zeiss EM 900 and EM 902 microscopes. Mouse fibroblasts were grown on plastic tissue culture wells until semiconfluency. The cells were fed with 5-nm gold particles coated with bovine serum albumin and diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to an optical density of 5.0, for 2 h. The cells were then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and prepared for conventional Epon embedding. Thin sections were photographed with a Jeol 1200EX transmission electron microscope. Mouse kidneys were fixed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.4. Fixation was continued in immersion for 2 h at room temperature, and the tissue cubes were then stored in 2% paraformaldehyde. For cryosectioning, tissue cubes from the cortex were infiltrated in 18% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1.66 m sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C, mounted on specimen holders, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Semithin sections (500 nm) and thin sections (80 nm) were cut at −100 °C for immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, respectively. The sections were labeled with rat LAMP-1 (1D4B), rat LAMP-2 (Abl 93), or rabbit cathepsin-D antibodies, which were detected using goat anti-rat IgG-fluorescein, goat anti-rabbit-lissamine rhodamine (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), or rabbit anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) followed by protein A coupled to 10-nm colloidal gold (University of Utrecht, The Netherlands) or directly with protein A-gold. Semithin sections were mounted in Mowiol containing Diazobicyclooctane, and thin sections were mounted in 1.5% methyl cellulose containing 0.4% uranyl acetate. Two control and two LAMP-1-deficient mice were used for the immunocytochemical analysis. A 12-kbp genomic clone from the lamp-1 structural gene region was isolated by screening a genomic 129/SvJ mouse phage library with a genomic PCR fragment as probe containing exons 2 and 3 of lamp-1, corresponding to amino acid residues 37–114 of the LAMP-1 protein (Fig. 1 A,I; for details see “Experimental Procedures”). The targeting vector (Fig. 1 A, II) was used for disruption of the lamp-1 structural gene in ES cells. The open reading frame of the gene is disrupted by insertion of aneo cassette in a BglII site at lamp-1exon 3 corresponding to cDNA nucleotide position 323 and amino acid 107 of 382 amino acids, respectively (8Chen J.W. Cha Y. Yuksel K.U. Gracy R.W. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8754-8758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting construct was introduced into E-14-1 ES cells (45Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), and G418- and gancyclovir-resistant colonies were analyzed by Southern blotting. Using the 3′ external probe (Fig. 1 A), in two out of 96 independent clones tested an additional HindIII DNA restriction fragment was detected, indicating a homologous recombination in one of the lamp-1 gene alleles (Fig.1 B). These results were confirmed by hybridizingBglII-digested DNA with the 5′ external probe (data not shown). The targeted ES cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and five chimeric males were generated. Only the ES cells from ES cell clone EL20 transmitted the mutated allele through the germ line. Heterozygous offspring was identified by hybridization ofHindIII-digested DNA with the 3′ external probe (data not shown). Heterozygotes exhibit a normal phenotype and normal fertility (data not shown). Genotyping of 98 offspring from heterozygote crosses (Fig.1 C) revealed a frequency of 27.2% for homozygous mutant mice (LAMP-1 −/−), resembling the expected Mendelian frequency (25%). Hence, disruption of the lamp-1 gene does not result in embryonic lethality. To test for expression of thelamp-1 gene in LAMP-1 −/− mice, Northern blot analyses were performed. A single lamp-1-specific transcript was detectable in liver and kidney total RNA from wild-type animals, whereas no lamp-1-specific transcripts were detectable in homozygous mutant animals (Fig. 1 D). LAMP-1 protein was not detectable in brain, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney homogenates from LAMP-1 −/− animals, whereas it was readily detectable in the respective homogenates from wild-type mice (Fig.1 E). The Northern blot and Western blot analyses demonstrate that thelamp-1 gene has been inactivated and that homozygous mutant mice are devoid of LAMP-1. Homozygous mutant, heterozygous, and wild-type mice resulting from heterozygote crosses did not exhibit differences in growth and weight development (data not shown). LAMP-1-deficient mice were fertile and did not show an elevated mortality up to an age of 19 months. X-ray analyses and determination of clinical blood and serum parameters did not reveal abnormalities (data not shown). Macroscopically, no differences were observed in shape and size of individual organs prepared from knockout mice as compared with controls. Light microscopic investigation of liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and brain did not reveal any apparent change in tissue structure. Likewise, density and distribution of macrophages and microvascular architecture taken as indicators for tissue damage were unchanged. In the brain (and there most notably within the dorsal neocortical region), the normally high neuronal expression of cathepsin-D (Fig. 2 A) was replaced by a more irregular distribution pattern with a still high immunoreactivity in superficial laminae II and deep lamina VI, but now being irregularly reduced in the more central strata (Fig.2 B). It should be pointed out that this does not correlate with neuronal cell degeneration, but it could be associated with an early disturbance of lysosomal metabolism in a subpopulation of cells. In addition, astrogliosis was observed in circumscribed dorsal cortical areas spanning about 500–800 μm (Fig. 2 D; control shown in Fig. 2 C), which overlapped only partially with the regions featuring alterations in their cathepsin-D"

We have shown that the sixth copper-binding motif alone is sufficient, but not essential, for normal ATP7B function. The N-terminal two or three copper-binding motifs alone are not sufficient for ATP7B function. The first two or three N-terminal motifs of the copper-binding domain are not equivalent to, and cannot replace, the C-terminal motifs when placed in the same sequence position with respect to the transmembrane channel. From our data, we propose that the copper-binding motifs closest to the channel are required for the copper-transport function of ATP7B. We propose that cooperative copper binding to the copper-binding domain of ATP7B is not critical for copper transport function, but that cooperative copper binding involving the N-terminal two or three copper-binding motifs may be involved in initiating copper-dependent intracellular trafficking.

Our data also suggest a functional difference between the copper-binding domains of ATP7A and ATP7B. Heavy metal transporting P-type ATPases (designated CPx-type ATPases) are distinguished from other P-type ATPases, by the presence of a large N-terminal metal-binding domain (1Solioz M. Bittar E.E. Anderson J.P. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. JAI Press, London1998: 167-203Google Scholar). This domain contains repeats of a GMXCXXCXXXIE motif evolutionarily conserved in heavy metal-binding proteins. Metal binding to these motifs occurs via the cysteine (C) residues (2Lutsenko S.

The copper-binding domains of ATP7A (human Menkes disease protein) and ATP7B (human Wilson disease protein) contain six repeats of the copper-binding motif, whereas Ccc2p, the yeast orthologue of ATP7B/ATP7A, has an N-terminal domain containing two motifs (5Vulpe C.

The copper-binding domains of ATP7A and ATP7B expressed and purified from bacteria have been shown to bind at least six atoms of copper (2Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol.

However once bound, copper is found only as Cu(I). Copper binding to the N-terminal domain of ATP7B may be cooperative, based on results from competitive zinc binding experiments (3DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).The solution structure of the fourth copper-binding motif of ATP7A has been solved by NMR (4Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The structure of this motif was solved with silver(I) bound, which was assumed to be similar to the copper bound form. The fourth ATP7A motif folded independently, and the structure closely resembled the overall fold of the MerP mercury-binding protein which has a mercury-binding domain well conserved at the sequence level with the copper-binding motifs found in CPx-type ATPases. The structure of the fourth ATP7A motif likely represents the prototypical fold of copper-binding motifs found in CPx-type ATPases. Each motif may fold individually, and then fold again with respect to the other motifs to form the complete copper-binding domain.There have been several hypotheses presented regarding the role of copper binding to the copper-binding domain in the overall function of CPx-type ATPases. The copper-binding domain has been proposed to remove copper from cytosolic ligands and transiently bind copper prior to transport (5Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 11Bull P.C. Cox D.W. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 246-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A recent paper substantiated this hypothesis (12Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Atx1p is a yeast copper chaperone protein required upstream of Ccc2p for iron and copper homeostasis in yeast (13Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that Atx1p, which contains one copper-binding motif, was able to directly interact with the putative copper-binding domain of Ccc2p, but no other predicted domain of Ccc2p (12Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). This interaction was dependent on copper ions and suggested that Atx1p could donate copper to Ccc2p by direct interaction and copper exchange between homologous GMXCXXCXXXIE motifs (12Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Since a human orthologue of Atx1p exists (ATOX1: originally designated HAH1) and was able to functionally replace Atx1p (14Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.-J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), likely ATP7B also requires a copper chaperone, probably ATOX1, as its major source of copper for transport. These data support the hypothesis that copper removed from a cytosolic chaperone protein and transiently bound to the ATP7B copper-binding domain is the source of copper for subsequent transport.Another proposed role for the copper-binding domain is that of a copper sensor (3DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). When mammalian cells were exposed to high concentrations of copper, ATP7A and ATP7B underwent a reversible copper-regulated trafficking event, from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane or a post-Golgi vesicular compartment, respectively (15Petris M.J.

Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This trafficking may represent a change in physiologic function of ATP7B from cupro-enzyme biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus, to a copper efflux function in the plasma membrane or secretory vesicles. The observed trafficking event may be triggered by conformation changes induced by cooperative copper binding to the N-terminal domains of these proteins (3DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).The metal binding properties of the ATP7B copper-binding domain are beginning to be understood. However, the functional significance of copper binding to the copper-binding domain of ATP7B is not yet well characterized. In this study we describe the functional consequences of mutations and deletions in the copper-binding domain of ATP7B in an attempt to further understand the role of this domain in the overall copper transport function of ATP7B.The assay used in our study is based on complementation ofccc2 mutant yeast by ATP7B, an assay we have previously used to determine the effect of Wilson disease missense mutations on ATP7B function (17Forbes J.R.

When yeast cells lack Ccc2p, copper is not incorporated into Fet3p, and subsequently the cells lack high-affinity iron uptake leaving them unable to grow on iron-limited medium (10Yuan D.S.

We have shown that ATP7B is able to complement the yeast mutant ccc2, delivering copper to Fet3p, thereby restoring the ability ofccc2 mutant yeast cells to grow on iron-limited medium, providing a sensitive assay for the copper transporter function of ATP7B (17Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Similar yeast complementation assays have recently been used to study the functional effect of mutations in the copper-binding domain of ATP7A (21Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the effect of deletions in the copper-binding domain of ATP7B (22Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miuna N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our study represents the most comprehensive analysis to date of the copper-binding domain of ATP7B. Additionally, our data suggest a functional difference between the copper-binding domains of ATP7B, and that reported for ATP7A.RESULTSThe copper-binding domains of the mutant ATP7B expression constructs analyzed for function in this study are shown in Fig.1. All constructs were expressed inccc2 mutant yeast from the single copy integrating vector unless otherwise noted.Series 1 constructs were those in which both cysteine residues in each of the copper-binding motifs were mutated to serine sequentially from the N-terminal to C-terminal end of the copper-binding domain (Fig. 1). These were analyzed for function based on their ability to complement the high affinity iron uptake deficiency phenotype of ccc2mutant yeast. When expressed in yeast, all proteins but Cu1–6C/S were able to complement the ccc2 yeast mutant allowing the cells to grow on iron-limited medium (Fig.2 A). We have shown previously that mutant proteins unable to fully complement ccc2 mutant yeast at single copy expression levels could often complement when overexpressed from a multicopy vector (17Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Overexpression from the multicopy vector produced approximately 30-fold more ATP7B protein than from the single copy vector, and saturated the yeast cell membranes with ATP7B protein (data not shown). A mutant protein which failed to complement when expressed in multicopy was considered completely non-functional. Cu1–6C/S also failed to complement when expressed from the multicopy vector indicating that the mutant protein was nonfunctional (data not shown).Figure 2Complementation of ccc2mutant yeast by ATP7B copper-binding domain mutation series 1 constructs (Fig. 1). A, plating assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”B, Fet3p oxidase assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Holo-Fet3p activity, Fet3p copper loadedin vivo, was detected by homogenizing yeast in buffer containing the copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate and reducing agent ascorbate to prevent artifactual copper loading of apo-Fet3p during processing. Total-Fet3p activity, holo-Fet3p plus apo-Fet3p activity, was detected by homogenizing yeast in the presence of copper to reconstitute apo-Fet3p in vitro. Western blots were done, using anti-ATP7B.C10 antibody, on 10 μg of solubilized membrane protein prepared for the oxidase assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fet3p oxidase assays were employed to measure the function of Series 1 ATP7B copper-binding domain mutants. Fet3p receives its copper from Ccc2p within a vesicular compartment and therefore serves as a marker protein for copper transport across the vesicular membrane (19Yuan D.S. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In wild-type yeast and in yeast expressing normal ATP7B, there is little difference between holo- and total-Fet3p activity indicating little or no excess apo-Fet3p production. If high affinity iron uptake is reduced or absent, Fet3p expression is induced in an attempt to compensate (28Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), therefore a high ratio of total-Fet3p to holo-Fet3p activity indicates an ATP7B mutant protein with absent or reduced function (17Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Fet3p assay results for the first series of ATP7B mutant proteins showed, with the exception of Cu1–6C/S, little or no difference between holo- and total-Fet3p activity indicating that the first series of copper-binding domain mutant ATP7B proteins analyzed have activity comparable to normal ATP7B (Fig. 2 B). Only the sixth motif was necessary for ATP7B function. Cu1–6C/S protein was nonfunctional judged by its inability to generate detectable holo-Fet3p activity, and the high level of total-Fet3p activity.We have shown previously, by measuring growth curves, thatccc2 mutant yeast expressing ATP7B grows at a rate equal to the wild-type strain in iron-limited medium (17Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We were able to quantitate differences in the ability of mutant ATP7B proteins to complement ccc2 mutant yeast, which was useful as a relative measure of ATP7B function. Growth rates, in iron-limited medium, of yeast expressing ATP7B and Cu1–5C/S were calculated from the linear exponential phase of growth curves done in triplicate (TableI). The ccc2 yeast strain expressing the Cu1–5C/S grew at a rate identical to normal ATP7B. These results confirm that only the sixth copper-binding motif was required for normal transport activity of ATP7B.Table IGrowth rates of ccc2 mutant yeast expressing ATP7B copper-binding domain mutant proteinsStrainGrowth rateΔLog (OD600)/hr%ATP7Bccc20.017 ± 0.00413.5ATP7B0.126 ± 0.000100Cul-5C/S0.128 ± 0.001101.5Cul-5Del0.120 ± 0.00195.2Growth curves in iron-limited medium were generated over 24-h period. Optical density at 600 nm of triplicate cultures was measured at times 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Growth rates were calculated from the linear exponential growth phase of the cultures using the 3-, 6-, and 12-h time points. Open table in a new tab To determine if copper-binding motifs at the N-terminal end of the copper-binding domain were sufficient for function, Series 2 copper-binding domain mutants were made (Fig. 1). Cu4–6C/S and Cu3–6C/S were made in which the cysteines of copper-binding motifs four to six and three to six were mutated to serine, respectively. These proteins, when expressed, did not restore the ability ofccc2 mutant yeast to grow on iron-limited medium, and generated no detectable holo-Fet3p activity, but had a high total-Fet3p activity indicating they were non-functional (Fig.3). Additionally, expression of these constructs from the multicopy vector failed to complementccc2 mutant yeast (data not shown). However, Cu3–5C/S was able to complement ccc2 mutant yeast and deliver copper to Fet3p as well as normal ATP7B, as indicated by similar levels of holo- and total-Fet3p oxidase activity (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that two or three N-terminal motifs alone are not sufficient for ATP7B function, and reinforce the functional importance of the sixth copper-binding motif.Figure 3Complementation of ccc2mutant yeast by ATP7B copper-binding domain mutation series 2 constructs (Fig. 1). A, plating assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Fet3p oxidase assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Holo-Fet3p activity, Fet3p copper loaded in vivo, was detected by homogenizing yeast in buffer containing the copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate and reducing agent ascorbate to prevent adventitious copper loading of apo-Fet3p during processing. Total-Fet3p activity, holo-Fet3p plus apo-Fet3p activity, was detected by homogenizing yeast in the presence of copper to reconstitute apo-Fet3p in vitro. Western blots were done, using anti-ATP7B.C10 antibody, on 10 μg of solubilized membrane protein prepared for the oxidase assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine if the sixth copper-binding motif was essential for ATP7B function, a construct was made (Cu6C/S) in which the cysteine residues within the sixth motif only were mutated to serine (Fig. 1). This protein was able to complement ccc2 mutant yeast, and deliver copper to Fet3p as well as normal ATP7B judged by the similar levels of holo- and total-Fet3p oxidase activity (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the sixth copper-binding motif is sufficient but not essential for ATP7B function.The rodent orthologues of ATP7B all are lacking the fourth copper-binding motif (29Wu J. Forbes J.R. Shiene Chen H. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 30Theophilos M.B. Cox D.W. Mercer J.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 5: 1619-1624Google Scholar). However, the spacing and sequence properties between the third and fifth motif are conserved leading to the conclusion that the copper binding property of the fourth motif is not essential for function. As expected, Cu4C/S complementedccc2 mutant yeast cells, allowing normal growth on iron-limited medium, and delivered copper to Fet3p as well as normal ATP7B (ratio of holo- and total-Fet3p oxidase activity similar to ATP7B; Fig. 3).A series of copper-binding domain deletion constructs were analyzed for function. Cu4–6del and Cu3–6del were made so that the third or second copper-binding motifs, respectively, were in the same position relative to the beginning of the first membrane spanning segment as was the sixth copper-binding motif. Neither of these constructs could restore the ability of ccc2 mutant yeast to grow on iron-limited medium (Fig. 4 A). Expression of Cu4–6del or Cu3–6del proteins generated no detectable holo-Fet3p activity, but had a high level of total-Fet3p activity indicating they were nonfunctional (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that the N-terminal motifs of the copper-binding domain are not equivalent to, and cannot replace, the C-terminal motifs. Deletion of the third to fifth copper-binding motifs (Cu3–5del) resulted in a protein unable to complement ccc2 mutant yeast (Fig. 4 A). Cu3–5del protein was nonfunctional, generating no detectable holo-Fet3p activity, and a high level of total-Fet3p activity (Fig.4 B). None of these deletion constructs could complementccc2 mutant yeast when overexpressed from the multicopy vector, further supporting that they were nonfunctional (data not shown).Figure 4Complementation of ccc2mutant yeast by ATP7B copper-binding domain deletion series constructs (Fig. 1). A, plating assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Fet3p oxidase assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Holo-Fet3p activity, Fet3p copper loaded in vivo, was detected by homogenizing yeast in buffer containing the copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate and reducing agent ascorbate to prevent artifactual copper loading of apo-Fet3p during processing. Total-Fet3p activity, holo-Fet3p plus apo-Fet3p activity, was detected by homogenizing yeast in the presence of copper to reconstitute apo-Fet3p in vitro.

The mutant protein delivered copper to Fet3p, and restored the ability of the mutant yeast strain to grow on iron-limited medium. Growth curve analysis revealed that Cu1–5del protein allowed ccc2 mutant yeast to grow at a rate 95% of normal ATP7B expressing ccc2mutant yeast (Table I). Deletion of the entire copper-binding domain (Cudel) resulted in a protein unable to complement ccc2mutant yeast (Fig. 4) even when overexpressed from a multicopy vector (data not shown). Expression of Cudel generated no detectable holo-Fet3p activity, but had a high level of total-Fet3p activity indicating the protein was nonfunctional.Judged by Western blot analysis, several mutant proteins appeared to have a higher steady-state protein level with respect to normal ATP7B (Figs. 2 B, 3 B, and 4 B). This result was reproduced in multiple protein preparations (membrane and total cell extracts) and Western blotting experiments. All of these mutant constructs were confirmed to be correctly integrated in single copy by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from these strains probed with ATP7B cDNA (data not shown). In most cases, the mutants exhibiting higher protein levels do not complement ccc2mutant yeast. Constructs Cu1–3C/S, Cu1–4C/S, and Cu3–5C/S do fully complement ccc2 mutant yeast and the proteins appeared to be more abundant relative to normal ATP7B. However, since Cu1–5C/S, which was detected at a level equal to normal ATP7B was able to fully complement ccc2 mutant yeast, we believe that the relatively high steady-state protein level of these constructs was not significant to our results. We are currently investigating the cause for the increased protein levels observed.DISCUSSIONWe have used the yeast complementation assay developed in our laboratory to study the functional consequences of mutation and deletions in the copper-binding domain of ATP7B. Fet3p serves as a marker enzyme for the putative copper-transport function of Ccc2p across an as yet unidentified post-Golgi membrane (19Yuan D.S. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ATP7B is able to replace Ccc2p in yeast demonstrating that it too is a putative copper transporter. ATP-dependent copper uptake has been demonstrated in basolateral membranes of rat and human liver (31Dijkstra M. In t'Veld G. van den Berg G.J. Muller M. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 412-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dijkstra M. van den Berg G.S. Wolters H. In't Veld G. Sloof M.J. Heymans H.S. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. J.

Physiol. 1996; 271: G741-G746PubMed Google Scholar). However, these activities have not been specifically assigned to Atp7b. Recent reports have shown that expression of ATP7B in Menkes patient fibroblast cell lines was able to reduce copper accumulation in these cells (34La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Camakaris J. Englezou A. Theophilos M.B. Petris M.J. Howie M. Lockhart P.J. Greenough M. Brooks H. Reddel R.R. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, together with the impaired hepatic copper efflux found in patients with Wilson disease in whichATP7B is mutated (36Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar), ATP7B appears to be copper transporter. However, copper transport by ATP7B remains to be directly demonstrated as has been done for ATP7A (37Voskoboinik I. Brooks H. Smith S. Shen P. Camakaris J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The copper-binding domain of ATP7B was required absolutely for its copper transport function. Mutation or deletion of all six copper-binding motifs resulted in a protein unable to complementccc2 mutant yeast or deliver copper to Fet3p (Figs. 2 and4). These data indicate that binding of copper to this domain is a requirement for transport across membranes by ATP7B. Copper transiently bound to the copper-binding domain, perhaps delivered by a chaperone protein, is likely the source of copper transferred to the transmembrane domain for subsequent transport.Our data indicate that the copper-binding motifs of the copper-binding domain nearer to the transmembrane domain of ATP7B were more important for the copper transporting activity of ATP7B than were the more N-terminal ones. Only the sixth motif was necessary, but not essential, for normal function of the protein (Figs. 2 and 4 and Table I). Mutation or deletion of the first five motifs resulted in"

SAPK3 phosphorylates α1-syntrophin at serine residues 193 and 201 in vitro and phosphorylation is dependent on binding to the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin. In skeletal muscle SAPK3 and α1-syntrophin co-localize at the neuromuscular junction, and both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from transfected COS cell lysates.

SAPK3 and SAPK4 are not inhibited by SB 203580 (10Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 23Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buée-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and consequently only little is known about their substrates. The transcription factor ATF2 is a good substrate of SAPK3 in vitro (23Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buée-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), whereas stathmin has been proposed as a physiological substrate of SAPK4 (26Parker C.G. Hunt J. Diener K. McGinley M. Soriano B.

Here we identify α1-syntrophin as a substrate for SAPK3 and show that phosphorylation is dependent on the interaction of the carboxyl-terminal sequence -KETXL of SAPK3 with the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin. In skeletal muscle SAPK3 and α1-syntrophin were found to co-localize at the neuromuscular junction and throughout the sarcolemma. Full-length human α1-syntrophin was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from human skeletal muscle cDNA. It was subcloned into pACT2 (Stratagene) for yeast two-hybrid screening or pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for bacterial expression as a GST fusion protein. α1-Syntrophin (78–179) and α1-syntrophin (174–505) were produced by polymerase chain reaction, as were human β1-syntrophin (103–204) and human neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (9–108). Expression and activation of rat GST-SAPK3 have been described (23Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buée-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Rat SAPK3(1–363) was produced by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 for expression as GST fusion protein. For some experiments SAPK3(1–363) and SAPK3(1–367) were subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid vector pAS2–1 (Stratagene) or the thioredoxin fusion protein vector pET32a (Novagen). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce L367VSAPK3, followed by subcloning into pGEX4T-1 and expression as a GST fusion protein. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and activation of recombinant MAPK, SAPK2a, SAPK2b, and SAPK4 have been described (10Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screening (27Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar) was performed using an adult human brain expression library (CLONTECH) containing cDNAs fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain of pACT2 and rat SAPK3 DNA (20Mertens S. Craxton M. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) subcloned into vector pAS2–1, which contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The plasmids were transformed into Y190 yeast cells, and positive clones were selected on triple minus plates (Leu−, Trp−, His−) + 25 mm 3-aminotriazole and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Two million clones were screened, and two positives were obtained. Positive clones were co-transformed with either the bait vector or the original pAS2–1 (used as a control) into yeast to confirm the interaction. All the constructs that were used in other interaction experiments were from polymerase chain reaction products subcloned into pAS2–1 or pACT2 and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins of PDZ domain-containing proteins were bound to 96-well Micro Test plates (Falcon) at 10 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing four times in PBS, serial 1:3 dilutions (starting at 200 μg/ml) of thioredoxin-SAPK3(1–367) or thioredoxin-SAPK3(1–363) in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (w/v) were added and allowed to bind for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed four times in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with anti-thioredoxin antibody (1:3,000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed four times in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated peroxidase (1:2,000, Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times in PBS, followed by the addition of 100 μl of 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) + 0.5 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine (Sigma). After 5 min the color reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 8 nH2SO4 and absorbance at 450 or 490 nm determined using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). GST-α1-syntrophin (0.5 μm) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with activated GST-SAPK3 (2 units/ml) (23Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buée-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, the band corresponding to 32P-labeled α1-syntrophin was excised and digested with trypsin, and the phosphopeptides generated were chromatographed on a Vydac 218TP54 C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the column was developed with a linear acetonitrile gradient. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected. The two peaks of 32P radioactivity were analyzed by solid and gas phase sequencing (28Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and also by electrospray mass spectrometry to identify the peptide sequences and sites of phosphorylation. SAPK3 was assayed routinely with MBP as substrate (23Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buée-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of α1-syntrophin by wild-type GST-SAPK3, GST-SAPK3(1–363), and GST-L367VSAPK3 was carried out in the same manner. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and after centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g, the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and 32P incorporation was measured by Cerenkov counting. Incorporation of phosphate into substrate was kept below 0.1 mol phosphate/mol substrate in all experiments to ensure that initial rate conditions were met. Pectoral and semitendinous muscles were dissected from five adult Sprague-Dawley rats and kept at −70 °C until use. Cryosections (10 μm) were dipped in acetone, air-dried, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (w/v). Following a 5-min wash in PBS, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 10−7m tetramethylrhodamine α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) diluted in PBS. Tissue sections were then washed for 15 min in PBS and fixed for 5 min in ethanol. For double staining, tissue sections were further incubated overnight with anti-SAPK3 serum R5 (diluted 1:200). R5 was raised in a rabbit against the synthetic peptide KPPRQLGARVPKETAL (corresponding to residues 352–367 of rat SAPK3) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. After a 30-min wash in PBS, tissue sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:200, Vector Laboratories), and, following a further 30-min wash in PBS, they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein-avidin D (diluted 1:200, Vector Laboratories). Sections that were triple stained were washed in PBS, blocked using the Vector blocking kit, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-α1-syntrophin serum SYN17 (diluted 1:50) (29Peters M.F. Kramarcy N.R. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody and washings were done as for double staining and sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-streptavidin (diluted 1:50, Boehringer Mannheim). Sections were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium. Immunofluorescence was observed using a Leitz DMRD fluorescence microscope using filters for rhodamine, fluorescein, and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid. In parallel experiments, muscle sections were single stained with tetramethylrhodamine α-bungarotoxin, antiserum R5, or antiserum SYN17. As a control for the specificity of staining, diluted antiserum R5 was incubated with 10 μm recombinant GST-SAPK3 prior to staining. Moreover, in double or triple stainings, tetramethylrhodamine α-bungarotoxin and antibodies R5 or SYN17 were alternatively omitted. Full-length rat SAPK3 and human α1-syntrophin cDNAs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 and COS cells transiently transfected with 10 μg/ml plasmid DNA using DEAE-dextran chloroquine. After 48 h cells transfected with SAPK3 alone and double transfected with SAPK3 and α1-syntrophin were lysed in 300 μl of buffer (20 mmTris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Aliquots (100 μl) of cell lysates were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C on a shaking platform with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose conjugated to 10 μl of anti-α1-syntrophin serum TROPHA. TROPHA was raised in a rabbit against the synthetic peptide ASGRRAPRTGLLELRAG (corresponding to residues 2–17 of human α1-syntrophin) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The suspensions were centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm, and the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5m NaCl and once with 1 ml lysis buffer, followed by resuspension in gel loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates were detected with anti-α1-syntrophin serum TROPHA and anti-SAPK3 serum R5. To identify SAPK3 substrates, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using rat SAPK3 as bait. This screen yielded two independent clones encoding residues 85–505 of α1-syntrophin. α1-Syntrophin is a peripheral membrane protein that comprises two pleckstrin homology domains, a PDZ domain and a unique carboxyl-terminal domain, with the PDZ domain being inserted into the first pleckstrin homology domain (30Froehner S.C.

Syntrophins are believed to function as modular adapters that recruit signaling proteins to the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex at the plasma membrane (35Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system was used to examine the domains that are responsible for the α1-syntrophin-SAPK3 interaction (Fig.1). Full-length α1-syntrophin interacted with SAPK3. The shortest construct that was positive when paired with SAPK3 contained the PDZ domain (residues 78–179) of α1-syntrophin. By contrast, a construct extending from the end of the PDZ domain to the carboxyl terminus of α1-syntrophin (residues 174–505) failed to interact with SAPK3, establishing that the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin mediates the binding to SAPK3. PDZ domains are known to interact with the carboxyl termini of proteins that have the consensus sequence -E(S/T)XV (36Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 37Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of rat SAPK3 (amino acid sequence -ETAL) (20Mertens S. Craxton M. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) is similar to this consensus sequence. Deletion of the last four amino acids of SAPK3 prevented its association with α1-syntrophin, demonstrating that this sequence is necessary for the interaction (Fig. 1). The syntrophin constructs were also expressed as GST fusion proteins and their binding to thioredoxin-SAPK3 assessed by ELISA (Fig. 1). As in the yeast two-hybrid system, SAPK3 bound through its carboxyl-terminal four amino acids to the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin. Similarly, SAPK3 interacted with the PDZ domain of β1-syntrophin (Fig. 1), whereas it failed to bind to the PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (Fig. 1), which forms homotypic interactions with the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin and PDZ domains 1 and 2 of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95/SAP90) (38Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase bound to α1-syntrophin both in the yeast two-hybrid system and as judged by ELISA (not shown). Human α1-syntrophin contains nine (S/T)P sites located outside the PDZ domain that are potential sites of phosphorylation by SAPKs (30Froehner S.C. Murnane A.A. Tobler M. Peng H.B. Sealock R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,31Adams M.E. Butler M.H. Dwyer T.M. Peters M.F. Murnane A.A. Froehner S.C. Neuron. 1993; 11: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Activated GST-SAPK3 phosphorylated GST-α1-syntrophin to 2 mol phosphate/mol protein in vitro, and two32P-labeled tryptic peptides were identified that corresponded to residues 198–207 and 178–197, respectively (Fig.2 A). Solid and gas phase sequencing, as well as electrospray mass spectrometry were used to identify the phosphorylated residues as serines 193 and 201, which are located between the PDZ domain and the second half of the first pleckstrin homology domain (Fig. 1 A). Initial rates of phosphorylation showed that relative to myelin basic protein α1-syntrophin is a good substrate for SAPK3 but not for other SAPKs or for p42 MAPK (Table I). SAPK3 phosphorylated α1-syntrophin at approximately the same rate as it phosphorylated MBP, its standard substrate (Table I). Phosphorylation of α1-syntrophin by SAPK3 was dependent on the carboxyl-terminal four amino acids of SAPK3, as demonstrated by the following three separate lines of evidence (Fig. 2, B–D). α1-Syntrophin was a poor substrate for GST-SAPK3(1–363), which lacks the carboxyl-terminal four amino acids, whereas MBP was an equally good substrate for both GST-SAPK3(1–363) and GST-SAPK3(1–367) (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, preincubation of wild-type rat GST-SAPK3 with an antibody raised against its carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids prevented phosphorylation of α1-syntrophin but not MBP (Fig. 2 C). Finally, preincubation of α1-syntrophin with synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 6 or 8 amino acids of rat SAPK3 prevented phosphorylation of α1-syntrophin by GST-SAPK3 (Fig.2 D).Table IComparison of substrate specificities of different MAPK family members (assayed as in Fig. 2)Kinase (0.2 units/ml)Rates of phosphorylation relative to myelin basic proteinα1-Syntrophin (1 μm)MBP (1 μm)SAPK3100 ± 15100SAPK432 ± 9100SAPK2b9 ± 4100SAPK2a7 ± 2100MAPK12 ± 2100 Open table in a new tab The carboxyl-terminal sequence -KETAL of mouse, rat, rabbit, and zebrafish SAPK3 (20Mertens S.

Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) by replacement of the terminal valine with leucine. We therefore investigated the ability of rat GST-L367VSAPK3 to bind and phosphorylate GST-α1-syntrophin. By ELISA, the binding of wild-type GST-SAPK3 to α1-syntrophin was similar to that of mutant GST-L367VSAPK3 (Fig.3 A). The rate of phosphorylation of α1-syntrophin by GST-L367VSAPK3 was slightly faster than by wild-type GST-SAPK3 (Fig. 3 B). However, both mutant and wild-type SAPK3 phosphorylated α1-syntrophin to the same extent (Fig. 3 B). The phosphorylation of MBP by SAPK3 was unaffected by the L367V mutation (Fig. 3 C). If the association of SAPK3 with α1-syntrophin is physiologically relevant, the two proteins should be co-localized in vivo. Both SAPK3 and α1-syntrophin are expressed at highest levels in skeletal muscle (20Mertens S. Craxton M. Goedert M.

Koga M. Mendel J.E. Ohshima Y. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1990; 348: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We used immunofluorescence to examine the localization of SAPK3 in rat skeletal muscle. SAPK3 was found throughout the sarcolemma and was concentrated at the neuromuscular junction, as indicated by its co-localization with α-bungarotoxin, which visualizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (Fig.4). Moreover, double staining for SAPK3 and α1-syntrophin showed extensive co-localization, both at the neuromuscular junction and throughout the sarcolemma (Fig. 4). The staining was specific, because it was abolished by incubation of diluted SAPK3 antiserum with 10 μm recombinant SAPK3 (not shown). For an independent assessment of the α1-syntrophin-SAPK3 interaction, the ability of SAPK3 to co-immunoprecipitate with α1-syntrophin was examined in extracts from mammalian cells co-transfected with both proteins. α1-Syntrophin and SAPK3 were co-expressed transiently in COS cells. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-α1-syntrophin antibody, and proteins present in the pellet were immunoblotted using anti-α1-syntrophin and anti-SAPK3 antibodies. The strong signal seen for SAPK3 upon immunoprecipitation with the anti-α1-syntrophin antibody indicates that α1-syntrophin existed in a complex with SAPK3 in COS cell lysates (Fig.5).Figure 5Co-immunoprecipitation of SAPK3 with α1-syntrophin. Lysates from COS cells transfected with rat SAPK3 alone (marked SAPK3) or double transfected with SAPK3 and human α1-syntrophin (marked SAPK3 + α1-Syntrophin) were immunoprecipitated with anti-α1-syntrophin serum TROPHA. Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates (markedIP) were immunoblotted with anti-α1-syntrophin and anti-SAPK3 antibodies. α1-Syntrophin-immunoreactive bands were present in double transfected cell lysates and immunoprecipitates (arrows). SAPK3-immunoreactive bands were detected in single and double transfected cell lysates (arrowhead). SAPK3 was detected as an immune complex with α1-syntrophin in double transfected cell lysates (arrowhead) but not in cells transfected with SAPK3 alone. The strong band in the lanes marked IP corresponds to the IgG heavy chain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SAPK3 is a protein kinase whose phosphorylation of α1-syntrophin depends on the interaction between its carboxyl-terminal sequence and the PDZ domain of this substrate. The carboxyl-terminal sequence of SAPK3 thus provides a mechanism both for its selective targeting to subcellular sites and for determining its substrate specificity. During vulval induction in Caenorhabditis elegans, the PDZ domain-containing protein LIN-7 is essential for localizing the epidermal growth factor receptor-like tyrosine kinase LET-23 to cell junctions by binding through its PDZ domain to the carboxyl-terminal sequence -KETCL of LET-23 (40Hoskins R.

In skeletal muscle the interaction between SkM1 and α1-syntrophin has been proposed as a mechanism for anchoring voltage-gated sodium channels in the depths of the junctional folds of the post-synaptic membrane (46Rogart R.B.

At the neuromuscular junction SAPK3 is therefore likely to be anchored in close proximity to voltage-gated sodium channels. The carboxyl-terminal sequences of voltage-gated sodium channels closely resemble the carboxyl-terminal -KETAL or -KETPL of SAPK3 from different species, except that the terminal leucine is replaced by valine. However, binding of L367VSAPK3 to the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin was found to be similar to that of wild-type SAPK3. Phosphorylation of α1-syntrophin by L367VSAPK3 was also similar to that of wild-type SAPK3. This indicates that proteins with a leucine residue at position 0 of the consensus sequence of PDZ domain-binding proteins will bind to α1-syntrophin. Mammalian type-II activin receptors are transmembrane serine/threonine protein kinases of the transforming growth factor β receptor superfamily with the carboxyl-terminal sequences -KESSL or -KESSI (49Matthews L.S. Vale W.V. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 50Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may also be PDZ domain-binding proteins and bind to α1-syntrophin. Although SAPK3 is expressed at highest levels in skeletal muscle, it is expressed at lower levels in many other tissues (20Mertens S. Craxton M. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is likely that SAPK3 will be found to interact with the PDZ domains of proteins other than α1-syntrophin. Possible candidates include the PDZ domains of proteins whose binding partners have a leucine residue at position 0, such as the recently identified Veli proteins, the vertebrate homologues of LIN-7 (51Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). SAPK3 is unique among members of the MAPK family in having a carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain-binding sequence. It therefore probably serves distinct physiological functions and is not a mere isoform of SAPK2a/p38. Inactivation of endogenous SAPK3 by gene targeting and/or the use of specific inhibitors will help to identify its specific functions. Many proteins with PDZ domains localize to specialized cell junctions, such as synapses and tight junctions, where they bind to the carboxyl termini of transmembrane proteins, thereby creating a mechanism for positioning and clustering these proteins and for connecting them to the cytoplasmic network (52Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The finding that SAPK3 co-localizes with α1-syntrophin in skeletal muscle, that it binds to the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin, and that phosphorylation of α1-syntrophin depends on this interaction identifies a novel mechanism for targeting a protein kinase to its substrates. Protein phosphorylation may be important for modulating the interactions between PDZ domain-containing proteins and their binding partners. It is also likely that additional protein kinases that interact with PDZ domains through a carboxyl-terminal targeting sequence remain to be discovered. We thank F. B. Caudwell and N.

The primary sequence showed 28 and 24% amino acid identity with the yeast Pex14p from Hansenula polymorpha andSaccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively; therefore, we termed this cDNA rat PEX14 (RnPEX14). Human and Chinese hamster Pex14p showed 96 and 94% identity to rat Pex14p, except that both Pex14p comprised 377 amino acids. Pex14p was characterized as an integral membrane protein of peroxisomes, exposing its N- and C-terminal parts to the cytosol. Pex14p interacts with both Pex5p and Pex7p, the receptors for peroxisome targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) and PTS2, respectively, together with the receptors' cargoes, PTS1 and PTS2 proteins. Mutation in PEX14 from ZP161, the same CG as ZP110, was determined by reverse transcription-PCR as follows. A 133-base pair deletion at nucleotide residues 37–169 in one allele created a termination codon at 40–42; in addition to this mutation, 103 base pairs were deleted at positions 385–487, resulting in the second termination immediately downstream the second deletion site in the other allele. Neither of these two mutant forms of Pex14p restored peroxisome biogenesis in ZP110 and ZP161, thereby demonstrating PEX14 to be responsible for peroxisome deficiency in CG14.

The peroxisome is a ubiquitous, spherical intracellular organelle bounded by a single membrane and with a diameter of 0.1–1 μm. Peroxisomes are present in eukaryotic cells, from yeast to humans. Peroxisomes function in a wide variety of metabolic pathways, including β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids; biosynthesis of plasmalogens, structural ether lipids abundant in the central nervous system; interconversion of cholesterol to bile acids; and glyoxylate transamination (1van den Bosch H.

Pex14p is a peroxisomal integral membrane protein, apparently involved in PTS1 and PTS2 protein import mediated by Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively. Rat liver cDNA library in a ZAP Express predigested vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), containing unidirectionally inserted cDNA under the CMV promoter, was described (20Okumoto K. Fujiki Y. Nat.

Combined cDNA pools consisted of an equal amount of three small pool mixtures, containing approximately 6,000 independent clones. For transfection of a cDNA library, ZP110 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells that had been plated on a coverslip 1 day before transfection at 1 × 105 cells/well of a six-well plate were washed twice with serum-free F-12 medium. One μg of plasmid DNA and 12 μg of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) were separately diluted with 100 μl of serum-free medium, Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). Both solutions were mixed and left for 30 min at room temperature before pouring onto the cells. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the DNA-liposome mixture was removed by aspiration, and fresh F-12 medium with fetal calf serum was added. The cells were cultured for 2 days and further incubated overnight in 2 ml of serum-free F-12 medium. Among cDNA pools examined, a positive one (A9) that restored peroxisomes in ZP110 was further divided into subpools and screened. A cDNA fragment (SalI–NotI fragment) of an isolated clone pBK-CMV·PAF-4, was blunted and subcloned into theSmaI site of pBluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequence of both strands was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using Dye-terminator DNA sequence kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Alignment was done using a CLUSTAL W program (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). A32P-labeled, 0.65-kilobase pair BamHI fragment of open reading frame from rat (Rattus norvegicus;Rn) PEX14, RnPEX14, was used as a probe to screen 2.4 × 105 colonies of human liver cDNA library (16Tamura S.

CHO cell mutant ZP110 was transfected with pUcD2Hyg·RnPEX14, followed by selection in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). The hygromycin B-resistant colonies formed on the coverslips were examined for complementation of peroxisomes, 4 days after transfection. Peroxisome-restored colonies were counted. Seven other groups of CHO cell mutants, Z24, Z65, ZP92, ZP105, ZP109, ZP114, and ZP119, and fibroblasts derived from peroxisome-deficient patients were similarly transfected with pUcD2Hyg·RnPEX14. A stable cell clone of the RnPEX14 transformant of ZP110 was isolated as follows. Three of five hygromycin B-resistant transformant clones were peroxisome-positive, on the basis of immunostaining; one of the three, named 110P14, was cloned by the limiting dilution method. Transfection with human and Chinese hamster PEX14 (HsPEX14 andClPEX14, respectively) was likewise done, as withRnPEX14. Peroxisomes in CHO cells and human fibroblasts were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence light microscopy, under a Carl Zeiss Axioskop FL microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) using a number 17 filter, as described by Tateishi et al.

An epitope,myc, tagging to the C terminus of Pex14p was done with a PCR-based technique, using a forward primer (5′-CTGGATCCTGGAGTC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CCGGGTACCTCACAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATCAGCTTTTGTTCGTCTCGCTCACTCTC-3′) containing the myc epitope (underline) and a stop codon. myc-tagged RnPEX14 was cloned into pBluescript II KS(−) (pBS·RnPEX14-myc) by replacing theNheI–KpnI fragment of pBS·RnPEX14with NheI–KpnI fragment of PCR-amplified products using the primers described above. Plasmid pUcD2Hyg·RnPEX14-myc was constructed by inserting theXbaI–KpnI fragment of pBS·RnPEX14-myc into pUcD2SRαMCSHyg vector (21Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T.

Flag-tagging to the N terminus of RnPEX14 protein was likewise done by PCR using a forward primer, 5′-GCCCAGATCTTGGCGTCCTCGGAGC, and a reverse primer, 5′-TCAGGGCTGTGCCCGTCCTT-3′. Flag-tagged RnPEX14 in pUcD2Hyg·SRα vector (pUcD2Hyg·flag-RnPEX14) was constructed as follows. The BamHI fragment of pUcD2Hyg·RnPEX12 (21Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T.

All plasmid constructs were assessed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Pex14p-myc and Flag-Pex14p were detected using mouse monoclonal antibodies to human c-myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and Flag (M2) (Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT), and Texas Red-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG second antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan), in cells that had been permeabilized with either 25 μg/ml of digitonin or 1% Triton X-100. Liver was excised from a 7-week-old male Wistar rat and homogenized, as described by Miuraet al. (24Miura S. Kasuya-Arai I. Mori H. Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 1 μm each of pepstatin and leupeptin was added to a homogenizing buffer. A postnuclear supernatant fraction, prepared by centrifugation of the liver homogenates at 750 × g for 10 min, was then centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min, 25,000 ×g for 10 min, and 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate heavy and light mitochondria, microsomes, and cytosol, respectively (25Fujiki Y.

Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The light mitochondrial fraction (12 mg of protein) was further subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation (24Miura S. Kasuya-Arai I. Mori H. Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein and marker enzymes, catalase for peroxisomes, glutamate dehydrogenase for mitochondria, esterase for microsomes, and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase for lysosomes were assayed, essentially as described (17Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Protein in each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Pex14p and marker proteins were probed with respective antibodies and then visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For determination of intraperoxisomal localization, peroxisomal fraction was diluted with 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, and sonicated four cycles for 30 s each in the presence of 1m NaCl (17Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Membrane and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Sodium carbonate treatment (26Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) and Triton X-114 extraction (27Bodier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607PubMed Google Scholar) were performed as described. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein with rat Pex14p was constructed in Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as follows. The 3′-half of thePvuII fragment of pBS-RnPEX14 was inserted into the SmaI site of pGEX4T-1. This vector expresses the C-terminal region of Pex14p, termed GST-C. The 5′-half ofRnPEX14 was amplified using PCR primers (forward, 5′-GCCAGATCTGCGTCCTCGGAGCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTTCATCCACGTGGCTCAC-3′). GST-Pex14p-expression plasmid was constructed by replacing theBamHI fragment of GST-C with theBglII–BamHI fragment of the amplified 5′-half products of RnPEX14. GST fusion protein with a shorter isoform of Pex5p (Pex5pS) and a longer, 37-amino acid-inserted isoform Pex5p (Pex5pL) of Chinese hamster (14Otera H. Tateishi K. Okumoto K. Ikoma Y. Matsuda E.

Fujiki, unpublished observations. was ligated into the blunted SalI site of E. coli expression vector pQE30, containing a histidine tag sequence (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Five hundred μl each of 16-h culture of E. coli, separately expressing GST and GST fusion protein, were diluted with 10 volumes of YT medium at 2-fold concentration. After 1 h of culture at 37 °C, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the final concentration of 1 mm. After 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of chilled PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and then sonicated. Lysates were centrifuged, and supernatant was collected. The supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of 50% slurry glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed three times and resuspended in 250 μl of binding assay buffer: 50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.25% BSA, 25 μg/ml each of leupeptin and antipain, 50 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. GST-Pex5pS and GST-Pex5pL were separately mixed with Glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. After a thorough wash, the protein-bound Sepharose beads were suspended in 10 volumes of a cleavage buffer, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. GST-Pex5p was cleaved with PreScission Protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 5 h, and Pex5p was isolated as an eluate according to the procedure recommended by a manufacturer. His-Pex7p was isolated as follows. His6-tagged Pex7p-expressing E. coli cells were sonicated, and inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation. After solubilized with 8m urea, His-Pex7p was purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (QIAGEN), where elution was done with 0.5 m imidazole, 8 murea, according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. His-Pex7p was used at a 10–20-fold dilution. Binding reaction mixture contained protein components to be examined, including 20 μg of GST or GST-Pex14p, His-Pex7p (5 μg), and 35S-labeled 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (29Miura S. Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Fujiki Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (5 μl) in the binding assay buffer (400–500 μl) described above. The reaction was done overnight at 4 °C. A binding reaction was also done, using GST-Pex14p (3 μg), each of the two isoforms of Pex5p (3 μg) (i.e. Pex5pS or Pex5pL), 35S-labeled rat acyl-CoA oxidase (AOx) (30Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ohno K. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) (5 μl), GST-Pex14p (20 μg), and 35S-Pex14p (5 μl). Proteins were recovered using glutathione-Sepharose, washed four times with the binding assay buffer minus BSA, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% or 4–20% polyacrylamide gel. Radioactive protein bands were detected using a FujiX BAS1000 Bio-Autoimazing Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan), and His-Pex7p and Pex5p were detected by immunoblot using mouse monoclonal anti-RGS-His tag antibody (QIAGEN) and rabbit anti-Chinese hamster Pex5pS antibody, 4T. Harano, and Y. Fujiki, unpublished observations. respectively. Continuous cell labeling with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine was done by culturing cells for 24 h in a medium containing 20 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro transcription/translation (30Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ohno K. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Immunoprecipitation of proteins using antibodies to rat AOx and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and a catalase latency assay using digitonin were performed as described (11Tsukamoto T. Yokota S. Fujiki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, RNA was isolated from CHO cells and the liver of a rat treated for 7 days with clofibrate and of an untreated rat. The blot was hybridized with the BamHI fragment (nucleotide residues at 232–605) of RnPEX14 labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blot analysis was done with primary antibodies, including anti-Pex12p antiserum (20Okumoto K. Fujiki Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Okumoto K.

Increasing the dexamethasone treatment from 2 to 4 days resulted in a time-dependentpref-1 down-regulation and increased differentiation as measured by adipocyte marker mRNAs. The dexamethasone concentration between 1 and 10 nm showed a dose-dependent decrease in pref-1 mRNA and an enhancement of adipogenesis. To test the hypothesis that dexamethasone initiation of adipoconversion may be via down-regulation of pref-1, we lowered endogenous pref-1 mRNA levels by stably transfecting 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with antisense pref-1. At 1 μm, antisense cells had enhanced adipose conversion; a similar degree of differentiation occurred with 2 nm dexamethasone, a concentration that does not support differentiation of control 3T3-L1 cells.

Pref-1 is highly expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and is totally absent after their differentiation to mature adipocytes. Interfering with this normal repression ofpref-1 during adipogenesis by constitutive expression of pref-1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or by the addition of soluble pref-1 ectodomain markedly decreases adipocyte conversion (1Smas C.M.

Madsen B. Teisner B. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data, and the detection of soluble pref-1 in circulation (6Jensen C.H. Krogh T.N. Hojrup P. Clausen P.P. Skjodt K. Larsson L.I. Enghild J.J. Teisner B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), support a functional role for pref-1 in adipocyte differentiation in vivo. In this regard, pref-1 mRNA levels were recently shown to be elevated by adipose-specific expression of SREBP-1c in a transgenic mouse model of congenital generalized lipodystrophy, a condition characterized by poorly developed white and brown adipose tissue (7Shimomora I. Hammer K.E. Richardson J.S. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Pref-1 belongs to that class of proteins that can act as either transmembrane or soluble molecules; membrane-associated pref-1 is cleaved at two sites in the extracellular domain, thereby extending its potential range of function (4Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, pref-1 is hypothesized to exert its inhibitory function by mediating cell communication or interaction with an as yet unidentified receptor protein via its EGF repeats. In addition to full-length pref-1 (pref-1A), three alternately spliced transcripts with deletions in the juxtamembrane region are present in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Although all four transcripts generate transmembrane pref-1, two of these undergo processing to a soluble form of pref-1 corresponding to their respective complete ectodomains. The mode of pref-1 inhibitory function, juxtacrine or paracrine, may therefore depend on the specific alternate pref-1 transcript expressed. The presence of EGF-like domains in the pref-1 ectodomain, a protein motif demonstrated to mediate protein-protein interaction to control cell growth and differentiation in a variety of biological settings (8Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21393-21396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar), suggests that transmembrane and/or soluble pref-1 may function by interaction of its EGF-like domains with EGF-like domains of the putative pref-1 receptor present on the cell surface to maintain the preadipose phenotype. A combination of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor methylisobutylxanthine (MIX), first employed 20 years ago by Rubin and co-workers (11Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is the standard protocol for in vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells is routinely induced by a 2-day treatment of confluent preadipocytes with 1 μm dexamethasone and 0.5 mm MIX in the presence of fetal calf serum. 3–5 days after dexamethasone/MIX removal, the majority of cells attain an adipocyte phenotype. During the dexamethasone/MIX hormonal induction phase cells briefly express c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc; decrease surface area; and undergo postconfluent mitoses, subsequent clonal expansion, and growth arrest; however no overt adipose conversion occurs (12Ailhaud G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Because the continued presence of dexamethasone/MIX is not needed for the initial appearance of lipid droplets nor for maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype, these agents have been hypothesized to initiate and/or potentiate differentiation signals. Although the molecular targets of dexamethasone/MIX remain largely unknown, the basic transcriptional machinery mediating adipocyte differentiation involves the nuclear hormone receptor PPARγ and the C/EBP family of transcription factors (14Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 15Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These transcription factors, however, are not expressed solely in adipocytes (16Michael L.F. Lazar M.A. Mendelson C.R.

It is clear that superimposed on their actions is the ability of cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the hormone/growth factor microenvironment to modulate adipocyte differentiation positively or negatively (24Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 25Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). It remains to be clarified how the dexamethasone/MIX adipogenic agents transduce their respective differentiation signals at the molecular level. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are induced approximately 5–10-fold during hormonal treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by MIX and dexamethasone, respectively (26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar,27Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), which subsequently leads to PPARγ induction. However, recent studies argue against C/EBPδ as a major effector of dexamethasone action and indicate that dexamethasone may signal through pathways unrelated to C/EBP transcription factors (28Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The addition of soluble pref-1 ectodomain to culture media severely inhibits dexamethasone/MIX induction of differentiation, including inhibition of C/EBPα and PPARγ expression (30Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This supports the hypothesis that the inhibitory action of pref-1 is exerted early in differentiation and suggests that adipogenic agents may function in part through down-regulation of this adipo-inhibitory factor. To determine if the adipogenic effects of dexamethasone/MIX in the initiation of adipocyte differentiation may be relayed through down-regulation of the expression of pref-1, we examined the levels of pref-1 protein and mRNA during exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to these agents. We determined that pref-1 is an early target of dexamethasone action and that dexamethasone rapidly decreases pref-1 gene transcription. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between the dose response of pref-1repression by dexamethasone and the effective concentration(s) of dexamethasone capable of supporting adipocyte differentiation. Modulation of pref-1 levels by varying dexamethasone/MIX exposure times indicates that by maximally reducing pref-1 levels we increased the degree and uniformity of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, lowering of endogenous pref-1 levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, via antisense pref-1, substitutes in part for dexamethasone treatment in the promotion of adipogenesis, supporting a model whereby the rapid decrease of pref-1 gene transcription upon dexamethasone exposure may be a mechanism whereby glucocorticoids promote adipocyte differentiation. The pref-1 antisense construct, pAS-pref-1, was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the pref-1 coding sequence using the complete pref-1 cDNA sequence in pcDNA (Invitrogen) as a template. The primers were designed to add HindIII sites to both ends of the amplified product. TheHindIII-digested polymerase chain reaction fragment was inserted into HindIII sites of the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vector, which includes a neomycin-selectable marker. Orientation was determined by multiple restriction mapping. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For standard induction of adipocyte differentiation, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in fetal calf serum-containing medium were treated with 0.5 mm MIX and 1 μm dexamethasone. For evaluation of test agents, the medium was changed 1 day before the experiments, and confluent 3T3-L1 cells were treated for the indicated times and concentrations. For antisense studies the pAS-pref-1 plasmid construct was transfected via the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, and stable clones were established by selection in 400 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks. Clones were expanded and analyzed for the level of endogenous pref-1. For comparison of differentiation, 1 × 105 cells were plated in quadruplicate in six-well plates, and 7 days after differentiation RNA was harvested and subjected to Northern analysis. Cell monolayers of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and the crude membrane fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 30 min, clarified by brief spinning in a microcentrifuge, and protein content determined (Bio-Rad). The indicated amount of protein was loaded per lane in SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) using 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol transfer buffer. For immunodetection of proteins, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 1 × NET (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.05% Triton X-100 and 50 mm Tris-HCl, 7.4) followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with primary antiserum. For blocking experiments, the pref-1 antiserum was preincubated with 30 μg of the noted proteins for 1 h before the addition of the membrane. Detection of the antigen-antibody complexes was accomplished via goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad), and the peroxidase conjugate was developed with 0.015% H2O2, 16% methanol, 8.3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.05% w/v 4-chloro-1-naphthol. For enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detection, processing was essentially as above except that 5% bovine serum albumin was used for the blocking step, and product visualization was according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was prepared by guanidine isothiocyanate/cesium chloride ultracentrifugation or TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) extraction methods. RNA was electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels in 2.2 m formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Corporation). After UV cross-linking, filters were incubated at 42 °C for at least 4 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 50 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. After prehybridization, filters were hybridized under identical conditions to 32P-labeled random primed cDNA probes for at least 16 h or with strand-specific in vitro transcribed probes using the MaxiScript kit (Ambion). Posthybridization washes were for 30 min at room temperature in 1 × SSC, 1% SDS and then in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. After exposure to x-ray film with intensifying screen at −80 °C, autoradiograms were scanned using an imaging densitometer (GS670, Bio-Rad) and analyzed with Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) or Alpha Innotech digital imaging software. A template for the production of antisense RNA probe was prepared by insertion of a restriction fragment from bases 132 through 1312 of the pref-1 cDNA sequence into the EcoRI site of pcDNAI (Invitrogen) followed by linearization with SmaI at base 970 of the pref-1 sequence. The SmaI restriction site occurs in the region that is present in the pref-1A form of the transcript but is deleted in the alternate forms of the transcript, pref-1B, pref-1C, and pref-1D. Because pref-1C and pref-1D differ at the 5′-end but have the same 3′-end of their respective deletions, this probe will not distinguish between these two forms of the transcript. A32P-labeled antisense riboprobe of 397 base pairs was generated by use of SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega); this includes 53 base pairs of vector sequence and 342 base pairs of pref-1 cDNA sequence. The probe was purified by elution from 6% polyacrylamide gel and employed in a ribonuclease protection assay utilizing the RPAII kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Products were analyzed on 6% sequencing gels and fragment lengths determined by comparison with DNA sequencing ladders. 3T3-L1 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.32 msucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Nuclei collected by centrifugation were washed once by centrifugation in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 and stored in liquid nitrogen in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 40% glycerol. Run-on transcription was carried out at 30 °C for 45 min in a reaction mixture containing 5 × 107 nuclei and 125 μCi of [α-32P]UTP in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Labeled RNA was extracted with phenol and SDS at 65 °C, ethanol-precipitated, and subjected to a Sephadex G-50 spin column. 5 μg of each plasmid DNA was denatured by treating with 0.3 n NaOH for 30 min at 4 °C and applied to nitrocellulose filters using a slot-blot apparatus. Hybridization was carried out with 5 × 107cpm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 72 h. The filters were washed twice in 0.1% SDS, 2 × SSC at 22 °C and in 0.1% SDS, 0.1 × SSC at 60 °C. Standardin vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes involves induction of differentiation by treatment of confluent preadipocytes with dexamethasone/MIX for 48 h in the presence of fetal calf serum. This results in differentiated adipocytes 3–5 days later. The exact mechanism whereby dexamethasone/MIX promotes adipocyte differentiation is not known, and no overt differentiation to the adipose phenotype occurs during the dexamethasone/MIX treatment phase. A potential point at which these inducing agents exert their effects may involve down-regulation of the adipo-inhibitory factor pref-1. To begin to address if these agents affect pref-1 protein levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, antiserum was prepared against a TrpE/pref-1 fusion protein. Fig. 1 A demonstrates that in Western analysis of crude 3T3-L1 preadipocyte membrane preparations, the pref-1 antibody detects at least seven discrete pref-1 protein bands of 45–60 kDa. We have reported that this heterogeneity likely arises from multiple pref-1 transcripts and glycosylation of pref-1 protein (2Smas C.M. Green D. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9257-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The specificity of the signal is demonstrated by the fact that it is competed by preincubation of the pref-1 antiserum with bacterially produced TrpE/pref-1 protein but not with TrpE protein alone, and no signal is detected by normal rabbit serum nor with an antiserum raised against an unrelated TrpE fusion protein. In addition, no signal resulted when the pref-1 antibody was used in Western analysis of crude membrane fractions prepared from mouse L cells, a cell line that does not express pref-1 (data not shown). Western analysis of pref-1 protein levels after the standard 2-day incubation of confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with 1 μmdexamethasone and 0.5 mm MIX in combination or individually is shown in Fig. 1, B and C. Cells treated with dexamethasone/MIX for 48 h had a drastic reduction in all forms of the pref-1 protein compared with untreated control cells (Fig.1 B, bracket). No differential effect was noted; dexamethasone/MIX decreased all forms of the protein in a manner proportional to their initial levels in control cells. The degree of reduction in pref-1 protein by dexamethasone was comparable to that of dexamethasone/MIX, indicating that the decreased pref-1 protein content was primarily attributable to the effects of dexamethasone (Fig.1 C, bracket). We observed previously that in pref-1-transfected COS cells, the pref-1 protein half-life is less than 7 h (4Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The decrease in pref-1 protein content we observe with dexamethasone treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes is consistent with this relatively short half-life. The pattern of pref-1 protein species, with the disappearance of the higher molecular mass proteins in MIX-treated cells, resembles that for pref-1 protein in 3T3-L1 cells whenN-linked glycosylation is blocked by tunicamycin (4Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), indicating that MIX could possibly alter the glycosylation profile and subsequently influence protein half-life. Given the striking decrease in pref-1 protein levels by dexamethasone, we determined if this reflected changes in the pref-1 mRNA level by conducting northern analyses of pref-1 mRNA after a 48-h incubation of confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm MIX, or 1 μm dexamethasone and 0.5 mm MIX in combination. Dexamethasone and dexamethasone/MIX treatment affect pref-1 mRNA levels most dramatically. As shown in Fig.2 A, pref-1 mRNA levels in dexamethasone-treated cells decreased to approximately 20% of that of nontreated controls. Furthermore, the reduction of pref-1 mRNA by dexamethasone/MIX in combination is equal to that observed with dexamethasone alone. Decreased pref-1 mRNA content by dexamethasone and dexamethasone/MIX in combination paralleled the effects we observed at the protein level and suggests that dexamethasone is the primary agent down-regulating pref-1 levels when 3T3-L1 cells are subjected to the standard dexamethasone/MIX differentiation protocol. Although not as pronounced as the effects of dexamethasone, MIX decreased pref-1 mRNA levels somewhat. However, as shown in Fig. 1 C, MIX treatment resulted in a decrease in only the larger species of the pref-1 protein. Therefore, the Western and Northern analyses we present indicate that pref-1 is reduced drastically by the dexamethasone component of the adipogenic mixture and that this occurs during the dexamethasone/MIX hormonal induction phase, a time period when cells are presumably receiving differentiation signals. Boney et al. (31Boney C.M. Fiedorek Jr., F.T. Paul S.R. Gruppuso P.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2923-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have reported that in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, although neither dexamethasone nor MIX had an effect, decreased pref-1 mRNA levels were noted only with the complete differentiation mixture of dexamethasone/MIX plus insulin. These studies probably reflect gene expression during adipocyte differentiation but not the immediate effect of glucocorticoids on pref-1 expression. Northern analysis shows dexamethasone-mediated down-regulation of a pref-1 mRNA of 1.7 kilobases in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This signal, however, reflects the sum of at least four pref-1 transcripts that we have identified previously by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and through the isolation and sequence analysis of multiple independent pref-1 cDNA clones (2Smas C.M. Green D. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9257-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These arise by in-frame deletions of up to 225 base pairs of the pref-1 juxtamembrane region. Each of these transcripts generates a transmembrane protein that undergoes processing to release soluble products into culture media, with the nature of these soluble forms dependent on the type of pref-1 transcript expressed: pref-1A and pref-1B release large soluble products that apparently correspond to their complete ectodomain, whereas forms pref-1C and pref-1D do not shed their full ectodomain (4Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The soluble pref-1 ectodomain has been demonstrated to inhibit adipocyte differentiation. Because Northern analysis does not distinguish among these multiple transcripts, the possibility existed that the remaining pref-1 mRNA we detect after a 48-h dexamethasone treatment represents a form of the transcript not subjected to dexamethasone regulation. We therefore addressed whether the dexamethasone/MIX differentiation mixture, or dexamethasone alone, differentially regulates the various pref-1 transcripts. This could in turn govern the production and release of the soluble pref-1 ectodomain during the adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Ribonuclease protection assays were conducted with a probe that distinguishes those transcripts giving rise to the soluble full ectodomain, pref-1A and pref-1B, from those that do not, pref-1C and pref-1D. Results shown in Fig. 2 B indicate that the longest transcript (pref-1A) is the most abundant form in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and that together pref-1C and pref-1D constitute approximately 10% of the pref-1 mRNA species, and pref-1B 10%. Comparison of the signals for pref-1A and pref-1B versus those of pref-1C and pref-1D indicates that there are no differential effects of dexamethasone on the individual forms of the pref-1 transcript; all four forms are down-regulated by dexamethasone to the same extent we observed by Northern analysis. In addition, the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to examine the levels of each of these four major forms of pref-1 transcript in dexamethasone-treated and control 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed no differences in the relative amounts of the various pref-1 transcripts (data not shown). Therefore dexamethasone has equal inhibitory effects on those forms of pref-1 which shed the full ectodomain and those that do not undergo such processing. To examine the time course of dexamethasone down-regulation of pref-1 mRNA during the critical hormonal induction phase of adipocyte differentiation, RNA was prepared from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at confluence (time 0) and after culture in the presence of 1 μm dexamethasone for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h and from untreated control cells at 48 h postconfluence. The Northern analysis shown in Fig.3 A indicates that a decrease in pref-1 mRNA is first noted at 6 h, and it decreases through the final time point of 48 h. At this time we observed a decrease to approximately 25% of control levels. To illustrate that glucocorticoid down-regulation of pref-1 mRNA was the result of direct"
https://openalex.org/W2052888450,"In airway and renal epithelia, the glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport is associated with increased expression of the epithelial Na+ channel α subunit (αENaC). In H441 lung cells, 100 nm dexamethasone increases amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current (3.3 μA/cm2 to 7.5 μA/cm2), correlating with a 5-fold increase in αENaC mRNA expression that could be blocked by actinomycin D. To explore transcriptional regulation of αENaC, the human αENaC 5′-flanking region was cloned and tested in H441 cells. By deletion analysis, a ∼150-base pair region 5′ to the upstream promoter was identified that, when stimulated with 100 nm dexamethasone, increased luciferase expression 15-fold. This region, which contains two imperfect GREs, also functioned when coupled to a heterologous promoter. When individually tested, only the downstream GRE functioned in cis and bound GR in a gel mobility shift assay. In the M-1 collecting duct line Na+ transport, mαENaC expression and luciferase expression from αENaC genomic fragments were also increased by 100 nm dexamethasone. In a colonic cell line, HT29, trans-activation via a heterologously expressed glucocorticoid receptor restored glucocorticoid-stimulated αENaC gene transcription. We conclude that glucocorticoids stimulate αENaC expression in kidney and lung via activation of a hormone response element in the 5′-flanking region of hαENaC and this response, in part, is the likely basis for the up-regulation of Na+transport in these sites.

Transepithelial sodium transport in the collecting ducts of the kidney, in airway epithelia, and in sweat and salivary glands occurs principally via amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; MC, mineralocorticoid(s); GC, glucocorticoid(s); IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; Isc, short circuit current; RT, resistance; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotides; UTR, untranslated region; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; CCD, cortical collecting duct; PNMT, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; SRC-1, steroid receptor co-activator 1; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; MC, mineralocorticoid(s); GC, glucocorticoid(s); IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; Isc, short circuit current; RT, resistance; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotides; UTR, untranslated region; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; CCD, cortical collecting duct; PNMT, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; SRC-1, steroid receptor co-activator 1; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(1Barbry P.

This channel is a hetero-multimeric complex, composed of three distinct but homologous subunits termed α, β, and γ ENaC, that was first cloned from rat colon (2Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Two of the major physiologic functions of this channel are to absorb lung liquid at birth and to regulate Na+ and K+ homeostasis. Targeted disruption of the αENaC subunit causes fatal neonatal respiratory failure, whereas disruption of the β or γENaC subunit produces death from hyperkalemia (4Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J.

Williamson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1727-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Overactivity of the channel causes Na+retention, hypokalemia, and hypertension, a phenotype that can be produced by activating mutations in one of the channel subunits, by excessive production of mineralocorticoids (MC) or by excessive stimulation by endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids (GC) (7Lifton R. Science. 1996; 272: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar).GC and MC are two important physiological regulators of amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ transport in target epithelia where their cognate receptors are expressed. Dexamethasone or aldosterone increases αENaC mRNA expression in rat kidney cortex and in primary cultures of inner medullary collecting duct cells (IMCD) without any effect on β and γ ENaC expression (8Stokes J.B.

Dexamethasone, but not aldosterone, increases αENaC expression in fetal and adult rat lungsin vivo, and in fetal lung explants and cultured airway epithelial cells in vitro (8Stokes J.B. Sigmund R.D.

The mechanism of the increase in steady state levels of ENaC mRNAs following adrenal steroid treatment is unknown but has been presumed to be at the level of ENaC gene transcription.In this study, we identify the promoter and enhancer elements in the 5′-flanking region of the human αENaC gene that regulate basal and GC-mediated induction of αENaC gene expression. In addition we provide evidence that enhanced Na+ transport by two different cell lines (lung and kidney) is tightly linked to enhanced expression of αENaC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCycloheximide, dexamethasone, spironolactone, amiloride, and human placental collagen were purchased from Sigma. Actinomycin D was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, poly dI-dC from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and RU38486 was a generous gift from Roussel Uclaf (Romainville, France). Culture materials were from Life Technologies, Inc., and all radionucleotides were from NEN Life Science Products. Stock solutions of cycloheximide and actinomycin D were made in Me2SO and stocks of dexamethasone, spironolactone, and RU38486 made in ethanol.Tissue Culture and RNA IsolationThe human lung epithelial cell line, H441, and the human colon carcinoma cell line, HT29, were cultured as described previously (16Thomas C.P. Auerbach S.D. Stokes J.B. Volk K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1312-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse renal cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell line, M-1, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 with 10% fetal calf serum (17Stoos B. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Carretero O. Ito S. Fejes-Toth G. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 1168-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of dexamethasone on gene expression, cell cultures were switched to serum-free media and then exposed to various concentrations of dexamethasone or its vehicle for 24 h. Cycloheximide (10 μm), actinomycin D (1 μm), and the steroid receptor blockers, spironolactone (10 μm) and RU38486 (10 μm), were used in some experiments and compared with control cultures in the presence of vehicle alone. RNA was isolated from these cells as described previously (16Thomas C.P. Auerbach S.D. Stokes J.B. Volk K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1312-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Na+ Transport MeasurementsH441 and M-1 cells were seeded on 12-mm Millicell PCF filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which had been pretreated with human placental collagen. H441 cells were grown for 6 days in RPMI medium with 6% serum and 100 nm dexamethasone and the medium changed daily. A day prior to electrical measurements, the cells were placed in steroid-free media and the following day placed in serum-free RPMI with or without 100 nm dexamethasone. The Millicell PCF filters were then transferred to a specially designed chamber (Jim's Instruments, Iowa City, IA) to measure transepithelial voltage, resistance (R T) and short circuit current (Isc) at 37 °C (18Husted R.F. Laplace J.R. Stokes J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). M-1 cells were grown for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 nm triiodothyronine, 50 nm hydrocortisone, 10 nm sodium selenite, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 nm dexamethasone. The filters were then grown for 1 day without albumin and steroids and then with or without 100 nm dexamethasone and 10 μmspironolactone for another 24 h.Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA)To measure steady state levels of hαENaC gene expression, a previously described cDNA template that would distinguish exon 1A-initiated (αENaC-1) from exon 1B-initiated (αENaC-2, 3, 4) transcripts was used to synthesize antisense [α-32P]cRNAs (16Thomas C.P. Auerbach S.D. Stokes J.B. Volk K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1312-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To control for RNA extraction, quantitation and gel loading, an 18 S rRNA template (pTR1–18SRNA, Ambion, Austin, TX) was used. Sample RNAs were co-hybridized overnight with ENaC and 18 S riboprobes, digested with RNase A and T1, and analyzed by PAGE as described previously (16Thomas C.P. Auerbach S.D. Stokes J.B. Volk K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1312-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To measure steady state levels of mouse αENaC mRNA, a 451-bp fragment corresponding to sequence from the 3′ portions of the coding region was amplified and cloned into pCRII and linearized at an internal BsmFI site to protect a 132-nt product. As a control a mouse β-actin template (pTR1-β-actin, Ambion) was used to protect a 99-nt fragment. Antisense biotinylated cRNA probes were synthesized using the Brightstar Psoralen-Biotin kit (Ambion). Sample RNAs were co-hybridized with both riboprobes, digested with RNase A and T1, resolved by PAGE, transferred to nylon membranes, and developed by the Brightstar Biodetect system (Ambion) (8Stokes J.B. Sigmund R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1699-C1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To quantitate mRNA expression, the autoradiograms were scanned with a PDI scanning densitometer and the density of individual bands measured using Quantity One software (Huntington Station, NY). Each ENaC band was normalized for the density of 18 S or β-actin band, and the data from three to four experiments pooled and analyzed by Student's t test and by analysis of variance.Cloning of the 5′-Flanking Region of hαENaCSequence information from the 5′ end of the SCNN1A locus was provided to us by the Chromosome 12 Mapping and Sequencing Center at Albert Einstein University. The transcription start sites for hαENaC have been mapped and previously reported (16Thomas C.P. Auerbach S.D. Stokes J.B. Volk K.A. Am. J.

To clone the ∼1500 bp of 5′-flanking region upstream of exon 1A, primer α25 (5′-ACCCAGCACCCAGAGAGCAGACGAA) and primer α23 (5′-TCAGGCCCTGCAGAGAAGAGAGAAGAGGTC) were used to amplify a DNA fragment from human genomic DNA. This fragment, which includes 55 nt of the 5′ UTR of αENaC-1, was directionally subcloned into pGL3basic (Promega, Madison, WI) upstream of the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase coding region. The primers α18 (5′-GAGGGGGTGGCGAGGAATCA) and α21 (5′-CTCGAGCTGTGTCCTGATTC) were used to amplify ∼700 bp of sequence upstream of αENaC-2, digested with Bsu36I and then subcloned into pGL3basic. This genomic DNA fragment begins downstream of the transcription start site of αENaC-1 and includes 682 nt 5′ to the transcription start site of αENaC-2 and 100 nt of its 5′ UTR. Deletion variants of these constructs were created by using internal restriction enzyme sites or by re-amplification using internal primers.To test the glucocorticoid-responsive enhancer region in reverse orientation and with a heterologous promoter, anAvrII site was introduced at −289 using primer α27 (5′-CCTAGGCTCCGGGTCTGTGTCCA). A native Avr II site at −142 allowed the recovery of a 146-nt fragment, which was cloned in reverse orientation upstream of a P1 construct at −142 and a P2 construct at +322. The glucocorticoid-responsive DNA fragment was also cloned upstream of a 459-nt hγENaC promoter (19Thomas C.P. Doggett N.A. Fisher R. Stokes J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26062-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) coupled to luciferase. To test individual glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in transfection assays, single-stranded oligonucleotides that correspond to the putative GREs were synthesized and then annealed together. The flanking SacI and AvrII overhangs were used to clone these fragments into the native AvrII site upstream of αENaC-1 (see sequence below).SEQUENCES 1–3 Transfection and Functional Analysis of the 5′-Flanking DNA ClonesSubconfluent H441 cells grown in 12-well plates were used for transfection. 1 μg of the firefly luciferase construct or the parent plasmid pGL3basic and 1–2 μg of a control plasmid pSVβ-gal, where the Escherichia coli lacZ gene is cloned downstream of the SV40 promoter (Promega) was combined with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and added to each well. For transfection of M-1 cells, monolayers from two T75 flasks were trypsinized, and then resuspended in 2 ml of a solution containing 120 mm KCl, 150 μm CaCl2, 10 mmK2HPO4, 10 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm EGTA 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm ATP, 250 mmglutathione, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6. A 500-μl aliquot of cells was combined with 20 μg of a luciferase construct and 40 μg of pSVβ-gal in a 0.4-cm cuvette and then electroporated (Electroporator II, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 330 V, 1000 microfarads. and 500 ohms. Each aliquot of cells was then diluted with complete medium and plated into four to six wells of a 12-well plate. 24–48 h following transfection, cells were placed in serum-free medium and dexamethasone or vehicle were added where appropriate; another 24 h later, cell lysates were prepared for measurement of reporter gene activity. For HT29 cells, LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as the transfecting reagent. As HT29 cells contained a high level of endogenous β-galactosidase activity, we used pRL-SV40 (Promega), where the sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase gene is cloned downstream of the SV40 promoter, as the internal control plasmid. In some experiments, 1 μg of the plasmid p6RGR, where the rat glucocorticoid receptor cDNA is under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (gift from D. Pierce and K. Yamamoto) was co-transfected with the luciferase vectors.For preparation of cell lysates, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into Lysis buffer (Luciferase assay kit, Promega). An aliquot of cell lysate was added to Luciferase Assay reagent and activity measured in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI) for 5 s. For measurement of β-galactosidase activity, an equal aliquot of cell lysate was incubated with the substrate Galacton-plus (Tropix, Bedford, MA) for 30 to 60 min and then activity measured in a luminometer for 5 s. Lysates from HT29 cells were made with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and firefly luciferase activity, reflecting transcriptional strength of cloned ENaC gene fragments, and sea pansy luciferase activity was sequentially measured in the same sample using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay kit (Promega).Gel Mobility Shift AssayOligonucleotides that correspond to the functional αENaC GRE or to a nonspecific sequence were synthesized and annealed together (see sequences below).SEQUENCES 4 and 5 For gel mobility shift experiments, 50,000 cpm of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated with recombinant human glucocorticoid receptor (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO) in a 20-μl reaction mixture that contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 ng/ml poly(dI-dC), 5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. For competition experiments, a 50-fold excess of cold oligonucleotides were used. All constituents except the labeled probe were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then incubated with the labeled probe at 22 °C for 30 min. Samples were then resolved on a 3.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 20:1) in 0.5× TBE buffer run at 150 V.RESULTSGC increases αENaC mRNA expression in lung and kidney cortex and in cultured epithelial cells derived from these tissues (8Stokes J.B.

To address the mechanisms whereby GC increase αENaC mRNA expression, we used a human lung cell line H441 and mouse CCD cell line M-1. We found that H441 cells, when grown on permeable supports in the presence of dexamethasone, develop as a tight epithelium and have electrogenic ion transport measured as a positive Isc from the apical to the basolateral compartment (Fig.1 A). This current was almost completely blocked by 10 μm amiloride applied to the apical side (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the bulk of the Isc was accounted for by amiloride-sensitive electrogenic Na+transport pathways. To examine the effect of dexamethasone on Na+ transport, H441 cells were placed in steroid-free media for 24 h and then exposed to 100 nm dexamethasone or vehicle for another 24 h. Dexamethasone increased Isc from 3.3 μA/cm2 to 7.5 μA/cm2 (Fig. 1 C), similar to results obtained from primary cultures of airway epithelial cells (15Champigny G. Voilley N. Lingueglia E. Friend V. Barbry P. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2177-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).We have previously reported that heterogeneity in hαENaC transcripts arise from alternate transcription start sites and from splicing at the 5′ end of hαENaC (16Thomas C.P. Auerbach S.D. Stokes J.B. Volk K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1312-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exon 1A begins at the upstream transcription start site and gives rise to αENaC-1 while a second transcription start site 724 bp downstream in an alternate first exon (exon 1B) gives rise to αENaC-2,3,4 (Fig. 2). 24 h of treatment with dexamethasone increased expression of both αENaC transcripts in a dose-dependent manner with the earliest effect seen at 10 nm (Fig.3 A). The basal expression of exon 1A-intiated transcripts was greater than exon 1B-initiated transcripts, and this difference persisted through the dose-response curve. The effect of GC on αENaC expression was blocked by RU38486, a type II (glucocorticoid receptor; GR) antagonist, but not by spironolactone, a type I (mineralocorticoid receptor; MR) antagonist, confirming that these effects required GR binding (Fig. 3 B). The effect of GC on αENaC expression was blocked by co-administration of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, suggesting that GC stimulates αENaC expression by increasing gene transcription rather than by affecting mRNA stability (Fig. 3 C). Cycloheximide, a general inhibitor of translation, did not prevent GC-induction of hαENaC mRNA expression and may have augmented expression of the hαENaC-1 transcript (Fig. 3 D).Figure 2Schematic of the 5′ end of human αENaC gene including 1400 nt 5′ to αENaC-1 transcription start site.

We focused our attention on identification of the putative promoters as well as the GC-regulated elements of the αENaC gene. Constructs that included either transcription start site and portions of their proximal 5′-flanking sequence were able to stimulate luciferase expression in H441 cells (Fig. 4 A). The ability of constructs containing sequence 5′ to each transcription start site (e.g. −142 + 44 and +322 +814) to increase luciferase gene transcription suggest that separate promoters direct expression of αENaC-1 and αENaC-2. Two of the five tested constructs robustly stimulated luciferase activity when treated with 100 nm dexamethasone (Fig. 4 A). Analysis of the sequence common to these constructs (−487 and −142) revealed that it contained one or more GREs. The magnitude of the dexamethasone-induced luciferase gene transcription is similar to the magnitude of αENaC mRNA stimulation in H441 cells (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that transcriptional activation of this region is sufficient to account for the effect of dexamethasone on steady state αENaC mRNA levels. A preliminary analysis of the nucleotide sequence in this region between −289 and −142 showed two imperfect GREs, TGTcCannnTGTcCT (Up-GRE) and AGAACAnnnTGTcCT (Dn-GRE), which are candidate cis-elements to mediate this effect.Figure 4A, separate promoters drive expression of transcripts αENaC-1 and αENaC-2 and a dexamethasone-responsive region maps to a site between −487 and −142 of the human αENaC gene. Left panel, 5′ end of αENaC including the 5′-flanking region showing putative transcription factor binding motifs. The location and extent of genomic fragments coupled to the luciferase (luc) coding region are shown. The αENaC transcription start sites are shown as bent arrows. Right panel, the genomic constructs were compared with the empty plasmid pGL3basic and the luciferase assay corrected for β-gal activity is shown. Each construct was tested with (black bar) and without (white bar) dexamethasone (100 nm for 24 h). *,p < 0.002 compared with pGL3basic; #,p < 0.02 compared with the absence of dexamethasone; +, p < 0.002 compared with the absence of dexamethasone.

In the case of the P1 promoter, a construct as short as −82 to +44 was active, suggesting that the minimal promoter was contained within this region (Fig. 4 B). In the case of the P2 promoter, a construct as short as +476 to +874 was active while the construct (+596+814) that included just ∼70 nt of 5′-flanking sequence was not, suggesting that the minimal promoter included sequences 5′ to this construct. (Fig. 4 C). To determine if the region between −289 and −143 in the 5′-flanking region of the hαENaC gene could transduce the glucocorticoid effect, a 146-bp sequence containing these elements were cloned in reverse orientation (−289−143INV) upstream of the P1 and P2 promoters and transfected into H441 cells. As expected for a classic “enhancer,” these elements functioned in reverse orientation to confer glucocorticoid responsiveness to both promoters (Fig. 5, A and B). These experiments confirm that the defined region is sufficient to direct glucocorticoid-regulated gene transcription from P1 and P2. We also tested this αENaC genomic fragment with the promoter for hγENaC. Our results show that the enhancer region of αENaC confers glucocorticoid responsiveness to this heterologous promoter (Fig.5 C).Figure 5The glucocorticoid-responsive enhancer tested with homologous and heterologous promoters. The steroid-responsive enhancer localized to a 146-bp sequence and functions in a direction-independent manner. Portions of the hαENaC 5′-flanking region with the location of two putative glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) are shown. Panels A andB, a 146-bp sequence containing both GREs was ligated to a P1 or P2 construct in reverse orientation and tested in H441 cells without (ctrl) or with 100 nm dexamethasone (dex) for 24 h. Panel A, *,p < 0.01 compared with control; #, p< 0.005 compared with −142+44 construct. Panel B, *,p < 0.05 compared with control.

UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine β1,3-galactosyltransferase(s) (β3Gal-Ts) are required for the synthesis of the sialyl Lewis a epitope. In the present study, a novel β3Gal-T, named β3Gal-T5, was isolated from a Colo205 cDNA library using a degenerate primer strategy based on the amino acid sequences of the four human β3Gal-T genes cloned to date. Transfection experiments demonstrated that HCT-15 cells transfected with the β3Gal-T5 gene expressed all the type 1 Lewis antigens. In gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer cell lines, the amounts of β3Gal-T5 transcripts were quite well correlated with the amounts of the sialyl Lewis a antigens. The β1,3Gal-T activity toward agalacto-lacto-N-neotetraose was also well correlated with the amounts of β3Gal-T5 transcripts in a series of cultured cancer cells, and in Namalwa and HCT-15 cells transfected with theβ3Gal-T5 gene. Thus, the β3Gal-T5 gene is the most probable candidate responsible for the synthesis of the type 1 Lewis antigens in gastrointestinal and pancreatic epithelia and tumor cells derived therefrom.

Nature. 1993; 365: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Takada A. Ohmori K. Yoneda T. Tsuyuoka K. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 354-361PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical statistical analysis demonstrated that cancer patients who express abundant sLea antigens have a worse prognosis as to liver metastasis than patients who do not express sLeaantigens (7Nakayama T. Watanabe M. Katsumata T. Teramoto T. Kitajima M. Cancer. 1995; 75: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Nakayama T. Watanabe M. Teramoto T. Kitajima M. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 1379-1382PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is of interest that sLea antigens may confer some metastatic capacity on cancer cells. At least three glycosyltransferases are required for the synthesis of the sLea epitope. First,N-acetylglucosamine-β1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3Gal-T) transfers a galactose (Gal) to an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) with a β1,3-linkage, resulting in the synthesis of a type 1 chain, Galβ1,3GlcNAc, and then galactose-α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal) transfers a sialic acid (SA) to the Gal residue of the type 1 chain with an α2,3-linkage, resulting in sialyl-type 1 (sialyl Lewis c; sLec) chain, SAα2,3Galβ1,3GlcNAc, synthesis. Finally, α1,3/4-fucosyltransferase (Fuc-TIII, FUT3, Lewis enzyme) transfers a fucose (Fuc) to the GlcNAc residue of the sialyl-type 1 chain with an α1,4-linkage to complete the synthesis of the structure, SAα2,3Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc. In previous studies, we demonstrated that Fuc-TIII (FUT3) is the only enzyme determining the expression of sLea antigens in colorectal cancer (3Narimatsu H. Iwasaki H. Nishihara S. Kimura H. Kudo T.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 512-518PubMed Google Scholar), and that ST3GalIV, one of the ST3Gals, mainly participates in the sLea synthesis in colorectal cancer (9Kudo T. Ikehara Y. Togayachi A. Morozumi K. Watanabe M. Nakamura M. Nishihara S. Narimatsu H. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 797-811PubMed Google Scholar).

The recent rapid growth of data bases of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and the Human Genome Project enabled us to find novel genes homologous to the original one. Thus, three human β3Gal-T genes homologous to the original one were cloned very recently (11Kolbinger F. Streiff M.B. Katopodis A.G. J. Biol.

It has not been elucidated which β3Gal-T determines the expression of the sLea epitopes in gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers. The tissue distributions of the four β3Gal-Ts were determined by Northern analysis (11Kolbinger F. Streiff M.B. Katopodis A.G. J. Biol.

They did not examine the expression of those β3Gal-Ts in the gastrointestinal tissues, such as colon and stomach, which frequently produce the sLea antigens when they become cancerous. In this study, we first noticed that none of the four human β3Gal-Ts cloned to date, β3Gal-T1 to -T4, is responsible for the sLea expression in gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers, and successfully cloned a novel β3Gal-T gene, namedβ3Gal-T5, from Colo205 cells. β3Gal-T5 is the most probable candidate participating in the synthesis of the sLea epitopes, i.e. CA19-9 antigens, in gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer cells. Various tumor cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The monoclonal antibodies used in this study were as follows: 1116NS19-9 (19-9), which was used for the detection of tumor marker CA19-9, anti-sLea (IgG) (2Magnani J.L. Nilsson B. Brockhaus M.

The cDNA encoding β3Gal-T1 was cloned by the expression cloning method used in our previous study (10.Sasaki, K., Sasaki, E., Kawashima, K., Hanai, N., Nishi, T. & Hasegawa, M.

The full-length cDNAs encoding the other three homologous sequences were cloned from various human cDNA libraries using probes encoding the fragment sequences in the EST data base.

Thus, the four human cDNAs encoding the respective full-length open reading frames (ORFs) of β3Gal-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4 were subcloned into the pAMo vector for expression in cultured cells (17Kudo T.

A cDNA library was constructed by inserting size-fractionated cDNAs (more than 1.5 kilobase pairs) into an expression vector, pAMo, using SfiI adaptors (17Kudo T. Ikehara Y. Togayachi Y. Kaneko M.

We obtained about 1 × 106independent clones as a cDNA library and extracted plasmid DNAs from the library. On alignment of the amino acid sequences of the four cloned β3Gal-Ts, we found conserved amino acid sequences at three positions, and named them Motifs 1, 2, and 3 (Table I). The conserved amino acid sequences of Motifs 1, 2, and 3 were employed for the design of degenerate primer sequences, i.e. primers at-1 (5′ primer for Motif 1), 5′-GCI AT(A/C/T) (A/C)GI CA(A/G) ACI TGG GG-3′; at-2 (3′ primer for Motif 2), 5′-(A/G)TC (A/G)CT (A/G)TC IGT (C/T)TT CAT IAC (A/G)TA-3′; at-3 (5′ primer for Motif 2), 5′-TA(C/T) GTI ATG AA(A/G) ACI GA(C/T) TCI GA(C/T)-3′; and at-4 (3′ primer for Motif 3), 5′-(A/G)CA IA(A/G) ICC IAC (A/G)TA IAC (A/G)TC (C/T)TC-3′, respectively.Table IConserved amino acid motifs in the β3Gal-T familyMotif 1Motif 2Motif 3β3Gal-T199AIRETWG172YVMKTDSD264EDVYVGLCβ3Gal-T2169AIRQTWG247YVMKTDSD340EDVYVGICβ3Gal-T396AIRVTWG175YVMKTDTD266EDVYVGICβ3Gal-T489AIRASWG170YVLKTDDD290EDFYVGVS Open table in a new tab The cDNAs of the Colo205 cDNA library described above were used as templates for PCR amplification to obtain a DNA fragment. Two PCRs were performed with two sets of degenerate primers, respectively,i.e. the first PCR was performed with primers at-1 and at-2, and the second PCR with primers at-3 and at-4. The amplified PCR products were inserted into a pBluescript SK (−) (pBS) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the DNA fragments obtained were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Two fragment DNAs contained novel nucleotide sequences, which, however, were homologous to the corresponding regions of the clonedβ1,3GalT genes. On an additional PCR involving Colo205 cDNAs as templates using primers encompassing the two fragment sequences, both fragments were found to be encoded by one species of cDNA. The two DNA fragments obtained through the two PCRs,i.e. those with the Motif 1 and 2 primers, and the Motif 2 and 3 primers, respectively, were mixed and used as the probe for hybridization to isolate full-length cDNA clones. We screened the Colo205 cDNA library and isolated several distinct clones having inserts of different sizes. All inserts encoded the same sequence of one species of cDNA, this sequence being found to be homologous to those of the known four β3Gal-Ts. Thus, we named this novel gene the human β3Gal-T5 gene. After the cDNA sequences had been completed, we searched the data base of the Human Genome Project to determine whether the same sequence or homologous ones were registered or not. We found a genome sequence completely identical to the cDNA sequences in the data base, which was very recently registered (June 2nd, 1998). Its registration number is AF064860. By comparison between the cDNA sequences and the genome one, we determined the genomic organization of the β3Gal-T5 gene. By the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) method using two primers,i.e. si-1 (5′-GAAAGGATTTAGACTGTACATGC-3′), this sequence being positioned close to the ATG codon in the ORF, and si-2 (5′-GTGAATTCCTCTTTCTCTGCTG-3′), we obtained five different types of amplified fragments, and subcloned them into a pBS (−) vector for sequencing. Thus, five isoforms, isoforms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, of β3Gal-T5 transcript were identified. Further RT-PCR experiments were performed to determine the abundance of each isoform of the β3Gal-T5 transcript expressed in Colo205 cells, for which the following primers were employed, primers si-1, si-2, si-3 (5′-TGAAAGGAACAAAATCCAATGAT-3′), and si-4 (5′-AGAACCCTGACTAATACACCTGGA-3′). The principle of the competitive RT-PCR method was described in detail in our previous papers (9Kudo T. Ikehara Y. Togayachi A. Morozumi K. Watanabe M. Nakamura M. Nishihara S. Narimatsu H. Lab.

Competitor DNA plasmids each carrying a small deletion within the respective full-length ORF cDNA were constructed by appropriate restriction endonuclease digestion as shown in Table II.

Open table in a new tab Total cellular RNA was isolated from various tumor cell lines and human tissues. Complementary DNAs were synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer from 6 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA in a 20-μl (total volume) reaction mixture using a SuperscriptTMPreamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). After cDNA synthesis, the reaction mixture was diluted 50-fold with H2O and then stored at −80 °C until use. The competitive RT-PCR was performed with AmpliTaq GoldTM(Perkin Elmer) in a 50-μl (total volume) reaction mixture comprising 10 μl of standard plasmid DNA or sample cDNA, 10 μl of competitor DNA at the optimal concentration, which differs with the transcript, and 0.2 μm amounts of each primer of the gene-specific primer sets listed in TableII. The PCR buffer for the competitive RT-PCR comprised 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μm of each dNTP, and 0.001% (w/v) gelatin. PCR was performed with a pre-PCR heat step at 95 °C for 11 min, followed by the optimal number of PCR cycles, each of which comprised 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at the optimal annealing temperature (Table II), and 2 min at 72 °C. After the competitive RT-PCR, a 10-μl aliquot was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel and the bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The intensities of the amplified fragments were quantified by scanning positive pictures using the public domain NIH Image program. 2The NIH Image program was developed at the National Institutes of Health and is available through the Internet by anonymous FTP from zippy.nimh.nih.gov or on a floppy disk from the National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA (part no. PB95-500195GEI). Measurement of the β-actin transcript in each sample was performed using the same competitive RT-PCR method as for the β3Gal-T transcripts. Each value for the β3Gal-T and β-actin transcripts was plotted on the respective standard curve to obtain the actual amount of each transcript. The actual amount of each β3Gal-T transcript was divided by that of β-actin for normalization. Each of the five β3Gal-T genes subcloned into the pAMo vector was stably transfected by the electroporation method into Namalwa or HCT-15 cells. These cells were selected in the presence of Geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Stable transformant cells were obtained after 25 days of exposure to Geneticin. Cell homogenates of stable transformants expressing each of the β3Gal-T genes were subjected to assaying of β3Gal-T activity. The levels of the transcripts expressed in the transformant cells were measured by means of competitive RT-PCR to normalize the β3Gal-T activity. The stable transformants of HCT-15 cells were subjected to limiting dilution to obtain single transformant clones. The expression of type 1 Lewis antigen epitopes, i.e. the Lea, Leb, sLec, and sLea epitopes, on the surface of the cultured tumor cells and the cells transfected with each of theβ3Gal-T genes was examined by flow cytometry analysis using an Epics Elite (Coulter, Tokyo, Japan). The transfected cells (1 × 106) were incubated with a first antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h on ice, and then washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgM or IgG (Bio-Rad). Then, the cells were washed again with PBS-BSA and finally subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Cell pellets were solubilized in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2% Triton X-100 by brief sonication. Proteins separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to an Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a Transblot SD cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 5% skim milk at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with 10 μg/ml 19-9. The membrane was stained according to the manual with the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) was pyridylaminated as in the previous study (17Kudo T. Ikehara Y. Togayachi Y. Kaneko M. Hiraga T. Sasaki K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26729-26738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The pyridylaminated-LNnT (LNnT-PA) was digested with 20 milliunits/ml streptococcal β-galactosidase (Seikagaku-Kogyo) to remove the galactose residue at the nonreducing end. Thus, agalacto-LNnT-PA was prepared, and used for assaying β3Gal-T activity. Namalwa and HCT-15 cells tranfected stably with each of the β3Gal-T genes, and various cultured cells were solubilized in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2% Triton X-100. The β1,3Gal-T activity was assayed in 14 mm HEPES buffer (pH7.4), 75 μm UDP-Gal, 11 μm MnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 25 μm acceptor substrate. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the enzyme reactions were terminated by boiling for 3 min., followed by dilution with water. After centrifugation of the reaction mixtures at 15,000 rpm for 5 min., 10 μl of each supernatant was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography analysis on a TSK-gel ODS-80TS column (4.6 × 300 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction products were eluted with 20 mmammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) at the flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 25 °C and monitored with a Jasco FP-920 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). Various tumor cell lines derived from different human tissues were examined as to the transcript levels of the fourβ3Gal-T genes that were cloned previously, and their expression levels were compared with the amounts of type 1 Lewis antigens, i.e. the sLea (19-9), Lea(7LE), and Leb (TT42) antigens, expressed in these cancer cells (Fig. 1). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Colo205, Colo201, and SW1116 (colon cancer) cells, and Capan-2 (pancreatic cancer) cells expressed large amounts of type 1 Lewis antigens, these results being consistent with those of a previous study (20Yago K. Zenita K. Ginya H. Sawada M. Ohmori K. Okuma M. Kannagi R. Lowe J.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5559-5565PubMed Google Scholar). All the above cell lines except for Capan-2 were strongly stained with the three antibodies, i.e. 19-9 (anti-sLea), 7LE (anti-Lea), and TT42 (anti-Leb) antibodies. Capan-2 cells were also strongly stained with 19-9, but not with 7LE or TT42. However, these four types of cells did not express β3Gal-T1 or β3Gal-T2 transcripts at all. The expression of β3Gal-T1 was abundantly detected in PC-1 (lung cancer) cells, and faintly detected in Jurkat (T cell leukemia) and PC-3 (prostatic cancer) cells. β3Gal-T2 was expressed in Namalwa and SK-N-MC (neuroblastoma) cells at intermediate levels, and faintly expressed in some cell lines from gastrointestinal cancers. β3Gal-T3 was abundantly expressed in some gastric cancer cells, i.e.KATO III and MKN45 cells, and PC-3 cells, and intermediately expressed in Capan-1 and Capan-2 (pancreatic cancer) cells, HCT-15 cells, and SK-N-MC and SK-N-SH (neuroblastoma) cells; however, it was not detected at all in Colo201 or Colo205 cells. We observed a significant discrepancy between the expression of the three β3Gal-Ts, i.e. β3Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3, and the expression of the type 1 Lewis antigens in these cell lines. In contrast, the expression of β3Gal-T4 appeared to be correlated with the type 1 Lewis antigen expression, i.e. the cells expressing type 1 Lewis antigens, i.e. Colo201, Colo205, SW1116, HT-29, and Capan-2 cells, also expressed substantial amounts of the β3Gal-T4 transcript. β3Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3 could synthesize the type 1 chain (11Kolbinger F.

Previous studies have demonstrated that unique receptor events occur in different cell types supporting investigation of CCR-3-mediated events in eosinophilic cells. We now report biochemical characterization of CCR-3 internalization following exposure of eosinophils to CCR-3 ligands. Treatment of freshly isolated human eosinophils with CCR-3 ligands resulted in marked and differential internalization of CCR-3 in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to 100 ng/ml eotaxin reduced surface expression to 43, 43, and 76% at 15 min, 1 h, and 3 h, respectively. RANTES (reduced on activation T cell expressed and secreted) treatment induced more significant and prolonged internalization of CCR-3 than eotaxin; following 100 ng/ml of RANTES, 29, 24, and 47% of the receptor was expressed at 15 min, 3 h, and 18 h, respectively. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that receptor modulation involved receptor internalization by an endocytic pathway shared with the transferrin receptor. Receptor internalization was accompanied by partial degradation of CCR-3, and reexpression of CCR-3 was dependent in part upon de novo protein synthesis. Internalization was not blocked by pretreatment of eosinophils with pertussis toxin. Furthermore, staurosporine did not inhibit internalization although it blocked phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced CCR-3 down-modulation. These results demonstrate that CCR-3 ligands induce differential receptor internalization that is not dependent upon Gi-protein coupling, calcium transients, or protein kinase C.

Elucidating the processes that regulate eosinophil tissue accumulation is fundamental, since these cells markedly increase in tissue locations and cause potent proinflammatory effects in numerous diseases.Recent studies have focused on the orchestration of eosinophil tissue accumulation by chemokines, especially eotaxin, the most selective eosinophil chemoattractant identified to date (4Jose P.J.

Most CXC chemokines are active on neutrophils, while CC chemokines have variable potencies for monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. In addition to mediating leukocyte chemoattraction and activation, selected chemokine receptors (e.g. CXCR-4, CCR-2, CCR-3, and CCR-5) serve as co-receptors for the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 into cells (11Bates P.

This receptor appears to play a central role in allergic responses, since it is not only expressed on eosinophils but also on basophils and Th2 lymphocytes, other cells central in allergic responses (12Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (Correction (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11034): 16491-16494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 14Daugherty B.L.

Of these chemokines, only eotaxin signals exclusively through CCR-3. Eotaxin has been shown to be responsible for eosinophil trafficking during base-line and inflammatory processes (18Gonzalo J.-A.

S. A. 1998; 95: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Following ligand binding to GPCRs, cellular responses are rapidly attenuated. This may be particularly important in eosinophils, since treatment of eosinophils with eotaxin, a chemokine specific for CCR-3, for only 10 min in vitro results in chemokine unresponsiveness for at least 8 h when the cells are adoptively transferred in vivo (21Teixeira M.M. Wells T.N. Lukacs N.W. Proudfoot A.E. Kunkel S.L. Williams T.J. Hellewell P.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A variety of mechanisms may be responsible for signal attenuation including receptor desensitization, endocytosis, and down-regulation (24Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Each receptor and each cell type utilize unique mechanisms indicating the importance of elucidating individual receptor events in the appropriate cell type (25Uhing R.J. Gettys T.W. Tomhave E. Snyderman R. Didsbury J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to analyze CCR-3-mediated events in eosinophilic cells rather than CCR-3-transfected heterologous cells. We now report biochemical analysis of CCR-3 internalization following exposure of human eosinophils to CCR-3 ligands.DISCUSSIONWe report that CCR-3 is rapidly removed from the cell surface into an intracellular endocytic compartment following ligand binding. The two CCR-3 ligands studied, eotaxin and RANTES, induced a different magnitude and duration of receptor internalization. In all cases, RANTES was more potent and induced a longer duration of internalization than eotaxin although it was not a stronger chemoattractant in previous studies (15Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and in eosinophil transmigration assays (data not shown). This suggests that internalization of CCR-3 involves molecular events that are dissociated, at least in part, from the signals involved in triggering chemotaxis. Consistent with this, chemokine-induced internalization was not dependent upon G-protein coupling or calcium transients although both of these processes are involved in chemoattraction. Interestingly, a derivative of RANTES that functions as an antagonist, aminooxypentane-RANTES, induces a stronger and more prolonged internalization of CCR-5 in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells compared with RANTES itself (33Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Additionally, IL-8 derivatives that have equal chemotactic activity can have differential ability to induce elastase release, suggesting that they trigger independent events involving the same receptor (34Clark L.I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134PubMed Google Scholar).We also demonstrate that the half-life of CCR-3 is prolonged (>3 h), since treatment of eosinophils with cycloheximide did not change the level of CCR-3 protein in the whole cell lysate. However, following 3 h of chemokine treatment, the level of cell-associated CCR-3 protein was decreased in a manner augmented by cycloheximide treatment. This indicates that chemokine treatment induces protein degradation and that new protein synthesis is involved in maintaining the level of the CCR-3 protein following chemokine treatment. Concomitantly, the surface expression of CCR-3 was further decreased with cycloheximide treatment, indicating that reexpression of the receptor on the cell surface is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. Ligand-induced modulation of chemokine receptor expression has only been examined for a limited number of chemokine receptors, and variable pathways have been reported. IL-8 induces rapid internalization of its receptor in neutrophils (29Samanta A.K. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stromal cell-derived factor-1α induces a decrease of cell surface CXCR-4 in the CEM T-cell line, HeLa cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (35Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J.

Kleinschmidt A. Nerl C. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1522-1531PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, CCR-5 ligands induce receptor internalization in lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and CCR-5-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (33Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In these cases, the receptors enter an endocytic pathway but recycle by 3 h after ligand binding. In contrast, CXCR-2 undergoes internalization and does not recycle, since it enters a degradative lysosomal pathway (37Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rapid ligand-induced internalization of CCR-1 in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (38Solari R. Offord R.E. Remy S. Aubry J.P. Wells T.N. Whitehorn E. Oung T. Proudfoot A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9617-9620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and CCR-2b in transfected HEK-293 cells (39Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar) have been described, but their intracellular processing was not studied. The diverse mechanisms of ligand-induced modulation of chemokine receptors indicate the importance of dissecting these processes for each chemokine receptor.Because most experiments were done by FACS analysis utilizing an antibody against CCR-3, it remained possible that the apparent decrease in the level of CCR-3 expression was dependent upon blockade of the CCR-3 immunoreactive epitope by the chemokine. Therefore, experiments were conducted at 4 °C in order to block internalization. These experiments showed no modulation of CCR-3 expression, indicating that ligand binding alone was not sufficient to decrease CCR-3 detection. Furthermore, confocal microscopy was performed in order to directly demonstrate ligand-induced CCR-3 internalization. These experiments were performed on an eosinophilic cell line that expressed high levels of functionally active CCR-3. This cell line was useful especially because it maintained expression of the transferrin receptor, which allowed co-localization studies to be performed. On resting cells, most CCR-3 was demonstrated to be on the cell membrane; however, following ligand treatment, the majority of the CCR-3 protein was detected in an intracellular location. Co-staining studies with the transferrin receptor revealed that intracellular CCR-3 was predominantly co-localized with the transferrin receptor, which is known to recycle via the early endosome compartment. This pathway exists in numerous cells and is commonly involved in receptor endocytosis. It is interesting that the cytoplasmic motif (YXXF) required for internalization of other receptors (e.g. transferrin receptor) is conserved in CCR-3 (40Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar).We have begun to elucidate mechanisms of CCR-3 internalization. Experiments conducted with pertussis toxin demonstrated that Gi-protein coupling is not necessary for internalization. Interestingly, high doses of pertussis toxin alone down-regulated the level of surface CCR-3 expression. The dissociation of G-protein coupling and GPCR internalization has been reported for other selected GPCRs such as CXCR-4 (35Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 36Forster R. Kremmer E. Schubel A. Breitfeld D. Kleinschmidt A. Nerl C. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1522-1531PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested the involvement of PKC in mediating ligand-induced CCR-3 internalization. Using staurosporine to inhibit PKC, we demonstrated that ligand-induced CCR-3 internalization was not dependent upon PKC. However, in these experiments, CCR-3 down-modulation was induced by activation of PKC with PMA. Similarly, although PMA and ligands induce rapid phosphorylation of CXCR-2, only PMA-induced phosphorylation is inhibited by staurosporine (37Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data indicate that at least two pathways exist for down-modulating CCR-3 expression: one mediated by PKC and another mediated by chemokines and independent of PKC. The latter pathway may be dependent upon G-protein-related kinases, such as GRK-2, which has been shown to be involved in CCR-5 internalization (41Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).The present results have several biological implications, especially since CCR-3 events have been investigated specifically in eosinophils. Conclusions concerning eosinophil chemokine receptor events have often been drawn from investigation of heterologous cell lines transfected with CCR-3. Since individual cell types often utilize distinct signaling events, it is important to examine chemokine-triggered biochemical events in eosinophils. For example, fMLP inhibits adenylate cyclase in fMLP receptor-transfected cells but not in human neutrophils (25Uhing R.J. Gettys T.W. Tomhave E. Snyderman R. Didsbury J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have therefore performed all experiments in eosinophilic cells. The finding that chemokines induce CCR-3 to undergo significant and prolonged receptor internalization has mechanistic implications for understanding eosinophil traffickingin vivo. It is widely accepted that chemokines induce cellular activation and chemoattraction. However, it is unclear if chemokines are also involved in stopping leukocyte movement. For example, eotaxin has been demonstrated to be required for the maintenance of gastrointestinal eosinophils at base line (23Matthews A.N. Friend D.S. Zimmermann N. Sarafi M.N. Luster A.D. Pearlman E. Wert S.E. Rothenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). If eotaxin also induces receptor internalization with subsequent cellular hyporesponsiveness, then eosinophils would likely home into the intestine and become localized there, since they would no longer be responsive to other chemokine gradients operating through CCR-3. In contrast, eosinophils in hematopoietic organs, tissues that do not express eotaxin, would remain responsive to the induction of subsequent chemokine gradients. Additionally, the observed inefficiency of receptor recycling following ligand binding, especially for RANTES, may have mechanistic implications concerning the difficulty in expressing CCR-3 on the surface of transfected cell lines. In one study, only 2–5% of CCR-3-transfected cells expressed CCR-3 on their surface although substantial intracellular protein could be detected in most transfected cells (15Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), suggesting a problem with CCR-3 protein trafficking. Last, the current study sheds light on possible mechanisms by which eotaxin may block cellular entry of CCR-3 trophic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains (13Choe H. Farzan M. Sun Y. Sullivan N. Rollins B. Ponath P.D. Wu L.J. Mackay C.R. Larosa G. Newman W. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Cell. 1996; 85: 1135-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Besides directly blocking human immunodeficiency virus binding to CCR-3, eotaxin may inhibit human immunodeficiency virus uptake by causing internalization of the CCR-3 co-receptor. Further studies are under way analyzing the long term biological consequences of exposing eosinophils to chemokines and a further elucidation of the biochemical events associated with CCR-3 signaling. Eosinophils are bone marrow-derived granulocytes associated with numerous diseases including allergic disorders, parasitic infections, and malignancies (1Gleich G.J. Adolphson C.R. Adv. Immunol. 1986; 39: 177-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 2Weller P.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1110-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 3Rothenberg M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Elucidating the processes that regulate eosinophil tissue accumulation is fundamental, since these cells markedly increase in tissue locations and cause potent proinflammatory effects in numerous diseases. Recent studies have focused on the orchestration of eosinophil tissue accumulation by chemokines, especially eotaxin, the most selective eosinophil chemoattractant identified to date (4Jose P.J. Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Collins P.D. Walsh D.T. Moqbel R. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Williams T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 5Luster A.D. Rothenberg M.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 620-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Chemokines are grouped into the CXC, CC, C, and CX3C subfamilies on the basis of the arrangement of the conserved cysteine residues (6Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 7Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). The CXC and CC groups, in contrast to the C and CX3C groups, contain many members and have been studied in detail. The specific effects of chemokines are mediated by a family of seven-transmembrane spanning G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CCR, CC chemokine receptor; CXCR, CXC chemokine receptor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; IL, interleukin; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; RANTES, reduced on activation T cell expressed and secreted; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CCR, CC chemokine receptor; CXCR, CXC chemokine receptor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; IL, interleukin; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; RANTES, reduced on activation T cell expressed and secreted; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate(9Murphy P.M.

Kleinschmidt A. Nerl C. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1522-1531PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, CCR-5 ligands induce receptor internalization in lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and CCR-5-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (33Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In these cases, the receptors enter an endocytic pathway but recycle by 3 h after ligand binding. In contrast, CXCR-2 undergoes internalization and does not recycle, since it enters a degradative lysosomal pathway (37Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rapid ligand-induced internalization of CCR-1 in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (38Solari R. Offord R.E. Remy S. Aubry J.P. Wells T.N. Whitehorn E. Oung T. Proudfoot A.E. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar) have been described, but their intracellular processing was not studied. The diverse mechanisms of ligand-induced modulation of chemokine receptors indicate the importance of dissecting these processes for each chemokine receptor.Because most experiments were done by FACS analysis utilizing an antibody against CCR-3, it remained possible that the apparent decrease in the level of CCR-3 expression was dependent upon blockade of the CCR-3 immunoreactive epitope by the chemokine. Therefore, experiments were conducted at 4 °C in order to block internalization. These experiments showed no modulation of CCR-3 expression, indicating that ligand binding alone was not sufficient to decrease CCR-3 detection. Furthermore, confocal microscopy was performed in order to directly demonstrate ligand-induced CCR-3 internalization. These experiments were performed on an eosinophilic cell line that expressed high levels of functionally active CCR-3. This cell line was useful especially because it maintained expression of the transferrin receptor, which allowed co-localization studies to be performed. On resting cells, most CCR-3 was demonstrated to be on the cell membrane; however, following ligand treatment, the majority of the CCR-3 protein was detected in an intracellular location. Co-staining studies with the transferrin receptor revealed that intracellular CCR-3 was predominantly co-localized with the transferrin receptor, which is known to recycle via the early endosome compartment. This pathway exists in numerous cells and is commonly involved in receptor endocytosis. It is interesting that the cytoplasmic motif (YXXF) required for internalization of other receptors (e.g. transferrin receptor) is conserved in CCR-3 (40Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar).We have begun to elucidate mechanisms of CCR-3 internalization. Experiments conducted with pertussis toxin demonstrated that Gi-protein coupling is not necessary for internalization. Interestingly, high doses of pertussis toxin alone down-regulated the level of surface CCR-3 expression. The dissociation of G-protein coupling and GPCR internalization has been reported for other selected GPCRs such as CXCR-4 (35Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 36Forster R. Kremmer E. Schubel A. Breitfeld D. Kleinschmidt A. Nerl C. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1522-1531PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested the involvement of PKC in mediating ligand-induced CCR-3 internalization. Using staurosporine to inhibit PKC, we demonstrated that ligand-induced CCR-3 internalization was not dependent upon PKC. However, in these experiments, CCR-3 down-modulation was induced by activation of PKC with PMA. Similarly, although PMA and ligands induce rapid phosphorylation of CXCR-2, only PMA-induced phosphorylation is inhibited by staurosporine (37Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data indicate that at least two pathways exist for down-modulating CCR-3 expression: one mediated by PKC and another mediated by chemokines and independent of PKC. The latter pathway may be dependent upon G-protein-related kinases, such as GRK-2, which has been shown to be involved in CCR-5 internalization (41Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).The present results have several biological implications, especially since CCR-3 events have been investigated specifically in eosinophils. Conclusions concerning eosinophil chemokine receptor events have often been drawn from investigation of heterologous cell lines transfected with CCR-3. Since individual cell types often utilize distinct signaling events, it is important to examine chemokine-triggered biochemical events in eosinophils. For example, fMLP inhibits adenylate cyclase in fMLP receptor-transfected cells but not in human neutrophils (25Uhing R.J. Gettys T.W. Tomhave E. Snyderman R. Didsbury J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have therefore performed all experiments in eosinophilic cells. The finding that chemokines induce CCR-3 to undergo significant and prolonged receptor internalization has mechanistic implications for understanding eosinophil traffickingin vivo. It is widely accepted that chemokines induce cellular activation and chemoattraction. However, it is unclear if chemokines are also involved in stopping leukocyte movement. For example, eotaxin has been demonstrated to be required for the maintenance of gastrointestinal eosinophils at base line (23Matthews A.N. Friend D.S. Zimmermann N. Sarafi M.N. Luster A.D. Pearlman E. Wert S.E. Rothenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). If eotaxin also induces receptor internalization with subsequent cellular hyporesponsiveness, then eosinophils would likely home into the intestine and become localized there, since they would no longer be responsive to other chemokine gradients operating through CCR-3. In contrast, eosinophils in hematopoietic organs, tissues that do not express eotaxin, would remain responsive to the induction of subsequent chemokine gradients. Additionally, the observed inefficiency of receptor recycling following ligand binding, especially for RANTES, may have mechanistic implications concerning the difficulty in expressing CCR-3 on the surface of transfected cell lines. In one study, only 2–5% of CCR-3-transfected cells expressed CCR-3 on their surface although substantial intracellular protein could be detected in most transfected cells (15Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), suggesting a problem with CCR-3 protein trafficking. Last, the current study sheds light on possible mechanisms by which eotaxin may block cellular entry of CCR-3 trophic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains (13Choe H. Farzan M. Sun Y. Sullivan N. Rollins B. Ponath P.D. Wu L.J. Mackay C.R. Larosa G. Newman W. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Cell. 1996; 85: 1135-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Besides directly blocking human immunodeficiency virus binding to CCR-3, eotaxin may inhibit human immunodeficiency virus uptake by causing internalization of the CCR-3 co-receptor. Further studies are under way analyzing the long term biological consequences of exposing eosinophils to chemokines and a further elucidation of the biochemical events associated with CCR-3 signaling. We report that CCR-3 is rapidly removed from the cell surface into an intracellular endocytic compartment following ligand binding. The two CCR-3 ligands studied, eotaxin and RANTES, induced a different magnitude and duration of receptor internalization. In all cases, RANTES was more potent and induced a longer duration of internalization than eotaxin although it was not a stronger chemoattractant in previous studies (15Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and in eosinophil transmigration assays (data not shown). This suggests that internalization of CCR-3 involves molecular events that are dissociated, at least in part, from the signals involved in triggering chemotaxis. Consistent with this, chemokine-induced internalization was not dependent upon G-protein coupling or calcium transients although both of these processes are involved in chemoattraction. Interestingly, a derivative of RANTES that functions as an antagonist, aminooxypentane-RANTES, induces a stronger and more prolonged internalization of CCR-5 in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells compared with RANTES itself (33Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Additionally, IL-8 derivatives that have equal chemotactic activity can have differential ability to induce elastase release, suggesting that they trigger independent events involving the same receptor (34Clark L.I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that the half-life of CCR-3 is prolonged (>3 h), since treatment of eosinophils with cycloheximide did not change the level of CCR-3 protein in the whole cell lysate. However, following 3 h of chemokine treatment, the level of cell-associated CCR-3 protein was decreased in a manner augmented by cycloheximide treatment. This indicates that chemokine treatment induces protein degradation and that new protein synthesis is involved in maintaining the level of the CCR-3 protein following chemokine treatment. Concomitantly, the surface expression of CCR-3 was further decreased with cycloheximide treatment, indicating that reexpression of the receptor on the cell surface is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. Ligand-induced modulation of chemokine receptor expression has only been examined for a limited number of chemokine receptors, and variable pathways have been reported. IL-8 induces rapid internalization of its receptor in neutrophils (29Samanta A.K. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in response to exposure of cells to microtubule toxins, including taxol. MEKK1 expression is elevated 3-fold in mitosis and microtubule toxin-treated cells accumulated at G2/M of the cell cycle. Targeted disruption of MEKK1 expression in embryonic stem cells resulted in the loss of JNK activation and increased apoptosis in response to taxol. Targeted disruption of the MEK kinase 2 gene had no effect on activation of the JNK pathway in response to microtubule toxins demonstrating a specific role of MEKK1 in this response. Cytochalasin D-mediated disruption of actin fibers activates JNK and stimulates apoptosis similarly in MEKK1−/− and wild type cells. The results show that MEKK1 is required for JNK activation in response to microtubule but not actin fiber toxins in embryonic stem cells. MEKK1 activation can protect cells from apoptosis in response to change in the integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton.

MEKK1 activation can protect cells from apoptosis in response to change in the integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Restructuring of the microtubule cytoskeleton occurs in response to a variety of events such as immune cell infiltration and invasion, interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix, and during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Cell shape change and the underlying restructuring of the cytoskeleton regulates gene expression and contributes to the commitment of cells to grow, undergo apoptosis, or differentiate. The importance of the cytoarchitecture and its regulation was realized when it was described that a reduction in cell spreading resulting in a spherical versus flat cell shape had an inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis (1Folkman J. Hochberg M. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 138: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 2Maroudas N.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 1: 104-110Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that cytoarchitecture determines whether a cell will grow or undergo apoptosis, as decreased cell spreading, which results in cell rounding using micropatterned substrates of various dimensions, induced an apoptotic response whereas cell spreading allowed survival and proliferation (3Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). The underlying restructuring of the cytoskeleton during these responses has been shown to influence gene expression. For example, microtubule disruption induces expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator and interleukin 1-β but inhibits tubulin synthesis (4Cleveland D.W. Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 331-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ferrua B. Manie S. Doglio A. Shaw A. Sonthonnax S. Limouse M. Schaffer L. Cell.

The promoter region for the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor was shown to contain a cis-acting response element that was regulated by shear stress induced by changes in cytoarchitecture (7Resnick N.

The collagenase-1 gene, which encodes a matrix metalloproteinase important for cell migration and invasion, is also regulated in response to cytochalasin D disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (8Kheradmand F.

Consistent with the activation of signal pathways, specific transcription factors are activated by cytoskeletal restructuring (8Kheradmand F. Werner E. Tremble P. Agmons M. Werb Z.

In this report, we show that targeted disruption of MEKK1 expression selectively inhibits JNK activation in response to microtubule toxins. Functionally, MEKK1 is the transducer for the specific regulation of the JNK pathway and promotes cell survival during changes in microtubule integrity. Cells were maintained in a humidified 7.0% CO2 environment in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium for T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium for MEKK1−/− and MEKK1+/+ mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells was supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, CO), 144 μmmonothioglyerol (Sigma), and 1% leukemia inhibitory factor Chinese hamster ovary cell-conditioned medium. MEKK1 and JNK activies were measured as described previously (14Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), except 1 μg of recombinant purified kinase-inactive glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase kinase (GST-JNKKk-r) was used as a substrate to assay MEKK1 activity. To determine ERK and p38 activity, cell lysates were Western blotted with either an anti-phospho-ERK or anti-phospho-p38 antibody (New England Biolabs, MA) as a measure of kinase activity. Apoptosis was measured using acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. Apoptotic cell death was verified using DNA ladder formation assays. Cells were plated onto uncoated glass coverslips 2 days before being fixed in a solution containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 3% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with an anti-tubulin antibody, followed by an incubation with 1.5 mg/ml Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Coverslips were mounted and analyzed as described previously (14Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to conditions and drugs that alter the cytoarchitecture strongly activate the JNK pathway. Fig.1, A and B, shows that with T47D human breast carcinoma cells and ES cells, respectively, microtubule toxins (taxol and nocodazole), actin fiber disruption (cytochalasin D), and hyperosmolarity (sorbitol) strongly activate the JNK pathway. In these studies modest concentrations of these stimuli were used for short times where the cells were not adversely affected, demonstrating that activation of the JNK pathway is an early major response to these stimuli. Analysis of the ERK and p38 pathways indicates that the different treatments differentially activate MAPK pathways, even though each stimulus significantly activates JNK. As predicted, hyperosmolarity achieved with sorbitol addition to the growth medium activated p38 in both cell types. Cytochalasin D and nocodazole activated p38 similarly in T47D cells but not in ES cells. ERK activation is weak in ES cells in response to most stimuli 2T. Yujiri and G. L. Johnson, unpublished observations.and not measurably activated in response to the compounds used to alter cell shape. In contrast, for T47D cells, cytochalasin D and nocodazole modestly activated ERK, whereas taxol was a very weak activator of the ERK pathway. Sorbitol-induced hyperosmolarity stimulated significant ERK activation. Interestingly, taxol did not significantly activate p38 in either cell type; JNK activation is the primary response to taxol treatment. This finding indicates microtubule poisoning by taxol is sensed differently by the cell than nocodazole-induced depolymerization of microtubules. MEKKs regulate the JNK pathway (15Blank J.L.

Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), suggesting that a specific MEKK could mediate the JNK activation in response to microtubule reorganization of the cytoarchitecture. We found that MEKK1 is activated by stimuli that alter microtubule dynamics. Nocodazole disrupts microtubules in T47D cells (Fig.2 A) and activates MEKK1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2,B and C). Taxol treatment of T47D cells, which stabilizes microtubule structures (Fig. 2 A), activates MEKK1 (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the microtubule toxins, nocodazole and taxol, activate MEKK1. During the cell cycle the greatest change in microtubule structure occurs in mitosis. Analysis of T47D breast carcinoma cells proliferating in normal growth conditions demonstrated that the expression of MEKK1 is increased in the M phase of the cell cycle. Fig. 3 A shows T47D cells, co-stained using an antibody recognizing MEKK1 and the DNA stain, DAPI. Immunofluorescence microscopy readily demonstrated that mitotic cells have significantly higher levels of MEKK1 expression than non-mitotic cells. To quantitate differences in anti-MEKK1 immunofluorescence in mitotic versus non-mitotic cells, deconvolved confocal three-dimensional images were constructed. Images of mitotic and non-mitotic cells were quantitated for anti-MEKK1 immunofluorescence. Fig. 3 B shows that mitotic T47D cells express approximately 3-fold higher MEKK1 protein levels than non-mitotic cells. Similar results have been observed in other cell types (not shown). To biochemically confirm the immunofluorescence analysis, T47D cells were treated with microtubule toxins to arrest cells at G2/M in the cell cycle. The G2/M block of treated cells was confirmed by cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry (not shown). Immunoblotting with the anti-MEKK1 antibody used for immunofluorescence demonstrated that MEKK1 protein levels were increased in drug-treated cells accumulated at G2/M, compared with untreated cell populations having cells randomly in all phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 3 C, upper left panel). As a control, treatment of cells with etoposide, which induces DNA damage in S phase and blocks cells in G1/S of the cell cycle, did not increase MEKK1 expression (Fig. 3 C,upper right panel). In fact, etoposide, which acutely activates MEKK1, induces a loss of MEKK1 expression in T47D cells after several hours of drug exposure, resulting from the induction of caspase 3 cleavage of the 196-kDa MEKK1 protein (18Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We have found that taxol and nocodazole treatment of cells does not induce the cleavage of MEKK1 like that observed for DNA-damaging drugs. Thus, the regulation of MEKK1 protein levels and caspase cleavage in response to microtubule toxins and DNA-damaging drugs is different. Consistent with the increased levels of MEKK1 in T47D cells blocked at G2/M, the total MEKK1 activity is also increased by the microtubule toxin-induced block at G2/M (Fig. 3 C,lower panel). In contrast, hydroxyurea and etoposide, which act in S phase of the cell cycle do not cause an increase in MEKK1 activity following prolonged cellular exposure to these drugs. Cumulatively, the findings demonstrate increased MEKK1 expression at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and that microtubule toxins activate MEKK1. Thus, MEKK1 regulation is responsive to changes in microtubule organization in the cell. We have targeted the disruption of MEKK1 expression by homologous recombination (20Yujiri T. Sather A. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). MEKK1−/− ES cells do not express the MEKK1 protein. Treatment of wild type ES cells with either taxol or nocodazole activates MEKK1 measured by immunoprecipitation and in vitrokinase assay (Fig. 4, A andB). Importantly, no kinase activity is observed in immunoprecipitates from lysates of MEKK1−/− ES cells treated with nocodazole (Fig. 4 B). This finding unequivocally demonstrates that our antibodies selectively immunoprecipitate MEKK1 and that MEKK1 is responsible for the JNKK phosphorylation in the in vitro kinase assay. As predicted from this result, JNK activation in response to the microtubule toxins nocodazole and taxol is lost in two independent MEKK1−/−clones (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D activates the JNK pathway in MEKK1−/− and MEKK1+/+ ES cells (Fig. 5 A). Thus, MEKK1 is absolutely required for JNK activation in response to microtubule but not actin fiber disruption. Re-expression of the 196-kDa MEKK1 protein by stable transfection of MEKK1−/− with a plasmid encoding the full-length MEKK1 cDNA reconstituted the regulation of the JNK pathway by taxol (Fig. 5 B). The reconstitution of JNK activation in response to taxol demonstrates that this response is specifically mediated by MEKK1.Figure 5MEKK1 but not MEKK2 is required for JNK activation in response to exposure of ES cells to microtubule poisons. A, wild type ES cells (MEKK1+/+) and two ES cell clones having targeted disruption of MEKK1 expression (MEKK1−/− #4 and #15) were exposed to 4 μg/ml cytochalasin D (Cyto D), 5 μm taxol, 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole (Nocod) or growth medium only (Control) for 2 h. Cells were lysed and JNK activity was measured using GST-c-Jun as substrate. B, the cDNA encoding the full-length 196-kDa MEKK1 in pCEP4 was stably transfected into MEKK1−/− cells. Hygromycin-resistant, MEKK1-expressing clones were characterized by immunoblotting. Two re-expression clones (AB1 and AB2) and MEKK1−/− and MEKK1+/+ ES cells were challenged with 5 μm taxol for 1 h, lysed, and assayed for JNK activity.

D, cytochalasin D (2 μg/ml) and nocodazole (0.5 μg/ml) were incubated with wild type (+/+) and MEKK2−/− (−/−) ES cells for 2 h. Cells were lysed and assayed for JNK activity using GST-c-Jun as substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have also disrupted the expression of MEKK2 by homologous recombination in ES cells (Fig. 5 C). 3T. P. Garrington, T. Yujiri, S. Gibson, and G. L. Johnson, manuscript in preparation.Both microtubule and actin fiber disruption by nocodazole and cytochalasin D, respectively, activated the JNK pathway similarly in MEKK2+/+ and MEKK2−/− ES cells (Fig. 5 D). Thus, MEKK2 is not involved in the regulation of the JNK pathway in response to changes in the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton; the microtubule response involves MEKK1. This finding demonstrates the selectivity of different MEKKs for regulation by specific stimuli. We have shown that MEKK1−/− ES cells do not activate JNK following treatment with nocodazole or taxol. Prolonged shape change and microtubule disruption induce apoptosis in many cell types (3Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 20Yujiri T. Sather A. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Fig.6 A shows that MEKK1−/− ES cells have a significantly greater apoptotic index in response to taxol, relative to MEKK1+/+ ES cells. Fig. 6 B shows that temporally MEKK1−/− cells become apoptotic more rapidly than MEKK1+/+ cells. At a significantly slower rate, MEKK1+/+ cells will reach the same apoptotic index as taxol-treated MEKK1−/− cells. Thus, MEKK1 activation has a protective function in response to microtubule poisoning. To prove this fact, the two MEKK1−/− ES cell lines having MEKK1 expression re-established by stable transfection of a MEKK1 expression plasmid were tested for their sensitivity to taxol-induced apoptosis (Fig.6 A). Just as in the reconstitution of JNK activation, the re-expression of MEKK1 expression rescued the survival of cells exposed to taxol similar to wild type ES cells. Cytochalasin D disrupts the actin cytoskeleton but has little effect on microtubule integrity. Cytochalasin D treatment of T47D cells strongly stimulates MEKK1 and JNK activities (Fig.7 A). Similarly, cytochalasin D treatment of wild type ES cells activates MEKK1 (Fig. 7 B) and strongly activates JNK in both MEKK1+/+ and MEKK1−/− ES cells (Fig. 5 A). The activation of JNK, independent of MEKK1 in ES cells, allowed the question of whether MEKK1 or JNK mediates the cell survival response to actin cytoskeleton poisoning. Fig. 7, C and D, shows that the sensitivity of ES cells to undergo cytochalasin D-induced apoptosis is virtually identical in a MEKK1−/− or MEKK1+/+background. The increased apoptotic response of MEKK1−/−cells is specific to microtubule toxins and not actin cytoskeleton toxins. Thus, the enhanced sensitivity of MEKK1−/− cells to undergo apoptosis in response to microtubule toxins may involve the loss of JNK activation regulated by MEKK1. Changes in cytoskeletal dynamics stimulate signal transduction pathways. Several studies indicate that the microtubules play an integral part in regulating signaling pathways. We have shown that JNK is the dominant MAPK activated by microtubule toxins, including taxol and nocodazole. MEKK1 is absolutely required for JNK activation when cells are exposed to nocodazole and taxol. MEKK1 is similarly required for JNK activation in response to mild hyperosmolarity and cold stress, both of which alter the integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton and cell shape. Targeted disruption of MEKK1 expression unequivocally defined its role by being the MAPK kinase kinase regulating the JNK pathway in response to changes in microtubule integrity. How might microtubule restructuring activate MEKK1? One hypothesis would involve the GTP-binding protein Rac1 (21Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 260-261Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Rac1 has been shown to bind β-tubulin in a GTP-dependent manner (22Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The binding of Rac1·GTP did not influence tubulin polymerization, and it was proposed that tubulin-Rac1·GTP complexes would control Rac1 signaling. MEKK1 binds Rac1 in a GTP-dependent manner (14Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Rac1 activates the JNK pathway as does MEKK1 (23Coso O.A. Chieariello M. Yu J. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 24Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), and inhibitory MEKK1 mutants block Rac1 activation of JNK (14Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). If Rac1 functions as a sensor for cytoskeletal changes it could stimulate MEKK1, resulting in JNK activation and protection of cells from apoptosis. The increased expression of MEKK1 during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle is consistent with its involvement in sensing the dramatic microtubule changes that occur during mitosis. The protective properties of MEKK1 would prevent cells from defaulting into apoptosis during progression through the G2/M phase. The increased apoptotic response of MEKK1−/− ES cells to microtubule toxins is consistent with this hypothesis. Confirmation of this hypothesis will require the use of an inducible dominant-negative Rac1 construct to determine the role of Rac1 in microtubule disruption-stimulated JNK activity. In the future, cell lines expressing an inducible dominant-negative Rac1 will be generated to test this hypothesis. The targeted gene disruption of MEKK1 expression unequivocally defined the function of MEKK1 in responding to changes in microtubule dynamics in mouse ES cells, namely the protection of ES cells from committing to apoptosis. The role of MEKK1 is specific in that loss of its expression causes complete loss of JNK activation in response to microtubule disruption. Targeted disruption of MEKK2 expression had no effect on the JNK response to microtubule disruption in ES cells. Thus, each MEKK will be predictably found to respond to very specific upstream stimuli. Support for this prediction is observed with the loss of specific receptor activation of the JNK pathway in MEKK2 knockouts that is not observed with MEKK1 knockouts. 3T. P. Garrington, T. Yujiri, S. Gibson, and G. L. Johnson, manuscript in preparation. The role of MEKK1 in cell survival is contrary to its pro-apoptotic functions when cleaved by caspases (18Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 25Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). MEKK1 is a substrate for caspase 3 and is cleaved at Asp874. The cleavage of MEKK1 at Asp874 releases a 91-kDa activated kinase domain that amplifies the activation of caspases. The activated full-length 196-kDa MEKK1 does not activate caspases or apoptosis (18Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a dual role of MEKK1 that is controlled by caspases. Activation of MEKK1 promotes cell survival; targeted disruption of MEKK1 expression unequivocally defines this function of MEKK1. Caspase cleavage of MEKK1 causes loss of the survival response and conversion to a pro-apoptotic response of the newly generated 91-kDa MEKK1 COOH-terminal kinase domain. If the survival response mediated by MEKK1 could be abrogated, then microtubule toxins like taxol would have greater efficacy as chemotherapeutic drugs. From a practical standpoint, defining proteins and genes specifically regulated by the MEKK1-activated JNK pathway might define new drug targets for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.

Nedd4 consists of a ubiquitin-protein ligase domain, multiple WW domains, and a Ca2+ and lipid binding domain (20Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. McGlade J. Rotin D.

The Ca2+ and lipid binding domain has been shown to mediate Ca2+-dependent redistribution of Nedd4 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane (27Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), although the importance of this is unclear given that intracellular Ca2+ has no role in the control of Na+ channels by intracellular Na+(17Kellenberger S.

A. 1996; 93: 8107-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both mouse and rat Nedd4 proteins contain three WW domains, whereas human Nedd4 has an additional WW domain (20Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 22Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that WW domains 1, 2, and 3 from rat Nedd4 can bind to the PY motifs of the β and γ ENaC subunits in vitro (20Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). It is not known however whether all, or only a subset, of these three WW domains are required for Nedd4 to regulate Na+ channel activity. In this study, we have used a combination of in vitro binding assays and whole cell patch clamp analysis to investigate the role of the WW domains of Nedd4 in mediating the feedback inhibition of Na+ channels by raised intracellular Na+. The expression construct used to generate protein containing all three WW domains of mouse Nedd4 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) has been described previously (25Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Single WW domain-GST constructs were generated by amplifying each WW domain individually by PCR using appropriate primers 2Primer sequences are available upon request. followed by cloning into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). WW domain mutations were produced according to a published protocol (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar), PCR amplified, and cloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK. The regions encoding the carboxyl termini of human and mouse α, β, and γ ENaC subunits were PCR amplified2 and cloned into eitherBamHI or BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK. The regions encoding the carboxyl termini of the murine α, β, and γ subunits of ENaC were cloned from mouse mandibular duct cells, obtained as described previously (30Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), by reverse transcriptase PCR. mRNA was reverse transcribed and then PCR amplified using a set of nested primers.2 Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T-easy (Promega) and verified by sequencing. Overnight cultures ofEscherichia coli DH5α harboring the appropriate GST expression plasmid were diluted 1/50, grown for 2 h at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and grown for an additional 5 h at 37 °C. Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by sonication, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated with the cleared lysate for 60 min at room temperature, and then the beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Fusion protein was eluted with glutathione buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit (Pierce). 32P-labeled protein probes were produced by directly labeling the appropriate GST fusion protein using protein kinase A (New England Biolabs). Glutathione beads containing bound fusion protein were incubated with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 12 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline, and labeled protein was eluted with glutathione buffer. To prepare WW domain protein filters, approximately 2 μg of each GST fusion protein was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). Membranes were blocked in Hyb75 (31Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K.

Membranes were washed three times in Hyb75 and exposed to x-ray film. Isolated granular duct cells were prepared by collagenase digestion of mouse mandibular glands from male mice as previously described (30Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The standard bath solution (pH 7.4) contained 145 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 7.5 mmHEPES, and 10 mm glucose. The standard (0 Na+) pipette solution (pH 7.2) contained 150 mm NMDG-glutamate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm glucose. In the 70 mm Na+ pipette solution, Na+ was adjusted by substitution of Na+-glutamate for NMDG-glutamate. Standard whole-cell patch clamp techniques were used (25Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P.

(Lond.). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After establishing the whole-cell configuration, the bath solution was replaced with one containing 145 mmNa+-glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The amiloride-sensitive current was measured as described previously (25Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's unpaired t test. All experiments were performed at 20–22 °C. To investigate the specificity of the interaction between the WW domains of Nedd4 and the subunits of ENaC, a dual approach involving far-Western blotting and patch clamp analysis was used. To do this, a variety of WW domain proteins fused to GST were produced (Fig.1). Murine Nedd4 protein contains three WW domains located between the amino-terminal Ca2+ and lipid binding domain and carboxyl-terminal ubiquitin-protein ligase domain (22Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing all three WW domains of murine Nedd4 with one domain mutated or all three domains in their wild-type configuration were produced as well as wild-type and mutant versions of each individual WW domain (Fig. 1). WW domain mutations were generated by converting the second conserved Trp to Phe and the conserved Pro to Ala. These mutations were designed to abolish WW domain binding activity without significantly altering the tertiary structure. The human Nedd4 protein contains four WW domains of which domains 1, 2, and 4 correspond to domains 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of the mouse protein (22Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These three domains are highly conserved between mouse and human Nedd4 (22Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and are thus expected to have similar ligand binding specificity. However, WW domain 3 in human Nedd4 is not found in the mouse protein. We therefore generated a GST fusion protein containing WW domain 3 of the human protein for our binding and patch clamp assays. The PY motifs of α, β, and γ subunits of ENaC have been shown to be required for interaction with Nedd4 WW domains (20Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), and therefore the intracellular carboxyl terminus of each ENaC subunit containing the PY motif was cloned into the pGEX-2TK vector and used for production of 32P-labeled protein probes (Fig.2). Various GST-WW domain fusion proteins were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting following electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and probed with32P-labeled GST-ENaC subunits. As shown in Fig.2 B, the α subunit of ENaC does not bind to the control, GST (lane 1), but binds with equal strength to the wild type (wt) protein (lane 2) and the WW domain 1 mutant,m1 (lane 3), suggesting that it does not bind to WW domain 1. The α subunit of ENaC shows reduced binding ability to mutant WW domain 2 (m2) and even less affinity for mutant WW domain 3 (m3) which suggests that both WW domains 2 and 3 can bind to the α subunit, although the α subunit has a preference for WW domain 3. The β ENaC subunit has very similar binding characteristics to the α subunit and binds with similar strength to wt and m1 but with reduced affinity to m2 and m3 (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that the β subunit can bind to WW domains 2 and 3 but not to WW domain 1 and may also have a slight preference for WW domain 3. The γ ENaC subunit bound efficiently to both wt and m1, once again suggesting that it does not interact with WW domain 1. The γ ENaC subunit bound weakly to m2 and m3, indicating that it has affinity for both WW domains 2 and 3. To explore the binding specificity of ENaCs further, individual WW domains were fused to GST and used for far-Western analysis. As depicted in Fig. 3 B, the α ENaC subunit bound to WW domains 2 and 3 with similar affinity, but not to WW domain 1, confirming the result in Fig. 2 B. The α subunit also bound to human WW domain 3, which is not found in mouse Nedd4. As was the case in Fig. 2, the β subunit showed similar binding characteristics to the α subunit by binding to murine WW domains 2 and 3 and human WW domain 3, but not to WW domain 1 (Fig.3 C). The γ ENaC subunit displayed a higher affinity for murine WW domain 2 and human WW domain 3 and reduced affinity for murine WW domain 3, but like the α and β ENaC subunits, showed no affinity for WW domain 1 (Fig. 3 D). The WW domain 1 protein (Fig. 1, s1) used for binding studies contained an extra 5 kDa at the carboxyl terminus of the WW domain, whereas s2 and s3 proteins contained only the minimal WW domain sequence fused to GST (Fig. 1). To examine whether the extra sequence in s1 altered the binding characteristics of WW domain 1, a shorter construct containing only WW domain 1 was used in far-Western experiments. As was the case with s1, this shorter protein did not bind to any of the ENaC subunits (data not shown). The analysis presented in Figs. 2 and 3 was open to objection that interactions between human ENaC carboxyl termini and murine Nedd4 may differ from those we would observe if we were to use murine ENaC carboxyl termini. We therefore, using reverse transcriptase PCR, cloned the coding regions of the carboxyl termini of α, β, and γ subunits of murine ENaC from granular duct cells of mouse mandibular glands. When used in far-Western analyses, GST fusion proteins generated from all three subunits of murine ENaC carboxyl termini gave results similar to those shown in Figs. 2 and 3 (data not shown). This is not surprising given the close homologies evident in and around the PY motifs of human and mouse ENaC subunits (Fig.4). The PY motifs in the α and β subunits (PPAY and PPNY, respectively) of mouse and human ENaC are identical, whereas in the γ subunit, the sequence differs by a single conservative change (PPRY in mouse compared with PPKY in human) (Fig.4). As none of the mouse or human ENaC subunits showed binding affinity for WW domain 1 that was immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane, we used32P-labeled WW domain 1 to probe immobilized ENaC-GST fusion proteins. A positive control probe, wt, bound to all mouse and human ENaC subunits, whereas, WW domain 1 did not exhibit any significant binding to any of the subunits (data not shown), further confirming the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3. As mentioned in the introduction, Nedd4 mediates the feedback inhibition of Na+channel activity produced by an increase in intracellular Na+. We have previously shown using the whole cell patch clamp technique that Na+ channel activity of single mouse mandibular granular duct cells can be inhibited by increasing the pipette solution Na+ to 70 mm (25Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Komwatana P. Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I.

Biol. 1998; 162: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a value within the physiological range for cytosolic Na+concentration in exocrine tissues (33Xu X. Zhao H. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19606-19612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Poronnik P. Schumann S.Y. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 429: 852-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This feedback inhibition by raised intracellular Na+ can be inhibited by inclusion in the pipette solution of: (i) an antibody directed against the WW domains of Nedd4, 3A. Dinudom and D. I. Cook, unpublished data. (ii) an antibody directed against the ubiquitin-protein ligase domain of Nedd4 (25Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or (iii) a GST-Nedd4 WW domain fusion protein that presumably acts as a dominant negative mutant by displacing endogenous Nedd4 from ENaC subunits (25Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We thus decided to use the ability of this GST-WW domain fusion protein (wt in Fig. 1) to block Na+ feedback inhibition of Na+ channels as the basis for an investigation of the roles of the individual WW domains of Nedd4 in regulating ENaC activity. We first investigated the concentration-dependence of the ability of the wt protein to block Na+ feedback inhibition of Na+ channels in mouse granular duct cells. We found that the inclusion in the pipette solution of 100 μg/ml GST-wt, but not 50 μg/ml GST-wt, was sufficient to overcome feedback inhibition of Na+ channels (Fig. 5). In subsequent studies we thus used a concentration of 100 μg/ml as the reference concentration of the GST-wt construct. To test whether all three WW domains of Nedd4 are required to inhibit the Na+-dependent feedback pathway, GST fusion proteins containing two intact WW domains and one mutant WW domain (m1, m2, and m3 in Fig. 1) were examined. We found that none of these proteins were able to overcome the inhibition of Na+channel activity produced by inclusion of 70 mmNa+ in the pipette solution (Fig.6 A). These results suggested that each of the three WW domains in murine Nedd4 binds to a distinct, noninterchangeable site and that to prevent Na+ feedback control of Na+ channels it is necessary to occlude all three sites. We further tested this interpretation by examining whether the inclusion in the pipette solution of a mixture of individual WW domains of murine Nedd4 (s1, s2, and s3 in Fig. 1, each at 100 μg/ml) could block Na+ feedback. Indeed, as shown in Fig.6 B, the effect of adding the three individual WW-GST proteins to the pipette solution was similar to the wt WW-GST fusion protein containing the three WW domains. Furthermore, omission of any of these isolated domains from the mixture led to the loss of this blocking effect despite the adjustment of the concentration of each of the two remaining WW domain proteins to 150 μg/ml to maintain the total concentration of GST-WW domain fusion proteins in the pipette solution at 300 μg/ml (Fig. 6 B). Finally, we examined whether the WW domain unique to human Nedd4 (h3 in Fig. 1) could replace any of the 3 murine WW domains. We found that it was unable to do so (Fig. 6 C). Inclusion of the h3 domain (100 μg/ml) in the 0 Na+ pipette solution did not suppress the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (data not shown). Thus we concluded that the additional WW domain in human Nedd4 does not substitute for any of the three WW domains that are present in both murine and human Nedd4. This study has shown that to block Na+-dependent feedback inhibition of epithelial Na+ channels, distinct binding sites for all three WW domains of murine Nedd4 must be occluded. It also suggests that,in vivo, each of these WW domains binds one of these sites and is unable to bind to the other two. In vitro, the WW domains of Nedd4 were found to have varying specificity for the PY motifs of different ENaC subunits. Murine WW domains 2 and 3, and human WW domain 3 showed varying affinity for all three ENaC subunits, whereas WW domain 1 failed to bind to either of the three ENaC subunits. This suggests that WW domain 1 either prefers a different PY motif to WW domains 2 and 3 or different residues surrounding the PY motif. There is a precedence for WW domains preferring proline-rich motifs other than PPxY; the WW domains of some formin binding proteins (FBPs) prefer a PPLP motif (35Chan D. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 36Bedford M.T. Chan D. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 16: 2376-2383Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar), whereas other FBPs prefer a proline-, methionine-, and glycine-rich motif (37Lehman A.L. Nakatsu Y. Ching A. Bronson R.T. Oakey R.J. Keiper-Hrynko N. Finger J.N. Durham-Pierre D. Horton D.B. Newton J.M. Lyon M.F. Brilliant M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9436-9441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Nedd4 WW domain 1 is much more homologous to Nedd4 WW domains 2 and 3 than to the WW domains of FBPs, so it is reasonable to expect that WW domain 1 will bind to a PPxY motif containing protein. Staub et al. (20Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) reported that WW domain 1 of rat Nedd4, like WW domains 2 and 3, bound to the PY motif of both the β and γ ENaC subunits. Because mouse and rat Nedd4 WW domain 1 sequences are highly homologous (95% identical), the possibility of different ligand specificities is highly unlikely. Our data show that, similar to mouse, the human Nedd4 WW domain 1 does not interact with either of the three ENaC subunits. We are therefore unsure about the reason for discrepancy between our results and those reported by Staub et al. (20Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that two other proteins p45/NF-E2 and RNA polymerase II, which interact with Nedd4 through their PY motifs, also do not bind WW domain 1 (38Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M. Shen C.-K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24105-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting that WW domain 1 of Nedd4 may have very restricted ligand-binding specificity. In light of our binding assays, it may have been reasonable to expect that WW domains 2 and 3 alone would be capable of exerting a dominant negative effect on the Na+ feedback pathway as measured by patch clamp analysis. This was not the case, however, as an intact WW domain 1 was required, in concert with WW domains 2 and 3, to restore Na+ channel activity under high Na+ conditions. We therefore suggest that WW domain 1 must play a role in ENaC regulation that is not dependent on direct binding of an ENaC subunit PY motif. We postulate that WW domain 1 binds to an additional, as yet unidentified, molecule that is activated under high salt conditions, possibly downstream of G0. This molecule may recruit Nedd4 to the ENaC complex and/or stabilize the ENaC/Nedd4 complex. We postulate that a stable Nedd4/ENaC complex will comprise one ENaC tetramer, two molecules of Nedd4, and two molecules of the unknown recruitment/stabilization factor (Fig.7). The possibility also exists that a single molecule of Nedd4 binds to a single ENaC tetramer, leaving two ENaC PY motifs free. Further experiments are required to explore these possibilities. In vitro, human WW domain 3 showed affinity for all three subunits of ENaC, comparable with the binding characteristics shown by murine WW domains 2 and 3 (Fig. 3), but it was unable to complement either of these WW domains or WW domain 1 in vivo. This suggests that, although human WW domain 3 recognizes the PY motifs of ENaC subunits in vitro, it does not play a role in the Na+-dependent feedback inhibition of Na+ channels. The finding that all three WW domains of murine Nedd4 must be occluded to inhibit the Na+ feedback loop suggests that more than one WW domain/PY motif contact needs to occur for stable complex formation between Nedd4 and ENaC. This is supported by the molecular understanding of the hypertensive disorder Liddle's syndrome, where mutation in a single ENaC subunit (β or γ) is sufficient to cause a disease phenotype (7Hansson J.H.

This would seem insufficient to form a stable complex with Nedd4, however, as hypertension results, presumably as a consequence of lack of negative regulation of ENaC by Nedd4.

The IGF-IR is also capable of inducing differentiation in a number of cell types, raising the question of how the same receptor can send two seemingly contradictory signals, one for growth and one for differentiation. Using 32D cells, which are murine hemopoietic cells, we show that the activated IGF-IR can induce differentiation along the granulocytic pathway in a manner similar to the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. We find that one of the major substrates of the IGF-IR, the insulin receptor substrate-1 inhibits IGF-I-mediated differentiation of 32D cells. In the absence of insulin receptor substrate-1, functional impairment of another major substrate of the IGF-IR, the Shc proteins, is associated with a decrease in the extent of differentiation. Although the end points of the respective pathways remain to be defined, these results show for the first time that IGF-I-mediated growth or differentiation of hemopoietic cells may depend on a balance between two of its substrates.

The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR), 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-IR, type I insulin-like growth factor receptor; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IL-3, interleukin-3; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; PCR, polymerase chain reactionactivated by its ligands plays an important role in the growth of cells in at least three different ways: it is mitogenic, both in vivo andin vitro, it is quasiobligatory for transformation, and it can protect cells from a variety of apoptotic injuries (1Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The IGF-IR can also induce differentiation in certain types of cells, notably myoblasts (2Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Falen S.L. van Wyk J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C771-C778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schmid C. Steiner T. Froesch E.R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 161: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), adipocytes (4Smith P.J.

These apparently contradictory actions of the IGF-IR, and indeed of other growth factor receptors (growth promotion on one side and induction of differentiation on the other) are usually dismissed as due to the “cell context,” a somewhat unsatisfactory answer. It is self-evident that, at some point, the mitogenic and differentiation signals originating from the IGF-IR will diverge. The question we have asked in this investigation is whether these signals can already be separated at the level of the receptor itself or its immediate substrates. We have used as a model 32D cells (9Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), which are well characterized diploid murine hemopoietic cells. 32D cells have an absolute requirement for interleukin-3 (IL-3), and undergo apoptosis when IL-3 is withdrawn (10Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar, 11Metcalf D. Blood. 1985; 65: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I or overexpression of the IGF-IR prevent or markedly decrease apoptosis caused by IL-3 withdrawal (12Dews M. Nishimoto I. Baserga R. Recept. Signal Transduc. 1998; 7: 231-239Google Scholar, 13McCubrey J.A. Stillman L.S. Mayhew M.W. Algate P.A. Dellow R.A. Kaleko M. Blood. 1991; 78: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Prisco M.

Indeed, an overexpressed IGF-IR causes 32D cells to grow in the absence of IL-3 at least for several days (14Prisco M. Hongo A. Rizzo M.G. Sacchi A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhou-Li F. Xu S.Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another interesting characteristic of 32D cells is that they are completely devoid of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 (12Dews M. Nishimoto I. Baserga R. Recept. Signal Transduc. 1998; 7: 231-239Google Scholar, 17Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). While the IGF-IR, by itself, protects 32D cells from apoptosis, overexpression of the insulin receptor (IR) is not sufficient for the growth of these cells in the absence of IL-3 (17Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, the combined overexpression of the IR and IRS-1 renders 32D cells IL-3-independent (17Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We show here that 1) the IGF-IR can also induce differentiation of 32D cells, along the granulocytic pathway; 2) IRS-1, one of the major substrates of the IGF-IR, inhibits IGF-I-mediated differentiation; 3) mutations of tyrosine 950 and of tyrosines 1250/1251 in the C terminus of the IGF-IR, in the absence of IRS-1, cause a decrease in the extent of IGF-I-mediated differentiation; 4) when these three tyrosine residues are mutated, the phosphorylation of Shc, another major substrate of the IGF-IR, is impaired; 5) overexpression of Shc promotes differentiation of 32D cells, while a dominant negative mutant of the Shc protein partially inhibits differentiation; and 6) the inhibitory effect of IRS-1 on the differentiation of 32D cells is associated with changes in the Akt/p70 S6 kinase pathway. We suggest that, at least in the case of 32D cells overexpressing the IGF-IR, the outcome (i.e. growth or differentiation) depends on a balance between the signaling pathways originating from two of its substrates. 32D clone 3 cells were transduced with a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector system (19Soneoka Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) to express the wild type IGF-IR or its various mutants or its substrates, IRS-1 and Shc. These constructs have been described in previous papers from one of our laboratories (16Zhou-Li F. Xu S.Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20D'Ambrosio C. Valentinis B. Prisco M. Reiss K. Rubini M. Baserga R.

Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G. Baserga R. Blättler W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The retroviral vector stocks were generated with a transient expression system (23Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) and used to transduce 32D cells as described previously (24Romano G. Guan M. Long W.K. Henderson E.E. Virology. 1997; 237: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were inserted either into retroviral transfer vector MSCV.neoEB (carrying the neomycin resistance gene) or MSCV.hph, (carrying the hygromycin resistance gene), which were kindly provided by Dr. R. G. Hawley (University of Toronto, Canada) and are described elsewhere (25Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar). The Shc-SH2 cDNA was constructed as described (26Baldari C.T. Pelicci G. Di Somma M.M. Milia E. Giuli S. Pelicci P.G. Telford J.L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1141-1147PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5′ portion of Shc cDNA, corresponding to amino acid residues 1–377, was deleted and substituted with a 15-base pair sequence containing an eukaryotic initiation site for translation (TAAAGCACTATGGGC). This construction was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using a sense primer containing the above mentioned initiation translation site and a XhoI restriction site in its overhang and an antisense primer containing the TAG stop codon and an EcoRI restriction site in its overhang. The sequence of the sense primer was 5′-GGTCAACCCTATATTCCTctcgagTAA AGCACTATGGGCTGGTTCCATGGGAAGCTGAGCCGGC-3′ (theXhoI restriction site is indicated in lowercase letters, and the translated region sequence of 5′ Shc-SH2 cDNA is underlined), whereas the sequence of the antisense primer was 5′-GGTCAACCTTA ACCGCAGCACCGGTTAATCgaattcGTCCATGCTACTCCCAGCTCTGACACAAGGC-3′ (the EcoRI restriction site is indicated in lowercase letters, and the stop codon and the translated region sequence of 3′ Shc-SH2 cDNA are underlined). The PCR conditions were as follows: a denaturation step of the template at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by a 1-min interval at 52 °C to allow the annealing of the primers to the template and a 3-min incubation at 72 °C for polymerase elongation of the primers. This cycle was repeated 35 times. At the end of these 35 cycles, an additional incubation at 72 °C for 15 min was included to allow completion of the amplification. The PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. The correct size product was excised from the gel and purified with a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The end PCR product was in 50 μl of water and digested withXhoI and EcoRI. After the digestion, the enzymes were heat-inactivated at 68 °C for 15 min, and the PCR fragment was gel-purified as already described. The digested and gel-purified PCR fragment was then ligated into the XhoI–EcoRI cloning site of MSCV.pac retroviral vector, carrying the puromycin resistance gene (25Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar). The Shc-SH2 cDNA was then sequenced to monitor for mutations. 32D cells and the derived mixed populations obtained by retroviral transduction were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% WEHI cell conditioned medium as a source of IL-3 and the required antibiotics for the selection (G418, 1 mg/ml (Life Technologies) or 1 mg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem)). For survival and granulocytic differentiation experiments, 32D cells and their derivatives were collected, washed three times, and seeded at a density of 5 × 104cells/ml in the medium specified for the different experiments. At each time point, viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion (Life Technologies), and Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospins were evaluated for differentiation. Bands and polymorphonuclear cells were considered as differentiated cells. Myeloperoxidase expression was detected in cell cytospins using a leukocyte myeloperoxidase kit, following the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma). Cells were incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 3 h before stimulation with the indicated growth factors, 20 ng/ml IGF-I (Life Technologies), 100 units/ml granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; Life Technologies) or 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lysates were resolved directly or after immunoprecipitation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures are described by Valentinis et al. (27Valentinis B. Morrione A. Taylor S.J. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3744-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine blots were performed with an antiphosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (PY20; Transduction Laboratories). The IGF-I receptor was immunoblotted with an anti-α-subunit IGF-I receptor polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Shc proteins were immunoprecipitated or immunoblotted with a polyclonal (Transduction Laboratories) or a monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) anti-Shc antibody, respectively. Grb2 was immunoblotted with a monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Phospho-Akt and Akt protein were detected using the PhosphoPlus Akt (Ser473) antibody kit (New England Biolabs), following the manufacturer's instructions. Phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr421/Ser424) and p70 S6 kinase protein were visualized with a PhosphoPlus p70 S6 kinase antibody kit, also from New England Biolabs, and also following the manufacturer's instructions. The present observations stem from our previous finding that, at variance with the IR, an overexpressed IGF-IR protects 32D cells from apoptosis although these cells do not have IRS-1 or IRS-2 (12Dews M. Nishimoto I. Baserga R. Recept. Signal Transduc. 1998; 7: 231-239Google Scholar, 17Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Yenush L. Fernandez R. Myers Jr., T.C. Grammer M.G. Sun X.H. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. Schlessinger J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the IR requires the combined overexpression of IRS-1 to promote growth of 32D cells in the absence of IL-3 (17Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). When 32D cells overexpress the IGF-IR, they not only survive but actually grow in the complete absence of IL-3 (12Dews M. Nishimoto I. Baserga R. Recept. Signal Transduc. 1998; 7: 231-239Google Scholar, 14Prisco M. Hongo A. Rizzo M.G. Sacchi A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We had noticed, however, that, after a period of rapid growth, the 32D IGF-IR cells stop growing and, after 4–5 days, begin to decrease in number, especially when the culture is not supplemented daily with IGF-I (see below). The period of reduced growth coincided with the appearance of differentiated 32D cells. We were intrigued by the finding that the IGF-IR can protect 32D cells from apoptosis, while at the same time inducing terminal differentiation, which usually results in cell death (28Maruoka Y. Harada H. Mitsuyasu T. Seta Y. Kurokawa H. Kajiyama M. Toyoshima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to examine the effects of the IGF-IR on 32D cells in more detail, using transduction with appropriate retroviral vectors. The use of retroviral vectors (see “Experimental Procedures”) gives a good efficiency of transduction of 32D cells (notoriously resistant to transfection by plasmids) and generates mixed populations, expressing, in the case of the IGF-IR, approximately 100,000 to 200,000 receptors/cell (see below). The use of mixed populations obviates the problem of clonal variation and, since the expression levels are high, also compensates for slight variations in individual cells. The levels of expression are also reasonably uniform in the mixed population, as one would expect from retroviral transduction (24Romano G. Guan M. Long W.K. Henderson E.E. Virology. 1997; 237: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). By flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with an antibody to the IGF-IR, the width of the peak is essentially the same as the width of the peak in a cloned cell line (data not shown). The mixed population expressing the wild type human IGF-IR is here designated as 32D IGF-IR. Fig.1 shows that these cells survive after IL-3 withdrawal and, with the addition of IGF-I, can actually grow, as already reported for 32D cells transfected with an IGF-IR plasmid (12Dews M. Nishimoto I. Baserga R. Recept. Signal Transduc. 1998; 7: 231-239Google Scholar,14Prisco M. Hongo A. Rizzo M.G. Sacchi A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 32D IGF-IR cells differentiate all the way to granulocytes, reaching a level of 50% differentiated cells by day 6 after IL-3 withdrawal and IGF-I addition (Fig. 1). Omission of IGF-I results in cell death, despite the high levels of receptor expression. It should be noted, however, that in these experiments, we have used heat-inactivated serum, a procedure that can destroy many growth factors, including the IGFs. For clarity, Fig. 1 gives only the data on days 0, 4, and 6, but both survival and differentiation were determined also at other intervals. The differentiation is morphologically detectable (Giemsa staining), and can be confirmed by staining for myeloperoxidase (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 also shows G-CSF-induced differentiation of 32D IGF-IR cells. G-CSF has been known to induce differentiation of parental 32D cells (29Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar), confirmed here, whether using the parental 32D cells or the 32D IGF-IR cells. The data in Fig. 1 are not intended as a comparison between IGF-I and G-CSF, since conditions are different. It is given here simply to show that the extent of IGF-I-mediated differentiation is not trivial. We investigated several mutants of the IGF-IR to determine the specific residues that are necessary for the induction of differentiation. These mutants have been described in previous papers from one of our laboratories (20D'Ambrosio C. Valentinis B. Prisco M. Reiss K. Rubini M. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3264-3271PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1231-1238PubMed Google Scholar, 22O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G. Baserga R. Blättler W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and are listed in Fig.2 a, which gives the levels of expression of the IGF-I receptors in mixed populations of transduced 32D cells. For simplicity, we are showing the results obtained with an antibody to the α-subunit of the IGF-IR, but the same results were obtained with an antibody to the β-subunit (not shown). The reason we chose to present the α-subunit results is that the antibody to the β-subunit does not recognize the receptor truncated at residue 1245. Notice that the α-subunit of δ1245 is of normal size, but the proreceptor is a little shorter, because of the truncated β-subunit. We have compared levels of expression with those of cell lines with a known number of IGF-IRs (30Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We can say that all populations express at least 50,000 receptors/cell, which is more than it is needed for other functions of the IGF-IR (30Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 a gives the survival at 4 days after IL-3 withdrawal of three of these mixed populations. The overexpressed mutant receptors, 32D 4 basic aa, 32D 6 serine, and 32D 1293–94 (Fig. 3 a), are as effective as the wild type receptor in protecting 32D cells from apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal, and all of them induce differentiation upon IGF-I addition (Fig. 3 b). Other mutant receptors (32D 3YF, 32D d1245, 32D Y950, and 32D Y1250–51) were not capable of fully protecting 32D cells from apoptosis after the first 48 h. Since differentiation, even with the wild type receptor, does not become clearly visible until day 4, it was necessary to prolong the survival of these cell lines by the addition of 0.1% WEHI medium (hereafter designated as IL-3). This procedure partially decreases the extent of differentiation in 32D cells expressing the wild type receptor to about 18% of viable cells (Fig. 3 d). However, the cells still differentiate. Using the same conditions, we can see that the three mutant receptors, Y950F, Y1250F/Y1251F, and d1245, have lost the ability to induce differentiation (Fig. 3 d). The level of differentiation is roughly the same as that of parental 32D cells growing in IL-3 (see Fig. 1). It may be argued that these mutant receptors are nonfunctional receptors, incapable of transmitting an IGF-I-mediated signal. The addition of 0.1% IL-3 was not sufficient to induce survival in the cell line described in Fig. 3 c (not shown). The addition of IGF-I made these cell lines grow with two exceptions: the parental cell line and the 32D 3YF cell line (Fig. 3 c). The 3YF mutant receptor has been known to be an inactive receptor (31Li S. Ferber A. Miura M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32558-32564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dependence on IGF-I for survival and growth of the 32D Y950, 32D Y1250–51, and 32D d1245 cell lines indicates that these mutant receptors are responsive to stimulation by IGF-I, as indeed they are when transfected into other cell lines (20D'Ambrosio C. Valentinis B. Prisco M. Reiss K. Rubini M. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3264-3271PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1231-1238PubMed Google Scholar, 22O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G. Baserga R. Blättler W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We can therefore say that these mutant receptors can still transmit a mitogenic signal but have lost the ability to transmit a differentiation signal. It could be objected that 32D Y950, 32D Y1250–51, and 32D d1245 cell lines may have lost the ability to differentiate. We therefore treated these same cell lines with G-CSF (100 units/ml). The wild type receptor cells gave (day 4) 19.5% differentiated cells, 20.8% Y950, 16.3% Y1250–51, and 14.1% δ1245. Therefore, these cell lines can differentiate when induced by G-CSF but not when induced by IGF-I. Since 32D cells are devoid of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (17Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), we inquired whether the absence of these proteins played a role in IGF-I-mediated differentiation of 32D cells. For this purpose, we examined other cell lines, all derived from the parental 32D cells: 1) a cell line in which we introduced, through a retroviral vector, the IGF-IR into a 32D cell line overexpressing IRS-1 (32D IRS/IGF-IR) (the original 32D IRS-1 cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Morris White and was described previously also from our laboratory (16Zhou-Li F. Xu S.Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)); 2) a cell line in which a retroviral vector expressing IRS-1 was introduced into 32D IGF-IR cells (in order to avoid confusion, these cells are designated as 32D GR15/IRS cells); and 3) a cell line overexpressing the IGF-IR and transduced with the empty retroviral vector used to deliver IRS-1 (32D IGF-IR/hph). Fig. 2 b shows that IRS-1 is not detectable in the parental 32D cells (lane 1), in the 32D IGF-IR cells (lane 2), and in 32D IGF-IR/hph (lane 3). It is modestly expressed in 32D GR15/IRS cells (lane 4) and strongly overexpressed in the 32D IRS/IGF-IR (lane 5). This blot was purposely overexposed in order to demonstrate again the absence of IRS-1 from the parental 32D cells. The levels of the expression of the IGF-IR in these cell lines are also given in Fig.2 b. Notice the comparable level of the overexpressed receptor in all four 32D-derived cell lines and the very low level of expression of the IGF-IR in parental 32D cells. Table I shows a representative experiment on the survival and differentiation of these cell lines, in the absence of IL-3 but with the addition of IGF-I. The 32D IGF-IR cells and the same cells transduced with an empty retroviral vector for IRS-1 (32D IGF-IR/hph) survive after IL-3 withdrawal, grow, and differentiate (40–45% differentiated cells). The combined overexpression of IRS-1 and the IGF-IR (32D GR15/IRS and 32D IRS/IGF-IR) results in cell lines that also survive and grow extremely well in the absence of IL-3. These last two cell lines, however, do not differentiate as well as the cells expressing only the IGF-IR (Table I). The mixed population of 32D cells expressing the IGF-IR and moderate amounts of IRS-1 (32D GR15/IRS) had 8.9% differentiated cells; the one expressing high amounts of IRS-1 (32D IRS/IGF-IR) had 0.3%. The difference between these two cell lines expressing both the IGF-IR and different levels of IRS-1 will be discussed further below. Table I shows the extent of differentiation at day 4, but we examined these cell lines also at day 6, and the cell lines that did not differentiate remained undifferentiated even at day 6, when 50% of the 32D IGF-IR cells are already differentiated. It seems therefore, that IRS-1 inhibits IGF-I-induced differentiation of 32D cells. We have confirmed the observation that overexpressed IR, by itself, does not protect 32D cells from apoptosis but that the combined overexpression of the IR and IRS-1 makes these cells grow in the absence of IL-3 (17Wang L.M.

The 46- and 52-kDa isoforms are strongly expressed in 32D cells, roughly 10 times the levels of expression in 3T3 cells (data not shown). The p66 isoform is not expressed in these cells (34Lanfrancone L. Pelicci G. Brizzi M.F. Arouica M.G. Casciari C. Giuli G. Pegoraro L. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

We transduced 32D cells with a retroviral vector carrying the Shc protein cDNA that codes for the 46- and 52-kDa forms (a kind gift of Dr. Joseph Schlessinger). Even with retroviral vectors, it was not easy to obtain 32D clones overexpressing Shc proteins, because the cells seemed to differentiate spontaneously even in the presence of IL-3. W"
https://openalex.org/W1978474183,"Short-chain acyl-CoA oxidases are β-oxidation enzymes that are active on short-chain acyl-CoAs and that appear to be present in higher plant peroxisomes and absent in mammalian peroxisomes. Therefore, plant peroxisomes are capable of performing complete β-oxidation of acyl-CoA chains, whereas mammalian peroxisomes can perform β-oxidation of only those acyl-CoA chains that are larger than octanoyl-CoA (C8). In this report, we have shown that a novel acyl-CoA oxidase can oxidize short-chain acyl-CoA in plant peroxisomes. A peroxisomal short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase from Arabidopsis was purified following the expression of the Arabidopsis cDNA in a baculovirus expression system. The purified enzyme was active on butyryl-CoA (C4), hexanoyl-CoA (C6), and octanoyl-CoA (C8). Cell fractionation and immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase is localized in peroxisomes. The expression pattern of the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase was similar to that of peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, a marker enzyme of fatty acid β-oxidation, during post-germinative growth. Although the molecular structure and amino acid sequence of the enzyme are similar to those of mammalian mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, the purified enzyme has no activity as acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. These results indicate that the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidases function in fatty acid β-oxidation in plant peroxisomes, and that by the cooperative action of long- and short-chain acyl-CoA oxidases, plant peroxisomes are capable of performing the complete β-oxidation of acyl-CoA.

Oilseed plants convert reserve oil to sucrose after germination. This unique type of gluconeogenesis occurs in the storage tissues of oilseeds, such as endosperms or cotyledons (1Beevers H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 243-251Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The metabolic pathway involves many enzymes in several subcellular compartments, including lipid bodies, glyoxysomes (a specialized peroxisome), mitochondria, and the cytosol. Within the entire gluconeogenic pathway, the conversion of a fatty acid to succinate takes place within the glyoxysomes, which contain enzymes for fatty acid β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle. Glyoxysomes and leaf peroxisomes are members of a group of organelles called peroxisomes (2Beevers H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1979; 30: 159-193Crossref Google Scholar). In glyoxysomes, fatty acids are first activated to fatty acyl-CoA by fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (3Huang A.H.C. Trelease R.N. Moore T.S. Plant Peroxisome. Academic Press, New York1983Google Scholar). Fatty acyl-CoA is the substrate for fatty acid β-oxidation, which consists of four enzymatic reactions (4Kindl H. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The first reaction is catalyzed by acyl-CoA oxidase. The second and third enzymatic reactions are catalyzed by a single enzyme that possesses enoyl-CoA hydratase and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities (5Preisig-Müller R. Guhnemann-Schafer K. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20475-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fourth reaction is catalyzed by 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (referred to as thiolase below) (6Preisig-Müller R. Kindle H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA, an end product of fatty acid β-oxidation, is metabolized further to produce succinate by the glyoxylate cycle. In mammalian cells, both peroxisomes and mitochondria contain a functional fatty acid β-oxidation system. In peroxisomes, the first enzyme of fatty acid β-oxidation, acyl-CoA oxidase, donates electrons to molecular oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide (7Hashimoto T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mammalian peroxisomes oxidize long-chain fatty acids, but are inactive with fatty acids shorter than octanoic acid (C8). This is mainly the consequence of the exclusive presence of long-chain acyl-CoA oxidases and the absence of acyl-CoA oxidases that are active on short-chain acyl-CoAs. In contrast, mammalian mitochondria are capable of complete oxidization of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA (8Eaton S. Bartlett K. Pourfarzam M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar); the first step of fatty acid β-oxidation is accomplished by long-, medium-, and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, and electrons generated by the dehydrogenases are transferred to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. By analogy, Thomas and co-workers (9Wood C. Burgess N. Thomas D.R. Planta (Heidelb.). 1986; 167: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Masterson C. Wood C. Thomas D.R.

(Bethesda). 1991; 95: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have postulated the existence of plant mitochondrial β-oxidation, but the presence of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was not investigated or not detected (12Hoppe A. Theimer R.R. Planta (Heidelb.). 1997; 202: 227-234Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, data reported by Gerhardt and co-workers (13Gerhardt B. Planta (Heidelb.). 1983; 159: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Gerbling H. Gerhardt B.

Planta (Heidelb.). 1998; 206: 125-130Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have suggested that glyoxysomes in plants can completely metabolize fatty acids to acetyl-CoA. We have previously reported the existence of an acyl-CoA oxidase that is active on long-chain acyl-CoA in glyoxysomes (16Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Yamaguchi K. Kato A. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8301-8307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report evidence that glyoxysomes contain another acyl-CoA oxidase that can metabolize short-chain acyl-CoA. We also discuss the unique features of fatty acid β-oxidation accomplished by these acyl-CoA oxidases in plant cells. Pumpkin seeds (Cucurbita sp. Kurokawa Amakuri) were purchased from Aisan Seed Co. (Aichi, Japan). Pumpkin seeds were soaked in running tap water overnight and germinated in Rock-Fiber soil (66R, Nitto Boseki, Chiba, Japan) at 25 °C in darkness. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsbergerecta seeds were surface-sterilized in 2% NaClO and 0.02% Triton X-100 and grown on growth medium (2.3 mg/ml Murashige-Skoog salts (Wako, Osaka, Japan), 1% sucrose, 100 μg/ml myoinositol, 1 μg/ml thiamine HCl, 0.5 μg/ml pyridoxine, 0.5 μg/ml nicotinic acid, 0.5 mg/ml Mes 1The abbreviations used are: Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; PS, protein signature-KOH, pH 5.7, and 0.2% Gellan gum (Wako)) in Petri dishes.Arabidopsis seeds were soaked in growth medium and germinated at 22 °C under continuous illumination or under darkness, and some of Arabidopsis seedlings were transferred to light after 4 days of growing in the dark. Some seedlings that were grown under continuous illumination for 2 weeks on growth medium were transferred to a 1:1 mixture of perlite and vermiculite. Plants were grown under continuous illumination at 22 °C. The cDNA clone (GenBankTMaccession number T46525) was obtained from the ArabidopsisBiological Resource Center (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). DNA sequencing was performed by the method of Sanger et al.(17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). DNA sequences were analyzed with GeneWorks Release 2.5 computer software (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA). The BLAST server was utilized for the analysis of homologies among proteins. Alignment of several acyl-CoA oxidases and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases was performed using CLUSTAL W software (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 8: 4321-4325Google Scholar). TheArabidopsis cDNA was inserted into pET32b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). A fusion protein between short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase and a histidine tag was synthesized in Escherichia coli cells and purified by column chromatography on Ni2+ resin. The purified protein (∼0.5 mg of protein) in 1 ml of sterilized water was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco). The emulsion was injected subcutaneously into the back of a rabbit. Four weeks later, a booster injection (∼0.25 mg of protein) was given similarly to the first injection. Blood was taken from a vein in the ear 7 days after the second booster injection. The serum was used for immunoblotting. Short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase was produced employing the baculovirus expression system from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's protocols. The system includesSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) as the insect cell line, pBlueBac 4.5 (19Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1988; 167: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as a transfer vector, and engineered baculoviralAutographa californica multiple polyhedrosis virus (Bac-N-Blue DNA) as an expression vector. In brief, the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase cDNA was inserted into the pBlueBac 4.5 transfer vector and cotransfected together with linearized baculoviral Bac-N-Blue DNA in insect cells. Recombinant viruses were purified from the transfection supernatant by plaque assay on medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside, and recombinant plaques were verified by polymerase chain reaction. Afterward, a high-titer recombinant viral stock was generated, and following a time course of expression experiment, the optimal expression time was determined. The recombinant protein expression levels were optimized, and a large-scale expression of recombinant protein was performed. Log-phase growing Sf9 cells in 20 75-cm2 flasks were infected with recombinant viral stock at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Four days after infection, the cells were dislodged from the flask walls and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, gently suspended in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.7, 10 mm NaCl, 100 μg/mg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm FAD, and 10% glycerol), and lysed by three bursts of sonication (3 × 1 min at 30-min intervals on ice). After centrifugation of the sample at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A and loaded on a HiTrap SP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan). Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 10–500 mm NaCl in buffer A, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Fractions with high short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activities were pooled and concentrated using Centricon 30 concentrators (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and then loaded on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 10 μm FAD, and 10% glycerol). Proteins were eluted with buffer B, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for the presence of acyl-CoA oxidase activity. Four-day-old pumpkin etiolated cotyledons (15 g, fresh weight) were homogenized in a Petri dish by chopping with a razor blade for 5 min in 10 ml of a medium that contained 150 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.5 m sucrose. The homogenate was passed through four layers of cheesecloth. Three ml of the filtrate was layered onto a sucrose gradient that consisted of a 1-ml cushion of 60% (w/w) sucrose and 11 ml of a linear sucrose gradient from 60 to 30% without buffer. The gradient was centrifuged at 21,000 rpm for 3 h in a Beckman SW 28.1 rotor in a Beckman Model XL-90 ultracentrifuge. After centrifugation, fractions of 0.5 ml were collected with a gradient fractionator (Model 185, Isco Inc., Lincoln, NE). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Subcellular fractionation ofArabidopsis etiolated cotyledons was performed as follows. One-hundred mg of seeds (∼5000 seeds) was grown on growth medium for 5 days in darkness at 22 °C. Etiolated cotyledons were harvested and chopped with a razor blade in a Petri dish with 2 ml of chopping buffer (150 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5m sucrose, and 1% bovine serum albumin). The extract was then filtered with a cell strainer (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Two ml of the homogenate was layered directly on top of a 16-ml linear sucrose density gradient (30–60%, w/w) that contained 1 mm EDTA. Centrifugation was performed in the SW 28.1 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected with the gradient fractionator. Arabidopsis etiolated cotyledons were harvested after 3 days in darkness. The samples were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in LR white resin (London Resin, Basingstoke, United Kingdom) as described previously (20Nishimura M. Takeuchi Y. De Bellis L. Hara-Nishimura I. Protoplasma. 1993; 175: 131-137Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Hayashi M. Toriyama K. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 2: 183-195Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert ultramicrotome (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) with a diamond knife and mounted on uncoated nickel grids. The protein A-gold labeling procedure was essentially the same as that described (20Nishimura M. Takeuchi Y. De Bellis L. Hara-Nishimura I. Protoplasma. 1993; 175: 131-137Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Hayashi M. Toriyama K. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 2: 183-195Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with a solution of catalase antiserum (diluted 1:1000) and then with a 30-fold diluted suspension of protein A-gold (10 nm for catalase; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 30 min. A solution of short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase antiserum (diluted 1:1000) was added to a 200-fold diluted biotinylated species-specific whole antibody and incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then with a 20-fold diluted suspension of streptavidin-gold (15 nm for short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 30 min. The sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope (1200EX, Joel, Tokyo) at 80 kV. Enzyme activities were measured at 25 °C in 1 ml of reaction mixture and monitored with a Beckman DU-7500 spectrophotometer. Acyl-CoA oxidase (EC 1.3.3.6) was assayed according to the method of Gerhardt (22Gerhardt B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 516-525Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with the concentration of acyl-CoA substrates reduced to 25 μm. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.3) was assayed according to Dommes and Kunau (23Dommes V. Kunau W.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Furuta et al. (24Furuta S. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Catalase (EC1.11.1.6) was assayed according to Aebi (25Aebi H. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2. Academic Press, New York1974: 673-684Google Scholar). Cytochrome coxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) was assayed according to Hodges and Leonard (26Hodges T.K. Leonard R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 392-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 15 °C using a Multiphor II electrophoresis system and Immobiline Dry Strip gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Arabidopsis and pumpkin cotyledons were homogenized in extraction buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% SDS); the homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min; and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot analysis was then performed essentially following the method of Towbin et al. (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immunologic reactions were detected by monitoring horseradish peroxidase activity (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Thiolase (28Kato A. Hayashi M. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 22: 843-852Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), castor bean isocitrate lyase (29Maeshima M. Yokoi H. Asahi T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 381-384Google Scholar), and pumpkin catalase (30Yamaguchi J. Nishimura M. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1984; 74: 261-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antisera were prepared as described previously. Protein was quantitated with a protein assay kit (Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories, Tokyo). As result of a similarity search with a long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (16Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Yamaguchi K. Kato A. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8301-8307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in a DNA data base, we found a putative Arabidopsis acyl-CoA dehydrogenase cDNA 2Grellet, F., Gaubier, P., Wu, H.-J., Laudie, M., Berger, C., and Delseny, M. (1996) EBI/GenBankTM accession number U72505. and the availability of another homologous cDNA clone (EBI/GenBankTM accession number T46525, AB017643) in theArabidopsis Expressed Sequence Tag data base. We received the latter from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and fully sequenced it. The expressed sequence tag clone contained an insert of 1.6 kilobases. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 436 amino acids, which corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼47 kDa (Fig. 1). Because mammalian acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is a mitochondrial enzyme, this putative acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was thought to be localized in plant mitochondria. However, we failed to find a mitochondrial targeting signal in the amino acid sequence. Instead, a typical peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) was present at the carboxyl terminus (SRL) (Fig. 1,boxed) (31Gould S.J. Keller G.-A.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that this cDNA encodes a second acyl-CoA oxidase with a substrate specificity that is different from that of a known plant acyl-CoA oxidase (16Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Yamaguchi K. Kato A. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8301-8307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To confirm that the ArabidopsiscDNA actually encodes an acyl-CoA oxidase, we expressed the protein from the cDNA employing a baculovirus expression system. To ascertain whether this expression protein has short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity or not, we found that crude homogenates obtained from infected insect cells showed acyl-CoA oxidase activity on hexanoyl-CoA (C6) (Table I). To purify the protein expressed by the cDNA, the crude homogenates were subjected to cation-exchange chromatography on a HiTrap SP column. Fractions containing high acyl-CoA oxidase activity were concentrated by ultrafiltration. The sample was then loaded on a Superose 12 column. The results of the purification are summarized in Table I. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the protein expressed in the insect cells and isolated by this purification scheme was pure (Fig. 2 A). Fig.2 B shows an immunoblot analysis of the fractions from each purification step and of an extract prepared fromArabidopsis etiolated cotyledons using antibodies raised against this acyl-CoA oxidase. The immunoblot analysis revealed that the molecular mass (47 kDa; arrowheads) of the purified protein coincided with that of the immunoreactive protein inArabidopsis etiolated cotyledons.Table IPurification of recombinant Arabidopsis short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase expressed employing the baculovirus expression systemStepActivityProteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationunitsmgunits/mg%-fold15,000 × g supernatant23.53.37.11001.0Hi Trap SP16.10.5827.868.53.9Superose 123.40.031109.814.515.5Short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activities were tested with hexanoyl-CoA as a substrate. Open table in a new tab Short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activities were tested with hexanoyl-CoA as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, the purified protein showed oxidase activity toward acyl-CoAs from butyryl-CoA (C4) to octanoyl-CoA (C8). The maximum activity was observed when hexanoyl-CoA (C6) was used for the substrate. The K m value for hexanoyl-CoA was estimated at 8.3 μm (TableII). No activity was observed employing crotonoyl-CoA (C4:1, an unsaturated carboxylic ester) or glutaryl-CoA (a dicarboxylic ester). The enzyme was active on isobutyryl-CoA at a concentration of 67 μm (2.5 units/mg). Furthermore, we detected no acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity when hexanoyl-CoA (C6), decanoyl-CoA (C10), and palmitoyl-CoA (C16) were used as substrates. These data indicated that this Arabidopsis cDNA encodes a short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase.Table IIProperties of Arabidopsis short-chain acyl-CoA oxidaseSubunit molecular mass47 kDaNative molecular mass180 kDapI9.5K m8.3 μmOptimal pH8.5–9.0Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activityNoneSubcellular localizationPeroxisomesK m and optimal pH values were determined employing hexanoyl-CoA as a substrate.

Open table in a new tab K m and optimal pH values were determined employing hexanoyl-CoA as a substrate. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity was tested with hexanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates. Gel-filtration chromatography of the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column indicated a native molecular mass of ∼180 kDa (Table II). Because the subunit molecular mass of the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase is 47 kDa, the purified enzyme must be a homotetramer. The highest activity was observed between pH 8.5 and 9.0. Table II summarizes the characteristics of the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase. Interestingly, the alignment of the conserved regions of acyl-CoA oxidases and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases revealed that the short- and long-chain acyl-CoA oxidases have conserved signatures for mammalian acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PS1, (G/A/C)(L/I/V/M)(S/T)EX2(G/S/A/N)GSDX 2(G/S/A); and PS2, (Q/E)X 2G(G/S)XG(L/I/V/M/F/Y)X 2(D/E/N)X 4(K/R)X 3(D/E)) (Fig. 4) (32Bairoch A. Bvcher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). It is possible that these regions are important for the interaction with the substrates. X-ray crystallography and mutational analyses indicated that the glutamic acid residues of mammalian medium-chain (Glu-376) and short-chain (Glu-368) acyl-CoA dehydrogenases serve as the α-proton-abstracting base (33Bross P.

Peterson K.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8446-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both the Arabidopsis short-chain and pumpkin long-chain acyl-CoA oxidases contain a glutamic acid residue in a corresponding position (Fig. 4 A, asterisk). To analyze the similarity between acyl-CoA oxidases and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, we compared amino acid sequences of plant acyl-CoA oxidases with human acyl-CoA oxidases and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. A phylogenetic tree indicates that the plant short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase is clustered together with mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, whereas it is relatively far from other peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases (Fig. 4 B). To investigate the subcellular localization of the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, homogenates from 5-day-old Arabidopsis etiolated cotyledons were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fractions thus obtained were analyzed using an immunoblot technique with antibodies raised against the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase. Catalase was used as a glyoxysomal marker enzyme. As shown in Fig. 5 A, short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase were present together in fractions 21–23. Although these enzymes were detected in the first few fractions (top of the gradient), this may be due to disruption of the glyoxysomes during homogenization and subsequent cell fractionation. We confirmed this result using 5-day-old pumpkin etiolated cotyledons. As is the case with Arabidopsis, a short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase was detected in fractions 21–23 by the immunoblot technique (Fig.5 B). These fractions had short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase as well as catalase activities. In contrast, no short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity was detected in fractions 8–13, which correspond to the activity of a mitochondrial marker enzyme, cytochrome coxidase. Fig. 6 shows an immunoelectron microscopic observation of short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase in cotyledon cells of Arabidopsis etiolated seedlings. Double staining by polyclonal antibodies against Arabidopsisshort-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (arrow) and pumpkin catalase (arrowhead) revealed that both enzymes are co-localized in glyoxysomes. No signal was detected on other organelles. These results clearly indicated that the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase is exclusively localized in glyoxysomes. Fig. 7 shows changes in the levels of short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase during the post-germinative growth of the Arabidopsis seedlings. An immunoblot analysis of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the dark showed that short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase as well as thiolase, another enzyme for fatty acid β-oxidation, reached a maximum level after 5–7 days of growth. These enzymes were still present in the seedlings after 9 days of growth in the dark. After illumination of the seedlings was started, the amount of these enzymes decreased, but faint bands were still detectable after 5 days of illumination (Fig. 7, 4D5L). Instead, isocitrate lyase, an enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, reached a maximum level earlier than short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (3 days after germination) and completely disappeared after 9 days in the dark. Short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase was particularly abundant in 5-day-old Arabidopsis etiolated cotyledons (Fig.8, upper panel, lane 1). This enzyme was also present in flowers, roots, and siliques (lanes 4, 5, and7), whereas it was present at very low levels or not at all in 7-day-old green cotyledons, rosette leaves, and stems (lanes 2, 3, and 6). The expression pattern of the thiolase was essentially similar to that of short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, except that a band was detected at certain levels in 7-day-old green cotyledons, rosette leaves, and stems (Fig. 8, center panel). In contrast, isocitrate lyase was detected only in extracts from etiolated cotyledons (Fig. 8,lower panel). In higher plants with fatty seeds such as pumpkin, the triacylglycerols are stored in lipid bodies. During germination, the fatty acids are liberated by lipase and then degraded by the β-oxidation system in the glyoxysomes, and the resulting acetyl-CoA is further metabolized by the glyoxylate cycle. Thus, fatty acids serve as the main source for energy and carbon compounds. Therefore, fatty acid β-oxidation plays an important role in metabolism until the etiolated cotyledons turn green during late germination. To use storage lipids efficiently, fatty acids need to be completely converted from acyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA by fatty acid β-oxidation. Because most storage lipids are long-chain molecules (C16–C18) in higher plants, the first step in fatty acid β-oxidation begins with long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, and for the shorter acyl-CoAs, short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase takes the place of long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase. Thus, higher plants make efficient use of storage lipids to produce carbon and energy sources. In this study, we characterized an Arabidopsis peroxisomal short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase and its cDNA. The presence of a peroxisomal short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase explains how higher plant peroxisomes are able to completely oxidize fatty acids by a β-oxidation system. In mammalian cells, fatty acid β-oxidation is localized both in peroxisomes and in mitochondria. The presence of a short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase distinguishes the peroxisomal β-oxidation of higher plants from that of mammals. In fact, mammalian peroxisomes contain three acyl-CoA oxidase isoforms that act on CoA derivatives of fatty acids with chain lengths from C8 to C18 and that are inactive in oxidizing acyl-CoA esters with carbon chains shorter than 8 carbons. Short-chain fatty acids (C4–C8) that could not be oxidized by these peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases are transported to mitochondria (7Hashimoto T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial β-oxidation system is able to completely degrade fatty acids from long- to short-chain fatty acids (37Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1522-1528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Common features of the amino acid sequences of theArabidopsis short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase and the mammalian mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase are shown in Fig. 4 and can be summarized as follow: (a) the presence of the two acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein signatures (PS1 and PS2) in both enzymes; (b) a 35% identity between acyl-CoA oxidase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; and (c) similar subunit molecular masses. However, the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase differs from pumpkin long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (16Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Yamaguchi K. Kato A. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8301-8307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), not considering the substrate specificity, as follows: (a) a subunit molecular mass of 47versus 77 kDa (precursor subunit), (b) the presence of a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1)versus an N-terminal cleavable targeting signal (PTS2), (c) a total identity of only ∼18%, and (d) a tetrameric structure versus a dimeric one. A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4 B) including some representative acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and acyl-CoA oxidases from mammals and higher plants clearly summarizes the data presented above: the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase of Arabidopsis is relatively unrelated to the other peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases, whereas it is clustered together with mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. The low homology to other acyl-CoA oxidases might suggest that the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase shares a common ancestor with acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase could have arisen from a mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase that acquired the peroxisomal targeting signal and the new intracellular location during evolution. That allowed plant peroxisomes to host a novel acyl-CoA oxidase ability that distinguishes plant organelles from mammalian peroxisomes. At least five isoforms of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase are present in mammalian mitochondria: very long-, long-, medium-, short-, and short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Except for the very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, all the other isoforms are tetrameric enzymes with a subunit of ∼45 kDa. Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase appears to be a dimer of ∼75 kDa (8Eaton S. Bartlett K. Pourfarzam M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In conclusion, both acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and acyl-CoA oxidases are tetramers or dimers of ∼45 or 75 kDa. Our analysis revealed the presence of a short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase in plant peroxisomes that shares high homology with mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases in mammals. The alignment of the conserved regions of acyl-CoA oxidases and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (Fig. 4 A) revealed that the short- as well as long-chain acyl-CoA oxidases contain amino acids of the typical mammalian acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein signatures (PS1 and PS2). PS1 has the form (G/A/C)(L/I/V/M)(S/T)EX 2(G/S/A/N)GSDX 2(G/S/A), and PS2 has the form (Q/E)X 2G(G/S)XG(L/I/V/M/F/Y)X 2(D/E/N)X 4(K/R)X 3(D/E) (32Bairoch A. Bvcher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of pumpkin long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase also contains 7 of the 9 amino acids of PS1 and 6 of the 8 amino acids of PS2 (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, PS1 and PS2 might be unrelated to the functions of the dehydrogenase and the oxidase. The purified short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase was active exclusively against short-chain acyl-CoA (C4–C8) substrates and had a reduced affinity for octanoyl-CoA (C8) and a very low activity for branched-chain substrates. This substrate specificity resembles the characteristics of the maize short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase as indicated by Hooks et al. (38Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TheK m value of 8.3 μm is close to the value reported for the maize enzyme (6 μm). The optimum pH of 8.5–9.0 is similar to that of the maize enzyme (pH 8.3–8.5). Hooks et al. have reported the purification of medium- and short-chain acyl-CoA oxidases from maize. The former was a monomeric enzyme of 62 kDa, and the latter was a homotetrameric enzyme of 15-kDa subunits. The 15-kDa subunit has one-third of the subunit mass (47 kDa) of the Arabidopsis short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase. Since the maize short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase was not yet cloned, the discrepancy in the subunit molecular mass needs to be further investigated to determine whether there are different families of acyl-CoA oxidases. Regulation of the expression of short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase seems to be similar to that of other β-oxidation enzymes such as thiolase (Figs. 7 and 8). A similar regulatory mechanism was reported for the expression of pumpkin long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (16Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Yamaguchi K. Kato A. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8301-8307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). On the contrary, isocitrate lyase, a marker enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, is differently regulated. This enzyme disappeared very quickly compared with short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase and thiolase. Additionally, the organ-specific expression of short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase and thiolase does not appear to be coordinated with the expression of isocitrate lyase. These results suggest that β-oxidation enzymes are present in a wider range of organs than enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle such as isocitrate lyase. Particularly, it seems that β-oxidation enzymes are present in significant amounts in flowers, roots, and siliques (Fig. 8,lanes 4, 5, and 7). Our data further support the hypothesis that the β-oxidation pathway plays an important role not only during the degradation of stored lipids, but also in normal lipid turnover and senescence (28Kato A. Hayashi M. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 22: 843-852Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and in jasmonic acid synthesis (39Wasternack C. Parthier B. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is also supported by the finding that the cDNA of an acyl-CoA oxidase ofPhalaenopsis (which is probably a long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase) was isolated by a search for flower senescence-related genes (40Do Y.Y. Huang P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recent additional evidence has indicated that the expression of a gene for medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidase was induced when a lauroylacyl carrier protein thioesterase was overexpressed in Brassica(41Eccleston V.S. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 613-622PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that expression of the acyl-CoA oxidase gene is regulated by fatty acid biosynthesis or by the amount of fatty acids that are present in the cells. Thus, acyl-CoA oxidase isoforms might have a fundamental role in the control of fatty acid homeostasis in higher plants. We are most grateful to Dr. Masayoshi Maeshima (Nagoya University) for kindly providing the antibody against castor bean isocitrate lyase and Dr. Roland R.

Mutation of the corresponding residue in GIRK1 (Leu333) resulted in a similar phenotype.

The presumed topology of these channels includes a cytoplasmic N terminus (∼90 amino acids), followed by two transmembrane domains with the “ion selectivity” P-region in between (∼100 amino acids) and ending with a long cytoplasmic C terminus (over 200 amino acids) (3Kubo Y.

GIRK channels can function as highly active heteromultimers (pairing of GIRK1 with any other subtype) or low to moderately active homomultimers (GIRK2–5) (for review, see Ref. 10Sui J.-L. Chan K.

Mutations at a specific position within the P-region of these channels (“P-region mutants”, e.g. GIRK4-S143T) greatly enhance the activity of homomultimers (11Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M.

We sought to identify those residues of GIRK critical for transducing effects of the Gβγ subunits. Our strategy was to generate chimeras between the GIRK4(S143T) (referred to as GIRK4*) and IRK1 channels, and screen for differences in Gβγ-dependent function and binding to Gβγ. Mutagenesis at a single site, namely GIRK4(L339E), reduced binding to Gβγ and impaired agonist-induced activity, but left intact the Gβγ dependence of the basal activity. Thus, we have identified a site on an effector protein that interacts specifically with Gβγ released through receptor stimulation.

The chimeric cDNA constructs were produced by splicing by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction (24Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reactions, using Vent DNA polymerase, were performed for only 15 cycles to avoid errors. Point mutations were generated using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Sequencing facility, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The βARK-PH construct (amino acids 452–689) was altered to incorporate the 15 N-terminal residues of Src for membrane targeting. This construct, generously provided by Dr. Eitan Reuveny, was altered and subcloned into pGEMHE. All constructs were linearized with Nhel and cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the “message machine” kit (Ambion). RNAs were electrophoresed on formaldehyde gels and concentrations were estimated from two dilutions using an RNA marker (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a standard. Xenopus oocytes were surgically extracted, dissociated, defolliculated by collagenase treatment, and microinjected with 50 nl of a water solution containing the desired cRNA. Unless otherwise indicated, we used the following approximate quantities: GIRK channel subunits, 1.0 ng/species; IRK1 channel, 0.25 ng; m2 receptor, 1.0 ng; β2-adrenergic receptor, 2.0 ng; Gα and Gβsubunits, 1.0 ng; Gγ subunit, 1.0 ng; βARK-PH, 1.0 ng. Gβ2 and Gγ2 were used in all Gβγ coexpression experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 19 °C. Whole oocyte currents were then measured by conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Agarose cushion microelectrodes were used with resistances between 0.1 and 1.0 megaohms (25Schreibmayer W. Lester H.A Dascal N. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Oocytes were constantly superfused with a high potassium solution having (in mm): 91 KCl, 1 NaCl, 1MgCl2, 5 KOH/HEPES (pH 7.4). To block or activate currents, the oocyte chamber was perfused with solutions of the same composition with 3 mm BaCl2 or 5 μm ACh. Typically oocytes were held at 0 mV (E K), and currents were constantly monitored by 500 ms pulses to a command potential of −80 mV for 200 ms followed by a step to +80 mV for another 200 ms, and the cycle was repeated every 2 s. Periodically, a protocol was applied with a command potential from −100 to +100 mV with 10 mV increments. Current amplitudes were measured at the end of the 200 ms pulse at each potential. In such manner, control currents were evaluated 2–5 min after impaling the oocytes just before application of ACh, ACh-activated currents were evaluated at the peak of the response to ACh, and Ba2+-insensitive currents were evaluated once steady-state inhibition was achieved, 1–3 min after application of 3 mmBa2+. Basal current is the difference between control and Ba2+-insensitive currents, and ACh-induced (or ACh-sensitive) current the difference between ACh-activated and control currents. Error bars in the figures represent mean ± S.E. Each experiment shown or described was performed on 3–5 oocytes of the same batch. A minimum of 2–3 batches of oocytes were tested for each experiment shown. Single-channel activity was recorded on devitellinized oocytes under the cell-attached mode of standard patch-clamp methods (26Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth B.F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar), as described previously (27Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained 96 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution was composed of 96 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. 100 μm gadolinium was also included in the pipette solution. Gβγ purified from bovine brain was used in the inside-out experiments (gift from Dr. John D. Hildebrandt). Recordings were performed at a holding membrane potential of −80 mV. Recordings were performed using the EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier and the PULSE/PULSEFIT (v. 7.6) data acquisition software (Heka Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Data were stored on the hard disk of a PC compatible computer, and single channel analysis made use of TAC (v 2.6.1) software (Skalar Instruments, Inc., Seattle, WA). The sampling rate was 4 kHz for most recordings. Activity expressed as NPo (N, number of channels in the patch; Po, probability of opening) was calculated by integrating the current traces over 30–60 s intervals and dividing by the unitary current. Recombinant bovine Gβ1γ2 subunits were purified from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses encoding for β1, γ2, and His6-αi1 as described by Kozasa and Gilman (32Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the C termini of GIRK4, GIRK4(L339E), or IRK1, and the PH domain of βARK were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in frame with the GST coding sequence in pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragments coded for: amino acids 184–419 for GIRK4, GIRK4(L339E), amino acids 177–428 for IRK1; and amino acids 546–670 for βARK. Expression of fusion proteins was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h, and the fusion proteins were purified using glutathione 4B-Sepharose beads. The binding assay of Gβγ to the fusion proteins was performed as described by Huang et al. (14Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 μm GST fusion protein and 0.1 μm Gβγ were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% lubrol and glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with 200 volume of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% lubrol, the bound proteins were eluted from beads by heating in protein sample buffer at 70 °C for 10 min and were then electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GST fusion proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining, and Gβ1 was detected by immunoblotting using a Gβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized with ECL (Amersham). Densitometry was used to quantify the relative amounts of bound Gβγ. We compared Gβγ sensitivities of basal and agonist-induced currents between the highly active GIRK4* and IRK1 channels. All experiments were carried out by expression in Xenopusoocytes. In whole-cell experiments, Gβγ sensitivity, in the presence of coexpressed G protein-coupled receptor, was assessed by (a) K+ current responses to agonist stimulation, (b) coexpression of channels with proteins such as Giα subunits or the PH domain of βARK that can act as “sinks” for endogenous Gβγ subunits, and (c) coexpression of channels with exogenous Gβγsubunits. Expression of GIRK4* in oocytes led to large basal and ACh-induced currents (Fig. 1, A andC). Coexpression of either βARK-PH or Giα1 led to a significant reduction in basal currents. However, oocytes coexpressing Giα1, rather than βARK-PH, displayed ACh-induced currents. This result is consistent with the interpretation that Giα1, and not βARK-PH, bound to endogenous Gβγ may be available for receptor-mediated activation. Coexpression of GIRK4 with exogenous Gβγ-enhanced agonist-independent K+currents while preserving the ACh-induced response (as in Ref. 12Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These results indicate that both the GIRK4* basal and agonist-induced currents are largely mediated by the Gβγ subunits. In contrast, oocytes injected with IRK1 exhibited no ACh-induced currents and did not respond to coexpression with Giα1, βARK-PH, or Gβγ (Fig. 1, B and C). We constructed chimeras between GIRK4* and IRK1 (Fig. 2, left). We screened for minimal segments of GIRK4* that when replaced by the corresponding IRK1 regions impaired sensitivity to Gβγ. Chimeras were named for the IRK1 segment replacing the corresponding GIRK4 region. We first replaced the full C terminus of GIRK4* with that of IRK1 (GIRK4*(IRKV179-I428)). This chimera showed intact basal but impaired agonist-induced currents, consistent with a previous report (22Kubo Y. Iizuka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Huang et al. (15Huang C.-L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) found the GIRK1(Glu318-Pro462) segment to be a minimal Gβγ binding region. From an alignment of the GIRK1 and GIRK4 primary amino acid sequences, residue GIRK1(Glu318) corresponds to GIRK4(Asp324). Thus, we tested the response of the chimera GIRK4*(IRKL316-I428) that replaced the GIRK4(Met323-Val419) region with the corresponding IRK1 segment. Again this chimera exhibited intact basal but impaired agonist-induced currents. To narrow the region responsible for the aberration of the GIRK4* agonist-induced currents, we constructed and tested three additional chimeras GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341), GIRK4*(IRKS342-K365), and GIRK4*(IRKY366-I428). All three chimeras displayed intact basal currents. However, the response of GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341) was impaired to agonist. These results suggest that differences between the two channels in this region, GIRK4(Met323-Tyr348) and IRK1(Leu316-Tyr341), may be important in their differential sensitivity to Gβγ. This is unlike the downstream regions where differences were without effects on Gβγ sensitivity. The current resulting from expression of the chimera GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341) had intact basal currents but impaired agonist-induced responses. To test its sensitivity to Gβγ, the GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341) chimera was coexpressed with Giα1 or βARK-PH. A significant reduction of basal currents was obtained, similar to the GIRK4* control (Fig.3 A). Yet, this chimera differed from GIRK4* (see Fig. 1) in that its expression alone or with Giα or Gβγ resulted in impaired ACh-induced currents. This result further supports the conclusion that this chimeric channel is defective in producing agonist-induced currents. Coexpression with Gβγ did not stimulate basal levels of activity. Because the Gβγ dependence of the basal currents was intact in the GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341) chimera, it is likely that other regions may be involved in Gβγ mediation of basal currents. We proceeded to test which of the distinct residues within the identified region of the GIRK4* and IRK1 channels were responsible for their differences in sensitivity to Gβγ. Eleven point mutations were made in which residues in the Met323-Tyr348 region of GIRK4* were mutated to the corresponding residues found in the Leu316-Tyr341 region of IRK1 (Fig.3 B). Mutant names refer to the position and amino acid of GIRK4 that was mutated to the corresponding IRK1 residue. Only GIRK4*(L339E) showed impaired agonist-induced responsiveness, mimicking the responses obtained with the GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341) chimera. We next tested the Gβγ sensitivity of the basal currents of GIRK4*(L339E), and compared them with that of the GIRK4* control in the same batch of oocytes. Oocytes coexpressing GIRK4*(L339E), Gβγ, Giα1, or βARK-PH behaved similar to the chimera GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341), demonstrating an intact Gβγ-mediated basal current component. (Fig.4 A). Inside-out patch recordings from oocytes expressing the mutant and control channels were performed to test their responses to Gβγ subunits. Fig.4 B (left) compares activity from one batch of oocytes expressing GIRK4* and GIRK4*(L339E) channels. Perfusion of inside-out patches with purified Gβγ was ineffective in stimulating GIRK4*(L339E) activity compared with control GIRK4*. Stimulation of currents by endogenous G proteins through GTPγS application gave similar results as the application of purified Gβγ (data not shown, n > 3). Regardless of their sensitivity to Gβγ, control or mutant channels responded to a similar degree to intracellular Na+ ions (27Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), thus providing a positive control for gating by Na+ ions. These inside-out patch responses were consistent with the whole-cell data for GIRK4*(L339E). Perhaps the lack of stimulation of whole-cell currents by Gβγcoexpressed with GIRK4*(L339E) reflects maximal basal currents for this mutant. To examine this possibility, we coexpressed βARK-PH in oocytes (same batch as the experiments in Fig. 4 B, left) with GIRK4* or GIRK4*(L339E) channels. We perfused inside-out patches from such oocytes with Gβγ purified from bovine brain (Fig. 4 B, right). Inside-out patches of oocytes coexpressing GIRK4*(L339E) and βARK-PH convincingly responded to perfusion with exogenous Gβγ, presumably recovering the βARK-PH inhibition of the basal currents seen in the whole-cell experiments. However, these responses were significantly smaller than those of the control GIRK4*. In all cases, GTPγS application failed to stimulate channel activity by activating endogenous G proteins, serving as a positive control for βARK-PH effectiveness (data not shown, n > 3). Through these experiments we conclude that the GIRK4(L339E) mutation selectively impairs agonist-induced Gβγ-mediated responses. To determine the effects of the GIRK4(L339E) mutation of the C terminus on Gβγbinding, we constructed and purified GST fusion proteins containing the C termini of GIRK4 (GIRK4C), GIRK4(L339E), (GIRK4- (L339E)C) and IRK1 (IRK1C), or βARK-PH. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified (Fig.5, top). In vitrobinding assays were performed with the recombinant bovine Gβ1γ2 subunits purified from Sf9 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 (middle and bottom panels), the C termini of GIRK4 and GIRK4(L339E) were able to bind Gβγ as compared with negative controls (GST and IRK1C) and a positive control (βARK-PH). GIRK4(L339E)C binding to Gβγ was significantly reduced. These results suggest that the critical Leu of GIRK channels, and perhaps neighboring residues, directly interacted with Gβγ subunits. Additionally, because GIRK4(L339E)C has reduced but measurable binding to Gβγ, it is likely that additional C-terminal Gβγ binding sites exist, which contribute to the Gβγ dependence of basal currents. To determine whether the effect seen with the L339E mutant was specific to the GIRK4* subunit, we mutated the corresponding amino acid residue in GIRK1, L333E. We tested for Gβγ sensitivity of this point mutant in the context of the highly active homomultimer GIRK1(F137S) (see Refs. 11Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 12Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar; referred to as GIRK1*). Similar results were obtained with the GIRK1*(L333E) mutant as with the GIRK4*(L339E). Again, although ACh-induced currents were impaired by the mutation, the basal currents were reduced by Giα1 and βARK-PH (Fig. 6 A,right). Fig. 6 B shows that GTPγS application to inside-out patches expressing GIRK1* or GIRK1*(L333E) resulted in ∼42-fold increase in GIRK1* activity but caused no increase in the current of GIRK1*(L333E) (n = 5). We next sought to determine the relative contribution of wild-type GIRK subunits to agonist-induced activation in heteromultimeric channels (Fig. 6 C). We introduced the Leu to Glu mutations at the 333 and 339 positions of the wild-type GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits, respectively. We compared basal and agonist-induced currents of GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromultimeric channels, composed of both wild-type, both Leu to Glu mutants, and each wild-type to mutant combination. Our results suggest that each of the wild-type subunits contribute equally to agonist-induced activity, because heteromultimeric channels containing either Leu to Glu mutants displayed reduced agonist-induced sensitivity. Moreover, heteromultimeric channels, where both the subunits contained the Leu to Glu substitution showed significantly impaired agonist-induced currents. Thus, these results confirmed the importance of the residue for receptor-stimulated currents in heteromultimeric channels. Yeast two-hybrid experiments have shown that Gβ1 and Gβ2 interact with the N terminus of GIRK1 more strongly than do Gβ3–5(19Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17597-17600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether C-terminal mutation of the critical Leu residue could have altered the ability of the channel to interact with specific Gβ subunits, we coexpressed Gβ1, Gβ2, or Gβ3 with Gγ2 and GIRK1/GIRK4 or GIRK1(L333E)/GIRK4(L339E) heteromultimers. All Gβγ combinations stimulated wild-type basal currents (2–4-fold, n = 3). When tested with the mutated channel subunits, Gβ1–3γ2 subunits failed to stimulate basal currents (n = 3). These results suggest that mutation of the critical Leu residue does not exert its effects by altering the specificity of channel/Gβ1–3 interactions. However, possible changes in the specificity of Leu mutant channels with the Gβ4 or Gβ5 subunits that were not tested cannot be ruled out. Gβγ subunits released from Gsα subunits by β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation activate GIRK channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (28Lim F.N. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To test whether the critical Leu residue is involved in Gβγ signaling by receptors other than m2, we coexpressed β2-adrenergic receptor and Gsα subunits with GIRK1/GIRK4 or GIRK1(L333E)/GIRK4(L339E) heteromultimers. Isoproterenol-induced currents were obtained after expression of wild-type heteromultimers (−7.65 ± 2.17 μA at −80 mV, n = 3) but not with mutants (−0.17 ± 0.09 μA at −80 mV, n = 3). These results suggest that the Gβγ released after activation of these two different receptors interact in a similar fashion with the critical GIRK Leu residue. Since Soejima and Noma (29Soejima M. Noma A. Pflügers Arch. 1984; 400: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) first reported the membrane-delimited nature of the atrial muscarinic K+ channel, the mechanism of G protein gating of ion channels has received great attention. Over a decade ago, G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K channels provided the first example of a Gβγ controlled signaling pathway. Yet, despite intense efforts, many questions remain unanswered regarding specific sites of interaction between the channel and Gβγ. Biochemical studies from several groups have pointed to interaction of Gβγ with the C and N termini of these channels. Specifically, Huang et al. (14Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), using deletion mutagenesis, found that deletion of the GIRK1(Val273-Pro354) segment reduced Gβγ binding of the remaining C-terminal fragment. In subsequent studies, Huang et al. (15Huang C.-L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) determined the GIRK1(Glu318-Pro462) segment as a minimal Gβγ binding region. Kunkel and Peralta (16Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), using a combination of chimeras and deletion mutations, reported the GIRK1(Thr290-Tyr356) region to be important in interactions with Gβγ. In this study, we screened the C terminus of GIRK4* for residues that control channel activity. We made chimeras that replaced specific sections of GIRK4* with those from the G protein-insensitive channel, IRK1. Expression of a minimal chimera, the GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341), resulted in normal basal currents that did not respond to ACh when coexpressed with hm2 receptors. Expression of exogenous Gβγ did not enhance basal currents in this chimera. Yet, basal currents were inhibited by coexpression of Giα1 and βARK-PH. Of all the amino acid differences between IRK1 and GIRK4* contained in this chimera, only the mutant GIRK4*(L339E) retained all properties of the chimera. This mutant displayed Gβγ-sensitive basal currents that were not ACh-sensitive and did not respond to exogenous Gβγ. Inside-out patch currents from oocytes expressing GIRK4*(L339E) and hm2 receptors were significantly smaller in response to Gβγ or GTPγS. Binding of the Gβγ subunits to the GIRK4 C terminus bearing the L339E mutation was significantly reduced. Within the broader boundaries suggested by others (14Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Huang C.-L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the region surrounding Leu339 is a Gβγ binding site with critical functional consequences. Basal currents from the GIRK4*(L339E) channel were inhibited by coexpression of Gβγ sinks, such as the βARK-PH. Because binding of the L339E mutant of the GIRK4 C terminus was not abolished and because basal currents of GIRK4*(L339E) could be inhibited by βARK-PH or Giα1, it is likely that additional Gβγ binding sites contribute to basal channel activity. Moreover, because Gβγ perfusion of inside-out patches activated GIRK4*(L339E) channels only when they were coexpressed with βARK-PH, it is likely that this activation reflected reversal of the βARK-PH inhibited basal currents. We hypothesize that the basal binding sites may be high affinity and saturated in both the whole-cell and inside-out patch experiments. Recent evidence has suggested another region of GIRK4 (Ser209-Arg225) capable of high affinity binding to Gβγ (30Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is possible that such a site accounts for part or all of the basal channel activity. How does GIRK4*(L339E) impair specifically agonist-induced stimulation? In the simplest model, free Gβγ would be bound to high affinity basal sites. The GIRK4*(IRKL316-Y341) chimera and the GIRK4*(L339E) mutant may impair a low affinity binding of this region to Gβγ subunits. Normally, agonist-induced liberation of Gβγ subunits would increase the local free Gβγ concentration, allowing interaction with a low affinity site, encompassing GIRK4*(Leu339), and leading to stimulation of channel activity. Further work will be required to test this hypothesis. GIRK1*(L333E) channels displayed similar properties to GIRK4*(L339E). Again, basal currents from this mutant channel were sensitive to Gβγ, but no ACh-induced currents could be detected. Double mutations in heteromultimeric GIRK1(L333E)/GIRK4(L339E) channels expressed in oocytes showed similar properties to the highly active homomultimeric mutants discussed above. Furthermore, mutation of both channels in a heteromultimer was required for the ACh-insensitive phenotype, whereas reduced agonist-induced currents were obtained with one or the other of the two subunits mutated. These results suggest that there is an equivalent contribution of GIRK1 and GIRK4 to Gβγ-mediated ACh-induced activity. Additionally, coexpression of different Gβγ combinations or different receptors such as the β2-adrenergic receptor did not alter the unique properties of these mutant channels. This suggests that signaling through different receptors and by different Gβγcombinations activates the channel through conserved interactions. Biochemical evidence has suggested multiple binding sites in the C- and N-terminal segments of GIRK channels (15Huang C.-L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of Gβγ binding sites with effector proteins is in agreement with the finding that the Gβγ-phosducin co-crystals show multiple sites of interaction between the two proteins (31Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our data combine biochemical with functional evidence for more than one Gβγ binding site on the channel. Surprisingly, distinct functional roles could be assigned to multiple binding sites; one designed to interact with Gβγ released from receptor stimulation, whereas additional site(s) may interact with free Gβγ to yield basal activity. Thus, these results suggest that for the K+ channel the multiplicity of interactions may subserve distinct functional roles.

Fusion to a T7 promoter allowed expression in Escherichia coli, representing the first mammalian cystathionine γ-lyase overproduced in a bacterial system. About 90% of the heterologous gene product was insoluble, and renaturation experiments from purified inclusion bodies met with limited success. About 5 mg/liter culture of human cystathionine γ-lyase could also be extracted from the soluble lysis fraction, employing a three-step native procedure. While the enzyme showed high γ-lyase activity toward l-cystathionine (K m = 0.5 mm,V max = 2.5 units/mg) with an optimum pH of 8.2, no residual cystathionine β-lyase behavior and only marginal reactivity toward l-cystine and l-cysteine were detected. Inhibition studies were performed with the mechanism-based inactivators propargylglycine, trifluoroalanine, and aminoethoxyvinylglycine. Propargylglycine inactivated human cystathionine γ-lyase much more strongly than trifluoroalanine, in agreement with the enzyme's preference for C-γ–S bonds. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine showed slow and tight binding characteristics with a K i of 10.5 μm, comparable with its effect on cystathionine β-lyase.

While the enzyme showed high γ-lyase activity toward l-cystathionine (K m = 0.5 mm,V max = 2.5 units/mg) with an optimum pH of 8.2, no residual cystathionine β-lyase behavior and only marginal reactivity toward l-cystine and l-cysteine were detected. Inhibition studies were performed with the mechanism-based inactivators propargylglycine, trifluoroalanine, and aminoethoxyvinylglycine. Propargylglycine inactivated human cystathionine γ-lyase much more strongly than trifluoroalanine, in agreement with the enzyme's preference for C-γ–S bonds. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine showed slow and tight binding characteristics with a K i of 10.5 μm, comparable with its effect on cystathionine β-lyase. The results have important implications for the design of specific inhibitors for transsulfuration components. Transsulfuration and reverse transsulfuration constitute part of the metabolic interconversion of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine (Fig. 1). The forward pathway, the transformation of cysteine into homocysteine via the intermediate l-cystathionine is catalyzed by the sequential action of the enzymes cystathionine β-lyase (CBL) 1The abbreviations used are: CBL, cystathionine β-lyase; AVG, l-aminoethoxyvinylglycine; CGL, cystathionine γ-lyase; CGS, cystathionine γ-synthase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); F3Ala, β,β,β-trifluoroalanine; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PG, d,l-propargylglycine; RT, reverse transcriptase1The abbreviations used are: CBL, cystathionine β-lyase; AVG, l-aminoethoxyvinylglycine; CGL, cystathionine γ-lyase; CGS, cystathionine γ-synthase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); F3Ala, β,β,β-trifluoroalanine; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PG, d,l-propargylglycine; RT, reverse transcriptaseand cystathionine γ-synthase (CGS) and has been identified in bacteria, fungi, and plants. Conversely, reverse transsulfuration, catalyzed by the enzymes cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL), is known only in fungi and mammals (1Nagasawa T. Kanzaki H. Yamada H. J. Biol.

Actinomycetes species present a notable exception to this rule (1Nagasawa T. Kanzaki H. Yamada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10393-10403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four enzymatic transsulfuration components are all pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, but they pertain to different structural groups; CBL, CGS, and CGL show extensive sequence homology and are members of the PLP γ-family (Ref. 3Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar; Fig. 2), while cystathionine β-synthase is unrelated and belongs to the β-family.Figure 2Best fit alignment of the amino acid sequences of human CGL, rat liver CGL, yeast CGL, streptomyces CGL,E. coli CGS, and E. coli CBL.Identical residues are colored green, and those identical within the group of CGLs are additionally boxed.

Both CBL and CGS are homotetramers composed of ∼40–45-kDa subunits and carry one PLP cofactor per monomer covalently bound via a Schiff base to an active site lysine. A similar situation has been found for CGL (1Nagasawa T. Kanzaki H. Yamada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10393-10403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yamagata S. D'Andrea R.J.

In the present paper, we extend our structure-function analyses to human CGL (EC 4.4.1.1; unless otherwise stated, “CGL” refers to human cystathionine γ-lyase). CGL catalyzes the second step in the reverse transsulfuration pathway, i.e. the cleavage of thel-cystathionine C-γ–S bond, yieldingl-cysteine, α-ketobutyrate, and ammonia (Fig. 1). In humans, the enzyme is linked to cystathioninuria, cystinosis, and (although less frequently than cystathionine β-synthase (13Dudman N.P.B. Guo X.W. Gordon R.B. Dawson P.A. Wilcken D.E.L. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: S1295-S1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) homocystinuria (14Uren J.R. Ragin R. Chaykovsky M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These metabolic disorders potentially result in mental or physical impairments. In addition, malignant lymphoic cells show markedly reduced levels of CGL and do not grow in media devoid ofl-cystine (14Uren J.R. Ragin R. Chaykovsky M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Sturman J.A. Beratis N.G. Guarini L. Gaull G.E. J. Biol.

Therefore, observations ofl-cyst(e)ine conversion by CGL from various species (1Nagasawa T. Kanzaki H. Yamada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10393-10403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yamagata S. D'Andrea R.J. Fujisaki S. Isaji M. Nakamura K. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 367-376Google Scholar) suggested the possibility of exploiting the enzymatic activity for cyst(e)ine depletion in blood (14Uren J.R. Ragin R. Chaykovsky M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Alternatively, intracellular inhibition of the enzyme could block a metabolic route toward l-cyst(e)ine (14Uren J.R. Ragin R. Chaykovsky M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since human hepatic CGL activity levels are markedly reduced compared with those in rat liver, CGL could be a rate-limiting factor in human liver glutathione synthesis (through the limited availability of cysteine), which could be ultimately responsible for a susceptibility to alcoholic liver damage (Ref. 19Lu Y. O'Dowd B.F. Orrega H. Israel Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and references therein). Despite the central metabolic role of CGL and its link to a broad pathological spectrum, until now detailed mechanistic or structural data on the human enzyme are lacking. Such studies have been severely hampered by the small overall yields of native isolations (14Uren J.R. Ragin R. Chaykovsky M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). While nonrecombinant CGL purifications from several species have been described (neurospora (20Flavin M. Slaughter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2212-2219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), streptomyces (1Nagasawa T. Kanzaki H. Yamada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10393-10403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rat (14Uren J.R. Ragin R. Chaykovsky M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Matsuo Y. Greenberg D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 230: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the yeast enzyme so far is the only one that has been heterologously expressed in E. coli (11Yamagata S. D'Andrea R.J. Fujisaki S. Isaji M. Nakamura K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reported CGL preparations have not been exhaustively characterized, particularly with respect to substrate specificities and the enzymes' responses toward inhibitors. Inhibition of the transsulfuration enzymes is of interest because the different enzymatic spectra displayed by different organisms (Fig. 1) could be exploited for the development of new antibiotics and herbicides. Inhibition studies were so far focused on CGS and CBL, the enzymes of methionine biosynthesis in microorganisms and plants, employing the mechanism-based inhibitors β,β,β-trifluoroalanine (F3Ala; Ref. 7Silverman R.B. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4718-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), propargylglycine (PG; Refs. 9Kreft B.D. Townsend A. Pohlenz H.D. Laber B.

Schalkwijk S. Exterkate F.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 4037-4042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG; Refs. 6Clausen T. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Pohlenz H.-D. Laber B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12633-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 8Martel A. Bouthier de la Tour C. Le Goffic F. Biochemistry of Vitamin B6. Birkhäuser, Basel1987: 341-344Crossref Google Scholar). Deeper insight into the catalytic mechanisms and substrate recognition properties of CGL should be helpful, e.g. for the development of pesticides that are not harmful to humans. Recently, the gene for human CGL has been cloned and sequenced (19Lu Y. O'Dowd B.F. Orrega H. Israel Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to develop an expression system that would supply a sufficient amount of the enzyme for mechanistic and structural investigations. Herein, we describe the heterologous expression of human CGL in E. coli and introduce a three-column purification protocol that yields large amounts of apparently homogenous gene product. The product's enzymatic properties and its behavior toward inhibitors suggest possible guidelines for the development of specific inactivators and warrant caution in the use of certain substances for herbicides and antibiotics. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals used were of analytical grade as supplied by Sigma/Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany) or Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany). F3Ala was a kind gift from AgrEvo (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Human Hep G2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. P. Habenberger (Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, Martinsried, Germany). DNA oligonucleotides were ordered high pressure liquid chromatography-purified from MWG-Biotech GmbH (Ebersberg, Germany). Reverse transcriptase (RT) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany); Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany); and restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Chromatography columns were self-made and hand-packed with materials from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden) and driven by peristaltic pumps and stirred gradient mixers. Automated dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing (23Sanger F. Nickler S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) was performed in 25-μl polymerase chain reactions (PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, Perkin Elmer, Überlingen, Germany) under supplier-recommended conditions and analyzed by Dr. M. Boicu (Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie). N-terminal peptide sequencing was carried out by Dr. K.-H. Mann (Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie). UV-visible spectra were recorded with a Beckman (München, Germany) DU 7500 diode array spectrophotometer. Kinetic data were analyzed with the program KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software, University of California, San Franscisco, CA). SDS gels were prepared and run according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Analytical gel filtration experiments were performed with a 2.4-ml Superose-12 column on a SMARTTM system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from Hep G2 liver cells (ATCC-No. HB-8065) was prepared according to Chirgwin et al. (25Chirgwin J.J. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Briefly, after quantitative removal of the culture supernatant, 300 cm2 of confluent cells were lysed with 4 ml of denaturing solution (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mmsodium citrate, 0.5% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.1m 2-mercaptoethanol). The DNA was sheared by passing the lysate 10 times through a pipette. After the addition of 0.1 g of CsCl per ml of lysate, the solution was layered over a cushion of 9 ml of 5.7 m CsCl in a SW28 tube (Beckman) and centrifuged at 22 °C overnight at 113,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellet was immersed overnight at 4 °C in 3 ml of 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. After the addition of 0.1 volume of 3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, the RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol at −70 °C for 30 min. The total RNA was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, dried, resuspended in water, and stored at −70 °C. The presence of RNA in the required size range was confirmed by urea polyacrylamide gels with 16 and 23 S ribosomal RNA as standards. 100 pmol of an oligo(dT)15 primer served for first strand cDNA synthesis with 25 μg of total Hep G2 RNA in a 50-μl reaction. Other components and reaction conditions were as suggested by the RT supplier. Second strand cDNA synthesis and amplification of the product were performed via polymerase chain reaction (26Saiki R.K.

Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13369) Google Scholar) in 50-μl reaction volumes with 5 μl of the column-purified RT reaction mix as the template (30 polymerase chain reaction cycles: 30 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, 12 min at 68 °C) and 100 pmol of 5′-overhang primers (forward primer, 5′-CGATGGGTACCATATG CAGGAAAAAGACGCCTCCTCACAAGG-3′; reverse primer, GCGGTACCTCGAGTTACTACTGTGAATTCCACTTGGAGGGTGTGCTGCC-3′; sequences corresponding to the human CGL gene are italicized). The primers contained restriction enzyme recognition sites (forward primer NdeI; reverse primer XhoI; underlined) for subsequent cloning into a pET22b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) expression vector. The amplified cDNA and the vector preparation were digested overnight with NdeI/XhoI at 37 °C and purified via a 1% agarose gel. Ligation occurred overnight at 16 °C. Individual colonies were obtained from E. coli XL1-Blue cells electroporated with the ligation mixture, grown on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-Amp100), and propagated in liquid LB-Amp100 medium for plasmid preparations. Potentially positive clones were identified through restriction digests and verified by automated Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing. In a similar fashion, the CGL gene was cloned behind a Ptac promoter in the pCYB1 expression vector (New England Biolabs). 40 μl of electrocompetent BL21(DE3) E. coli cells were electroporated with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA at 18,000 V/cm (Electroporator 1000, Stratagene). Transformants were rescued in 1 ml of LB for 1 h at 37 °C and used to inoculate an overnight 100-ml LB-Amp100 starter culture. 3 ml of the starter culture were propagated in 3-liter Erlenmeyer flasks with 650 ml of LB-Amp200. After shaking at room temperature to an A 595 of ∼0.7, 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the cultures were maintained at room temperature for another 12 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Beckman JS4.2 rotor at 4200 rpm for 30 min, resuspended in 7 ml/1 liter original culture of resuspension buffer (50 mm KPibuffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm PLP, and 2 mm EDTA), and stored at −70 °C until further processing. 15% polyacrylamide SDS gels showed a strong expression band at about 45 kDa (Fig.3 b), which was roughly distributed in a 10:90 ratio between soluble and insoluble fractions, respectively, as estimated by the Coomassie stain. Cells from the 6-liter overnight culture were thawed and, after the addition of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated with 0.3 mg/ml hen egg white lysozyme for 30 min at room temperature. Cell lysis and DNA shearing were completed by 15-min sonification on ice using the 50% pulsed maximum output of a Branson (Danbury, CT) sonifier equipped with a macrotip. All subsequent steps were performed with the protein on ice or at 4 °C. The lysate was cleared for 45 min at 20,000 rpm in a Beckman JA25.50 rotor. The supernatant was applied to a 300-ml DEAE-Sepharose FF column, equilibrated with buffer A (20 mmKPi buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm PLP, 2 mm EDTA). A linear 1-liter gradient run at 8 ml/min to buffer A plus 0.5 m ammonium sulfate eluted CGL at about 0.1 m salt. Fractions containing CGL were identified via enzymatic assays (see below) and SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The DEAE pool was adjusted to 1.0 m ammonium sulfate, loaded on a 100-ml phenyl-Sepharose HP column, equilibrated with buffer A plus 1.0m ammonium sulfate, and eluted at 4 ml/min with a linear 600-ml gradient to buffer A. Peak fractions were identified as before, pooled, and concentrated to 20 mg/ml using an Amicon 30-kDa ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The concentrated pool was applied to a 300-ml Sephacryl S200 size exclusion column and chromatographed in 10 mm KPi, pH 8.0, 10 μm PLP at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The product was located in the fractions as before, pooled, and concentrated to 20 mg/ml with Centriprep-30 concentrators (Amicon). Concentrated pools were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −70 °C. The catalytic activity of the final product did not degrade for several months at this temperature, and the protein diluted to 6 mg/ml was stable at 4 °C for at least 14 days. A typical purification run yielded ∼5 mg of CGL per liter of original culture. The efficiency of individual purification steps is summarized in TableI.Table IPurification of human CGL overexpressed in E. coliPurification stepVolumeProtein concentrationProtein massActivitySpecific activityRecoveryEnrichment factormlmg/mlmgunitsunits/mg%Soluble cell extract8013.410721500.141001.0DEAE anion exchange chromatography1052.62761160.42773.0Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography700.856951.76312.0Size exclusion chromatography450.731.578.82.55318.0 Open table in a new tab The CGL-expressing cells were harvested and lysed as before. The pellet from the cell lysis was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, 0.5%N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide, sonicated (Branson, macrotip, 80% pulsed, 80% output for 15 min), and again centrifuged. Washing was repeated once withN,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide and twice without detergent. 150 mg of purified inclusion bodies were dissolved in 10 ml of solubilization buffer (6 mguanidinium hydrochloride, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 20 μm PLP, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5), slowly dripped overnight at 4 °C into a 500-ml reservoir of renaturation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 μm PLP, 5 mm1,4-dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5), and subsequently dialyzed against three changes of 4 liters of (a) 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 μm PLP, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, (b) 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μm PLP, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, and (c) 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μm PLP, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. The soluble supernatant was then passed over a 50-ml DEAE-Sepharose FF column at 4 ml/min with a 400-ml linear gradient from 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μm PLP, 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.5, to the same buffer containing 0.5 mammonium sulfate. Analysis of the fractions was performed as before. Similar renaturation trials were attempted using renaturation buffers with 1.2 m l-arginine and direct dialysis against guanidinium-free buffers. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with a bovine serum albumin standard curve. For calculation of kinetic constants, CGL concentrations were determined by the 280-nm absorption using the calculated molar extinction coefficient ε280 = 30,470m−1 cm−1 and a subunit molecular weight of 44,534. Solutions of 0.8 mm l-cystathionine in 40 mm borate buffer at pH 7.8 and 9.4 were titrated against each other to build a pH profile. 985 μl of these buffers were mixed with 10 μl of 0.1m DTNB in ethanol and 5 μl of enzyme (6 mg/ml). The linear portion of the reaction time course was monitored at 30 °C for 60 s through the development of a 412-nm absorption. Subsequent kinetic analyses were performed at the determined optimum pH of 8.2 for the native enzyme preparation. Detailed kinetic analyses were only performed with CGL purified under native conditions. Time courses for the CGL reaction were monitored at 30 °C for 1 min using the above direct colorimetric assay with DTNB. The 1-ml reactions contained 985 μl of 40 mm borate buffer, pH 8.2, adjusted tol-cystathionine concentrations between 0.03 and 3.0 mm, 5 μl of CGL (6 mg/ml), and 10 μl of 0.1m DTNB in ethanol. After rapid mixing, the development of the 412-nm absorption was followed for 1 min. Kinetics were linear for this time and throughout this concentration range. Data were plotted in reciprocal form according to Eadie and Hofstee (29Eadie G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 146: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 30Hofstee B.H.J. Nature. 1959; 184: 1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) to extract values for K m and V max. To evaluate the substrate specificity of CGL, identical experiments were performed in which l-cystathionine was replaced byl-cystine or l-cysteine. l-Cysteine levels were also monitored in a discrete fashion as described below.l-Cystine conversion was followed by the above DTNB assay and another continuous examination employing lactate dehydrogenase to detect α-ketoacids produced in the reaction via oxidation of NADH (20Flavin M. Slaughter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2212-2219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). l-Cysteine was quantitated according to Gaitonde (31Gaitonde M.K. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). 80-μl samples were removed from CGL reactions (borate buffer with l-cystathionine and enzyme) and mixed with 30 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. 80 μl of the terminated reactions were mixed with equal amounts of acetic acid and ninhydrin reagent (250 mg of ninhydrin dissolved in 6 ml of acetic acid and 4 ml of hydrochloric acid), boiled for 10 min, and diluted with 1 ml of 95% ethanol. Development of the pink color was monitored at 560 nm. The amount of l-cysteine was calculated using the published molar extinction coefficient, ε560 = 2.6 × 104m−1 cm−1. A standard curve with known amounts of l-cysteine in reaction buffer, treated in the same way as the reactions, served to verify the linearity of the response in the relevant concentration range. References contained all buffer and reaction components with the exception of l-cysteine or l-cysteine-producing precursors. Under the given conditions, l-homocysteine,l-cystine, and l-methionine do not show a similar response (31Gaitonde M.K. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CGL by AVG was detected in 30-min time courses, monitored by the DTNB assay. Reaction buffers contained saturating amounts of l-cystathionine (2.5 mm) in 40 mm borate buffer, pH 8.2, and varying levels of inhibitor. The resulting progress curves were analyzed according to Cha (32Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 33Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), Morrison (34Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem.

Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of CGL by PG and F3Ala was studied by reacting 2.5 mm l-cystathionine in 40 mmborate buffer, pH 8.2, with set amounts of CGL, preincubated for given times at 37 °C with varying amounts of the inhibitors. Reactions were monitored for 60 s in the continuous DTNB assay. From the activity remaining at various times after incubation with set amounts of F3Ala, the half-times of inactivation (t 12) were determined. A Kitz-Wilson analysis (Ref.36Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; inverse inhibitor concentration against t 12) was used to extract the inhibition constant, K i, and the rate of inactivation, k inact. To analyze the inactivation by PG, normalized activities, remaining after given times of incubation, were plotted against the relative concentrations of PG and enzyme active sites. After 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction and restriction digestion, a single product of the expected size (1218 base pairs) was visible on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (Fig. 3 a). The cloned full-length CGL gene corresponded to one of the published sequences (19Lu Y. O'Dowd B.F. Orrega H. Israel Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previously, similar cloning strategies have met with a second product with an internal 132-base pair deletion compared with the rat liver CGL gene (19Lu Y. O'Dowd B.F. Orrega H. Israel Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We could not detect such a heterogeneity in the present RT assays. CGL shows homology throughout its entire length not only to CGL from other species but also to CGS and CBL (Fig. 2), two other enzymes of the transsulfuration pathways, and from the crystal structures of E. coli CBL (4Clausen T.

Two subunits called EC3A and EC3B were isolated from reduced and alkylated EC3 by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography.

Integrins are a family of cell surface proteins that mediate cell-cell interactions and the adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix proteins and other ligands. Integrins are heterodimeric structures composed of noncovalently bound α and β subunits (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). In humans there are at least 15 different α subunits and 8 different β subunits, and they can combine to form proteins with diverse ligand specificities and biological activities. The integrins play important roles in many diverse biological processes including platelet aggregation, tissue repair, angiogenesis, bone destruction, tumor invasion, and inflammatory and immune reactions. Integrin αIIbβ3 (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex) binds fibrinogen on the platelet surface and mediates platelet aggregation. Integrin αvβ3 is predominantly expressed on endothelial cells and plays an important role in angiogenesis. It is also expressed on osteoclasts and participates in bone destruction. Integrin α5β1 is widely distributed on a variety of cells; it plays a critical role in cell adhesion to extracellular matrix as well as in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development (3Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1996; 18: 402-412Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). All three integrins, αIIbβ3, αvβ3, and α5β1, recognize RGD sequence in the adhesive ligands (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). The α4 integrins α4β1 and α4β7 are widely expressed on leukocytes and lymphoid cells and play a major role in inflammation and autoimmune diseases (4Lobb R.R. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1722-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The α4β1 integrin (also called VLA-4, very late antigen-4) mediates cell adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), 1The abbreviations used are: VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; ep, ethylpyridylethylated; MadCAM-1, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1; VLA-4, very late antigen-4; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; CS-1, connecting segment 11The abbreviations used are: VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; ep, ethylpyridylethylated; MadCAM-1, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1; VLA-4, very late antigen-4; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; CS-1, connecting segment 1an adhesive molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that is expressed on endothelial cells at sites of inflammation. α4β1 also binds to alternatively spliced variants of fibronectin that contain connecting segment 1 (CS-1). The α4β7 integrin binds to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MadCAM-1) and to a lesser extent to VCAM-1 and CS-1. Interaction of these integrins with VCAM-1 or MadCAM-1 (which are up-regulated by cytokines) on endothelium mediates leukocyte infiltration, which can lead to tissue and organ destruction (4Lobb R.R. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1722-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Selectins and β2 integrins (expressed on neutrophils and monocytes) also contribute to this process. Leukocyte engagement via α4 integrins is believed to play a significant role in the progression of many diseases including insulin-dependent diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, arteriosclerosis, asthma, allergy, and re-stenosis of arteries after surgery and angioplasty (4Lobb R.R. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1722-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 5McMurray R.W. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 25: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Over the last decade a number of investigators have sought naturally occurring or synthetic peptides that may selectively inhibit integrin-ligand interactions. Research on disintegrins, low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, RGD-containing peptides isolated from viper venoms was stimulated by this long term objective. The first disintegrin described in the literature, trigramin, was identified and characterized on the basis of its ability to block platelet aggregation and inhibit fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 (6Huang T-F. Holt J.C. Lukasiewicz H. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16157-16163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently a number of laboratories have isolated several other RGD containing viper venom disintegrins of similar size, including kistrin (rhodostomin) (7Dennis M.S. Henzel W.J. Pitti R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Deisher T.A. Bunting S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2471-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), applagin (8Chao B.H. Jakubowski J.A.

Polokoff M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19827-19832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and eristostatin (12Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T-F. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 13McLane M.A. Kowalska M.A. Silver L. Shattil S. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), have been isolated from the venoms of Echis carinatus andEristocophis macmahoni, respectively. A number of NMR studies on kistrin, echistatin, and flavoridin showed that their RGD sequences are located in a mobile loop joining two strands of β sheet protruding from the protein core (reviewed in Ref. 14Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloczewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds around the RGD sequence in disintegrins maintain the hairpin loop conformation in each peptide, which is important for their potency and selectivity. It is known that disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains occur in larger venom proteins containing a metalloproteinase domain and that the RGD sequence in these proteins is substituted with other amino acids (15Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that viper venoms may contain low molecular weight disintegrins with anti-adhesive properties mediated by epitopes other than RGD. We fractionated E. carinatus venom on HPLC reverse-phase column, and we tested each fraction for its ability to bind to Jurkat cells, which express α4β1 and α5β1 integrins but do not express β3 integrins. We isolated and characterized a new protein, referred as EC3, that is selective and a highly potent inhibitor of α4 integrins and shows a low level of interaction with β3 integrins. EC3 is the member of a new protein family called heterodimeric disintegrins, which is first reported in this paper. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) HP2/1 (anti-α4 subunit of VLA-4) and SAM-1 (anti-α5 subunit of VLA-5) were purchased from Immunotech, Inc. (Westbrook, ME). HP2/4 (anti-α4 subunit of VLA-4) was a gift from Dr. F. Sanchez-Madrid (Madrid, Spain). Because the biological effects of HP2/1 and HP2/4 were identical, only data with HP2/1 are shown. Highly purified human fibrinogen was a gift from Dr. A. Budzynski (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA). Recombinant human VCAM-1 (16Renz H.H. Jones S. Fox J. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Fong S. J.

Human vitronectin and fibronectin were purchased from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). RGDS was purchased from Sigma. Echistatin was isolated from E. carinatus suchoreki venom as described previously (13McLane M.A. Kowalska M.A. Silver L. Shattil S. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for flow cytometry was purchased from Jackson Immune Research (West Grove, PA). A5 and VNRC3 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 integrins, respectively (17O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Du X. Glass A. Ruggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. M. Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). CHO cells with deleted α5 integrin (B2 cells) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Juliano (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). CHO cells transfected with human α4 or its G190A mutant (18Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and B2 cells transfected with human α4 (α4B2) were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Takada (Scripps Research Institute). JY cells expressing α4β7 were a gift from Dr. S. Burakoff (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston MA), and RPMI8866 cells were from Dr. A. Garcia-Padro, Madrid, Spain. K562 cells transfected with α6 and α2 integrin were gifts of Dr. A. Sonnenberg (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Holland) and M. E. Hemler (Dana Farber, Boston, MA), respectively. Jurkat cells, K562 cells, and nontransfected CHO K1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Lyophilized E. carinatus suchoreki venom obtained from Latoxan (Rosans, France) was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (30 mg/ml). The solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm to remove the insoluble proteins. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was applied to a C-18 HPLC column. The column was eluted with an acetonitrile linear gradient of 0–80% over 45 min. The venom was separated into 17 fractions. EC3 fraction, eluting at approximately 40% of acetonitrile, was collected, lyophilized, and then dissolved in water. This solution was re-injected into the same HPLC column. However, a “flatter” gradient of acetonitrile was applied (0–60% over 45 min). The main peak, which contained EC3, was collected and lyophilized. Purity of EC3 was tested by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The yield of EC3 was about 4 mg/1 g of crude venom. Reduction and alkylation of EC3 were performed according to procedures used before for trigramin (6Huang T-F. Holt J.C. Lukasiewicz H. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16157-16163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of EC3 was incubated in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 4 mmEDTA, 3.2 mm dithiothreitol together with 2 μl of 4-vinylpyridine for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. Modified subunits epEC3A and epEC3B were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC on a C-18 column with an acetonitrile gradient of 0–80% over 45 min. In some experiments, EC3 subunits were reduced and carboxymethylated with iodoacetate acid before HPLC separation. Determination of the molecular mass of native EC3 or reduced and alkylated EC3 subunits was done by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Sciex API-III triple quadrupole instrument. The sequences of native EC3 electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (19Madsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and residues 1–40 of epEC3A and epEC3B were determined by N-terminal sequence analysis using an Applied Biosystems Procise instrument. The primary structures of EC3A and EC3B were deduced from Edman degradation of overlapping peptides obtained by digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (2 mg/ml protein in 100 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, for 18 h at 37 °C using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w)) and CNBr (10 mg/ml protein and 100 mg/ml CNBr in 70% formic acid for 6 h under N2atmosphere and in the dark). Peptides were separated by reverse-phase of HPLC using a 0.4 × 25-cm Lichrospher RP100 C-18 (5-μm particle size) column (Merck) eluting at 1 ml/min with acetonitrile gradient. For determination of sulfhydryl groups (free cysteines), native EC3 (2 mg/ml in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride) was treated for 2 h at room temperature with a 100-fold molar excess of iodoacetamide, dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, and subjected to amino acid analysis (after sample hydrolysis with 6n HCl for 18 h at 110 °C) using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AlphaPlus amino acid analyzer. The peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy on a 430A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a 9050 Pepsynthesizer Plus (Perseptive Biosystems, Cambidge, MA), as described previously (20Satoh T. Aramini J.M. Li S. Friedman T.M. Gao J. Edling A. Townsend R. Koch U. Choksi S. Germann W. Korngold R. Huang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12175-12180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Adhesion of cultured cells labeled with 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate was performed as described previously (21Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ligands EC3, fibrinogen, vitronectin, fibronectin, or VCAM-1 were immobilized on 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon, Pittsburgh, PA) in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were labeled by incubation with 12.5 μm 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 15 min. Unbound label was removed by washing with the same buffer. Labeled cells (1 × 105/sample) were added to the well in the presence or absence of inhibitors and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Unbound cells were removed by washing the wells, and bound cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100. In parallel, a standard curve was prepared in the same plate using known concentrations of labeled cells. The plates were read using a Cytofluor 2350 fluorescence plate reader (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a 485-nm excitation filter and a 530-nm emission filter. Samples for flow cytometry analysis were prepared as described (22Marcinkiewicz C. Rosenthal L.A. Mosser D.M. Kunicki T.J. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. J. 1996; 371: 118-124Google Scholar) and analyzed in a Coulter Epics flow cytometer (Miami, FL). Direct binding assay alkaline phosphatase conjugated with VCAM-1Ig was performed using Jurkat (α4β1-expressing) and JY (α4β7-expressing) cells according to procedures described previously (23Lobb R.L. Antonetti G. Pepinsky R.B. Burkly L.C. Leone D.R. Whitty A. Cell Adhes . Commun. 1995; 3: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Analysis of the nonreduced EC3 band excised from the Immobilon-P membrane revealed a single amino acid sequence: NSVHPXXDPV(K/T)XEPREGEHXISGP. The complete amino acid sequences of EC3A and EC3B were determined by N-terminal sequence analysis of reverse phase HPLC-isolated peptides derived by degradation of each subunit with endoproteinase Lys-C and CNBr. Both EC3A and EC3B are cysteine-rich proteins of 67 amino acids. They display amino acid sequence heterogeneity at several positions, indicating the existence of isoforms. The isotope-averaged molecular masses calculated for the reduced EC3A isoforms (1–67: N33 I37 G64 E66), (1–67: R33, V37, G64, E66), and (1–66: N33, I37, D64, D66) are 7412 Da, 7440 Da, and 7341 Da, respectively, corresponding to major and minor ions of reduced EC3 mass spectrum. The major EC3A isoforms might be the one with molecular weight 7412, which yields a mass of 8478 after reduction and ethylpyridylethylation. On the other hand, reduced EC3B isoforms (1–67: T11, K40, S55), (1–67: K11. R40, T55), and (1–67: T11, R40, T55) have calculated masses of 7370 Da, 7439 Da, and 7412 Da, respectively. The major EC3B isoform, i.e. the one that would have a molecular mass of 7950 after reduction and carboxymethylation, is the 7370-Da isoform. The possibility of a number of dimers involving combinations of various EC3A and EC3B isoforms should be considered. However, we propose that EC3A-EC3B heterodimers may represent the major species because homodimers would not yield separated subunits displaying the distinct biological activities demonstrated for the HPLC-purified EC3A and EC3B fractions, and a mixture of EC3A and EC3B homodimers would display a more complex HPLC separation profile. EC3A and EC3B showed a high degree of sequence similarity to each other and to eristostatin, echistatin, flavoridin, and kistrin, including the alignment of conserved cysteines identified in each subunit. The EC3A amino acid sequence had high homology with the disintegrin domain of Le3, a metalloproteinase-disintegrin identified in Vipera lebetina (24Siigur E. Aaspollu A. Tu A.T. Siigur J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, neither EC3 subunit contained an RGD sequence. The hairpin loop sequence of echistatin, KRARGDDMDDY, was substituted in EC3A and EC3B with KRAVGDDVDDY and KRAMLDGLNDY, respectively (Fig. 1). The biological activities of EC3 and the RGD-containing disintegrin echistatin were compared in a panel of integrin assays (Table I). As expected, echistatin at concentrations of 20–130 nmpotently inhibited αIIbβ3-dependent platelet aggregation and αIIbβ3-, αvβ3-, and α5β1-dependent cell adhesion (Table I). In contrast, EC3 only weakly inhibited αIIbβ3-dependent interactions (IC50 = 1 μm for platelet aggregation and IC50 = 500 nm for A5 cell adhesion to fibrinogen) and showed no inhibition of αvβ3-dependent adhesion up to 10 μm, although inhibition of α5β1-dependent adhesion was observed at an IC50 of 150 nm (Table I). When the two disintegrins were evaluated in a panel of α4 integrin-mediated cell adhesion assays, the specificities were reversed. At concentrations of 25–100 nm, EC3 was a highly potent inhibitor of the interaction of both anchorage-dependent and -independent cells expressing α4β1 with either VCAM-1 or the CS-1 fragment of fibronectin, whereas echistatin showed no detectable activity at 10 μm (Table I). EC3 inhibited to the same extent adhesion of A2 (CHO α4+α5+) cells and α4B2 (CHO α4+α5−) cells to immobilized VCAM-1, confirming direct inhibition of binding to α4β1 integrin. To further extend the data on α4 integrins, the potency of EC3 in assays measuring VCAM-Ig binding directly to either α4β1 on Jurkat cells or α4β7 on JY cells was evaluated. EC3 potently inhibited α4β1 and α4β7 binding at concentrations of 28 nm and 6 nm, respectively. Moreover, adhesion of RPMI 8866 cells was inhibited by EC3 with IC50 = 17 nm, whereas echistatin was not inhibitory. Cell adhesion assays and direct binding assays yielded similar results. Neither echistatin nor EC3 inhibited adhesion of α6β1-transfected cells to laminin and adhesion of α2β1 cells to collagen (Table I). We also studied biological function of both disintegrins in direct binding assay, confirming the specificity of EC3 for α4β1 and α4β7 integrin.Table IComparison of the inhibitory effects of echistatin and EC3 on various integrinsCell suspensionIntegrinLigandAssayIC50EchistatinEC3nmPlateletsαIIbβ3FgADP PA1301000A5 (CHO αIIbβ3+)αIIbβ3FgCA50500VNRC3 (CHO αvβ3+)αvβ3VnCA50>104K562α5β1FnCA20150K562 (α6+)α6β1LmCA>104>104K562 (α2+)α2β1CollCA>104>104A2 (CHO α4+)α4β1VCAM-1CA>10430α4B2 (CHO α4+/α5−)α4β1VCAM-1CA>10430Jurkatα4β1VCAM-1CA>10425Jurkat*α4β1VCAM-1DBAND28Jurkat*α4β1CS-1CAND100JY*α4β7VCAM-1DBAND6RPMI8866α4β7MadCAMCA>10417The data represent the mean from three independent experiments.

We also evaluated the biological activity of the EC3A and EC3B subunits after reduction and ethylpyridylethylation. Although residual activity of both subunits was significant, it was decreased by approximately 200-fold. It has been previously reported that reduction and ethylpyridylethylation of flavoridin and albolabrin decreased their ability to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation by approximately 40-fold (25Calvete J.J. Schafer W. Soszka T. Lu W. Cook J.J. Jameson B. Niewiarowski S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5225-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). epEC3B inhibited adhesion of Jurkat cells to immobilized VCAM-1 (IC50 = 6 μm), whereas epEC3A was inactive in this system. However, epEC3A and epEC3B both inhibited adhesion of K562 cells to fibronectin (IC50 = 30 μm and 6 μm, respectively) (Fig.2). This experiment suggests that the specificity of EC3 for α4 integrins likely resides in the MLD sequence in the EC3B subunit, whereas the ability if EC3 to inhibit α5β1 likely resides in both subunits. Obviously, the MLDG sequence in EC3B is replacing the RGDX motif in monomeric disintegrins. Both RGDX and MLDG motifs appear to represent integrin binding sites. Fig. 3 shows that MLDG peptide inhibited adhesion of Jurkat cells to immobilized VCAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner approaching saturation at 5–10 mm. Adhesion of K562 cells to immobilized fibronectin showed a similar pattern of inhibition by RGDS. On the other hand RGDS did not cause any significant inhibition of Jurkat cell adhesion to immobilized VCAM-1. Inhibition of K562 to fibronectin by MLDG was only partial at 10 mm. It should be noted that the inhibitory effect on Jurkat cell adhesion to VCAM-1 was increased when longer MLDG-containing peptides were used. For instance CKRAMLDGLNDYC inhibited Jurkat cell adhesion with IC50 of 800 μm, whereas the peptide CRAMLDGLNDYCTGKSSD caused 50% inhibition at 50 μm (not shown).Figure 3Effect of MLDG and RGDS peptides on the adhesion of Jurkat cells to immobilized VCAM-1 (A) and on the K562 cells adhesion to immobilized fibronectin (B). The experiment was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The inhibitory effects of MLDG peptide (open circles) and RGDS peptide (closed circles) are shown. Error bars indicate S.D. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further experiments showed that EC3 competes with mAb HP2/1 for binding to α4 integrin. HP 2/1 at a concentration of 1 μg/sample blocked adhesion of Jurkat cells to immobilized EC3, whereas at the concentration of 1 mm, neither the hexapeptide GRGDSP nor a control peptide GRGESP had any effect (Fig.4 A). Competition between EC3 and HP2/1 was also confirmed using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Fig. 4 B shows EC3-mediated inhibition of HP2/1 binding to α4B2 (CHO α4+α5−) cells. The inactive G190A α4 mutant did not interact with EC3 (data not shown). In addition, the ability to directly inhibit binding to α5β1 was confirmed using mAb SAM-1, which blocked adhesion of K562 cells to immobilized EC3 (data not shown). The experimental data described in this paper identify a novel, heterodimeric disintegrin in the venom of E. carinatus. This disintegrin, named EC3, is a potent and relatively selective antagonist of α4 integrins, which inhibits their interaction with ligands in an RGD-independent manner. EC3 is composed of two covalently linked subunits A and B, which show a high degree of homology (including alignment of conserved cysteines) with other viper venom disintegrins. It is likely that the integrin binding sites of EC3 are located in two loops encompassing 13 amino acids (Cys-38 to Cys-50), corresponding to hairpin loops extending from Cys-20 to Cys-32 in echistatin and from Cys-45 to Cys-57 in kistrin and flavoridin. It is well known that the hairpin loops in disintegrins are maintained in appropriate conformation by S-S bridges (14Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloczewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 26Saudek V. Atkinson R.A. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7369-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and the same appears to be true regarding EC3. The biological activity of this protein is decreased by 2 orders of magnitude after reduction and alkylation (Fig.3). In contrast to all other viper venom disintegrins, EC3 contains neither RGD nor KGD sequences. In fact, the RGD motif is substituted with VGD in EC3A and with MLD in EC3B. The activity of EC3 with regard to inhibition of α5β1 binding resides on both subunits. However, only EC3B was active in the inhibition of α4β1/VCAM-1 interactions. This observation suggests, that MLD is the active sequence in EC3 mediating its anti-α4 effects. The experiment with synthetic peptides (Fig. 3) confirmed this expectation. MLDG linear peptide blocked adhesion of Jurkat cells to VCAM-1. In contrast, RGDS peptide, which is a very well known inhibitor of several β1 and β3 integrins (27D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 246-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), was not significantly active in this system. The MLDG peptide partially inhibits adhesion of α5β1-expressing cells to fibronectin (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the dual inhibitory effect of EC3 and of EC3B subunit containing MLDG (Fig. 2). The inhibitory effects of anti-α4 and anti-α5 inhibitory antibodies are in agreement with this suggestion. EC3 is a new naturally occurring ligand for α4 integrins. The LD motif from its B subunit is also present in other ligands of α4 integrins. An ILDV sequence was found in alternatively spliced connective segment I of fibronectin (28Wayne E.A. Garcia-Pardo A. Humpries M.J. McDonald J.A. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 29Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Garratt A.N. Clements J. Humpries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27224-27230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and KLDAPT is present in the fibronectin type III5 repeat (30Moyano J.V. Carnemolla B. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Garcia-Gila M. Albar J.P. Sanchez-Aparicio P. Leprini A. Querze G. Zardi L. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24832-24836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The LDT sequence occurring in MadCAM (31Briskin M.J. Rott L. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 719-726PubMed Google Scholar) appears to be important for its ability to bind to α4β7. Recently Tselepis et al. (32Tselepis V.H. Green L.J. Humpries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21341-21348Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) produced a number of mutants of recombinant kistrin and demonstrated that ILDV kistrin (kistrin in which PRGD sequence was substituted with ILDV) inhibited binding of the LDV-containing fibronectin fragment to immobilized α4β1, with an IC50 close to 0.1 μm. It is difficult to compare activities of EC3 with LDV-kistrin and synthetic peptides because preparations have been tested in different assay systems; however, in our hands LDV-kistrin was some 50-fold less active than EC3 in the direct binding assay. 2Lobb, R., Humpries, M., Tselpis, V., unpublished observation. Until now, no MLDG motif has been identified and functionally characterized. Most investigators have achieved better inhibitory effects for tested α4 inhibitors in the presence of Mn2+. However EC3 has almost the same activity in the presence or absence of Mn2+ (data not shown). Because EC3A, EC3B, kistrin, and flavoridin show identical alignment of cysteines (Fig. 1) and because the pattern of S-S bonds in kistrin and flavoridin is well established (26Saudek V. Atkinson R.A. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7369-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 33Senn H. Klaus W. J. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Adler M. Lazarus R.A. Dennis M.S. Wagner D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is possible to deduce a hypothetical structure of EC3. Assuming that both subunits of EC3 may have the S-S pattern of kistrin/flavoridin, we propose that Cys-7 and Cys-12 may be involved in two intermolecular bridges. The intramolecular disulfides are likely formed between Cys-6–Cys-29, Cys-20—Cys-26, Cys-25—Cys-50, and Cys-38—Cys-57. On the other hand, if one uses the S-S bonding pattern of albolabrin (25Calvete J.J. Schafer W. Soszka T. Lu W. Cook J.J. Jameson B. Niewiarowski S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5225-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), then Cys-6 and Cys-7 will form intermolecular bridges, and the intramolecular S-S bonds would correspond to Cys-12—Cys-26, Cys-20—Cys-50, Cys-25—Cys-29, and Cys-38—Cys-57. Clearly, further structural studies are needed to establish the S-S pattern of EC3. EC3 inhibits quite selectively adhesion of α4β1-expressing cells to immobilized VCAM-1. Its effect on α5β1 and on αIIbβ3 appears to be lower by 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively. The effect of EC3 on α4β1 does not appear to be related to the inhibition of α5β1 integrin, because this disintegrin inhibited to the same extent the adhesion to VCAM-1 of CHO cells transfected with α4 and of α5-deficient CHO cells transfected with α4. EC3 also inhibits adhesion of α4β7-expressing cells to MadCAM. Because mAb HP2/1 competes with EC3 for binding to α4, it appears that EC3 may bind to the N-terminal domain of α4, where the epitope of this antibody also resides (18Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2696-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It should be noted that EC3 weakly inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation and the binding of CHO cells transfected with αIIbβ3 to fibrinogen, although it had no significant effect on αvβ3-mediated adhesion. This is in agreement with other observations that the RGD motif in disintegrins is not absolutely required for expression of platelet aggregation inhibitory activity. For instance, Jia et al. (38Jia L-G. Wang X-M. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) expressed in insect cells the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain of atrolysin A from Crotalus atrox and demonstrated that the recombinant protein inhibited collagen and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. This recombinant protein contained RSEC instead of the RGD motif. Trikha et al. (39Trikha M. De Clerck Y.A. Markland F.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4993-4998PubMed Google Scholar) and Clark et al. (40Clark E.A. Trikha M. Markland F.S. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21940-21943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a homodimeric, RGD-containing protein, contortrostatin, from the venom of Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix. The amino acid sequences of this protein, which appears to be a disintegrin, have not been reported. As determined by mass spectrometry, molecular mass of nonreduced contortrostatin is 13,505 Da, and the molecular mass of reduced and pyridylethylated contortrostatin is 8,000 Da. This bivalent protein is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and in contrast to monomeric disintegrins, it induces tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins. In addition, contortrostatin is a potent inhibitor of β1 integrin-mediated melanoma cell adhesion in vitroand lung colonization in vivo. Most recently we isolated three other dimeric disintegrins, EMF10 from E. macmahoniand CC5 and CC8 from Cerastes cerastes venom, which all seem to be heterodimeric disintegrins with an molecular mass of 14–15 kDa. 3C. Marcinkiewicz, J. J. Calvete, M. M. Marcinkiewicz, M. Raida, S. Vijay-Kumar, R. R. Lobb, and S. Niewiarowski, unpublished data. We are in the process of determining the amino acid sequences and function of these novel disintegrins. Further studies are required to establish how the bivalent structure of dimeric disintegrins affects the biological properties of the individual subunits. In conclusion, we describe a novel dimeric disintegrin, EC3, that is a potent inhibitor of α4 integrin binding to VCAM-1 and moderately inhibits α5β1 integrins. We propose that the activity of EC3 is associated with the MLDG sequence in the putative hairpin loop of this disintegrin. We thank Dr. M. Renz for the generous gift of recombinant VCAM-1, Dr. Y. Takada for providing CHO cells transfected with α4 integrin and its mutants, Drs. M. Ginsberg and J. Loftus for cells transfected with αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 integrins, Dr. L.

https://openalex.org/W2116084742,"Platelet factor 4 (PF-4) is a platelet-derived α-chemokine that binds to and activates human neutrophils to undergo specific functions like exocytosis or adhesion. PF-4 binding has been shown to be independent of interleukin-8 receptors and could be inhibited by soluble chondroitin sulfate type glycosaminoglycans or by pretreatment of cells with chondroitinase ABC. Here we present evidence that surface-expressed neutrophil glycosaminoglycans are of chondroitin sulfate type and that this species binds to the tetrameric form of PF-4. The glycosaminoglycans consist of a single type of chain with an average molecular mass of ∼23 kDa and are composed of ∼85–90% chondroitin 4-sulfate disaccharide units type CSA (→4GlcAβ1→3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)β1→) and of ∼10–15% di-O-sulfated disaccharide units. A major part of these di-O-sulfated disaccharide units are CSE units (→4GlcAβ1→3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate)β1→). Binding studies revealed that the interaction of chondroitin sulfate with PF-4 required at least 20 monosaccharide units for significant binding. The di-O-sulfated disaccharide units in neutrophil glycosaminoglycans clearly promoted the affinity to PF-4, which showed a K d ∼ 0.8 μm, as the affinities of bovine cartilage chondroitin sulfate A, porcine skin dermatan sulfate, or bovine cartilage chondroitin sulfate C, all consisting exclusively of monosulfated disaccharide units, were found to be 3–5-fold lower. Taken together, our data indicate that chondroitin sulfate chains function as physiologically relevant binding sites for PF-4 on neutrophils and that the affinity of these chains for PF-4 is controlled by their degree of sulfation.

Several members of the α-chemokine family like interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating peptide 2, or melanoma growth stimulatory activity have been shown to act as potent activators of PMN by binding to common IL-8 receptors (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). Such binding elicits diverse biological responses such as chemotaxis, degranulation, or adhesion. PF-4, another member of the α-subgroup of the chemokine family, is released in high concentrations from activated platelets (2Files J.C. Malpass T.W. Yee E.K. Ritchie J.L. Harker L.A. Blood. 1981; 58: 607-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,3McLaren K.M. Holloway I. Pepper D.S. Thromb. Res. 1982; 19: 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The functional role of PF-4 is intriguing. Highly purified PF-4 lacks any apparent biological activity for PMN but will in the presence of tumor necrosis factor α stimulate these cells to exocytose secondary granule markers or adhere tightly to different surfaces (4Petersen F. Ludwig A. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1954-1962PubMed Google Scholar). These PF-4-induced functions are not elicited through binding to IL-8 receptors but by interaction with distinct binding sites different from all other chemokine receptors known so far (4Petersen F. Ludwig A. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1954-1962PubMed Google Scholar, 5Petersen F. Bock L. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4347-4355PubMed Google Scholar). The action of PF-4 on PMN was shown to be sensitive to chondroitinase ABC treatment and could be inhibited by soluble chondroitin sulfate (CS), indicating that the potential receptor is of CS proteoglycan type (5Petersen F. Bock L. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4347-4355PubMed Google Scholar). CSs are galactosaminoglycans composed of alternating glucuronic acid and galactosamine units (→4GlcAβ1→3GalNAcβ1→)n that areO-sulfated on one or both units. 2The nomenclature to define the various CS species is based on the notion that all variants contain a significant proportion of →4GlcAβ1→3GalNAc(4-OSO3)β1→ disaccharide units. Although CSA contains no additional sulfated disaccharide unit, the other CS species do; the characteristic units are: →4IdoAα1→3GalNAc(4-OSO3)β1→ (additional sulfated substituents may occur) for CSB, →4GlcAβ1→3GalNAc(6-OSO3)β1→ for CSC, →4GlcA(2-OSO3)β1→3GalNAc(6-OSO3)β1→ for CSD, and →4GlcAβ1→3GalNAc(4,6-OSO3)β1→ for CSE. In contrast to the glucosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate (HS), they do not contain N-sulfate groups or l-iduronic acid units (except for CSB), which have been particularly implicated in protein binding to HS chains (6Casu B. Petitou M. Provasoli M. Sinay P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 221-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The expression of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on neutrophils has been described previously by several authors. Pioneering work by Olsson and co-workers showed that PMN predominantly express chondroitin 4-sulfate (CSA) (7Olsson I. Gardell S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 141: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Olsson I. Gardell S. Thunell S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 165: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and Levitt et al. demonstrated a minor proportion of HS in these cells (9Levitt D. Porter R. Wagner-Weiner L. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, as all of these analyses were done with total cell extracts, little is known about the composition and function of cell surface-expressed GAGs in PMN. Gardiner and colleagues showed that the majority of metabolically 35S-labeled compounds occurs as proteoglycans in neutrophil granules where they may enable proper storage of granule contents or exert protective functions against cellular damage (10Gardiner E.E.

Here, we provide evidence that surface exposed CS chains serve as physiologically relevant receptors for PF-4 on PMN, and propose that this function is critically dependent on the content of sulfate groups.

PF-4 was iodinated using the chloramine-T method as described for IL-8 (17Petersen F. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2467-2478PubMed Google Scholar). To control the integrity of the labeled chemokine, iodinated PF-4 was tested for its capacity to induce an exocytosis response in PMN (4Petersen F. Ludwig A. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1954-1962PubMed Google Scholar), its ability to form tetramers (5Petersen F. Bock L. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4347-4355PubMed Google Scholar), and its capacity to bind to different GAGs (filter binding assay, see below). No differences to unlabeled PF-4 were seen in these assays. Specific receptor binding of 1 μm [125I]PF-4 to PMN was determined as reported previously (5Petersen F. Bock L. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4347-4355PubMed Google Scholar).

CSA fragments resulting from a hydrazinolysis for 4 h were separated on a BioGel P-10 column (1 cm × 140 cm) equilibrated with 0.5 m NH4HCO3. Pools of size-defined fragments were collected by reference to standard heparin fragments. PMN cells were routinely isolated from citrated whole blood or fresh buffy coats of healthy single donors by gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque to a purity consistently greater than 95% as described previously (21Brandt E. Van Damme J. Flad H.-D. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Viability was examined by trypan blue exclusion and exceeded 98% in all experiments. Metabolic labeling was performed as described by Gardiner et al. (10Gardiner E.E. Robinson H.C. Sriratana A. Mok S.S. Lowther D.A. Handley C.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, PMN cells were washed twice with PBS and subsequently incubated at a concentration of 107 cells/ml in sulfate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, and 100 μCi/ml Na235SO4 or 10 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine for 5 h at 37 °C in humidified air. Cells were washed three times with an excess of PBS, and cell clumps were removed by digestion of cells with 100 μg/ml DNase I in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm MnCl2, pH 7.5, for 45 min at 37 °C under gentle agitation. Neutrophil surface-GAGs were proteolytically released from the cell surface by digestion with protease type XIV. Cells were suspended to 5 × 107 cells in 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2 and incubated with 500 μg of enzyme at 37 °C under agitation. After 18 h of incubation, the same amount of enzyme was added a second time and the incubation was continued for another 18 h. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation (16.000 × g, for 20 min at 4 °C), and proteolytic activity in the supernatant was heat-inactivated at 98 °C for 20 min. GAGs were isolated from the supernatant by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (1 × 10 cm), equilibrated with 0.2 mNH4HCO3. After removal of contaminants by washing with 0.3 m NaCl and re-equilibration of the column with 0.2 m NH4HCO3, GAGs were eluted with 2 m NH4HCO3 and subsequently lyophilized. GAGs were quantified by colorimetric determination of hexuronic acid using themeta-hydroxydiphenyl method (22Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) with purified CSA as a standard. Depending on the respective donor, about 14–16 μg of GAGs/108 cells could be isolated with a specific35S-radioactivity of ∼3 × 104 dpm/μg of GAG. To examine a possible contamination of surface GAGs with granule-derived material, the integrity of primary and secondary granules was monitored. Therefore, freshly isolated PMN as well as PMN incubated for 36 h in the presence or absence of protease type XIV were lysed with detergent and contents of the azurophilic granule marker elastase as well as the specific granule marker lactoferrin were determined as described elsewhere (17Petersen F. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2467-2478PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these markers were assayed also in the supernatant of PMN after 36 h of incubation in the absence of protease. Size determination of intact 35S-labeled GAG chains was performed by analytical gel filtration on a Superose 6 column, equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and calibrated with heparin fragments of defined size (4-mer ∼ 1.3 kDa, 10-mer ∼ 3.3 kDa, 20-mer ∼ 6.6 kDa, and 26-mer ∼ 8.6 kDa) as well as with hyaluronan-fragments (11.9, 18.9, 30, and 43 kDa). The nature of neutrophil GAGs was deduced from the susceptibility to deaminative cleavage and to digestion with chondroitinases as examined by gel chromatography on Superose 12. Deamination with nitrous acid was carried out at pH 1.5 according to the method of Shively and Conrad (23Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), which results in degradation of HS to oligosaccharides. Digestions with chondroitinase ABC or AC were performed with 0.1 unit/ml of the respective enzyme in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1% BSA for 16 h at 37 °C. About 1–2 × 104dpm (∼0.5 μg) 35S-labeled PMN-GAGs were used in all incubations in a 200-μl final volume. 35S-Labeled neutrophil GAGs (2 × 105 dpm; ∼6.6 μg), were digested with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 unit/ml) in 200 μl of chondroitinase buffer for 16 h at 37 °C, and the resulting disaccharides were purified on a Sephadex G-15 column (1 cm × 170 cm) equilibrated with 0.2 mNH4HCO3. The samples were freeze-dried and dissolved in water before analysis. PMN-derived GAGs were quantitatively converted into disaccharides, <5% of the degradation products being tetrasaccharides. Disaccharides were separated further with regard to charge by preparative high voltage electrophoresis on Whatman 3MM paper in 1.6 m formic acid (pH 1.7; 40 V/cm) for 80 min (24Bourin M.-C. Akerlund-Lundgren E. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 265: 15424-15431Google Scholar, 25Lidholt K. Eriksson I. Kjellén L. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and labeled fractions were recovered by elution with water. Monosulfated disaccharides (ΔDi-S) were subsequently analyzed by paper chromatography as described (25Lidholt K. Eriksson I. Kjellén L. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For analysis of the disulfated disaccharides (ΔDi-diS), the glycosidic linkage between the unsaturated hexuronic acid residue and the galactosamine residue was cleaved by treatment with 10 mm mercuric acetate as described (26Ludwigs U. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meezan E. Roden L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and followed by separation of the products by high voltage electrophoresis. Papers from high voltage electrophoresis and chromatography were dried, cut into 1-cm segments, and extracted with water, and the radioactivity was determined by β-scintillation counting. 35S-Labeled neutrophil GAGs (∼ 0.5 μg) were preincubated with increasing concentrations of PF-4 for 20 min at room temperature in 200 μl of chondroitinase buffer and were then digested with 0.1 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC for 16 h at 37 °C as described above. Proteins and GAG chains were dissociated by heating samples at 96 °C for 10 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the products were separated on a Superose 12 column. Approximately 0.2 μg of radiolabeled intact GAGs or size-defined fragments were incubated with PF-4 at the indicated concentrations in 200 μl of PBS, 0.1% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Unbound GAG was removed by filtration through a nitrocellulose filter, while protein-bound GAG was trapped on the filter surface (16Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The protein-bound GAG was dissociated from the membrane-trapped proteins in 2 m NaCl and analyzed for radioactivity in a β-scintillation counter. In some assays, binding affinities of PF-4 for different GAGs were assessed by transformation of the data according to Scatchard. As the molar amounts of PF-4 even at the lowest dosages used in the assay exceeded those of the GAGs by at least 5-fold, the amount of free PF-4 was set to total PF-4. In previous experiments we had shown that PMN proteoglycans responsible for PF-4 binding were rather resistant toward proteolytic digestion by trypsin or chymotrypsin (5Petersen F. Bock L. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4347-4355PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, a more unspecific protease (Streptomyces protease type XIV) was used for the digestion of neutrophils. In a first approach, experiments were designed to explore the time course for the elimination of PF-4 binding sites. A constant concentration of 500 μg/ml protease was used and the residual capacity for binding of iodinated PF-4 was monitored at different time-points as described (5Petersen F. Bock L. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4347-4355PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of 1 μm[125I]PF-4 to PMN at 4 °C decreased over time with 20% residual binding remaining after 10 h, and 5% residual binding after 18 h of incubation (data not shown). Therefore, the incubation time for proteolytic digestion of neutrophil PGs was extended to 36 h, when PF-4 binding was decreased to background levels. Under these conditions, about 40–50% of the total metabolically 35S-labeled material could be mobilized, while 50–60% remained cell-associated. No difference in the enzymatic activity of the primary granule marker elastase or content of the secondary granule marker lactoferrin (both determined in detergent-treated lysates) was seen between non-treated and protease-treated cells after 36 h. Furthermore, no marker protein was found in the cell-free supernatant (data not shown), indicating that neither primary nor secondary granules had leaked. These results support the notion that the integrity of granules after the proteolytic treatment was conserved such that the remaining 35S-labeled material presumably would be located in neutrophil granules (10Gardiner E.E. Robinson H.C. Sriratana A. Mok S.S. Lowther D.A. Handley C.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,11Gardiner E.E. Mok S.S. Sriratana A. Robinson H.C. Veitch B.J.A. Lowther D.A. Handley C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The released 35S-labeled surface GAGs were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography, after which the molecular size was determined by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column. PMN-GAGs eluted as a single broad peak representing molecules of a wide range of molecular sizes with an average of ∼23 kDa (Fig.1). This value corresponds to a GAG chain length of about 90 monosaccharide units (calculated with an average mass of 500 Da for a disaccharide unit), similar in size to a bovine nasal cartilage CSA preparation used as a standard. In order to characterize the GAG chains, the metabolically labeled PMN-GAGs were treated with either nitrous acid at pH 1.5 or with chondroitinase ABC and AC, respectively, followed by gel chromatography of the products. Nitrous acid treatment at pH 1.5 did not affect the elution behavior of the sample, indicating the absence of N-sulfated hexosamine residues as found in HS (Fig.2 A). In contrast, digestion with either chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 2 B) or chondroitinase AC (Fig. 2 C) resulted in the quantitative conversion of the chains into small saccharides. From these data, we conclude that neutrophil surface GAGs consist predominantly of CS and lack detectable amounts of HS or CSB.Figure 2Susceptibility of neutrophil GAGs to deamination by nitrous acid and to chondroitinase digestion.PMN-GAGs (15,000 dpm ∼ 0.5 μg) were treated with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (A) or digested with 0.1 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC (B) or chondroitinase AC (C) as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Digestion products (·○·) or untreated controls (-●-) were separated on a Superose 12 column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For compositional analysis, the surface PMN-GAGs were extensively digested with chondroitinase ABC and the resulting fragments separated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-15 column. More than 90% of the labeled material eluted as disaccharides which were further separated by high voltage paper electrophoresis in order to characterize their sulfation degree. The migration profile of the disaccharides revealed two peaks (Fig. 3 A). The major peak (P I) with approximately 74% of the total radioactivity comigrated with a monosulfated disaccharide (ΔDi-S) standard, while about 26% of the radioactivity appeared with the disulfated disaccharide (ΔDi-diS) fraction. As the radioactivity of this second peak (P II) represents two [35S]sulfate groups per disaccharide molecule, the molar proportion of ΔDi-diS corresponds to half of the amount of 35S-label in this fraction. The molar ratio of mono- to disulfated disaccharide units thus was calculated to 85:15. The occurrence of disulfated disaccharide units in neutrophil surface CS appeared to be a general phenomenon as the analysis of disaccharides from two other donors revealed similar disulfated disaccharide contents of 12 and 13% with minor variations between individuals (data not shown). Also, [3H]glucosamine labeling was performed to assess the amount of non-sulfated disaccharide units in the whole population. No non-sulfated disaccharides could be detected by chondroitinase ABC digestion of these preparations followed by high voltage electrophoresis, indicating that the chains are composed essentially of sulfated disaccharide units (data not shown). 3Metabolic labeling of PMN-GAGs with [3H]glucosamine is hampered by the short metabolical labeling period possible and by the reduced metabolic turnover of these terminally differentiated cells. A general use of this labeling procedure for analytical purposes is therefore practically unfeasible. Paper chromatography of the monosulfated disaccharide fraction P I showed a single peak corresponding to the standard ΔDi-4S disaccharide (Fig. 3 B), whereas no material co-migrating with the ΔDi-6S standard was seen. In order to assign the sulfation pattern of the disulfated disaccharide in fraction P II, the disaccharides were treated with mercuric acetate (26Ludwigs U. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meezan E. Roden L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the resulting products were separated by high voltage electrophoresis. About 85% of the labeled material displayed an increased migration after Hg-acetate cleavage as compared with the untreated control (Fig. 3 C). This peak corresponds to the disulfated monosaccharide GalNAc(4,6-OSO3), originating from the disaccharide ΔHexA1→3GalNAc(4,6-OSO3) (ΔDi-diSE). The remaining 15% of the generated monosaccharides migrated slower than the original disaccharide and correspond to a monosulfated monosaccharide, originating from either ΔHexA(2-OSO3)1→3GalNAc(4-OSO3) (ΔDi-diSB) or ΔHexA(2-OSO3)1→3GalNAc(6-OSO3) (ΔDi-diSD). In summary, the neutrophil surface GAGs contain predominantly (up to 90%) chondroitin-4-sulfate disaccharide sequences, while 12–15% of the chains consists of disulfated disaccharide units, mainly due to the presence of GalNAc-4,6-disulfate residues. In order to characterize the putative PF-4 binding sites on the CS chains, enzyme protection assays were performed. Purified 35S-labeled PMN-CS was preincubated with increasing concentrations of PF-4 and subsequently digested with chondroitinase ABC. At a concentration of 10 μm PF-4, more than 95% of the PMN CS-chains were protected against digestion with the bacterial eliminase (Fig.4). However, a stepwise decrease of the PF-4 concentration led to a corresponding decrease in the amount of protected polysaccharide: at 1 μm PF-4 59% and at 0.2 μm only 13% of the total radioactivity remained in the high molecular weight fraction. At 0.04 μm PF-4, protection of the CS chains was completely abrogated and all of the labeled carbohydrates eluted in a second peak, representing the breakdown products. Therefore, at sufficiently high concentrations PF-4 can bind to and protect all PMN-derived CS. Corresponding control experiments performed with the bovine [3H]CSA revealed a similar PF-4-mediated protection of these chains against digestion with chondroitinase ABC. However, compared with the PMN-GAGs, the concentration of PF-4 required for complete protection was significantly higher (20 μm) indicating a lower affinity of the chemokine for the bovine CSA. Notably, decreasing the concentrations of PF-4 led to a reduction in the total amounts of protected CS chains but did not affect the size of these chains (Fig.4). Thus, binding of PF-4 to the polysaccharide protected the entire chains from digestion but did not reveal any limited fragment that could be identified as a binding site for the chemokine. As PF-4 appeared to protect the entire neutrophil CS chain from lyase digestion, our next approach was to identify the minimal fragment size for PF-4 binding. Binding of size-defined, 3H-labeled CSA fragments to PF-4 was examined using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (16Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PF-4 (5 μm) was incubated with constant quantities of CSA fragments of various chain lengths, and protein-GAG complexes were retained by passing the solution through a nitrocellulose filter. As shown in Fig. 5 A, interaction of PF-4 with CSA-fragments did not exceed background levels (∼ 2.5% bound oligomer) until a fragment length of ∼ 8 monosaccharide units (12.8% bound oligomer). Binding further increased with increasi"

Here we demonstrate that althoughEscherichia coli DNA helicase II (UvrD) is capable of dimerization as evidenced by a positive interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system, gel filtration chromatography, and equilibrium sedimentation ultracentrifugation (K d = 3.4 μm), the protein is active in vivo andin vitro as a monomer. A mutant lacking the C-terminal 40 amino acids (UvrDΔ40C) failed to dimerize and yet was as active as the wild-type protein in ATP hydrolysis and helicase assays. In addition, the uvrDΔ40C allele fully complemented the loss of helicase II in both methyl-directed mismatch repair and excision repair of pyrimidine dimers. Biochemical inhibition experiments using wild-type UvrD and inactive UvrD point mutants provided further evidence for a functional monomer.

This investigation provides the first direct demonstration of an active monomeric helicase, and a model for DNA unwinding by a monomer is presented. The first DNA helicase was identified and characterized more than 20 years ago (1Abdel-Monem M. Durwald H. Hoffmann-Berling H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Abdel-Monem M. Hoffmann-Berling H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since then, the biochemical properties and biological functions of many helicases have been firmly established (3Matson S.W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 289-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Matson S.W. George J.W. Bean D.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), and new helicases are continually being discovered and characterized from prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral systems. Despite the great attention helicases have received in recent years due to their fundamental importance in DNA and RNA metabolism, many details of the mechanism(s) by which helicases couple the energy derived from nucleoside 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis to the separation of the two strands of duplex nucleic acids are still not known. Several models for helicase-catalyzed unwinding have been proposed (reviewed in Ref. 5Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). A common feature of these models is the existence of multiple DNA- or RNA-binding sites within the active enzyme. Multiple binding sites are believed to be essential for processive translocation of the helicase along the nucleic acid. This requirement is thought to be satisfied by an oligomeric enzyme, and in general, helicases have been divided into two oligomeric categories: dimers and hexamers. Whereas the assembly state of several hexameric helicases has been described in detail (6Reha-Krantz L.J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

A model for processive DNA unwinding catalyzed by the Rep helicase has been proposed in which the two subunits of the active dimeric enzyme alternate binding to the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; 2-AP, 2-aminopurine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; ATP, adenosine nucleoside 5′ triphosphate; bp, base pairregion at an unwinding fork to catalyze ATP hydrolysis-dependent strand separation (15Wong I. Lohman T.M. Science. 1992; 256: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this rolling model, cycling of the two subunits through a duplex region during processive unwinding is driven by changes in single-stranded (ssDNA) and dsDNA binding affinities. These changes in affinity are allosterically regulated by the state of nucleotide binding of each subunit (recently reviewed in Ref. 5Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). DNA helicase II (UvrD), which shares approximately 40% amino acid sequence identity with Rep, performs a variety of functions in E. coli including essential roles in methyl-directed mismatch repair (16Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and nucleotide excision repair (17Caron P.R. Kushner S.R. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Husain I. Van-Houten B. Thomas D.C. Abdel-Monem M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6774-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In a previous report, UvrD was shown to form dimers and higher order oligomers in solution, and dimerization was stimulated in the presence of ssDNA (19Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that UvrD functions as a dimer and may employ an unwinding mechanism similar to that proposed for Rep (5Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 20Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This suggestion is based on (i) the extensive sequence similarity between Rep and UvrD, (ii) the abundance of data suggesting dimerization is required for activity of the E. coli Rep helicase, (iii) the observation that UvrD forms dimers and higher order oligomers in solution, and (iv) current models for helicase-catalyzed DNA unwinding mechanisms in which the requirement for multiple DNA-binding sites is generally satisfied by multiple subunits in an active enzyme. However, there is currently no direct evidence to indicate that UvrD is functional as a dimer or to favor a rolling model for UvrD-catalyzed unwinding. During the course of a yeast two-hybrid screen of an E. coligenomic library using the uvrD gene as bait, we found that UvrD interacts with itself in support of the notion of dimerization. However, a UvrD mutant was constructed that failed to dimerize yet functioned in two DNA repair pathways in vivo and was active as a ssDNA-stimulated ATPase and a helicase in vitro. This result prompted a thorough biophysical and biochemical analysis of the oligomeric state of UvrD. We conclude that UvrD is active as a monomer, and unwinding mechanisms based on a monomeric helicase are discussed. E. coli BL21(DE3) (F− ompT [lon]hsdSBrB-mB- gal dcm λDE3) was from Novagen, Inc. BL21(DE3)ΔuvrD and JH137ΔuvrD were constructed previously in this laboratory (21George J.W. Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). JH137 (K91 din D1:: MudI (Apr lac)) was obtained from P. Model. Plasmids pET-9d, pET-11d, and pLysS were from Novagen, Inc. M13mp7 ssDNA was prepared as described (22Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of plasmids that express UvrD and the various UvrD mutants have been described previously (21George J.W. Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J.

To construct a plasmid that expressed UvrDΔ40C, pET11d-UvrD was digested to completion withBsiW1. The 5′ extension was filled in using DNA polymerase I (large fragment) and dNTPs, and the plasmid was ligated with T4 DNA ligase. This caused a +1 frameshift at codon 676, changing 5′-GTACGCCACGCTAAGTTT-3′ (Val-Arg-His-Ala-Lys-Phe) to 5′-GTACGTACGCCACGCTAA-3′ (Val-Arg-Thr-Pro-Arg-TER). TheuvrDΔ40C mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Oligonucleotide (dT)16 was from The Midland Certified Reagent Co. The 2-aminopurine (2-AP)-substituted oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys. All nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All enzymes used for cloning and PCR were from New England Biolabs, with the exception of T4 DNA ligase, which was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Thyroglobulin, catalase, rabbit muscle aldolase, and cytochrome c were from Sigma. Human transferrin was from Calbiochem. UvrD and UvrDΔ40C were overexpressed prior to purification by growing either a 10-liter culture of BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells containing pET11d-UvrD (21George J.W. Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or BL21(DE3)ΔuvrD/pLysS cells containing pET11d-UvrDΔ40C to an optical density (600 nm) of 1.0 at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth was continued for an additional 4 h. Purification of wild-type helicase II was performed according to a previously published procedure (19Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). UvrDΔ40C was purified using the same procedure with one modification. UvrDΔ40C was loaded onto an ssDNA-cellulose column (5.8 mg ssDNA/g of cellulose) at 0.1 m NaCl in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 25 °C), 20% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol) instead of Buffer A + 0.2 m NaCl. The column was washed using Buffer A + 0.2 m NaCl and eluted using Buffer A + 1 m NaCl. Plasmids and strains for the yeast two-hybrid system were from CLONTECH. An E. coli genomic library was constructed previously in pGAD424 (25Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The library was screened for UvrD-interacting proteins as described (25Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid was pGBT9-UvrD. Vent DNA polymerase was used to amplify the uvrD gene by PCR using pET9d-UvrD as target. Amplified uvrD was cloned into the SmaI site of pGAD424 and pGBT9 to create in-frame translational fusions with theGAL4 transcriptional activation domain and DNA binding domain, respectively. These constructs were designated pGAD424-UvrD and pGBT9-UvrD. Deletions from the N and C termini of UvrD were generated using convenient restriction enzyme sites within the uvrD gene. The restriction enzymes XmnI, AvaII, andBstBI were used to generate the N-terminal deletionsuvrDΔ276N, uvrDΔ309N, and uvrDΔ383N,respectively. The uvrD PCR product described in the preceding paragraph was digested individually with each of these enzymes, and the appropriate fragment was purified and ligated into theSmaI site of pGAD424 to generate a fusion with theGAL4 activation domain. Blunt ends were generated by a DNA polymerase I (large fragment)-catalyzed fill-in reaction where necessary. All clones produced in-frame translational fusions and were confirmed by sequence analysis. pGAD424-UvrDΔ40C was generated by digestion of pGAD424-UvrD with BsiWI and BglII, gel purification, fill-in of the 5′-overhanging ends with DNA polymerase I (large fragment), and re-ligation of the blunt ends. Two-hybrid interactions were characterized using the lacZreporter gene in strain SFY526 or the HIS3 reporter gene in strain HF7c. In HF7c, interactions were identified by growth on media lacking histidine. Assays for β-galactosidase activity encoded by thelacZ gene in SFY526 were performed using the substrateo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as described by the supplier (CLONTECH), and quantified as Miller units (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments were done using a Beckman XL-A centrifuge and an An-60ti rotor at 20 °C. Protein was prepared for these experiments by extensive dialysis into the appropriate buffer. For sedimentation equilibrium experiments the buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 25 °C), 0.2 m NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. For velocity sedimentation experiments the buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Solvent densities (ρ) were measured using a Mettler DA-110 mdensity meter. The partial specific volume for UvrD and UvrDΔ40C was calculated to be ν = 0.729 at 20 °C using SEDNTERP (27Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.O. Hatan J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in 6-channel (1.2 cm path) charcoal-epon centrifuge cells (Beckman). The equilibrium experiment was performed using three different concentrations of UvrD (1.1, 2.1, and 3.8 μm) and UvrDΔ40C (2.8, 5.0, and 8.4 μm). Protein concentrations were determined from absorbances collected during the low speed scans in the ultracentrifuge. Scans at 280 nm were recorded every 2 h. After 30 h the cell was judged to be at equilibrium. This was confirmed by subtracting successive plots and examining residuals for the absence of any systematic patterns. For UvrD the speeds used were 5,000, 7,500, and 10,000 rpm, and for UvrDΔ40C the speeds were 7,200, 8,600, and 12,600 rpm. All concentrations of UvrDΔ40C reached equilibrium within the 30-h period for each speed. Three of the data sets obtained with the wild-type protein did not reach equilibrium during the course of the experiment (1.1 μm at 5,000 rpm, 2.1 μmat 5,000 rpm, and 3.8 μm at 10,000 rpm) and were not considered in the analysis. Several models were fit to data from equilibrium centrifugation experiments using NONLIN (28Johnson M.L. Correia J.L. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Separate concentrations and different speeds were analyzed individually, in groups, and globally. The models primarily considered were single ideal species and ideal monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium. In addition, other models were examined including non-ideality, monomer ↔ trimer and monomer ↔ tetramer. Molecular masses were calculated based on the values for ς (reduced molecular mass) (see Equation 1) according to methods described (28Johnson M.L. Correia J.L. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar).ς=M(1−νρ)ω2RTEquation 1 M is the molecular weight; R is the gas constant; T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin; ν is the partial specific volume (ml/g) of the protein; ω is the angular velocity of the rotor (radians/s), and ρ is the measured density of the buffer (g/ml). K d values were calculated using Equation 2 for the model of monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium (see Equation3).C(r)=δ+C1,0e(ς1ξ)+C1,02e(lnK2+2ς1ξ)Equation 2 ξ=(r2−r02)/2Equation 3 C(r) is the total protein concentration (mg/ml) at the radius (r); δ is the base-line offset used to compensate for absorbance measurements of 0 not being precisely equal to 0 protein concentration; C 1,0 is the monomer concentration at the reference distance (r 0); and K 2 is the association constant for monomer ↔ dimer model (28Johnson M.L.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reference distance, or reference radial position, is chosen in data analysis and is usually near the meniscus in the cell. ς1is the reduced molecular weight for the monomer. Velocity experiments were performed with 350-μl samples in two-channel charcoal epon centerpieces (1.2 cm path) (Beckman). The rotor speed was 50,000 rpm. Initial protein concentrations were approximately 7.5 μm. Experimental samples analyzed in the presence of nucleotide contained 0.2 mm AMP-PNP. For reactions containing ssDNA, the DNA molecule used was a (dT)16 oligonucleotide containing the modified base 2-aminopurine (AP). The two ssDNA substrates were either 5′-TTTTT(AP)TTTT(AP)TTTTT-3′ or 5′-TTT(AP)TT(AP)TT(AP)TT(AP)TTT-3′. The molar ratio of protein to DNA was 1:1.25. Data obtained from sedimentation velocity experiments in the absence of DNA (protein alone or protein with nucleotide) were collected at either 285 or 290 nm. In the presence of DNA, sedimentation was monitored at 315 nm to detect only the modified (dT)16 molecule. Scans were recorded at 1-min intervals in a continuous mode. Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed using the program Svedberg (30Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficients (s*) were determined by fitting the modified Fujita-MacCoshman equation for a single species and two species to the data (31Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For experiments containing DNA, the program dCdT (32Stafford W.F.I. Laue T.M. Schuster T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar) was used to obtain s w values for interacting species. The s w values obtained using dCdT were consistent with s* values obtained using Svedberg. A control sedimentation velocity experiment performed using the 2-AP oligonucleotide in the absence of protein confirmed the identity of the two species in the experiment containing DNA (DNA alone and DNA-protein complex). The values s* and s w were corrected for solvent density and viscosity and normalized to standard conditions to produce the s 20,w value (33Van Holde K.E. Neurath H. Hill R. The Proteins. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 226-287Google Scholar, 34Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Vapnek P.C. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1980: 591-642Google Scholar). Values for ν were corrected for percentage glycerol as described (35Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 36Cole J.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15601-15610Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of UvrD and UvrD mutants was determined in the presence and absence of ligands using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and high pressure liquid chromatography system (Rainin, model HPXL) at 4 °C. Column buffer was 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol. When present in the column buffer, ATP was 0.5 mm. Proteins (25 μg) were injected onto the column in a volume of 50 μl at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. When present, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (dT)16 was included in the loaded sample at a concentration of 11.2 μm. Samples were passed through the column at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, and elution of protein peaks was monitored continuously by absorbance at 280 nm. The elution of (dT)16was followed by scintillation counting of column fractions. Samples were subjected to centrifugation prior to loading to remove particulate matter and any insoluble protein. Comparison of protein concentration measurements made before and after application to the column revealed that essentially all protein was soluble and recovered in a single peak. A standard curve of log molecular mass versusretention time was generated in the absence of ATP using the following proteins under the column buffer conditions described above: thyroglobulin (668,000 Da), catalase (212,000 Da), rabbit muscle aldolase (158,000 Da), human transferrin (80,000 Da), and cytochromec (12,400 Da). The retention time of all protein standards was not significantly altered by the presence of ATP. Genetic complementation assays were performed using JH137 and derivatives. UV irradiation survival assays (23Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and determination of spontaneous mutation frequencies (37Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18614-18620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. The standard ATPase reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mmMgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction stop solution was 33 mmEDTA, 7 mm ATP, and 7 mm ADP. In general, reactions were executed and products separated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (38Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions were incubated at 37 °C. When [3H]ATP was used, the results were quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. When [α-32P]ATP was used, the results were quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Background signals measured in the absence of enzyme were typically between 1 and 2% and were subtracted from the experimental data. For inhibition assays the concentration of UvrD was 4 nmand the concentrations of UvrD-K35M, UvrD-E221Q, and UvrD-R605A were 125 nm. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 1 mm [α-32P]ATP and 1.8 μmoligonucleotide (dT)16 (molecules). Wild-type and mutant helicase II enzymes were mixed together at 15 times their final concentrations and preincubated on ice for 10 min. Reactions were initiated by adding enzyme (wild-type, mutant, or a mixture of both) to reaction mixtures at 37 °C. Samples (5 μl) were removed at 1-min intervals (within the linear range of the reaction) and quenched with 5 μl of stop solution. Reactions for examining the protein concentration dependence of the UvrD-catalyzed ATPase reaction were identical to those for the inhibition assays except that the UvrD concentration was varied from 1 to 64 nm, and bovine serum albumin was included at 50 μg/ml. As the UvrD concentration was decreased, samples were removed at increasing time intervals to ensure production of a detectable signal. All data points fell within the linear range of the reaction. To compare the k cat values of UvrD and UvrDΔ40C, reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 0.8 mm[3H]ATP and 30 μm M13mp7 ssDNA (nucleotide phosphate). Reactions were initiated with enzyme at a final concentration of 2 nm. Samples (8 μl) were removed and quenched with 8 μl of stop solution at 2-min intervals. To compareK m values of UvrD and UvrDΔ40C, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 2 nm enzyme, 30 μm M13mp7 ssDNA (nucleotide phosphate), and increasing concentrations (25–500 μm) of [α-32P]ATP. Reactions were initiated with [α-32P]ATP and incubated for 10 min. Duplicate samples of 5 μl were removed and quenched with 5 μl of stop solution. Helicase reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mmMgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 3 mm ATP. For inhibition experiments, the reaction mixtures also included 0.5 μm20-mer oligonucleotide molecules and 5 nm 20-bp partial duplex [32P]DNA substrate molecules. The partial duplex substrate was prepared as described previously (23Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unlabeled 20-mer was the same sequence as the 32P-labeled 20-mer used to make the partial duplex substrate and was included at molar excess to prevent reannealing of unwound 32P-labeled 20-mer. The concentration of UvrD was 1 nm, and the concentrations of UvrD-K35M, UvrD-E221Q, and UvrD-R605A were 3 nm. Wild-type and mutant helicase II enzymes were mixed together at 10 times their final concentrations and incubated on ice for 10 min. Subsequently, enzymes were incubated on ice with the partial duplex DNA substrate in the reaction buffer for 5 min prior to initiation of the reactions. Reactions were initiated by adding ATP and unlabeled 20-mer at 37 °C. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 min, reactions were quenched with 10 μl of stop solution (37.5% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.05% each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue, and 0.3% SDS). For the biochemical comparison of UvrD- and UvrDΔ40C-catalyzed unwinding reactions, the standard reaction mixtures included approximately 0.2 nm 92-bp partial duplex [32P]DNA substrate molecules prepared as described previously (23Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated with the indicated concentration of enzyme at 37 °C, incubated for 10 min, and quenched with 10 μl of stop solution. All reaction products were resolved on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (20:1 cross-linking ratio), and the results were visualized and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The formation of dimers and higher order oligomers by UvrD has been suggested based on gel filtration techniques and glutaraldehyde cross-linking (19Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the idea that the active form of UvrD may be dimeric, as has been demonstrated for Rep helicase (13Chao K.L. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1165-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wong I. Lohman T.M. Science. 1992; 256: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We discovered independent evidence for UvrD dimerization that enabled us to begin to identify the domain(s) responsible for this phenomenon. In a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with UvrD, an interacting clone was isolated that was identical to a portion of the uvrD gene. This interacting clone encoded a region of UvrD lacking the N-terminal 244 amino acids, suggesting that the N terminus of helicase II was not essential for oligomerization. Subsequently, an interaction between two full-length UvrD proteins was demonstrated (Fig. 1 A). To define further the interaction domain, various deletion mutants were constructed and analyzed for their ability to interact with wild-type UvrD in the yeast two-hybrid system using assays for β-galactosidase activity to quantify interaction-dependent expression of alacZ reporter gene (Fig. 1 B). The results indicated that the C-terminal half of UvrD was sufficient to produce a detectable interaction. Removal of 383 amino acids from the N terminus or 40 amino acids from the C terminus abolished the two-hybrid interaction. The latter result was particularly interesting because the UvrDΔ40C mutant had been partially characterized previously and found to be indistinguishable from wild-type UvrD. 2L. E. Mechanic and S. W. Matson, unpublished data. The two-hybrid data suggest that UvrDΔ40C has a defect in oligomerization, which prompted a careful examination of this property using both UvrD and UvrDΔ40C. The existence of a mutant that fails to dimerize, yet has wild-type biochemical activity, has significant implications for the UvrD-unwinding mechanism. The assembly state (i.e. monomer, dimer, oligomer) of UvrD and UvrDΔ40C was examined by analytical sedimentation equilibrium ul"
https://openalex.org/W2035638887,"The cytoplasmic β subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels modulates channel properties in a subtype-specific manner and is important in channel targeting. A high affinity interaction site between the α1 interaction domain (AID) in the I-II cytoplasmic loop of α1 and the β interaction domain (BID) of the β subunit is highly conserved among subunit subtypes. We describe a new subtype-specific interaction (Ss1) between the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of α1A (BI-2) and the carboxyl terminus of β4. Like the interaction identified previously (21Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) between the carboxyl termini of α1A and β4 (Ss2), the affinity of this interaction is lower than AID-BID, suggesting that these are secondary interactions. Ss1 and Ss2 involve overlapping sites on β4 and are competitive, but neither inhibits the interaction with AID. The interaction with the amino terminus of α1 is isoform-dependent, suggesting a role in the specificity of α1-β pairing. Coexpression of β4 in Xenopus oocytes produces a reduced hyperpolarizing shift in the I-V curve of the α1A channel compared with β3 (not exhibiting this interaction). Replacing the amino terminus of α1A with that of α1C abolishes this difference. Our data contribute to our understanding of the molecular organization of calcium channels, providing a functional basis for variation in subunit composition of native P/Q-type channels.

Our data contribute to our understanding of the molecular organization of calcium channels, providing a functional basis for variation in subunit composition of native P/Q-type channels. Despite their functional diversity, high voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have three subunit types in common (1Flockerzi V. Oeken H.-J. Hofmann F. Pelzer D. Cavalie A. Trautwein W. Nature. 1986; 323: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Sakamoto J. Franzini-Armstrong C. Pragnell M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Science. 1993; 261: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The α1, pore-forming component of the channel is associated with a cytoplasmic β subunit of 52–78 kDa and a largely extracellular α2δ component, anchored by a single transmembrane domain. These subunits are encoded by at least 7 α1, 4 β, and 1 α2δ genes, respectively, of which numerous splice variants exist (3Birnbaumer L. Campbell K.P. Catterall W.A. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F.

The β subunit, when coexpressed with the α1 subunit, results in an increase in current density, alteration of the voltage dependence and kinetics of both inactivation and activation, and an increase in the number of recognition sites for channel-specific ligands (for review, see Refs. 4Catterall W.A.

These effects reflect not only conformational modulation but also an increase in the number of channels properly addressed to the cell surface, suggesting multiple roles for the β subunit. Although the effects of β are highly conserved, significant differences are seen depending on the combination of α1 and β subunits studied. For example, the kinetics of inactivation shows a general trend of variation with β subtype (6De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol.

Finally, α1 and β subtypes differ in their potential (based on sequence predictions) to be phosphorylated by various protein kinases.

The specificity of such secondary interactions, or at least differences in affinity, represents a potential source for the variation seen for different α1 and β combinations, in terms of both the electrophysiological properties of the channel and potential differences in control by other cellular factors, such as protein kinases and G proteins. We therefore set out to determine whether further secondary interaction sites exist.

The interaction plays a critical role in the precise positioning of the channel activation process on the voltage axis.

A 21-amino acid peptide containing the AIDA sequence QQQIERELNGYMEWISKAEEV and a 21-amino acid peptide containing residues 76–96 of the α1Aamino-terminus (RSLFLFSEDNVVRKYAKKITE) were synthesized by Genosys (United Kingdom). For competition experiments, a maltose-binding protein (MBP) in fusion with the carboxyl-terminal binding site of α1A (amino acids 2120–2275) was constructed using the BamHI/SalI sites of pMAL-c2 (MBP-CTA,2120–2275). The effects of β-AIDAand β-CTA associations on β-AIDA, β-CTA, and β-NTA interaction were analyzed by saturating each β site by preincubating the [35S]methionine-labeled β4 subunit (35S-β4) with 10 μmAIDA peptide (1 h) or 2 μmMBP-CTA,2120–2275 (4 h).

Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Two-electrode voltage clamp recording was performed at room temperature (18–20 °C) using a GeneClamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The extracellular recording solution was of the following composition (in mm): Ba(OH)2, 40; NaOH, 50; KCl, 3; HEPES, 5; niflumic acid, 0.5; pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid. Electrodes filled with 3 m KCl had a resistance of 0.1 megohm. Current records were filtered at 1 kHz, leak-subtracted on-line by a P/6 protocol, and sampled at 5 kHz. Residual capacitative currents were blanked. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP version 6.03 (Axon Instruments). All values are mean ± S.D. A GST fusion protein, GST-NTA, expressing the entire amino-terminal cytoplasmic region of α1A (splice variant BI-2) was assayed for in vitro binding to35S-β4. As Fig.1 A shows, the NTAregion exhibits a significant and specific interaction with β4 which is comparable to the binding observed to a GST fusion protein carrying the AIDA sequence. The binding of GST-NTA to 35S-β4 appears slightly stronger than the binding of GST-AIDA, but the relative efficiency of binding of these fusion proteins varied slightly depending on the β-translation reactions used. The affinity of this interaction was determined by carrying out similar binding assays using a range of concentrations of GST-NTA fusion protein. Fig.1 B shows the resulting saturation curve, which is compared with that observed previously for the interaction of35S-β4 with GST-AIDA. The affinity of interaction of GST-NTA is 100-fold lower (kD = 336 nm) than that for the AID interaction (close to 3 nm). These data are in favor of the idea that the AID-BID interaction represents a primary anchoring site of interaction between the two subunits which allows secondary interactions of lower affinity to occur. As already mentioned, it is interesting that in Fig. 1 A, GST-NTAdemonstrates greater binding than GST-AIDA to35S-β4. Given that both fusion proteins are at concentrations giving maximal binding (Fig. 1 B), this demonstrates a difference in maximal binding which appears to reflect a difference in conformational requirements, coupled with conformational heterogeneity in the 35S-β4 preparation (permissive and nonpermissive binding states; data not shown). To characterize more precisely the region of α1Aresponsible for interaction with β4, a series of GST fusion proteins carrying truncations of the region concerned (depicted in Fig. 2 A) was constructed, and the proteins were assayed for their capacity to interact with35S-β4. As Fig. 2 B shows, removal of the most carboxyl-terminal amino acids, or of the 42 most amino-terminal, does not abolish the capacity to interact with β4. Concomitantly, fusion proteins corresponding to the most carboxyl-terminal region, which is most highly conserved among α1 subtypes, are incapable of binding. In addition, the interaction between GST-NTA and35S-β4 was not inhibited by addition to the binding reaction of a peptide (500 μm) corresponding to amino acids 76–98. These data suggest that the β4binding site concerns a region between residues 1 and 66 of α1A, maybe comprising, but not necessarily limited to, residues 42–52. The reduced binding to NTA,2–52 and NTA,42–77 compared with full-length NTAprobably reflects instability and/or sequence reduction of the interaction site. The reduction in binding of smaller deleted derivatives meant that we were unable to pursue this approach further. A sequence alignment of this α1A binding domain with equivalent domains of other α1 subunits (α1B, α1E, α1C, α1D, and α1S), some used in this investigation, suggests a relatively low level of sequence conservation, although α1B and α1A show some similarity (Fig. 2 C). This observation implies that the interaction may not be conserved, a prediction that we went on to test (see Fig. 5).Figure 5α 1 amino-terminal specificity of interaction with β subunits.

Error bars represent S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the region of β4 which interacts with the amino-terminal region of α1A, we initially analyzed the binding capacity of several deleted derivatives of β4, translated in vitro (Fig. 3,A and B). These derivatives lacked either the amino-terminal, carboxyl-terminal, or both regions, which shows a low level of conservation among β subunit subtypes. As Fig. 3 Bshows, removal of the amino-terminal region had no effect, whereas removal of the carboxyl-terminal abolished binding completely, illustrating the importance of this region in the interaction. We also found that although β3 does not interact with GST-NTA (see Fig. 5), the opposite is true for a β3-β4 chimera, in which the nonconserved carboxyl terminus of β3 is replaced by the equivalent domain of β4 (Fig. 3 B). We have shown previously (21Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that the carboxyl-terminal region of β4 also interacts with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of α1A (BI-2). We therefore wanted to map the two interaction sites more precisely, for which we constructed two additional derivatives of β4, lacking a third (residues 483–519) and two-thirds (residues 447–519) of the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 3, A and B). As Fig. 3 C shows, deletion of residues 483–519 of β4 had no effect on its capacity to bind to GST-NTA, whereas truncation of the carboxyl terminus of β4 up to residue 446 resulted in a total loss of binding capacity. This indicates that the NTAbinding region is located between residues 446 and 482 of β4. Analysis of the capacity of these truncates to bind to a GST fusion protein of the carboxyl-terminal region (residues 2090–2424) of α1A (GST-CTA) resulted in binding capacity being gradually lost with each further deletion. This suggests that the binding site of CTA spans a wider region than the NTA binding site, is dependent on secondary or tertiary structures that are disrupted by the deletions, or consists of a series of dispersed sites. It is noteworthy that the previously characterized α1A carboxyl-terminal binding site was also difficult to define, in that deleted derivatives over a long region retained binding capacity, giving support to the hypothesis that there are microdomains of interaction between these two sites (21Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NTA site and corresponding domain on β4 are shorter and seem more easily delineated. In any case, the different patterns of interaction capacities seen for GST-NTA and GST-CTA suggest that these two regions of α1A occupy different but overlapping sites on β4. The involvement of overlapping regions of β4 in interactions with the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of α1A also raised the question as to whether these interactions could occur simultaneously or whether they were mutually exclusive. To investigate this as well as their relationship with the AID-BID interaction, we tested whether the binding of AIDA(21-amino acid peptide) or GST-CTA to35S-β4 could prevent its interaction with GST-NTA. The results, illustrated in Fig.4, show that although the AID peptide was effective in preventing the interaction of β4 to GST-AIDA, it did not prevent the concomitant interaction with either GST-NTA or GST-CTA,2070–2275 (Fig.4 A). On the other hand, the association of MBP-CTA,2120–2275 with β4 blocked the ability of β4 to interact with GST-CTA,2070–2275 and also significantly reduced the binding of β4 to GST-NTA (Fig.4 B), suggesting that β4 is able to interact with AID and only one of the secondary interaction sites at a time. We have shown previously (21Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that β subtypes differ in their capacity to interact with the carboxyl-terminal region of α1A, with β4 interacting with greatest affinity, β2A with a lesser affinity, and β1b and β3 showing no significant interaction. We therefore wished to determine whether the same was true for interaction with the amino-terminal domain. In addition, because the β interaction site in the amino-terminal region of α1A shows a variable level of conservation among α1 subtypes, we wished to investigate whether β interaction capacities were conserved among them. Both of these questions were addressed by constructing a series of GST fusion proteins carrying the amino-terminal cytoplasmic region of α1B, α1C, and α1S (Fig.5 A). These fusion proteins, along with GST alone, GST-AIDA (for comparison purposes), and GST-NTA, were assayed for their ability to interact with four different β subtypes, translated in vitro in presence of [35S]methionine (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, interaction with GST-NTA showed a pattern similar to that observed for the carboxyl-terminal region of α1A (21Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in that β4 exhibited the most significant interaction, β2a interacted to a lesser degree, and β1b and β3 showed no significant interaction. The amino-terminal domains of α1B showed no significant interaction despite its closer sequence relatedness to α1A. GST-NTS, on the other hand, showed significant interaction with all four β subunits, whereas GST-NTC, another L-type channel member, showed no interaction with any of the β subunits. Because the amino-terminal sequences of α1A and α1S are very different, we checked whether binding of β4 to NTS involved the same interaction domain of β4. Fig. 6demonstrates that, as for NTA, the carboxyl terminus of β4 was required for binding to NTS, and the use of deleted derivatives of the carboxyl terminus of β4also indicates an important role for residues 446–482 of β4 in this interaction. These results suggest that the interaction site is defined more by the tertiary structure of the α1 amino-terminal region than by its primary sequence, also explaining why the NTA site could not be localized more precisely than to residues 1–66 (Fig. 2). Finally, we questioned the relevance of the interaction between the amino terminus of α1A and the carboxyl terminus of β4 in terms of channel functioning. First, because β3, in contrast to β4, does not interact with the amino terminus of α1A, we investigated whether there were significant differences in terms of channel regulation by these two subunits. We found that in addition to triggering different inactivation kinetic behaviors (6De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the two subunits differed in terms of their ability to shift the activation curve toward hyperpolarized potentials (Fig. 7 A). Although both β subunits shifted the activation curve along the voltage axis, the shift induced by β3 was significantly more pronounced than the one produced by β4. The estimated half-activation potential shifted from 17 mV (α1A-expressing oocytes) toward −13 mV (α1Aβ3 oocytes) and 1.5 mV (α1Aβ4 oocytes). There is thus an approximately 14–15 mV difference in the shift induced by the β3 and β4 subunits. In addition, we found that depending on the β subunit being expressed, the channels differed in their voltage dependence of inactivation with half-inactivation at −50 and −37 mV for α1Aβ3 and α1A"

Because ligand-mediated receptor endocytosis and activation of the MAP kinase pathway are common phenomena among G-protein coupled receptors, it has been suggested that the essential role of endocytosis in MAP kinase activation identified for the β2-adrenergic receptor may be universal for all G-protein coupled receptors (Daaka,Y., Luttrell, L.

We tested this hypothesis using the Gq/11-coupled m3-muscarinic receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and an m3-muscarinic receptor mutant that does not undergo endocytosis. We demonstrate that inhibition of endocytosis by concanavalin A and cytochalasin D does not affect the ability of the wild type m3-muscarinic receptor to activate Erk-1/2. Furthermore, the mutant m3-muscarinic receptor that is unable to undergo endocytosis, activates the MAP kinase pathway in an identical manner to the wild type receptor. We conclude that receptor endocytosis is not universally essential for MAP kinase activation by G-protein coupled receptors. We discuss the possibility that the differential roles played by endocytosis in MAP kinase activation between various receptor subtypes may be linked to the mechanism of upstream activation of Raf-1.

Recent studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor have also demonstrated that clathrin/dynamin-mediated receptor endocytosis may also be essential in the activation of the MAP kinase pathway by GPCRs (3Daaka Y.

These studies indicated that ligand-induced β2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis provided a link between the activated Raf-1 complex and MEK, the downstream kinase in the phosphorylation cascade (3Daaka Y.

Inhibition of endocytosis was sufficient to prevent Raf-1 activation of MEK and thereby block Erk-1/2 phosphorylation mediated by the β2-adrenergic receptor (3Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S.

Because many GPCRs undergo ligand-induced endocytosis via a clathrin/dynamin-mediated process (7Koening J.A. Edwardson M.J. Trends Pharmacol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that GPCRs generally employ receptor-mediated endocytosis in the mechanism of activation of the MAP kinase pathway (4Lefkowitz R.J.

This hypothesis, however, has not been extensively tested for receptor subtypes other than the β2-adrenergic receptor. Importantly, different receptor subtypes activate the MAP kinase pathway via distinct mechanisms. These mechanisms depend on the G-protein subtype to which the GPCR is coupled (8Crespo P. Xu N.

Whether the differential mechanisms by which GPCRs activate the MAP kinase pathway contribute to the role played by receptor endocytosis has not yet been examined. To address the question of the possibility that receptor endocytosis is universally essential in the activation of the MAP-kinase pathway by GPCRs, we investigate here the Gq/11-coupled m3-muscarinic receptor expressed in CHO cells. This receptor type shares a number of properties with the β2-adrenergic receptor in that the receptor is rapidly phosphorylated following agonist stimulation (14Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that it undergoes endocytosis in a clathrin/dynamin-dependent process (15Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L.

Using inhibitors of endocytosis and a mutant receptor deficient in the ability to undergo ligand-mediated endocytosis, we investigate the role receptor endocytosis plays in the activation of Erk-1/2 by the m3-muscarinic receptor. Further, we discuss the possibility that the upstream mechanism of Raf-1 activation may play a role in determining the involvement of receptor endocytosis in GPCR-mediated Erk-1/2 activation. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were maintained in α-minimal essential media (MEM) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% v/v), fungizone (2.5 μg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. CHO-m3 cells expressing recombinant human m3-muscarinic receptors (1.55 ± 0.04 pmol/mg of protein), and CHO cells expressing the m3-muscarinic receptor mutant m3(A349AAA352) (4.72 ± 0.08 pmol/mg protein) were kind gifts from Dr. Wolfgang Sadee and Dr. Jelveh Lameh (School of Pharmacy, University of California, San Francisco, CA). The generation of the m3(A349AAA352) has been previously described (17Moro O. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments where endogenous PKC was down-regulated by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, cells were exposed to 1 μm phorbol ester overnight prior to experimentation. Furthermore, in experiments where pertussis toxin was used, cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin overnight before experimentation. Cells grown to confluence in 24-well plates were washed with 250 μl of Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 118 mm NaCl, 4.3 mm KCl, 1.17 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 1.3 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 25 mmNaHCO3, 11.7 mm glucose). Cells were stimulated with 1 mm carbachol for the indicated times. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 1 mtrichloroacetic acid, and Ins(1,4,5)P3 was determined by a radioreceptor assay previously described (18Challiss R.A.J. Batty I.H. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (50 μCi/ml) for 1 h. Cells were stimulated with 1 mmcarbachol for the times indicated, and the reactions were terminated by rapid aspiration of media and the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.1% v/v SDS, 0.5% w/v Na-deoxycholate). The mutant m3(A349AAA352) receptor expression levels were ∼3-fold greater than wild type receptors. Therefore, to ensure that equivalent numbers of receptors were immunoprecipitated, the proteins were adjusted so that ∼1 pmol of solubilized receptors were used for each immunoprecipitation. The receptors were immunoprecipitated from precleared lysates using 1 μg of anti-muscarinic m3 receptor antibody (14Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, and the beads were washed three times with ice-cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA). Immunocomplexes were resuspended in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and placed in a boiling water bath for 2 min. Proteins were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. The gels were stained with 0.2% Coomassie Blue to ensure that there was equal immunoprecipitation. The gels were then dried, and phosphorylated bands were visualized by autoradiography. Confluent CHO cells grown in 24-well plates were serum-starved for 1 h in KHB with or without endocytotic inhibitors and then stimulated with 1 mmcarbachol for the appropriate times. Reactions were terminated by aspiration, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold KHB. Cells were incubated with ∼0.14 μCi of [3H]N-methylscopolamine (NMS) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed two times in ice-cold KHB and solubilized by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer, and receptor number was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by the inclusion of 10 μm atropine. CHO cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates were serum-starved for 1 h in KHB and then stimulated with the appropriate agents. Stimulations were terminated by aspiration, and cells were incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml benzamidine) at 4 °C. Solubilized CHO cell lysates were pre-cleared by centrifuging at 20,000×g for 5 min. Endogenous MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated using 0.2 μg of anti-Erk-1/2 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein A-Sepharose-immobilized MAP kinase was washed two times in lysis buffer and two times in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmNa3VO4). Washed pellets were resuspended in assay buffer containing 2 μCi [32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, 200 μm EGFr (peptide encompassing region 661–681 of EGF receptor), and reactions were left to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 25% trichloroacetic acid and spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper squares. Squares were washed four times with 0.05% orthophosphoric acid and once with acetone, and radioactivity associated with the EGFr was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Confluent CHO cells seeded in 6-well plates were serum-starved for 1 h in KHB and stimulated with 1 mm carbachol for the appropriate times. Reactions were terminated by rapidly aspirating the medium, and the cells were lysed in gold lysis buffer (GLB, composition: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 15% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated with 0.5 μg of anti-Raf-1 antiserum (kind gift from Dr. C. Pritchard, Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Leicester, UK). Immunocomplexes were washed two times with ice-cold GLB and two times with ice-cold Raf-1 assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMnCl2). Washed immunocomplexes were resuspended in Raf-1 assay buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 2 μCi [32P]ATP, 1.8 μg of Raf-1 peptide substrate. Assays were subsequently performed as for the Erk assay. Student's t test or two-way analysis of variance was applied where indicated. Stimulation of CHO-m3 cells expressing the recombinant human m3-muscarinic receptor with the cholinergic agonist carbachol (60 min, 1 mm) resulted in a 56% loss of cell surface receptors as determined using the binding of the hydrophilic ligand [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) (Fig. 1). Total receptor number determined using [3H]NMS binding to a broken cell preparation from stimulated or control cells remained unchanged during this time (data not shown), indicating that the loss of receptor binding at the cell surface was because of receptor endocytosis (or internalization) rather than receptor degradation. m3-Muscarinic receptor endocytosis could be completely inhibited following pretreatment with concanavalin A and reduced by 81% by cytochalasin D (Fig. 1). Stimulation of m3-muscarinic receptors resulted in an ∼25-fold increase in Erk-1/2 activity within 5 min, which fell to ∼8.5-fold within 20 min (Fig. 2). Inhibition of m3-muscarinic receptor endocytosis using concanavalin A and cytochalasin D had no significant effect on m3-muscarinic receptor activation of Erk-1/2 (Fig. 2). Previous studies have demonstrated that mutation of a region in the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor (S349ASS352−A349AAA352) resulted in a receptor that was unable to undergo receptor endocytosis (17Moro O. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the present study where expression of the m3(A349AAA352) mutant in CHO cells resulted in a receptor that showed no significant endocytosis following 60 min of agonist treatment (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, wild type receptors were internalized by 51.1 ± 5.1% following 60-min stimulation with carbachol (Fig. 3 A). The m3(A349AAA352) receptor did, however, couple to the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway as evident by a peak and plateau profile of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production (Fig.3 B). Comparison of the peak Ins(1,4,5)P3response revealed a numerical but not significant reduction in Ins(1,4,5)P3 for the m3(A349AAA352) receptor compared with wild type receptor (p = 0.073,n = 6, unpaired Student's t test). Furthermore, the m3(A349AAA352) receptor also underwent rapid agonist-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C), which was maximal after ∼30 s and was maintained for at least 30 min (data not shown). Densitometric analysis revealed that phosphorylation of the m3(A349AAA352) receptor was ∼3-fold greater than the wild type receptor. Note that in the data presented in Fig. 3 C, the receptor number was normalized at the point of immunoprecipitation so that an equal number of wild type and m3(A349AAA352) mutant receptors were immunoprecipitated (see “Materials and Methods”). Despite the fact that the m3(A349AAA352) receptor did not undergo endocytosis, the m3(A349AAA352) receptor stimulated Erk-1/2 activation with a time course that was similar to the wild type receptor (Fig.4 A). The m3(A349AAA352) receptor did, however, show a slight lag evident at 1 min (p < 0.05) and a significantly more robust response at 20 min (p < 0.01) when compared with the wild type receptor. The agonist-concentration dependence between the wild type and m3(A349AAA352) receptor was not significantly different (p = 0.82, two-way analysis of variance) (Fig. 4 B). The wild type and m3(A349AAA352) receptor activation of Erk-1/2 could be completely blocked by the MEK-1/2 inhibitor PD98053 (Calbiochem, data not shown). Furthermore, both the wild type and m3(A349AAA352) receptor Erk-1/2 responses were mediated, at least in part, by PKC. Down-regulation of PKC using phorbol ester pretreatment reduced the wild type and m3(A349AAA352) receptor responses by 87 and 77%, respectively (Fig. 5). In control experiments, PKC down-regulation completely inhibited the Erk-1/2 response to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (Fig. 5). Inhibition of PKC using the inhibitor Ro-318220 reduced wild type and m3(A349AAA352) receptor responses by 86 and 56%, respectively (Fig. 5). Once again in control experiments, Ro-318220 completely inhibited the Erk-1/2 response to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that Gq/11-coupled muscarinic receptors expressed in CHO cells activated Erk-1/2 via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein (11van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1266-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the present study where both m3(A349AAA352) and wild type receptor-stimulated Erk-1/2 activity was unaffected by pertussis toxin pretreatment (Fig. 5). The ability of the muscarinic receptor to activate Raf-1, the upstream kinase in the MAP kinase cascade, was also investigated. m3-Muscarinic receptor activation stimulated an ∼5-fold increase in Raf-1 kinase activity (basal = 125 fmol of phosphate incorporated/mg/min,n = 2) that peaked at 1–5 min followed by a plateau phase (∼3-fold over basal) evident at 10 min and extending for at least 20 min. The present study demonstrates that the Gq/11-coupled m3-muscarinic receptor expressed in CHO cells activates the MAP-kinase pathway (Erk-1/2) via a mechanism that is independent of receptor endocytosis. These data conflict with recent reports, based on studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor, that have suggested that receptor endocytosis is essential for GPCR activation of the MAP-kinase pathway (3Daaka Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Our conclusion is supported by the findings that inhibition of m3-muscarinic receptor endocytosis by cytochalasin D and concanavalin A did not affect the ability of the receptor to activate Erk-1/2. Furthermore, a receptor mutant (m3(A349AAA352) that did not undergo endocytosis in response to agonist exposure was still able to stimulate Erk-1/2 activity. Importantly, with the exception of receptor endocytosis, the m3(A349AAA352) mutant behaved with many of the characteristics associated with the wild type m3-muscarinic receptor in that it was able to couple to the PLC-pathway and undergo agonist-sensitive phosphorylation. The model for β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of the MAP-kinase pathway recently proposed by Lefkowitz and colleagues is thought to represent a general scheme for GPCR stimulation of Erk-1/2 (3Daaka Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). β2-Adrenergic receptor stimulation results in receptor phosphorylation by receptor-specific kinases (e.g. GRK-2/3) and protein kinase A (19Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Although previously linked with receptor desensitization, β2-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation has recently been shown to play a role in endocytosis and activation of the MAP-kinase pathway. Phosphorylation at GRK-2/3 sites allows for the recruitment of β-arrestin which acts as an adaptor protein linking the receptor to clathrin and hence the clathrin/dynamin endocytic pathway (20Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 21Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch allowing for the β2-adrenergic receptor to act via Gi-proteins to stimulate the MAP-kinase pathway (22Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to more conventional Gi-coupled receptors (for example m2-muscarinic). Dominant negative mutants of β-arrestin and dynamin, as well as chemical inhibitors of endocytosis, prevented both β2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis and Erk-1/2 activation (3Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M.

The point at which receptor endocytosis links with the MAP-kinase pathway is at the activation of MEK-1/2 by Raf-1 (3Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the activated Raf-1 complex once associated with the plasma membrane requires internalization to enable phosphorylation of MEK-1/2 (3Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Because receptor endocytosis is a common phenomenon among GPCRs (7Koening J.A. Edwardson M.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and that GPCR activation of the MAP-kinase pathway occurs through Raf-1 (2Gutkind S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the role for receptor endocytosis in Erk-1/2 activation described for the β2-adrenergic receptor may generally be applicable to all GPCRs (4Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Despite this, however, the data presented here clearly demonstrate that activation of the MAP-kinase pathway by m3-muscarinic receptors does not require receptor endocytosis. Muscarinic receptors coupled via Gq/11 to the PLC pathway have previously been shown to undergo endocytosis via a clathrin/dynamin pathway (15Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12967-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Vogler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17335-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings are data presented here that demonstrate the ability of concanavalin A and cytochalasin D, reagents known to disrupt clathrin-mediated endocytosis (24Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar), to inhibit m3-muscarinic receptor internalization. Furthermore, we have previously reported that the m3-muscarinic receptor is rapidly phosphorylated following agonist stimulation (14Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), possibly by CK1α (25Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The role phosphorylation plays in m3-muscarinic receptor endocytosis is unclear. It is interesting to note, however, that in the present study we show that the process of receptor phosphorylation is not sufficient to ensure endocytosis since, despite the m3(A349AAA352) receptor mutant undergoing agonist-mediated phosphorylation, this receptor is unable to endocytose. In fact, the m3(A349AAA352) receptor was phosphorylated to a level ∼3-fold greater than the wild type receptor. The apparent hyper-phosphorylation of the m3(A349AAA352) receptor may be explained by findings from previous studies that suggest a role for receptor endocytosis in dephosphorylation of GPCRs (26Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). If endocytosis is important for muscarinic receptor dephosphorylation, then a mutant receptor unable to undergo endocytosis may “accumulate” in the phosphorylated form. Whether this is the reason for the hyper-phosphorylation of the m3(A349AAA352) receptor is presently under investigation. The m3-muscarinic receptor expressed in CHO-m3 cells, therefore, shares some characteristics in common with the β2-adrenergic receptor that is known to be important in β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated MAP-kinase activation. Namely, the receptor undergoes rapid phosphorylation following agonist stimulation and is internalized via a clathrin/dynamin-dependent pathway. However, despite these similarities, the receptors do not share a common role for receptor endocytosis in MAP-kinase activation. The m3-muscarinic and β2-adrenergic receptors do show divergent mechanisms of activation of the MAP-kinase pathway at the level of the upstream activation of Raf-1. In some cell types, Gq/11-coupled receptors including muscarinic receptors, have been shown to activate Erk-1/2 in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner, via PKC, in a process that is independent of Ras but dependent on Raf-1 (11van Biesen T.

The data presented here demonstrates that the m3-muscarinic receptor-stimulated Erk-1/2 activity is reduced by PKC inhibition and is unaffected by pertussis toxin, suggesting that a similar mechanism is in operation for the m3-muscarinic receptor expressed in CHO-m3 cells. Furthermore, the ability of the m3-muscarinic receptors to activate Raf-1 in this study indicates that the process of Erk-1/2 activation by m3-muscarinic receptors in CHO-m3 cells is mediated via Raf-1 activation of MEK. This is supported by the fact that the MEK inhibitor PD98053 blocked m3-muscarinic receptor-mediated Erk-1/2 activation. In contrast with the Gq/11-coupled muscarinic receptor subtypes, the mechanism of Raf-1 activation by β2-adrenergic receptors involves βγ-subunits derived from pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins activating cytosolic tyrosine kinases that are able to phosphorylate adaptor proteins involved in the recruitment of Ras exchange factors and the activation of Ras (21Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The common thread, therefore, in the activation of Erk-1/2 by GPCR subtypes, and indeed growth factor receptors, is that they all operate through the activation of Raf-1 (2Gutkind S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The difference lies in the mechanisms employed in the upstream activation of Raf-1. The argument tested in this report is as follows. If receptor endocytosis is essential for Raf-1 activation of MEK, which appears to be the case for some growth factor receptors (5Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 6Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4672-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the β2-adrenergic receptor (3Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), then it might be predicted that this would be true for GPCRs generally because they undergo ligand-dependent endocytosis and all stimulate Erk-1/2 via Raf-1. Our data, however, do not support this hypothesis and demonstrate that receptor endocytosis is not universally essential in the mechanism of GPCR activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The reason for the differences in the role played by endocytosis between the various GPCR subtypes may lie at the differential upstream mechanisms employed in the activation of Raf-1,e.g. whether via PKC or βγ-subunits. We thank Dr. Jonathan Blank and Paul Wylie for help and advice with the MAP kinase assays."

In GP patients autoantibodies against the non-collagenous C-terminal domain (NC1) of the α3 chain of collagen IV cause a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and often lung hemorrhage, the two cardinal clinical manifestations of the GP syndrome (see Ref. 1Saus J. Delves P.J. Roitt I.M. Goodpasture's Syndrome: Encyclopedia of Immunology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press Ltd., London1998: 1005-1011Google Scholar for review). Since the NC1 domain is a highly conserved domain among species and between the different collagen IV α chains (α1–α6) (2Leinonen A. Mariyama M. Mochizuki T. Tryggvason K. Reeders S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26172-26177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the exclusive involvement of the human α3(IV)NC1 in a natural autoimmune response suggests that this domain has structural and/or biological peculiarities of pathogenic relevance. Consistent with this, the N terminus of the human antigen is highly divergent, and it contains a unique 5-residue motif, KRGDS9, that conforms to a functional phosphorylation site for type A protein kinases (3Quinones S.

Furthermore, the corresponding human gene, but not the other human related or homologous genes from other species, generates multiple transcripts by an exclusive alternative splicing phenomenon (5Bernal D.

Recent studies indicate that the phosphorylation of the N terminus of the GP antigen by cAMP-dependent protein kinase is up-regulated by the presence of the alternative products. 2J. Saus, manuscript in preparation. Thus, specific serine/threonine phosphorylation appears to be a major biological difference between the human antigen, antigen from other species, and the homologous domains from other human α(IV) chains and therefore might be important in pathogenesis (1Saus J. Delves P.J. Roitt I.M. Goodpasture's Syndrome: Encyclopedia of Immunology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press Ltd., London1998: 1005-1011Google Scholar, 4Revert F. Penadés J.R. Plana M. Bernal D. Johansson C.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel type of serine/threonine kinase that specifically binds to and phosphorylates the unique N-terminal region of the human GP antigen. GPpep1, KGKRGDSGSPATWTTRGFVFT, representing residues 3–23 of the human GP antigen, and GPpep1Ala9, KGKRGDAGSPATWTTRGFVFT, a mutant Ser9 to Ala9, were synthesized by MedProbe and CHIRON. FLAG peptide, DYKDDDDK, was from Sigma. The following as well as several other GPBP-specific oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys and Life Technologies, Inc:. ON-GPBP-54m, TCGAATTCACCATGGCCCCACTAGCCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG and ON-GPBP-55c, CCGAGCCCGACGAGTTCCAGCTCTGATTATCCGACATCTTGTCATCGTCG; ON-HNC-B-N-14m, CGGGATCCGCTAGCTAAGCCAGGCAAGGATGG; ON-HNC-B-N-16c, CGGGATCCATGCATAAATAGCAGTTCTGCTGT. Several human λ-gt11 cDNA expression libraries (eye, fetal and adult lung, kidney, and HeLa S3, from CLONTECH) were probed for cDNAs encoding proteins interacting with GPpep1. Nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) prepared following standard immunoscreening procedures were blocked and incubated with 1–10 nmol per ml of GPpep1 at 37 °C. Specifically bound GPpep1 was detected using M3/1A monoclonal antibodies (7Penadés J.R. Bernal D. Revert F. Johansson C. Fresquet V.J. Cervera J. Wieslander J. Quinones S. Saus J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A single clone was identified in the HeLa-derived library (HeLa1). Specificity of fusion protein binding was confirmed by similarly binding recombinant eukaryotic human GP antigen. The EcoRI cDNA insert of HeLa1 (0.5 kb) was used to screen further the same library and to isolate overlapping cDNAs. The largest cDNA (2.4 kb) containing the entire cDNA of HeLa1 (n4′) was fully sequenced. Pre-made Northern and Southern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with HeLa1 cDNA following the manufacturers' instructions. The original λ-gt11 HeLa1 clone was expressed as a lysogen in Escherichia coli Y1089 (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The corresponding β-galactosidase-derived fusion protein containing the N-terminal 150 residues of GPBP was purified from the cell lysate using an APTG-agarose column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). TheEcoRI 2.4-kb fragment of n4′ was subcloned in Bluescribe M13+ vector (Stratagene) (BS-n4′), amplified, and used for subsequent cloning. A DNA fragment containing from 5′ to 3′, an EcoRI restriction site, a standard Kozak consensus for translation initiation, a region coding for a tag peptide sequence (FLAG, DYKDDDDK), and the sequence coding for the first 11 residues of GPBP including the predicted Meti and a BanII restriction site, was obtained by hybridizing ON-GPBP-54m and ON-GPBP-55c and extending with modified T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting DNA product was digested with EcoRI and BanII and ligated with theBanII/EcoRI cDNA fragment of BS-n4′ in theEcoRI site of pHIL-D2 (Invitrogen) to produce pHIL-FLAG-n4′. This plasmid was used to obtain Muts transformants of the GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris and to express FLAG-tagged recombinant GPBP (rGPBP) either by conventional liquid culture or by fermentation procedures (Pichia Expression Kit, Invitrogen). The cell lysates were loaded onto an anti-FLAG M2 column (Sigma), the unbound material washed out with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) or salt-supplemented TBS (up to 2 m NaCl), and the recombinant material eluted with FLAG peptide. For expression in cultured human kidney-derived 293 cells (ATCC 1573-CRL), the 2.4- or 2.0-kbEcoRI cDNA insert of either BS-n4′ or pHIL-FLAG-n4′ was subcloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to produce pc-n4′ and pc-FLAG-n4′, respectively. When used for transient expression, 18 h after transfection the cells were lysed with 3.5–4 μl/cm2chilled lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in TBS) with or without 0.1% SDS depending whether the lysate was to be used for SDS-PAGE or FLAG purification, respectively. For FLAG purification, the lysate of four to six 175-cm2 culture dishes was diluted up to 50 ml with lysis buffer and purified as above. For stable expression, the cells were similarly transfected with pc-n4′ and selected for 3 weeks with 800 μg/ml G418. For bacterial recombinant expression, the 2.0-kb EcoRI cDNA fragment of pHIL-FLAG-n4′ was cloned in-frame downstream of the glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-encoding cDNA of pGEX-5x-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting construct was used to express GST-GPBP fusion protein in DH5α (9Coligan J.E. Dunn B.N. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Winfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Human recombinant GP antigen (rGP) was produced in 293 cells using the pRc/CMV-BM40 expression vector containing the α3-specific cDNA between ON-HNC-B-N-14m and ON-HNC-B-N-16c. The expression vector is a pRc/CMV (Invitrogen)-derived vector provided by Billy G. Hudson that contains cDNA encoding an initiation Met, a BM40 signal peptide followed by a tag peptide sequence (FLAG), and a polylinker cloning site. To obtain α3-specific cDNA, a polymerase chain reaction was performed using the oligonucleotides above and a plasmid containing the previously reported α3(IV) cDNA sequence (3Quinones S. Bernal D. Garcı́a-Sogo M. Elena S.F. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19780-19784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template (clone C2). For stable expression of rGP, 293 cells were transfected with the resulting construct (fα3VLC) and selected with 400 μg/ml G418. The harvested rGP was purified using an anti-FLAG M2 column. All the constructs were verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. Human 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of the Profection Mammalian Transfection Systems (Promega). Stably transfected cells were selected by their resistance to G418. Foci of surviving cells were isolated, cloned, and amplified. Cells expressing HeLa1 λ-gt11 as a lysogen were lysed by sonication in the presence of Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in a 7.5% acrylamide preparative gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band containing the fusion protein of interest was excised and used for rabbit immunization (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Deidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The antiserum was tested for reactivity using APTG affinity purified antigen. To obtain affinity purified antibodies, the antiserum was diluted 1:5 with TBS and loaded onto a Sepharose 4B column containing covalently bound affinity purified antigen. The bound material was eluted and, unless otherwise indicated, used in the immunochemical studies. Monoclonal antibodies were produced essentially as previously reported (7Penadés J.R. Bernal D.

The supernatants of individual clones were analyzed for antibodies against rGPBP. About 200 ng of rGPBP were incubated overnight at 30 °C in 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.132 μm [γ-32P]ATP, in the presence or absence of 0.5–1 μg of protein substrates or 10 nmol of synthetic peptides, in a total volume of 50 μl. Individual wells of a 24-well dish were seeded with normal or with stably pc-n4′-transfected 293 cells. When the cells were grown to the desired density, a number of wells of the normal 293 cells were transfected with pc-FLAG-n4′. After 12 h the culture medium was removed, 20 μCi/well of H332PO4in 100 μl of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium added, and incubation continued for 4 h. The cells were lysed with 300 μl/well of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mmNaF, and 0.2 mm vanadate and extracted with specific antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. When anti-GPBP serum was used, the lysate was precleared using preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose. About 1 μg of rGPBP was dephosphorylated in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 50 mm potassium acetate with 0.85 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 30 °C. In-blot renaturation assays were performed using 1–5 μg of rGPBP as described previously (11Ferrel J.E. Martin G.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequences were performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using α-35S-dATP, modified T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and universal or GPBP-specific primers (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 9Coligan J.E. Dunn B.N. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W.

Immunopurified rGPBP or high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration fractions therefrom containing the material of interest were phosphorylated, hydrolyzed, and analyzed in one- (4Revert F.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). When performing two-dimensional analysis, the buffer for the first dimension was formic acid:acetic acid:water (1:3.1:35.9) (pH 1.9), and the buffer for the second dimension was acetic acid:pyridine:water (2:0.2:37.8) (pH 3.5). Amino acids were revealed with ninhydrin and32P-phosphoamino acids by autoradiography. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as in Ref. 4Revert F. Penadés J.R. Plana M. Bernal D. Johansson C.

Immunohistochemistry studies were done on human multi-tissue control slides (Biomeda, Biogenex) using the ABC peroxidase method (13Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13474) Google Scholar). Homology searches were carried out against the GenBankTM and SwissProt data bases with the BLAST 2.0 (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) at the NCBI server and against the TIGR Human Gene Index data base for expressed sequence tags using the Institute for Genomic Research server. The search for functional patterns and profiles was performed against the PROSITE data base using the ProfileScan program at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (15Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Prediction of coiled-coil structures was done at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research using the program Coils (16Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) with both 21- and 28-residue windows. To search for proteins specifically interacting with the divergent N-terminal region of the human GP antigen, a 21-residue peptide (GPpep1), encompassing this and flanking sequence, and specific monoclonal antibodies against it were combined to screen several human cDNA expression libraries. The screening of more than 5 × 106 phages was required to identify a single HeLa-derived recombinant encoding a fusion protein specifically interacting with GPpep1 without disturbing antibody binding. By using the cDNA insert of the original clone (HeLa1), we isolated a 2.4-kb cDNA (n4′) that contains 408 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence, an open reading frame (ORF) of 1872-bp encoding 624 residues, and 109-bp of 3′-untranslated sequence (Fig.1). Other structural features are of interest. First, the predicted polypeptide has a large number of phosphorylatable (17.9%) and acidic (16%) residues with an unequal distribution along the sequence. Serine, which is the most abundant residue (9.3%), shows preference for two short regions of the protein where it comprises nearly 40% of the amino acids compared with an average of less than 7% throughout the rest of the polypeptide chain. It is also noteworthy that the more N-terminal serine-rich region consists mainly of a Ser-Xaa-Yaa repeat. Acidic residues are preferentially located at the three N-terminal quarters of the polypeptide with nearly 18% of the residues being acidic. These residues represent only 9% in the most C-terminal quarter of the polypeptide, resulting in a polypeptide chain with two electrically opposite areas. At the N terminus, the polypeptide contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that has been implicated in the recruitment of many signaling proteins to the cell membrane where they exert their biological activities (17Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, a bipartite nuclear targeting sequence (18Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar) exists as an integral part of a heptad repeat region that meets all the structural requirements to form a coiled-coil (16Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Protein data bank searches revealed homologies almost exclusively within the approximately 100 residues at the N-terminal region harboring the PH domain. The PH domain of the oxysterol-binding protein, which displays an overall identity of 33.5% and a similarity of 65.2% with our cloned protein, is the most similar. In addition, the Caenorhabditis elegans cosmid F25H2 (GenBankTM accession number Q93569) contains a hypothetical ORF that displays an overall identity of 26.5% and a similarity of 61% throughout the entire protein sequence indicating that similar proteins are present in lower invertebrates. Several tagged human expressed sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AA287878,AA287561, AA307431, AA331618, AA040134, AA158618, AA040087, AA122226,AA158617, AA121104, AA412432, AA412433, AA282679, and N27578) demonstrated a high degree of nucleotide identity (above 98%) with the corresponding stretches of the GPBP cDNA, suggesting that they represent human GPBP. Interestingly, the tagged sequence AA287878 shows a gap of 67 nucleotides within the sequence corresponding to the GPBP 5′-untranslated region, suggesting that the GPBP pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced in human tissues (not shown). The distribution and expression of the GPBP gene in human tissues was first assessed by Northern blot analysis (Fig.2 A). The gene is expressed as two major mRNAs species between 4.4- and 7.5-kb in length and other minor species of shorter lengths. The structural relationship between these multiple mRNA species is not known, and their relative expression varies between tissues. Striated muscle (skeletal and heart) is the tissue with highest expression, whereas lung and liver show the least. Southern blot studies using genomic DNA from different species indicate that homologous genes exist throughout phylogeny (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with the human origin of the probe, the hybridization intensities decrease in a progressive fashion as the origin of the genomic DNA moves away from humans in evolution. To confirm experimentally the predicted ORF, eukaryotic expression vectors containing either the 2.4-kb of cDNA of n4′ or only the predicted ORF tagged with a FLAG sequence (Fig.3 A) were used for transient expression assays in 293 cells. The corresponding extracts were analyzed by immunoblot using GPBP- or FLAG-specific antibodies. The GPBP-specific antibodies bind to a similar major polypeptide in both transfected cells, but only the polypeptide produced by the engineered construct expressed the FLAG sequence (Fig. 3 B). This locates the translation start site of the n4′ cDNA at the predicted Met and confirms the proposed primary structure. Furthermore, the recombinant polypeptides identified display a molecular mass higher than expected (80 versus 71 kDa) suggesting that GPBP undergoes post-translational modifications. Yeast expression and FLAG-based affinity purification were combined to produce rGPBP (Fig. 4 A). A major polypeptide of ∼89 kDa along with multiple related products displaying lower M r were obtained. The recombinant material was recognized by both anti-FLAG and specific antibodies guaranteeing the fidelity of the expression system. Again, however, the M r displayed by the major product was notably higher than predicted and even higher than theM r of the 293 cell-derived recombinant material, supporting the idea that GPBP undergoes important and differential post-translational modifications. Since phosphorylatable residues are the most abundant in the polypeptide chain, we investigated the existence of phosphoamino acids in the recombinant materials. By using monoclonal or polyclonal (not shown) antibodies against phosphoserine (Ser(P)), phosphothreonine (Thr(P)), and phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)), we identified the presence of all three phosphoresidues either in yeast rGPBP (Fig. 4 B) or in 293 cell-derived material (not shown). The specificity of the antibodies was further assessed by partially inhibiting their binding by the addition of 5–10 mm of the corresponding phosphoamino acid (not shown). This suggests that the phosphoresidue content varies upon the cell expression system, and theM r differences are mainly due to phosphorylation. Consistently, dephosphorylated yeast-derived material displays similar M r to the material derived from 293 cells, and phosphoamino acid content correlates with SDS-PAGE mobilities (Fig. 4 C). As an in vivo measurement, the phosphorylation of rGPBP in the 293 cells was assessed (Fig.4 D). Control cells (lanes 1) and cells expressing rGPBP in stable (lanes 2) or transient (lanes 3) modes were cultured in the presence of H332PO4. The recombinant material specifically immunoprecipitated contains 32P indicating that the phosphorylation of GPBP occurs in vivo and therefore is likely to be a physiological process. Although GPBP does not contain the 12 conserved structural regions required to define the classic catalytic domain for a protein kinase, the recent identification and characterization of novel non-conventional protein kinases (19Csermely P.

Addition of [γ-32P]ATP to rGPBP either from yeast or 293 cells (not shown) in the presence of Mn2+ and Mg2+ resulted in the incorporation of 32P as Ser(P) and Thr(P) in the major and related products that were recognized by both anti-FLAG and specific antibodies (Fig.5, A and B), indicating that the affinity purified material contains a Ser/Thr protein kinase. To characterize this activity further, GPpep1, GPpep1Ala9 (a GPpep1 mutant with Ser9 replaced by Ala), native and recombinant human antigens, and native bovine antigen were assayed (Fig. 5 C). Affinity purified rGPBP phosphorylates all human-derived material to a different extent; however, in similar conditions no appreciable 32P incorporation was observed in the bovine-derived substrate. The lower32P incorporation displayed by GPpep1Ala9 when compared with GPpep1 and the lack of phosphorylation of the bovine antigen indicates that the kinase present in rGPBP discriminates between human and bovine antigens and that Ser9 is a target for the kinase. Although the purification system provides high quality material, the presence of contaminants with a protein kinase activity could not be ruled out. The existence of contaminants was also suggested by the presence of a FLAG-containing 40-kDa polypeptide displaying no reactivity with specific antibodies nor incorporation of32P in the phosphorylation assays (Figs. 4 A and5 A). To identify precisely the polypeptide harboring the protein kinase activity, we performed in vitro kinase renaturation assays after SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig.6). We successfully combined the use of specific antibodies (lane 1) and autoradiographic detection of in situ 32P incorporation (lane 2), and we identified the 89-kDa rGPBP material as the primary polypeptide harboring the Ser/Thr kinase activity. The lack of32P incorporation in the rGPBP-derived products as well as in the 40-kDa contaminant further supports the specificity of the renaturation assays and locates the kinase activity to the 89-kDa polypeptide. Recently, it has been shown that traces of protein kinases intimately associated to a polypeptide can be released from the blot membrane, bind to, and phosphorylate the polypeptide during the labeling step (28Langelier Y.

To assess this possibility in our system, we performed the renaturation studies using a small piece of membrane containing the 89-kDa polypeptide either alone or together with membrane pieces representing the different regions of the blot lane. We observed similar 32P incorporation at the 89-kDa polypeptide regardless of the co-incubated pieces (not shown), indicating that if there are co-purified protein kinases in our sample they are not phosphorylating the 89-kDa polypeptide in the renaturation assays unless they co-migrate. Co-migration does not, however, appear to be a concern since rGPBP deletion mutants displaying different mobilities also have kinase activities and could similarly be in-blot renatured (not shown). To investigate GPBP expression in human tissues, we performed immunohistochemical studies using specific polyclonal (Fig.7) or monoclonal antibodies (not shown). Although GPBP is widely expressed in human tissues, it shows tissue and cell specificity. In the kidney, the major expression is found at the epithelial cells of the tubules and at the mesangial cells and podocytes of the glomerulus. At the lung alveolus, the antibodies display a linear pattern suggestive of a basement membrane localization along with staining of pneumocytes. Liver shows low expression in the parenchyma but high expression in biliary ducts. The expression at the central nervous system is observed in the white matter and not in the neurons of the brain. In testis, a high expression in the spermatogonium contrasts with the lack of expression in the Sertoli cells. The adrenal gland shows a higher level of expression at the cortical cells versus the medullar. In the p"

Because the enzyme is indispensable in thede novo synthesis of dTMP, it plays an important role in DNA replication in actively dividing cells and has been an attractive target at which anti-neoplastic agents are directed. Fluoropyrimidines (e.g. 5-fluorouracil and FdUrd) and, more recently, anti-folates (e.g. AG337, ZD1694, BW1843U89) have been useful in the clinical management of tumors of the breast, colon, stomach, and head and neck (2Ardalan B.

Fluoropyrimidines exert their effects through formation of the nucleotide analog FdUMP, which inhibits TS via formation of a covalent complex containing the analog CH2H4PteGlu and the enzyme (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). This complex, which is termed the inhibitory ternary complex, is quite stable and leads to prolonged inhibition of the enzyme, depletion of dTMP pools, and thymineless death. A number of studies with cultured cell lines, tumor models, and clinical specimens have shown that TS inhibitors induce enzyme levels by about 2–4-fold (6Spears C.P. Shahinian A.H. Moran R.G.

Because response to TS-directed chemotherapy is dependent upon the enzyme concentration, such induction has been viewed as a potential barrier to successful therapeutic outcomes. As a result, there has been a great deal of interest in the mechanism of the induction and in strategies to ameliorate its effects. The increases in TS levels do not involve changes in mRNA concentrations, indicating that induction occurs at the translational or post-translational level. Recent studies have shown that TS binds to its mRNA in vitro and inhibits the translational efficiency of the mRNA (9Chu E. Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Drake J.C. Chabner B.A. Elwood P.C. Zinn S. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8977-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar); TS ligands disrupt this complex and restore translation (9–12, see Ref. 13Chu E. Allegra C.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar for a review). These findings have provided the basis for the so-called translational autoregulation model, which postulates that ligand-mediated induction of TS occurs through destabilization of the TS protein-mRNA complex, followed by relief of translational repression (13Chu E. Allegra C.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The autoregulatory translation model is based upon an extensive body ofin vitro studies that are both elegant and persuasive. However, several predictions of the model remain untested. For example, because the binding of ribosomes to mRNA is rate-limiting in eukaryotic translation (14Sonenberg N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 173-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the model predicts that the number of ribosomes/TS mRNA molecule will increase in cells treated with TS inhibitors. In addition, it is expected that mutant TS mRNAs that have lost the ability to bind the enzyme (e.g. see Ref. 11Chu E. Voeller D. Koeller D.M. Drake J.C. Takimoto C.H. Maley G.F. Maley F. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) will be constitutively translated so that enzyme levels will be resistant to the inductive effects of inhibitors. In the present study, we have tested these predictions in human colon tumor cell lines. Our results do not support the autoregulatory translation model; rather, we find that TS induction can be accounted for by changes in the stability of the TS polypeptide. Thus, the translation model may not be a universal explanation for ligand-mediated induction of TS. Human colon tumor cell line HCT15 was purchased from the American Type Type Collection. A FdUrd-resistant derivative of this line, which expresses the P303L mutant of TS, is described elsewhere. 2M. E. Kitchens, A. M. Forsthoefel, K. W. Barbour, H. T. Spencer, and F. G. Berger, submitted for publication. Cells were typically grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Extracts of logarithmically growing cells were prepared by sonication and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The concentration of TS in the supernatants was determined by either the FdUMP binding assay (16Cisneros R.J. Dunlap R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or by Western blotting (17Reilly R.T. Forsthoefel A.M. Berger F.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against human TS, which was provided by Dr. S. Berger, served as the probe for the Western blot analyses. The TS-bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL-PLUS kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; signals were quantitated on a Storm PhosphorImager. Polysomes were isolated from cells using the methods of Palacios et al. (18Palacios R. Palmiter R.D. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2316-2321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (19Johannes G.J. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10108-10115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cycloheximide (90 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. At various times, cells were washed and homogenized at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 25 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mg/ml heparin, and 90 μg/ml cycloheximide. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was layered onto a 4.2-ml sucrose gradient (0.5–1.5 m) containing a 1-ml 2.5 m sucrose cushion. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected, and RNA was extracted from each fraction and analyzed by Northern blotting. To verify that RNA sedimenting in the polysomal region of the gradient is ribosome-bound, controls in which Na2EDTA was added to the extraction buffer prior to layering onto the sucrose gradient were included. A GCC→AAA substitution was introduced immediately upstream of the translational initiation codon of TS mRNA by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The template for mutagenesis was plasmid pKB169, which contains a cDNA copy of the TS mRNA between nucleotides 25 and 1354 (20Barbour K.W. Hoganson D.K. Berger S.H. Berger F.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 242-248PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers corresponded to nucleotides 81–110 within the cDNA; the forward mutagenic primer was 5′-CGCCCGCCGCAAAATGCCTGTGGCCGGCTC-3′ (the mutant nucleotides are underlined), whereas the reverse mutagenic primer was 5′-GAGCCGGCCACAGGCATTTTGCGGCGGGCG-3′. In one polymerase chain reaction, the reverse mutagenic primer and an upstream flanking primer (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′), corresponding to the T7 promoter region of the vector, were used; in a second reaction, the forward mutagenic primer and a downstream primer (5′-CTGCATGCCGAATACCGACA-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 260–279 of the cDNA, were used. Reaction mixtures contained, in a total volume of 100 μl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 250 μm dNTPs, 5% (v/v) formamide, and 5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out for 30 cycles (94 °C for 1.5 min, 52 °C for 2.5 min, and 72 °C for 3 min) followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. The DNA products from the two reactions were combined and co-amplified under the same conditions but using the T7 and the downstream primers. The final product was digested with HindIII andPstI and cloned in place of the corresponding fragment in pKB169; the insert of the resulting plasmid, pTF528, was sequenced to verify the presence of the GCC→AAA substitution. pTF528 was digested with HindIII and BglII, and the TS cDNA-containing fragment was cloned in place of the corresponding fragment in the expression construct pJZ205, which contains the wild-type TS cDNA under control of the SV40 promoter; the final construct was denoted pTF530. Plasmids pJZ205 and pTF530 were stably transfected into a TS-deficient Chinese hamster lung cell line (RJK88.13, Ref. 21Nussbaum R.L. Walmsley R.M. Lesko J.G. Airhart S.D. Ledbetter D.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 1192-1205PubMed Google Scholar) by calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation in medium containing 20 μg/ml thymidine; 16–25 μg of plasmid DNA were added per culture. After 48 h, the cells were placed in selective medium lacking thymidine, and surviving colonies were pooled, passed several times through selective medium, and stored until further use. Cells transfected with the wild-type cDNA plasmid (i.e.pJZ205) were denoted RJK88.13/TS(wt), whereas cells transfected with the mutant plasmid (i.e. pTF530) were denoted RJK88.13/TS(GCC→AAA). Cells were plated at low density, and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added to a concentration of 90 μg/ml. At various times after the addition of inhibitor, cells were collected, extracts were prepared, and TS levels were assayed by Western blotting as above. The binding of ribosomes to mRNA is rate-limiting in eukaryotic translation (14Sonenberg N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 173-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As a consequence, changes in translational efficiency are generally associated with alterations in the number of ribosomes bound to a particular mRNA. The translational model of TS regulation predicts that in the presence of ligands, the number of ribosomes/TS mRNA molecule will increase. To test this prediction, we examined the polysome distribution profiles for TS mRNA both prior to and following treatment with FdUrd. Human colon tumor cell line HCT15 was treated for 24 h with 6 nm FdUrd, which corresponds to the ID50 for this cell line.2 Under these conditions, TS levels increase about 2–3-fold with no change in mRNA concentrations (data not shown). Cellular extracts were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation to separate various size classes of polysomes (Fig.1 A), and the amounts of TS-specific mRNA in the gradient fractions were assessed by Northern blotting (Fig. 1, B and C). Polysome profiles were virtually identical for both control and FdUrd-treated cells. In each circumstance, nearly all of the TS mRNA sedimented in the polysome region of the gradient with little, if any, mRNA in nonpolysomal fractions; the polysomal TS mRNA contained approximately 4–7 ribosomes/molecule (Fig. 1). The addition of Na2EDTA to the extracts prior to centrifugation resulted in the TS mRNA being exclusively nonpolysomal, indicating that the mRNA is indeed ribosome-bound (data not shown). It could be argued that the modest extent of enzyme induction (i.e. 2–3-fold) is too small to be manifested as a detectable change in the polysome profile. We therefore made use of a mutant cell line in which the FdUrd-mediated induction of TS is amplified relative to that in HCT15. Cell line HCT15/200 is a FdUrd-resistant derivative of HCT15 that expresses high concentrations of a mutant TS molecule containing a Pro → Leu substitution at residue 303.2 This amino acid substitution renders the polypeptide relatively unstable, as compared with the wild-type enzyme.2 Treatment of HCT15/200 cells for 24 h in 200 nm FdUrd results in a 10–15-fold induction of TS with no change in mRNA concentrations (data not shown). The polysome profiles for TS mRNA from this cell line are presented in Fig. 1,D and E. The high mRNA concentrations in the gradient fractions reflect the 40-fold overproduction of mRNA in HCT15/200 as compared with HCT15.2 The vast majority of TS mRNA was polysomal and sedimented at a region corresponding to about 4–7 ribosomes/mRNA. Importantly, the polysome distribution pattern was identical in both control and FdUrd-treated cells (Fig. 1,D and E). Thus, even with a 10–15-fold induction of TS, there is no detectable change in the extent of ribosome binding to TS mRNA. Identical results were obtained with several other colon tumor cell lines (data not shown). Thus, the absence of an effect of FdUrd on the polysomal distribution of TS mRNA is not specific to cell line HCT15. RNA/protein binding experiments have shown that the translational initiation region of TS mRNA, particularly the AUG initiation codon and the three bases preceding it, are critical determinants of TS binding to its mRNA (11Chu E. Voeller D. Koeller D.M. Drake J.C. Takimoto C.H. Maley G.F. Maley F. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that TS recognizes and binds a stem loop that is 30 bases in length and encompasses the AUG codon (11Chu E. Voeller D. Koeller D.M. Drake J.C. Takimoto C.H. Maley G.F. Maley F. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). If destabilization of the TS-TS mRNA complex and subsequent derepression of translation are central to fluoropyrimidine-mediated enzyme induction, then the translatability of a mRNA that is incapable of binding the enzyme should be resistant to FdUrd; enzymes encoded by such a mutant mRNA should not undergo induction in response to drugs. To test this notion, we made use of the findings of Chu et al. (11Chu E. Voeller D. Koeller D.M. Drake J.C. Takimoto C.H. Maley G.F. Maley F. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), who reported that a mutant oligoribonucleotide containing AAA in place of GCC immediately upstream of the translational initiation codon of TS mRNA failed to compete with full-length mRNA for binding to TS; a wild-type oligoribonucleotide fully competed (11Chu E. Voeller D. Koeller D.M. Drake J.C. Takimoto C.H. Maley G.F. Maley F. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We introduced the GCC→AAA substitution into a full-length TS cDNA expression plasmid, and the resulting construct was stably transfected into a TS-deficient Chinese hamster lung cell line (RJK88.13, Ref. 21Nussbaum R.L. Walmsley R.M. Lesko J.G. Airhart S.D. Ledbetter D.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 1192-1205PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in cell line RJK88.13/TS(GCC→AAA). TS induction in response to FdUrd was measured and compared with that in cell line RJK88.13/TS(wt), which is a stably transfected line containing the wild-type TS cDNA. Fig.2 shows that TS levels in cells expressing the mutant mRNA are induced to the same extent (i.e. 2–3-fold) as cells expressing the wild-type mRNA. Thus, the GCC→AAA mutation had no detectable effect on enzyme inducibility, suggesting that binding of TS to the initiation region of the mRNA is not required for the induction. The results presented above do not support the autoregulatory translation model of TS induction. This leaves enzyme stability as a possible mechanism. We therefore measured the half-life of the TS protein in HCT15 cells both prior to and following treatment with FdUrd. Cycloheximide was added to cells, and the concentrations of TS protein were assayed by Western blotting at various times thereafter. The half-life of TS was 7.3 ± 0.3 h in control cells and 25 ± 1.0 h in FdUrd-treated cells (Fig. 3 A). This 3–4-fold stabilization of the TS polypeptide readily accounts for the approximately 2–3-fold induction of enzymes in response to fluoropyrimidines. In HCT15/200 cells, where the FdUrd-mediated induction of TS is amplified, the half-life of the enzyme was 2.3 ± 1.7 h, indicating that the mutant P303L polypeptide expressed in these cells is significantly less stable than the wild-type polypeptide (Fig.3 B). Treatment with FdUrd increased the half-life to 18 ± 1.4 h (Fig. 3 B), a degree of enzyme stabilization that fully accounts for the induction. Thus, TS induction by FdUrd appears to result from an increase in the stability of the TS polypeptide. We find no evidence for a translational level control mediated by TS binding to its mRNA. A large body of in vitro studies has clearly shown that free TS has an affinity for its own mRNA and that this affinity is decreased by TS ligands (9Chu E. Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Drake J.C.

The binding of TS to mRNA represses the translational efficiency of the latter and inhibits enzyme synthesis (9Chu E. Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Drake J.C. Chabner B.A. Elwood P.C. Zinn S. Allegra C.J.

TS inhibitors, therefore, have an impact on TS production, as well as on enzyme activity. These findings, in total, have led to the notion that derepression of TS mRNA translation, which occurs via disruption of the TS-TS mRNA complex, is a central mechanism underlying ligand-mediated induction of enzyme concentrations in cells (13Chu E. Allegra C.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The experiments reported in the current paper are not consistent with such a model. First, the polysomal distribution patterns for the mRNA were virtually identical in control and FdUrd-treated cells. If TS induction occurs via a translational mechanism, then an increase in the number of ribosomes/mRNA would be expected in the presence of drugs. Second, a 3-base substitution in TS mRNA that abolishes its ability to bind the enzyme had no observable effect on induction. Thus, interactions between TS and its mRNA do not appear to be required for the drug-mediated increases in cellular TS concentrations. Finally, direct biochemical measurements showed that treatment with FdUrd stabilizes the TS molecule to an extent that fully accounts for the induction. We conclude that fluoropyrimidine-mediated increases in TS levels occur through an effect on enzyme stability, with no effect on mRNA translation. This conclusion is similar to that made by Washtien (22Washtien W.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 171-177PubMed Google Scholar) many years ago, following the analysis of human gastrointestinal cell lines. The finding that ligands stabilize TS is entirely consistent with current views on TS structure and function. It is well documented that upon formation of either the catalytic or the inhibitory ternary complex, the enzyme, particularly its C-terminal residues, undergoes a major conformational shift that is stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network involving the folate co-substrate (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Indeed, this shift alters the susceptibility of TS to proteolytic enzymes in vitro (15Abdel Moshen A.-W. Aull J.L. Payne D.M. Daron H.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that the conformational change stabilizes the enzyme in vivo. It has been suggested that increases in TS levels cause resistance to TS-directed agents and may represent a significant barrier to successful cancer chemotherapy (13Chu E. Allegra C.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Distinguishing between mRNA translation and enzyme stabilization as mechanisms for TS induction has implications with regard to how such resistance occurs. In the translation model, increases in the TS level are derived from a newly synthesized enzyme, which confers resistance by enhancing the rate of dTMP synthesis. In contrast, in the enzyme stabilization model, the induced enzyme is bound into the inhibitory ternary complex; resistance in this model is conferred by “titrating out” FdUMP, thereby lowering the effective concentration of free nucleotide analog available for inhibition of newly synthesized enzyme. Clearly, further insights will require sorting out the relative importance of enzyme stability and mRNA translation in the regulation of cellular TS levels, particularly in response to TS-directed anti-metabolites. The present results, coupled with the absence of rigorous experiments testing the in vivo relevance of TS binding to its mRNA, raise questions concerning the general applicability of the translational model of TS induction. Of course, it is formally possible that cell lines other than those focused upon here may exhibit a translational derepression mechanism. In the least, it seems reasonable to conclude that the translation model cannot be invoked as a universal explanation for the induction of TS by its inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2092940132,"The peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria is known to trigger cytokine release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). However, it requires 100–1000 times more Gram-positive peptidoglycan than Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide to release the same amounts of cytokines from target cells. Thus, either peptidoglycan is poorly active or only part of it is required for PBMC activation. To test this hypothesis, purified Streptococcus pneumoniaewalls were digested with their major autolysinN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, and/or muramidase. Solubilized walls were separated by reverse phase high pressure chromatography. Individual fractions were tested for their PBMC-stimulating activity, and their composition was determined. Soluble components had a M r between 600 and 1500. These primarily comprised stem peptides cross-linked to various extents. Simple stem peptides (M r <750) were 10-fold less active than undigested peptidoglycan. In contrast, tripeptides (M r >1000) were ≥100-fold more potent than the native material. One dipeptide (inactive) and two tripeptides (active) were confirmed by post-source decay analysis. Complex branched peptides represented ≤2% of the total material, but their activity (w/w) was almost equal to that of LPS. This is the first observation suggesting that peptidoglycan stem peptides carry high tumor necrosis factor-stimulating activity. These types of structures are conserved among Gram-positive bacteria and will provide new material to help elucidate the mechanism of peptidoglycan-induced inflammation.

These types of structures are conserved among Gram-positive bacteria and will provide new material to help elucidate the mechanism of peptidoglycan-induced inflammation. Inflammation is a complex, nonspecific host defense response to pathological situations such as infection. When localized, inflammation is beneficial because it helps eradicate the invading organisms at the infected site (1Vaudaux P. Grau G.E. Huggler E. Schumacher-Perdreau F. Fiedler F. Waldvogel F.A. Lew D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In severe situations, however, the deregulation of numerous host defense factors and soluble cellular mediators, such as cytokines, may result in a dramatic cardiovascular collapse called septic shock (2Natanson C. Fink M.P. Ballantyne H.K. MacVittie T.J. Conklin J.J. Parrillo J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Glauser M.P. Heumann D. Baumgartner J.D. Cohen J.

Septic shock is a classical response to severe infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, in which the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the principal bacterial component triggering cytokine release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and other responsive cells (6Bone R.C. J. Crit. Care. 1993; 8: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Parsonnet J. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1989; 11 Suppl. 1: 263-269Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Crass B.A. Bergdoll M.S. J.

Microbiol. 1993; 7: 281-287PubMed Google Scholar). To stimulate cytokine release, LPS binds to the cell surface protein CD14 (10Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked determinant that presumably requires additional transmembrane elements such as the recently described Tol receptor (11Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4476) Google Scholar) to trigger cell response. In vivo LPS also binds to lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, an acute phase protein that catalyzes the binding of LPS to CD14 (12Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Septic shock is also a feature of severe Gram-positive infections (13Miethke T. Wahl C. Heeg K. Echtenacher B. Krammer P.H. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 14Riesenfeld-Orn I. Wolpe S. Garcia-Bustos J.F. Hoffmann M.K. Tuomanen E. Infect.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In recent years, Gram-positive pathogens have become more frequent than Gram-negative bacteria as a cause of nosocomial infections and shock (17Casey L.C. Balk R.A. Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 18Awada A. van der Auwera P. Meunier F. Daneau D. Klastersky J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This is particularly true in intensive care unit patients and in neutropenic patients, two subgroups with impaired host defenses that are especially prone to develop severe sepsis. However, in contrast to their Gram-negative counterparts, Gram-positive bacteria do not contain LPS. In certain cases, highly pathogenic agents such as Staphylococcus aureus andStreptococcus pyogenes produce toxins that may act as superantigens and trigger an overwhelming nonspecific T-cell-mediated inflammatory response (7Parsonnet J. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1989; 11 Suppl. 1: 263-269Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Miethke T. Wahl C. Heeg K. Echtenacher B. Krammer P.H. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). With less pathogenic agents, such as viridans group streptococci, triggering of inflammation and shock might be due to other cellular components, including the thick Gram-positive peptidoglycan. Gram-positive cell walls were shown to stimulate TNF release and inflammation in several in vitro and in vivo systems, including experimental meningitis, experimental arthritis, and experimental septic shock (19Tuomanen E. Liu H. Hengstler B. Zak O. Tomasz A. J. Infect. Dis. 1985; 151: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Fox A. Brown R.R. Anderle S.K. Chetty C. Cromartie W.J. Gooder H. Schwab J.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of peptidoglycan-induced inflammation, different types of Gram-positive wall materials were utilized. On the one hand, large molecules such as insoluble cell walls and soluble peptidoglycan released from penicillin-treated staphylococci allowed the demonstration that CD14 was also a receptor for Gram-positive wall products (22Heumann D. Barras C. Severin A. Glauser M.P. Tomasz A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2715-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Weidemann B. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Dziarski R. Bazil V. Kusumoto S. Flad H.D. Ulmer A.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4709-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the small molecule muramoyl dipeptide was shown to be the minimal common peptidoglycan structure carrying immunomodulatory activity (24Ellouz F. Adam A. Ciorbaru R. Lederer E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). However, while very useful, these compounds might not be ideal for solving the structure-activity relationship between the wall degradation products occurring in the nature and their cytokine-releasing capacity. First, molecules such as soluble peptidoglycan are very large (M r≥125,000) (25Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4713-4718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and might be too complicated for refined analysis. Second, muramoyl dipeptide is not a natural product of wall degradation, and it has only limited cytokine-stimulatory powerin vitro (27Dokter W.H. Dijkstra A.J. Koopmans S.B. Stulp B.K. Keck W. Halie M.R. Vellenga E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4201-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore this question, we attempted to isolate and characterize small proinflammatory peptidoglycan fragments resulting from the digestion of pneumococcal walls with their native autolysins, thereby liberating products of digestion that are likely to be foundin vivo. Specifically, Streptococcus pneumoniaecontains a major autolytic enzyme (anN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, which hydrolyzes the bonds between the glycan chain and the stem peptides) that is responsible both for wall solubilization and cell lysis during the stationary growth phase or during β-lactam treatment (28Mosser J.L. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 287-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Holtje J.V. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4199-4207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Garcia-Bustos J. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 114-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of this autolytic enzyme in pneumococcal pathogenesis has been demonstrated (31Berry A.M. Lock R.A. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2324-2330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In certain experiments, a second enzyme (M1-muramidase) that hydrolyzes the glycan chain was used in parallel. M1-muramidase is not formally a pneumococcal enzyme, but it has a functional equivalent in these organisms (32Garcia P. Garcia J.L. Garcia E. Lopez R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The resulting soluble fragments were separated by reverse phase high pressure chromatography (HPLC). Individual fractions were tested for their TNF-releasing activity, and the molecular structure of single components carrying inflammatory power was analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS), amino acid and amino sugar analysis, and postsource decay analysis. The noncapsulated lysis-prone positive S. pneumoniae strain R6 was used (33Avery O.T. MacLeod C.M. McCarty M. J. Exp. Med. 1944; 79: 137-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in the chemically defined liquid medium Cden (44Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15400-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of the cultures was followed by their optical density at 620 nm (A 620) with a spectrophotometer (Sequoia-Turner, Moutainville, CA). The cells were stored at −70 °C in Cden containing 20% glycerol. In certain experiments a label was introduced into the cell walls by either of the following methods. (i) To label the glycan chains,N-acetyl-d-[1-3H]glucosamine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 250 μCi/liter and 1.23 μg/liter. (ii) To label the stem peptides, l-[4,5-3H]lysine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to a final concentration of 250 μCi/liter and 0.45 μg/liter. The cultures were allowed to grow for 4–5 generation times in the presence of the label before being harvested as described below. Cell walls were prepared as described previously (34Garcia-Bustos J.F. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 447-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, one liter cultures grown to the late logarithmic phase (A 620 of 0.5) were rapidly cooled in an ice/ethanol bath and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g and 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in endotoxin-free water, and intrinsic autolytic enzymes were inactivated by pouring the suspension dropwise into boiling SDS (4%, final concentration). After 15 min of boiling, the SDS was removed by extensive washing with water, and the cells were broken open by vortexing with an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads with a 106-μm diameter (Sigma). The cells walls were pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C; resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% sodium azide; and treated with DNase, RNase, and trypsin as described (34Garcia-Bustos J.F. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 447-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides from protease digestion were extracted by boiling for another 10 min with SDS (1% final concentration), and the walls were incubated with 8 m lithium chloride and then 100 mm EDTA to remove material bound by ionic interactions. To remove possible contaminating endotoxin, the insoluble preparation was washed extensively with acetone followed by resuspension in endotoxin-free water prior to drying by rotary evaporation. The absence of contaminating endotoxin was confirmed by a negative result of theLimulus amebocyte test (Chromogenix, Molndal, Sweden) with a sensitivity of 4 pg/ml. To hydrolyze the bonds between the glycan chains and the stem peptides, the natural pneumococcal autolysinN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (referred to as amidase in the following) was used. This enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography (35Garcia J.L. Garcia E. Sanchez-Puelles J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 52: 133-138Crossref Google Scholar) from Escherichia coli CM21 lysates, into which the pneumococcal amidase gene (lytA) had been cloned (36Garcia E. Garcia J.L. Ronda C. Garcia P. Lopez R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 201: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Purified pneumococcal walls were suspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.9) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The mixture was incubated with 100 units/ml (final concentration) of amidase for 18 h with shaking at 37 °C. The digest was spun for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant, containing the solubilized walls, was collected. In certain experiments, the amount of radioactivity was counted to determine the extent of solubilization. The supernatant was then boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g and 4 °C to denature and remove the amidase. Eventually, the soluble walls were washed with acetone and water, as described, to remove any contaminating endotoxin and subsequently dried by rotary evaporation and stored at −20 °C. This enzymatic treatment resulted in >90% solubilization of the purified material. To hydrolyze the bonds between the N-acetylmuramoyl andN-acetylglucosamine residues, mutanolysin fromStreptomyces globiosporus (Sigma; EC 3.2.1.17) was used. The enzyme was added to a final concentration of 500 units/ml and 1 mg/ml substrate in 0.25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 10 mm magnesium chloride. The mixture was incubated for 18 h with gentle shaking at 37 °C before boiling and centrifugation to remove the enzyme as above. The supernatant was subsequently washed with acetone, dried by rotary evaporation, and stored at −20 °C as above. In certain experiments, the glycan chains and stem peptides were separated by differential precipitation in a mixture of water/acetonitrile/propan-2-ol (in the ratio 50:25:25) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Typically, 600 μg of amidase-solubilized cell walls were suspended in this solvent and kept on ice for 30 min. Insoluble material containing the glycan-rich fraction was then collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min (4 °C). The supernatant contained the stem peptides. Solvents were removed by rotary evaporation, and the peptides and glycan were dissolved in water. The amount of material present in each fraction was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The HPLC system (Hitachi Instruments, Ichige, Hitachinaka, Japan) consisted of the L-7200 autosampler, the L-7100 gradient pump, with low pressure mixing, and the L-7400 UV detector. Column temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a pelcooler (LabSource, Reinach, Switzerland). The results were analyzed using the D-7000 HPLC System Manager program (Hitachi). Separation was performed by injection of a 100-μl sample, containing 100 μg of wall digest, into a C18 reverse phase column (SuperPac Sephasil C18, 5 μm, 4 × 250-mm column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) protected with a guard cartridge (C18, 5 μm, 4 × 10 mm). The mixture was separated using a linear gradient of 0–15% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 100 min with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Detection was at 210 nm. 1-min fractions were collected. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The amount of material present in each fraction was too small to be measured either by weight or by radioactive counts and was therefore calculated by the percentage area method. Knowing the weight of material loaded, the amount of material present in each fraction was deduced. The samples were dissolved in 100 μl of water and stored at −20 °C. The content of specific fractions was analyzed by the following means. First their content in amino acids was determined using the OPAC postcolumn derivatization method following hydrolysis of the samples for 24 h in 6 m HCl at 110 °C (37Fountoulakis M. Juranville J.F. Berndt P. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2968-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second, their molecular mass was measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight MS, using a Voyager-Elite TOF mass spectrometer (PerSpective Biosystems Inc., Farmingham, MA) operating in the positive ion mode and using an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. The laser power was set to 1,600 units, and the accelerating voltage was set to 20,000 V. Postsource decay analysis was performed on certain fractions.N-Acetyl-d-glucosaminyl-(β1→4)-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (Calbiochem) was used as a standard (M r694.7). Human PBMCs were extracted from heparinized blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque (Seromed, Munich, Germany) density gradient centrifugation as described by Heumann et al. (22Heumann D. Barras C. Severin A. Glauser M.P. Tomasz A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2715-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and distributed into the wells of a flat bottomed 96-well tissue culture plate at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/well. Each well contained a final volume of 200 μl, which comprised the RPMI medium (140 μl), plasma from the donor (20 μl), and sample (20 μl). LPS from E. coli O111 (Sigma) in the concentration range 0.01–100 ng/ml was used as a positive control. PBMCs incubated with plasma or with medium alone were used as negative controls. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 8 h of incubation, samples (20 μl) of the supernatants were taken, diluted 20-fold in RPMI medium, and stored at −80 °C for measurement of TNF concentrations. For the whole blood assay, heparinized rabbit blood was diluted 4-fold in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described (38Desch C.E. Kovach N.L. Present W. Broyles Harlan J.M. Lymphokine Res. 1989; 8: 141-146PubMed Google Scholar). The diluted blood was distributed into tissue culture plates (200 μl/well). Samples (20 μl) were added, and the plates were incubated as above for 6 h. The plates were centrifuged for 5 min, and samples of the supernatant were diluted and stored as described above for subsequent measurement of TNF concentrations. WEHI clone 13 murine fibroblast cells (1 × 104/well) were used for quantitation of TNF-α as described (39Baumgartner J.D. Heumann D. Gerain J. Weinbreck P. Grau G.E. Glauser M.P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse TNF-α were used as a standard. The sensitivity of the assay was 25 pg/ml. Fig. 1 depicts a typical titration experiment of the TNF-releasing activity of LPS and insoluble pneumococcal walls exposed to human PBMCs in the presence of 10% plasma. Both LPS and purified cell walls triggered TNF release from the monocytes in a concentration-dependent fashion. However, it required ∼1000 times more pneumococcal walls than LPS to release the same amounts of TNF from the target cells. This was in agreement with previous observations reported by Timmerman et al. (40Timmerman C.P. Mattsson E. Martinez-Martinez L. De G. Van Strijp J.A. Verbrugh H.A. Verhoef J. Fleer A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4167-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with insoluble staphylococcal peptidoglycan and Heumann et al.(22Heumann D. Barras C. Severin A. Glauser M.P. Tomasz A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2715-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with pneumococcal peptidoglycan. To attempt to expose more active pneumococcal wall subcomponents that might be embedded in the insoluble peptidoglycan, we first solubilized the purified walls using the bacteria's own major autolysin amidase, purified as described (35Garcia J.L. Garcia E. Sanchez-Puelles J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 52: 133-138Crossref Google Scholar), and then sought inflammatory subcomponents in the soluble material. Amidase solubilized >90% of the purified walls. Nevertheless, the inflammatory power of this soluble mixture was not greater than that of insoluble material. Similar observations were made by Riesenfeld-Orn et al. (14Riesenfeld-Orn I. Wolpe S. Garcia-Bustos J.F. Hoffmann M.K. Tuomanen E. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, when soluble and insoluble walls were titrated for their TNF-releasing activity, as in Fig. 1, they produced very similar stimulation profiles and had the same stimulatory potency (see upper part of TableI). This observation came in support of the hypothesis that only part of the peptidoglycan might be inflammatory and suggested that such specific inflammatory constituents might now be present in the soluble mixture. Therefore, the wall constituents were further separated by reverse phase HPLC, and individual fractions were tested for their PBMC and/or whole blood-stimulating activity.Table IRelative stimulatory potency of LPS and various pneumococcal wall components exposed to human PBMCsStimulantMSC10×aThe relative stimulatory potency was expressed as the minimum concentration of material required to induce at least a 10-fold increase in TNF levels above background (minimum stimulatory concentration 10×, or MSC10×).

Purified insoluble pneumococcal walls (step 1 in Fig. 2) digested with amidase (step 2 in Fig. 2) produced a wealth of soluble fragments comprising free stem peptides, separated from the glycan backbone at theN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine bonds, and glycan chains decorated or not with teichoic acids and/or residual peptides (34Garcia-Bustos J.F. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 447-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although amidase solubilized >90% of the walls (step 2 in Fig. 2), the soluble fragments generated by this treatment could not be properly resolved by the chromatography conditions used in these experiments. The profile of this separation is shown in Fig.3 a.Figure 3Separation of soluble cell wall components by HPLC. Equal amounts (100 μg) of the following pneumococcal wall preparations were loaded onto a C18 Sephasil column: purified walls digested with amidase alone (a), purified walls digested with both amidase and muramidase (b), and stem peptides prepared by sequential precipitation of amidase-digested walls (c) (see Fig. 2). HPLC failed to resolve cell walls solubilized by amidase alone (a). In contrast, the amidase/muramidase, double-digested wall (b) and the peptide-enriched fractions (c) could be resolved and gave reproducible patterns that were very similar in both cases. Theinsets show the putative composition of the unseparated mixture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We reasoned that this might be due to some interference of the undigested glycan backbone (step 2 in Fig. 2) with the C18 column. To circumvent this problem, two strategies were adopted. In the first, the amidase-solubilized walls were submitted to a second digestion with muramidase (step 3A in Fig. 2), an enzyme that hydrolyzes the 1–4 β-bonds between the N-acetylmuramoyl andN-acetylglucosamine residues of the glycan chain. The profile of this second separation is depicted in Fig. 3 b. In contrast to Fig. 3 a, Fig. 3 b indicates that double-digested wall material could now be resolved by HPLC. The chromatogram was complex, indicating that the peptidoglycan contained a variety of subcomponents. Nevertheless, this profile was perfectly reproducible in terms of both interrun and intercell wall batch resolution and over at least four independent experiments. A second strategy (step 3B in Fig. 2) to encompass the interference of the undigested glycan chains consisted of removing the glycans from the amidase digest by serial precipitation in water/acetonitrile/propan-2-ol (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and then analyzing only the peptide-enriched fraction by HPLC. Fig. 3 c depicts the result of this separation. It can be seen that this chromatogram resembled very much that of Fig.3 b, indicating that the stem peptides of the cell walls were the prevalent species resolved with both of these methods. In a first series of experiments, we determined the TNF-releasing activity of 1-min fractions collected from the chromatogram presented in Fig.3 b. Individual fractions were exposed to human PBMCs as described. Fig. 4 indicates that the TNF-releasing activity was very low for material eluting before 30 min, whereas it rose considerably later on, i.e. up to 100-fold above background levels. Since the chromatograms resulting from the separation of either double-digested or single amidase-digested peptidoglycan were almost superimposable, we repeated the stimulation experiment with 1-min fractions of both of these enzymatic digests. In this second series of experiments, a new column was used, which resulted in a slight increase in retention times. Fig.5 presents these results. In these experiments, the TNF assay was performed with whole blood from rabbits, a system that gave similar results as human PBMCs but was much more convenient for screening large numbers of fractions. It can be seen that not only the chromatograms of double-digested or single amidase-digested peptidoglycan were very similar, but their profiles of TNF-release were comparable as well. This was consistent with the fact that the peptide-enriched material contained active subcomponents similar to those observed in the double-digested material.Figure 5TNF released from rabbit blood following stimulation by 1-min fractions collected from the separation of either double-digested wall or single amidase-digested wall enriched for peptides.

This effect of C2-ceramide depended on tyrosine kinase activity and an increase in Ras-GTP levels. Increased PI 3-kinase activity was also accompanied by its translocation to the membrane fraction, increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit, and physical association with Ras. Activation of PI 3-kinase by TNFα, sphingomyelinase, and C2-ceramide was inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and PP1). The stimulation of PI 3-kinase by sphingomyelinase and C2-ceramide was not observed in fibroblasts expressing dominant-negative Ras (N17) and the stimulation by TNFα was decreased by 70%. PI 3-kinase activation by C2-ceramide was not modified by inhibitors of acidic and neutral ceramidases, and it was not observed with the relatively inactive analog, dihydro-C2-ceramide. It is proposed that activation of Ras and PI 3-kinase by ceramide can contribute to signaling effects of TNFα that occur downstream of sphingomyelinase activation and result in increased fibroblasts proliferation.

We recently showed that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 12 h with C2-ceramide increased the PI 3-kinase activity that was physically associated with IRS-1, and this increased glucose uptake in the absence of insulin (23Wang C.-N. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These effects of ceramides mimic those of TNFα, which can increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, its binding of PI 3-kinase (24Guo D. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

PI 3-kinase phosphorylates the 3-position of the inositol ring to produce a family of 3-phosphoinositides that play important roles in cell signaling. In various cell types, PI 3-kinase is implicated in regulating cell growth and inhibiting apoptosis (27Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The p85 subunit contains two SH2 domains, one SH3 domain, a Bcr homology domain, and proline-rich sequences (for review see Refs. 35Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 36Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Harrison-Findik D. Keeler M.L. Susa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which suggests that PI 3-kinase is regulated by multiple mechanisms. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins such as the EGF and PDGF receptors IRS-1 and CD28 bind the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit (35Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin.

This binding increases PI 3-kinase activity and, in some situations, causes translocation of PI 3-kinase to plasma membranes to bring it into proximity with its lipid substrates (39Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.-A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Other possible mechanisms regulating PI 3-kinase activation include binding of the SH3 domains of the Src family of tyrosine kinases to the proline-rich sequences on the p85 subunit (40Pleiman C.M.

In addition, binding of Ras-GTP to the catalytic domain p110 increases PI 3-kinase activity (46Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

We demonstrated that C2-ceramide but not dihydro-C2-ceramide activates PI 3-kinase transiently after 5–20 min through a pathway that involves tyrosine kinase activity and the activation of Ras. Treatment of the fibroblasts with TNFα or sphingomyelinase for 20 min also stimulated PI 3-kinase activity through activation of tyrosine kinase activity and Ras. This work therefore identifies a novel TNFα and ceramide signaling pathway that could contribute to cellular responses such as proliferation of fibroblasts. DMEM, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. C2-ceramide (N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine), dihydro-C2-ceramide, and Ly 294002 were obtained from Biomol. Bovine serum albumin, N-oleoylethanolamine, aprotinin, leupeptin, phosphatidylinositol, human TNFα, EGF, PI, calf thymus DNA, and genistein were purchased from Sigma. 4-Amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo{3,4-d}pyrimidine (PP1) was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation, and PDGF was from Intergen. (1S,2R)-d-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (d-MAPP) was a generous gift from Drs. Y. A. Hannun and A. Bielawska. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p85α (sc-423), anti-pan Ras (sc-32, for immunoprecipitation), and anti-focal adhesion kinase were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-pan Ras (R02120, for Western analysis) was from Transduction Laboratory, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (05–321) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., and thin layer chromatography plates of Silica Gel 60 were from British Drug Houses. [γ-32P]ATP, [1-14C]acetic anhydride, anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase, and enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL) were purchased from Amersham Life Science. Sphingomyelinase and [3H]thymidine were from ICN Biomedicals. N-[14C]Acetylsphingosine was synthesized essentially by the method of Ohta et al. (49Ohta H. Ruan F. Hakomori S.-I. Igarashi Y. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and then purified by thin layer chromatography on plates of silica gel G using chloroform/methanol/NH4OH/water (80:20:0.5:0.5 v/v/v/v) for development. Rat2 fibroblasts (50Topp W.C. Virology. 1981; 113: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) were normally plated at 10,000 cells/cm2 in 10-cm culture dishes. Fibroblasts were then cultured as described previously (51Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Waggoner D.W. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23924-23932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 4–5 days until confluence. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Rat2 fibroblasts stably expressing wild type Ha-Ras and the dominant-negative mutant Ha-Ras (N17 Ras) were generated by infection with retroviruses containing the respective cDNA sequences and appropriate drug selection using 0.6 mg of Geneticin (G418)/ml or 2.5 μg of puromycin/ml, respectively. The N17 Ras containing vector was obtained from Dr. S. E. Egan, and it was subjected to DNA sequence analysis to verify the presence of the N17 mutation (52Warner L.C. Nashrudeen H. Egan S.E. Goldberg H.J. Weinberg R.A. Skorecki K.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3249-3255PubMed Google Scholar). N17 Ha-Ras is thought to form a stable inactive complex with Ras exchange factors and thereby prevents activation of endogenous Ras (53Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The N17-expressing fibroblasts contained about 28-fold more total Ras than did the Rat2 cells (Fig. 1 A). It should be noted that we purposely loaded five times more lysate protein for the parental rat2 and vector control fibroblasts to visualize the relatively low levels of expression of endogenous Ras. The increase in the number of fibroblasts expressing N17 after the third day in culture was about 30% lower than for vector control or parental rat2 fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B). The same growth trend was observed for DNA, measured by a fluorescent assay (54Labarco C. Paigan K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar), and analyzed for protein content (results not shown). In these experiments the initial seeding density was about 7,000 cells/cm2, and confluence was reached after about 6 days. Confluent cells were cultured overnight in DMEM containing 15 μm lipid-free bovine serum albumin followed by the addition of ceramide or dihydro-C2-ceramide in Me2SO (final concentration, 0.1%) as indicated. The final concentration of Me2SO was 0.08%. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in buffer A, which contained 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then sonicated twice for 10 s each and then centrifuged for 5 min at 800 ×g. After discarding the nuclei and unbroken cells, membranes were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × gfor 60 min. The pellets (membranes) were washed and resuspended in buffer A. PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (300 μg of protein) by adding 2 μg of anti-p85α or 5 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and incubating for 6 h at 4 °C with constant gentle rocking followed by adding 40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose in phosphate-buffered saline. The mixtures were incubated for overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. Identical amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (55Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% dry skim milk at 4 °C and then incubated with the primary antibody at room temperature. The immunoreactive proteins were detected using anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence. Western blots were exposed for various length of times to ensure the proportionality of the response and then analyzed densitometrically. PI 3-kinase activity was determined by measuring the formation PI 3-[32P]phosphate (56Folli F. Saad M.J.A. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22171-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cells were washed twice with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 μm Na3VO4 and then harvested in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated by incubating the cell lysates with 2 μg of anti-p85α, 5 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine, or 5 μg of anti-pan Ras antibodies for 6 h at 4 °C with constant gentle rocking followed by adding 40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose in phosphate-buffered saline. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant gentle rocking. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer I (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4) and then three times with buffer II (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mmLiCl, and 100 μm Na3VO4) followed by three times with buffer III (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmNa3VO4). Immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in 50 μl of buffer III. After adding 0.5 mmPI, the samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with constant shaking. Then 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2and 10 μl of 440 μm ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added, and the incubation was continued for 10 min with constant shaking. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 8 m HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). Lipids were separated on thin layer silica gel plates (pretreated with 10% (w/v) potassium oxalate) by development with chloroform/methanol/water/NH4OH (60:47:11:2.2 v/v/v/v). Incorporation of 32P into PI 3-phosphate was detected by autoradiography, and the activity was measured by scraping the corresponding region from the plates followed by scintillation counting (23Wang C.-N. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Ras-GTP was measured by using a nonisotopic method (57Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts overexpressing wild type Ha-Ras were treated with different agents and then lysed in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mmNaF, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. Cleared lysates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 20–30 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Ras binding domain (amino acids 1–149 of cRaf1 fused to glutathione S-transferase) that was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After three washes with lysis buffer, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 11% gels, and Ras was detected by immunoblotting with a pan Ras polyclonal antibody. Control experiments confirmed that Ras-GTP does not bind to glutathione-Sepharose beads alone. Because rat2 cells are thymidine kinase negative, we first generated a population of rat2 derivatives by infection with a retrovirus vector expressing herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase (21Gómez-Muñoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent rat2 fibroblasts containing nuclear thymidine kinase were cultured in DMEM containing 15 μm lipid-free bovine serum albumin and 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were then incubated for 24 h with TNFα or C2-ceramide, where indicated, and [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was present in the last 6 h of the incubation. Cells were then washed, and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was measured (21Gómez-Muñoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8937-8943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate cell proliferation assay, fibroblasts were treated with TNFα or C2-ceramide for 48 h and then released from the dishes by trypsinization, and cell number was determined using a Coulter counter. Ceramidase activity was measured by incubating fibroblasts for 30 min with 40 μm N-[14C]acetylsphingosine in DMEM. The cells were washed with ice-cold incubation buffer, and the combined media and resuspended cells were extracted separately with chloroform/methanol/water (final volumes, 1:1:0.9). The distribution of [14C]ceramide and [14C]acetate in the organic and aqueous phases, respectively, were determined by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad or BCA method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (58Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were determined by a fluorescent assay using calf thymus DNA as a standard (54Labarco C. Paigan K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity in cell lysates was assessed using an immune complex kinase assay that employed an anti-p85 antibody to precipitate the enzyme and using PI as a substrate. Treatment of rat2 fibroblasts with 40 μm C2-ceramide stimulated PI 3-kinase activity by 4–6-fold after 10–20 min, and the activity then decreased to the basal level by 60 min (Fig.2 A). The stimulation at 10 min was evident between 10 and 80 μm C2-ceramide with a peak at about 40 μm (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that these incubations contained 15 μmalbumin, which increases the amount of ceramide required to produce a biological effect. By comparison, the optimum increase in PI 3-kinase activity obtained after treating cells with 5 ng of PDGF/ml for 10 min was 6–8-fold (results not shown). PI 3-kinase was also assessed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies for precipitation. Under the latter conditions, PI 3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate increased by about 4.3-fold after 10 min following treatment with 40 μm C2-ceramide (Fig. 2 A). By comparison, the use of an optimum dose of PDGF (5 ng/ml) produced about an 8-fold increase after 10 min using this procedure (results not shown). Control experiments showed that similar amounts of precipitated PI 3-kinase protein were used to measure PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.2 C). We also tested whether PI 3-kinase activation by ceramide is correlated with translocation of the protein to cell membranes. Treatment with ceramide caused an approximately 2–3-fold increase in the amount of the p85 subunit detected in the particulate fraction, indicating translocation from the cytosol (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, when cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, C2-ceramide treatment increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase in a time-dependent manner (Fig.3 B). To demonstrate that these effects were specific, we treated rat2 fibroblasts with dihydro-C2-ceramide, which is a relatively inactive analog of C2-ceramide. Dihydro-C2-ceramide did not cause a significant increase in PI 3-kinase activity (0.7 ± 0.2-fold, mean ± S.E. from six independent experiments), translocation of PI 3-kinase to membranes (Fig. 3 A), or tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase. To verify that the activation of PI 3-kinase was caused by C2-ceramide itself as opposed to its conversion to sphingosine, we incubated rat2 fibroblasts with [14C]acetylsphingosine and measured its recovery and the production of [14C]acetate. Only 0.047 ± 0.019% (mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments) of the total C2-ceramide was converted to [14C]acetate after a 30-min incubation. Rat2 fibroblasts were also pretreated for 20 min with 5 μm d-MAPP or 500 μm N-oleoylethanolamine to inhibit alkaline and acid ceramidases, respectively (59Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The two inhibitors decreased the formation of [14C]acetate by 66–70% when added separately and by about 80% when added together, demonstrating their efficacies in these experiments. Treatment of rat2 fibroblasts with ceramidases inhibitors alone caused a marginal increase (1.2–1.6-fold) of PI 3-kinase activity, which is compatible with the expected increase in endogenous ceramide concentrations. The ceramidase inhibitors did not significantly affect the activation of PI 3-kinase by C2-ceramide after a 10-min incubation (Fig.4). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the activation of PI 3-kinase is caused by ceramide and not its metabolites. p21ras can activate PI 3-kinase through binding to the p110 catalytic subunit (46Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 47Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H.

Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether C2-ceramide stimulates PI 3-kinase through Ras by using fibroblasts expressing N17 Ras, which interferes with activation of endogenous Ras by exchange factors (53Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). C2-ceramide (40 μm) did not increase PI 3-kinase activity signific"

Ca2+ originates from two main sources, one of which involves the entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular space into the cell via Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. The other that has generated much interest in the last decade revolves around the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of [Ca2+]c (1Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). One of the better understood pathways concerning Ca2+release and uptake by the ER involves the application of hormones or neurotransmitters that bind to cell surface receptors activating the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of polyphosphatidylinositol lipids on the inner surface of the plasma membrane (3Hokin L.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 205-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 4Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). This leads to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), the second messenger directly responsible for the release of Ca2+ from the ER that occurs via the stimulation of InsP3 receptors situated in the ER membrane (1Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another mechanism by which Ca2+ is released from the ER implicates the ryanodine receptor family. This process is activated by several putative second messengers including Ca2+ itself (5Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar). The filled state and the reuptake of mobilized Ca2+ by the ER is mediated by a Ca2+-ATPase of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) type, which pumps Ca2+ back into the ER against the ionic gradient (6MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ concentration within the ER ([Ca2+]er) has been variously estimated to be anywhere from the low micromolar to the high millimolar range depending upon the cell type and the method of detection (7Kendall J.M. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Kendall J.M. Badminton M.N. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K. Anal.

The more widely used fluorescent Ca2+ probes such as fura2 fail to segregate specifically into intracellular organelles, and those that do localize to the ER compartment are rapidly saturated, indicating that there is a relatively high resting [Ca2+]er(17Glennon M.C. Bird G.S. Takemura O. Thastrup O. Leslie B.A. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25568-25575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other groups have reported the use of low affinity indicators to measure [Ca2+]er including mag-fura2 and mag-indo1 (18Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 85: 1091-1095Google Scholar, 20Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Again, however, due to calibration irregularities, it is difficult to measure the free lumenal [Ca2+]er with certainty. This approach is best suited for permeabilized cells or patch-clamped cells from which the cytosolic indicator can be dialyzed (21Mogami H. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1998; 15: 435-442Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) but has also been used successfully in intact cells (20Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). By exploiting the recombinant aequorin photoprotein technology it has become possible to target aequorin directly to the ER, which overcomes this problem and allows selective Ca2+ measurements to be made. This targeting is achieved by incorporating part of the immunoglobulin Igγ2b heavy chain gene upstream of the aequorin cDNA as described by Montero et al. (10Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this targeting is specific to the ER due to the interaction between the immunoglobulin heavy chain domain CH1 and the ER lumenal protein, BiP. In B lymphocytes and plasma cells this interaction will be dissociated by the arrival of the immunoglobulin light chain, but in cells that do not synthesize immunoglobulin this retention can be expected to remain unperturbed. To allow measurements in a high [Ca2+] compartment, a mutated ER-targeted aequorin was constructed that introduced a point mutation into the protein. This Asp119→ Ala mutation, previously shown to reduce the Ca2+affinity of the photoprotein (22Kendall J.M. Sala-Newby G. Ghalaut V. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), effectively shifts the detectable [Ca2+] from the 0.1 to 10 μm range to the submillimolar range anticipated in the ER. Furthermore, Monteroet al. (12Montero M. Barrero M.J. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Barrero et al. (14Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have introduced the use of an altered prosthetic group to facilitate the use of Ca2+ rather than the Ca2+ surrogate, Sr2+, in such experiments. Coelenterazine n displays lower oxidation rates than the wild type following Ca2+ binding to apoaequorin. It has been reported previously that the [Ca2+]er plays a pivotal role in the functioning of the pancreatic β-cell. As in other cell types, InsP3-generating receptor agonists mobilize Ca2+ from the ER (23Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). The pancreatic β-cells also express the ryanodine receptor, as low levels of mRNA for the type 2 receptor were reported recently (24Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekstrom T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6145-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Miura et al. (25Miura Y. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a small capacitative entry into murine β-cells facilitated by the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Moreover, studies on the proteolytic processing and intracellular transport of proinsulin and prohormone convertases in isolated rat pancreatic islets suggest that the Ca2+ required for these events originates from the ER (26Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the nutrient secretagogue, glucose, elicits Ca2+ sequestration by the ER in experiments using 45Ca2+ (Refs. 27Hellman B. Gylfe E. Wesslen N. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 383-389PubMed Google Scholarand references therein). In addition, the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol, and its second messenger InsP3, caused greater Ca2+ mobilization in broken cells (27Hellman B. Gylfe E. Wesslen N. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 383-389PubMed Google Scholar) and a higher [Ca2+]c rise in β-cells pretreated with high glucose concentrations compared with low glucose concentrations (28Gylfe E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1991; 419: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Theler J.M. Mollard P. Guerineau N. Vacher P. Pralong W.F. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18110-18117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, direct measurements of fluctuations of [Ca2+]er during the stimulation of insulin secretion are not yet available. We have used an INS-1 cell line stably expressing the ER-targeted aequorin to study directly the effects of agents that stimulate Ca2+ influx such as glucose, leucine, another nutrient secretagogue, and depolarizing concentrations of KCl. These effects were compared with those of the InsP3-producing agonists carbachol and ATP. The INS-1 cell line used throughout this study is morphologically similar to the native pancreatic β-cell sharing enzymatic and secretory profiles with the primary cells (30Asfari M. Janjic D.

We show here that INS-1 cells stably expressing high levels of mutated (Asp119 → Ala) aequorin targeted to the ER retain glucose-induced insulin secretion and provide information on the regulation of [Ca2+]er in this secretory cell system. INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium including 10% fetal calf serum and additions as described previously (30Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 32Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.-M. Pralong W.-F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin.

Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of mutated ER aequorin (erAEQmut)/pcDNA1 (see Introduction and Ref. 10Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and 2 μg pSV2neo were transfected into INS-1 cells set on a 10-cm Petri dish. Selection of clones stably expressing erAEQmut was made after several days with 0.4 μg/ml G418. The highest expresser, ER#18, was maintained in medium containing 0.25 μg/ml G418. For the luciferase-expressing cell line, the transfection was done in two separate steps using the Ca2+-phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method as outlined in Maechler et al. (33Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Measurement of the resultant luminescence was made as described previously (33Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B.

Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml on 13-mm polyornithine-coated coverslips and kept for 2–3 days prior to the experiments. Before the measurement of divalent cation in the ER could be made, the ER store had to be depleted of Ca2+ as described previously (10Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T.

This was done by a series of incubations as follows: (i) cells were washed twice briefly in Ca2+-free KRBH (135 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2 mmNaHCO3, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 2.8 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4); (ii) cells were then incubated for 5 min in Ca2+-free KRBH containing 3 mm EGTA; (iii) following this, the ER stores were emptied for 5 min in Ca2+-free KRBH containing 3 mm EGTA and 10 μm cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; Sigma) which, like thapsigargin, acts as an inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase; (iv) finally, the erAEQmut was reconstituted with 5 μmcoelenterazine n (Molecular Probes, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in Ca2+-free KRBH containing 0.1 mm EGTA and 10 μm CPA for approximately 60 min. Coelenterazine is the prosthetic group for apoaequorin (34Shimomura O. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 297-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the coelenterazine n synthetic analog displays significantly reduced Ca2+sensitivity (12Montero M. Barrero M.J. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For the permeabilized cell experiments, cells were plated on extracellular matrix-coated coverslips as described by Maechleret al. (33Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ER Ca2+ stores were emptied as above, and the erAEQmut was reconstituted with coelenterazine n. Following this procedure, cells were permeabilized withStaphylococcus α-toxin (1 μg/4–5 × 105 cells) for 8 min. As in our previous studies (33Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) the cells were perifused with an intracellular type buffer adjusted to approximately 100 nm free calcium (140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm ATP, 10.2 mm EGTA, 1.65 mm CaCl2), 500 nm free calcium (idem except 6.67 mmCaCl2), and 1.3 μm free calcium (idem except 10.0 mm CaCl2). For both intact and permeabilized cells, the coverslips were placed in a thermostatted chamber at 37 °C 5 mm from the photomultiplier apparatus (model EMI 9789, Thorn EMI Electron Tubes Ltd., Middlesex, UK) and perifused constantly at a rate of 1 ml/min in the appropriate buffer. In the case of intact cells the perifusion conditions were changed sequentially as follows. First, cells were exposed to continued 0.1 mm EGTA and 10 μm CPA. After 100 s, the CPA was removed, and the perifusion proceeded in the absence of CPA for a further 5 min to ensure complete removal of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor. Calcium was then added to the cells in a stepwise manner commencing in 0.1 mm Ca2+for 60 s before increasing the concentration to 1.5 mm. This pre-exposure to low calcium concentrations was found to slow the consumption of aequorin (possibly because it prevents an overshoot in [Ca2+]c during Ca2+ repletion) and thereby to facilitate a prolongation of the steady state in [Ca2+]er. Data were collected every second with a photon counting board (EMI 660) and calibrated according to Montero et al. (11Montero M. Alvarez J. Scheenen W.J.J. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Montero M. Barrero M.J. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that 1–5% of erAEQmut protein is missorted, which biases the calibrated [Ca2+]er (11Montero M. Alvarez J. Scheenen W.J.J. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, 2–4% of the total photon emission at the end of each trace was subtracted from the cumulative total before calibration. ER#18 cells were plated at a density of 50 × 103/ml on polyornithine-coated glass. For immunofluorescence studies, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized as described previously (32Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.-M. Pralong W.-F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T.

The antibody raised against the ER lumenal protein, calreticulin, was kindly donated by Dr. M. Michalek (Toronto, Canada). All other antibodies were from Pierce. Immunofluorescence was observed using a Zeiss laserscan 460 confocal microscope. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 in 24-well plates and allowed to settle for 2–3 days. Cellular Ca2+ stores were then emptied according to the above protocol where necessary. All cells were then preincubated for 30 min in KRBH as detailed above and subsequently stimulated for 15 min. Rat insulin in buffers and in acid-ethanol extracts of cells was measured by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard (30Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and an anti-insulin antibody from Linco (St. Louis, MO). Values are given as the means ± S.E., and the significance of differences was assessed by Student'st test for unpaired data except for rises in [Ca2+]er in Fig. 4, where the paired test was applied. Using an insulin-secreting INS-1 cell line that stably expresses aequorin targeted to the ER, we have studied the effects of several agents on the filling and the release of Ca2+ from this organelle. Thirty-three G418 resistant INS-1 cell clones were kept and of these twenty-seven expressed aequorin, nine of which displayed high expression levels. The clone ER#18, which contained the highest level of aequorin, had a total photon emission of 4.5 × 106counts/coverslip and was used throughout the study. This gives an approximate concentration of 4.4 ng of aequorin/106 cells or 1 μl of cell volume. Taking the ER as 10% of the cell volume this results in a concentration of approximately 2 μm in this organelle, a level not expected to affect [Ca2+]er by buffering the ion. Indeed, transient transfection protocols that yield variable expression levels in HeLa cells result in negligible variations of steady state [Ca2+]er (36Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the immunolocalization of the hemaggluttinin epitope-tagged aequorin expressed in the ER using an anti-hemaggluttinin antibody. The pattern of staining is identical to that observed when the cells were exposed to anti-calreticulin antibody (Fig. 1 B). This protein is known to be located in the lumen of the ER (37Bastianuto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Pizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Creveals the co-localization of the two proteins. Using this technique, no obvious missorting of the ER targeted aequorin to other cellular compartments could be detected. The calibrated [Ca2+]er values shown in Fig.2 A indicate, however, that a minor degree of missorting does occur. In particular upon readdition of Ca2+ to depleted cells, the apparent kinetics of Ca2+ concentration in the ER lumen (Fig. 2 A,thin line) was biphasic, the rapid uptake being followed by a slow decrease that eventually reached levels similar to those of depleted cells. This kinetic behavior was observed previously by Montero et al. (11Montero M. Alvarez J. Scheenen W.J.J. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and was shown to be due to a small (1–5%) fraction of aequorin missorted into a low Ca2+compartment. A close inspection of the kinetics of aequorin consumption in fact revealed that, as in the case of Montero et al.(11Montero M. Alvarez J. Scheenen W.J.J. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the decrease in the calibrated [Ca2+]eroccurred when over 80% of total aequorin content had been consumed (data not shown). A simple, practical solution to avoid the calibration artifact due to missorted aequorin is the elimination from the final algorithm of 2–4% of the total light emission. With this simple trick, the calibrated kinetics of Ca2+ refilling (Fig.2 A, thick line) are as expected, i.e.rapid uptake followed by a prolonged steady state plateau. It is worth stressing that the plateau level is almost identical to the peak of [Ca2+]er measured without the correction and that no significant elevation in steady state [Ca2+]er is generated if the fraction of missorted aequorin is varied between 2–5% of total (data not shown and see Ref. 11Montero M. Alvarez J. Scheenen W.J.J. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The plateau phase of [Ca2+]er occurs at around 300 μm (267 ± 9 μm; n = 20 independent experiments) and can last for several minutes, particularly if the temperature at which the experiment is performed is lowered to 22 °C (data not shown). The kinetics of the filling of the ER as well as the level of the observed steady state is influenced by the extracellular [Ca2+] as illustrated in Fig.2 B. The localization of the aequorin to InsP3-sensitive stores shown in Fig. 1 is further substantiated by the results obtained with receptor agonists known to activate phospholipase C and to raise [Ca2+]c in this cell system (32Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.-M. Pralong W.-F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Rutter G.A. Theler J.-M. Li G. Wollheim C.B. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Carbachol (100 μm) elicits Ca2+ mobilization from the ER as evidenced by a marked decrease in the [Ca2+]er (Fig.3 A, thin line). This effect is mediated by the activation of muscarinic receptors because the addition of atropine not only prevented the carbachol effect (data not shown) but also caused a more rapid refilling of the stores than occurs after simple removal of the agonist (Fig.3 A, thick line). The addition of extracellular ATP that activates P2Y receptors in insulin-secreting cells (39Li G.D. Milani D. Dunne M.J. Pralong W.-F. Theler J.-M. Petersen O.H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3449-3457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also causes a sustained decrease in the levels of [Ca2+]er (Fig. 3 B). It has been reported previously that 4-chloro-m-cresol raises [Ca2+]c in HIT-T15 cells (40Li G. Wollheim C.B. Pralong W.F. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). That this effect is exerted through activation of ryanodine receptors in the ER (24Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekstrom T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6145-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) is suggested by the results in Fig. 3 C. At 500 μm, 4-chloro-m-cresol caused an almost complete and irreversible emptying of [Ca2+]er. In the presence of 0.1 mm 4-chloro-m-cresol the lowering of [Ca2+]er was slower, but the steady state reached was similar to that observed with 0.5 mm (data not shown). As expected, the SERCA inhibitor, CPA, efficiently lowered [Ca2+]er. Removal of the inhibitor results in an almost complete refilling because a new steady state similar to that observed before the addition of CPA is reached again after approximately 3 min (Fig. 3 D). It should be noted that the initial phase of emptying of the ER Ca2+ store was more rapid with the InsP3-generating agent carbachol than with CPA, because 20% lowering of [Ca2+]er was 50% slower with the latter agent. This is in accordance with observations using histamine in HeLa cells (12Montero M. Barrero M.J. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although it has been established that ER refilling after Ca2+ mobilization is due to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium, it is less clear whether Ca2+entry invariably causes filling of the ER compartment. To investigate this, the insulin secretagogues glucose, leucine, and KCl were used, which all raise [Ca2+]c in β-cells by membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (23Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar, 32Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.-M. Pralong W.-F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), thereby promoting Ca2+influx from the extracellular space. Glucose caused an average increase in [Ca2+]er of 35 ± 13 μm(p"

The results of these studies showed that increasing the helicity of this leader would compensate for reduced import from positive charge substitutions of arginine with glutamine or the insertion of negative charged residues made in the native leader. In this in vivo study, utilizing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a passenger protein, import results showed the opposite effect with respect to helicity, but the results from mutations made within the native leader sequence were consistent between the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Leader mutations that reduced the efficiency of import resulted in a cytosolic accumulation of a truncated GFP chimera that was fluorescent but devoid of a mitochondrial leader. The native leader efficiently imported before GFP could achieve a stable, import-incompetent structure, suggesting that import was coupled with translation. As a test for a co-translational mechanism, a chimera of GFP that contained the native leader of aldehyde dehydrogenase attached at the N terminus and a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal attached to the C terminus of GFP was constructed. This chimera was localized exclusively to mitochondria. The import result with the dual signal chimera provides support for a co-translational mitochondrial import pathway.

This chimera was localized exclusively to mitochondria. The import result with the dual signal chimera provides support for a co-translational mitochondrial import pathway. The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA and are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes as precursor proteins. As a consequence of their cellular location during synthesis, mitochondrial proteins must be specifically targeted to the organelle and be imported. The N-terminal portion of these precursor proteins possesses a leader sequence that contains sufficient information to be recognized by the mitochondrial import apparatus, leading to import into mitochondria. Mitochondrial presequences do not share any primary sequence identity, but they do show a statistical bias of positively charged amino acid residues, provided mostly through arginine residues; very few presequences contain negatively charged amino acids (1von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The positive charges in the presequences have the potential to interact with the negatively charged surface of mitochondrial membranes (2Roise D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial import receptor (3Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R. Schatz G. Mihara K.

Numerous two-dimensional NMR studies of peptides corresponding to mitochondrial leaders show that these leaders do form an amphiphilic helix and have provided more structural detail in showing different structural motifs between leader sequences (8Bruch M.D. Hoyt D.W.

Thus, there is an apparent charge and structural component needed to target precursor proteins to the mitochondria. Mutations designed to study the role of positive charge, structure, or hydrophobicity of leader sequences have been performed under in vitro conditions (14Bedwell D.M. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Mol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17233-17236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this setting, numerous cytosolic components that assist the import process may be absent or in limited quantity due to the conditions of the assay. Due to the membrane binding property of leaders, in an in vivo setting the leader sequence may additionally need to discriminate among the various organelles (6Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Although there is an apparent preference of the leader for the lipid composition found in mitochondria, potential nonspecific interactions with membrane surfaces of other organelles may hinder the process of locating mitochondria, especially in mutants designed to study the import properties of the signal. Additionally, the total number of positive charges of the leader may be more important in vivo although in vitro experiments have shown that numerous positive charges can be removed without apparent interference with import. Thus, out of the diversity among all mitochondrial leader sequences, positive charges, structural motif, and the hydrophobicity of the leader may be balanced to minimize nonspecific membrane binding that may not be detected in vitro (15Bedwell D.M.

Either the native rat pALDH presequence plus the first 23 amino acid residues from the mature region (SP1) or the native ALDH presequence plus the mitochondrial processing peptidase recognition site (SP2) were fused to the N terminus of EGFP (a variant of native GFP) by the splicing by overlap extension PCR method (20Ho S.N.

All constructs were confirmed by sequencing the pALDH leader sequence, the N- and C-terminal EGFP fusion region, and the the ER-targeting signal sequence. HeLa cells were plated on coverslips in six-well plates in 3 ml of growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum) the day before transfection. The cells were 40–80% confluent on the day of transfection. The cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA at 37 °C for 2–3 h using the SuperFect Transfection Reagent from QIAGEN. Between 10 and 72 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed on the coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were observed with an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope. Culture and transfection of HeLa cells was performed as described above, except that 100-mm dishes and 10 μg of plasmids were used for the transfection. The whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Monoclonal antibody against Aequoria victoria GFP was used as the primary antibody; the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the second antibody. Culture and transfection of HeLa cells were performed as described above, except that 150-mm dishes and 20 μg of plasmid DNA were used for the transfection. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and then resuspended in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4.

The homogenate was centrifuged with an SS34 rotor at 3,000 rpm for 15 min to pellet the unbroken cells and the nucleus. The supernatant was centrifuged with an SS34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 20 min to obtain the mitochondria-rich fraction. HeLa cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and then resuspended in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The cells were homogenized by using a Polytron homogenizer for 30 s at 10,500 rpm. To remove the unbroken cells, the nucleus, and the mitochondria, the homogenates were centrifuged with an SS34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The cytosolic supernatant was removed, aliquoted, and saved at −70 °C. Radiolabeled SP1-EGFP, SP1(R3Q)-EGFP, and EGFP were produced by the TNT coupled transcription and translation with the pGEM7Zf(+) constructs in the presence of [35S]methionine following the manufacturer's instruction. The in vitro translated proteins were mixed with the HeLa cell cytosol extracts in equal volume at room temperature for fixed periods of time. EGFP was added in the both the SP1-EGFP and SP1-(R3Q)-EGFP incubations to test for protease resistance over the time points used. An aliquot was withdrawn and added to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis treatment buffer, which contained protease inhibitors. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and labeled proteins were visualized by Bio-Rad phosphor imaging.

Cells that were transiently expressing EGFP displayed an observable fluorescence that was distributed throughout the whole cell, including the nucleus (Fig.2), as shown by others (32Yano M.

Specific targeting of EGFP to any subcellular organelle was not observed. Cells, which expressed the EGFP protein with an attached pALDH mitochondrial leader sequence, displayed fluorescence localized to mitochondria. Rhodamine 123, a mitochondrial specific stain was used to visually confirm EGFP targeting to the organelle (data not shown). Portions of some cells that expressed pALDH-EGFP appeared to have cytosolic fluorescence. This was due to the fluorescence of mitochondria above and below the focal plane of the cell. To further verify that the pALDH-EGFP protein was localized to the mitochondria, cells that were transiently expressing pALDH-EGFP were analyzed by a Western blot to determine the molecular weight of the expressed protein. As shown in Fig. 3, a band of 30 kDa was observed, consistent with the imported and processed 32-kDa pALDH-EGFP chimera. The fluorescence microscopy and Western blot results from the transient expression of the EGFP and pALDH-EGFP demonstrated that the leader sequence of pALDH could target EGFP into the mitochondria.Figure 3Western blot of HeLa cells transiently expressing SP1 and SP2 constructs. The whole cell extracts of HeLa cells expressing the native and mutated SP1-EGFP (A) or SP2-GFP chimeras (B) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by a Western blot. The nontransfected HeLa cells were used as the negative control. The HeLa cells expressing EGFP were used as the positive control. A, the 30-kDa band corresponding to SP1-EGFP is the expected molecular weight of the imported and processed protein.

Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, under in vivo conditions, R3Q and R10Q were capable of targeting EGFP to mitochondria, but cytosolic and nuclear fluorescence were observed, indicating that not all of the precursor proteins were imported. The R3Q and R10Q mutants were not imported at similar levels, since the cytosolic fluorescence of EGFP appeared to be greater with the R3Q mutant. The double mutant R3Q(R10Q) was the most impaired of the three mutants, since fluorescence was mostly observed in the cytosol. The in vivo results with the Arg to Gln mutations in the first helix were consistent with the in vitro results. However, two unexpected properties emerged in subsequent in vivo experiments. First, there was no apparent necessity for positive charges in the C-helix of the native leader. In vitro, the two arginines in the C-helix of the native leader could be substituted with glutamines as single point mutations with no effect on import, but substituting both positive charges with glutamine resulted in a 2-fold reduction in import. However, in vivo, substitution of both C-helix arginines with glutamine did not effect import. The second unexpected result was that the linker-deleted leader was imported poorly in vivo, whereas it was found to import better than the native leader in vitro. Removing the helix-breaking residues of RGP in the sequence in the native leader allows the leader to form a continuous helix. This property has been shown to consistently recover in vitro import in mutations of the native leader that reduced or eliminated import. In the in vitro experiments, the R3Q(R10Q) mutation in the native leader essentially eliminated import, but the R3Q(R10Q)-RGP leader restored import to approximately 50% of native level. In the in vivoexperiments, the pALDH-RGP imported less than native as shown in Fig.2, and the R3Q(R10Q)-RGP leader was essentially nonfunctional. The import properties of the pALDH leader were shown to be surprisingly tolerant to the mutagenic introduction of negatively charged amino acids, provided that the charge of first helix of the leader remained positive (33Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29389-29393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the import of the S7E was less than native level, and the S7E(R11E) mutant did not appear to import, consistent with the in vitro results. Although the first helix of the leader remained positive in the S7E mutant, the loss of import in the S7E(R11E) mutant was probably due to the negative charge being placed adjacent to the first helix. In contrast to S7E(R11E), the S7E(R14E) was imported in vivo. The S7E(R14E) mutant surpassed the ability of the native leader to import in vitro, but there appears to be only a slight reduction in import from what was observed with the S7E mutant in vivo. The S7E(R14E) mutant does not have the additional negative charge adjacent to the first helix to influence the apparent critical positive charge in the first helix. The results of these in vivo experiments reveal that positive charges necessary for import are identical to those necessary for locating the mitochondria and do not require all five positive charges. After the precursor proteins are imported into mitochondria, many of the leader sequences are proteolytically removed by a matrix space peptidase. The pALDH leader sequence contains a terminal -RLLS- sequence, which serves as the recognition site for the matrix-processing protein (5Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As a direct measure of import in transfected HeLa cells, we harvested cells expressing the various constructs of EGFP and analyzed them by a Western blot using monoclonal antibodies against EGFP. For the majority of the precursor proteins used in this in vivo study, a 30-kDa protein would be the expected molecular mass of an imported and processed protein. The R17Q and R14Q(R17Q) mutants have lost the peptidase recognition motif, and these leaders were not proteolytically removed by the peptidase in rat liver mitochondria (5Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Additionally, the pALDH-RGP and R3Q(R10Q)-RGP leaders were also nonprocessable leaders, although they contain the recognition site (5Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These nonprocessable proteins should retain the leader after import and display a molecular mass of 32 kDa. As shown in Fig. 3 A (lane 4), the native pALDH-EGFP leader resolved to the predicted, processed mass of 30 kDa. No observable precursor band of 32 kDa was observed, suggesting that little, if any, of the precursor protein remained in the cytosol. If a processable mutant leader was less capable of importing EGFP, we would expect to observe a 32-kDa band and a 30-kDa band in the Western blot, corresponding to the nonimported precursor and the imported and processed protein, respectively. Mutant leader sequences that reduced import displayed the expected 30-kDa band, indicative of import and processing, but also displayed an unexpected 28-kDa band, Fig. 3. This 28-kDa band corresponds to the molecular mass of EGFP, which apparently had lost the entire N-terminal fusion sequence due to nonspecific proteolysis. For many of the mutant leader sequences, the intensity of the 28-kDa band found in the Western blot paralleled the pattern of cytosolic fluorescence shown in Fig. 2. Good import of the native protein resulted in a single 30-kDa band, and less efficient import resulted in both a 30- and 28-kDa band. Total loss of import resulted in a single 28-kDa band. An unexpected band was observed for the nonprocessed leaders, pALDH-RGP, R17Q, and R14Q(R17Q). Data are shown only for pALDH-RGP in Fig. 3 A (lane 8). These proteins all displayed a 30-kDa band, suggesting that they were processed. This was not observed in our previous in vitro import studies using rat liver mitochondria or processing studies with purified mitochondrial processing peptidase (11Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sjoling S. Waltner M. Kalousek F. Glaser E. Weiner H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A Western blot of isolated mitochondria from HeLa cells expressing either the native or linker-deleted EGFP constructs displayed a 30-kDa band for both proteins (data not shown). Based on the current knowledge of the processing motifs of matrix space processing enzymes, we cannot offer an explanation for the removal of the leaders in some of the mutants used in these experiments. However, independent of how the pALDH-RGP leader could be processed, the experimental evidence does point to a mitochondrial proteolysis as the source of the 30-kDa bands observed in these Western blots. The observation of cytosolic fluorescence in the microscopy experiments with the import-impaired constructs indicates that EGFP could properly fold and was resistant to proteolysis. To discern whether or not the mutations made in the leader were susceptible to proteolysis, thereby corrupting the signal, the native leader and the R3Q m"

In the present study, we report that mutant GPCR can affect the functional properties of the co-expressed wild type (WT) receptor. Mutants of the human platelet-activating factor receptor that fail to show any detectable ligand binding (N285I and K298stop) or coupling to a G-protein (D63N, D289A, and Y293A) were co-expressed with the WT receptor in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells. In this context, N285I and K298stop mutant receptors inhibited3H-WEB2086 binding and surface expression. Co-transfection with D63N resulted in a constitutively active receptor phenotype. Platelet-activating factor-induced inositol phosphate production in cells transfected with a 1:1 ratio of WT:D63N was higher than with the WT cDNA alone but was abolished with a 1:3 ratio. We confirmed that these findings could be extended to other GPCRs by showing that co-expression of the WT C-C chemokine receptor 2b with a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant (K311stop), resulted in a decreased affinity and responsiveness to MCP-1. A better understanding of this phenomenon could lead to important tools for the prevention or treatment of certain diseases.

For example, platelet-activating factor (PAF) 1The abbreviations used are: PAF, platelet-activating factor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CCR, C-C chemokine receptor; hCCR2, human C-C chemokine receptor 2; hPAFR, human platelet-activating factor receptor; IP, inositol phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; WT, wild type; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary1The abbreviations used are: PAF, platelet-activating factor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CCR, C-C chemokine receptor; hCCR2, human C-C chemokine receptor 2; hPAFR, human platelet-activating factor receptor; IP, inositol phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; WT, wild type; CHO, Chinese hamster ovaryis involved in embryogenesis as well as in modulation of a variety of functions of the immune and central nervous systems (1MacLennan K.M.

Lipid Mediators. 1990; 2: 123-158PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to PAF, for which the only known receptor is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, the diversity of responses generated is likely a result of the receptor coupling to different signaling pathways in the target cells (3Hwang S.-B. J. Lipid Mediators. 1990; 2: 123-158PubMed Google Scholar, 4Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for other ligands such as adrenaline and dopamine, the cell can also determine the specificity of its response by the differential expression of receptor subtypes with distinct characteristics of binding, coupling, and desensitization (5Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Subtypes of a given receptor can be derived from distinct genes or generated by alternative splicing. Divergence between receptor isoforms, as for the prostaglandin (EP) and the MCP-1 (CCR2) receptors, is most often limited to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a region that is potentially involved in G-protein coupling, internalization, and down-regulation of the receptors (6Kotani M. Tanaka I. Ogawa Y. Usui T. Mori K. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Yoshimi T. Nakao K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 869-879PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing can also lead to the formation of nonfunctional receptors or receptors with certain functions that are greatly modified (8Okuda-Ashitaka E. Sakamoto K. Ezashi T. Miwa K. Ito S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31255-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Liu K. Bergson C. Levenson R. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29220-29226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individually, these receptors are not involved in signaling, but some of them can show dominant-negative properties when co-expressed with a functional subtype. It has recently been demonstrated that the expression of a truncated isoform of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor could affect the extent of agonist-specific cellular response by inhibiting the cell surface expression of the functional isoform (10Grosse R. Schöneberg T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A similar effect, that of confining the WT receptor intracellularly, was also reported for a deletion mutant (Δ32) of the CCR5 receptor, conferring a certain level of resistance to human immunodeficiency virus infection and delayed onset of acquired immune deficiency syndrome to heterozygous individuals (11Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). All the evidence of the dominant-negative effect of these truncated receptors points toward their capacity to form heterocomplexes with their respective WT functional receptors (8Okuda-Ashitaka E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The ability of an EP1 receptor isoform to inhibit signaling by EP1 as well as EP4 receptors suggests an association between the different receptor subtypes (8Okuda-Ashitaka E. Sakamoto K. Ezashi T. Miwa K. Ito S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31255-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The formation of heterocomplexes between different receptor subtypes may be an efficient mechanism to control the cellular response. For example, using immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical studies, hetero-oligomerization between isoforms of the rat D3 dopaminergic receptor has been shown to occur in vivo (12Nimchinsky E.A.

They also demonstrated that exposure to an inverse agonist promoted the monomeric form. Thus, GPCRs could show similarities with the growth factor and cytokine receptors, whose activation depends on their transition from monomers to oligomers (25Lemon M.A. Bu Z.M. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M.

The GPCRs are involved in a multitude of fundamental processes in higher eukaryotes such as development, homeostasis, and the transfer and integration of information (27Watson S. Arkinstall S.

The dominance phenomenon observed with some receptor isoforms and the evidence of a connection between oligomerization and activation raise the possibility of the existence of genetic diseases caused by GPCRs with dominant properties. In an attempt to verify whether some mutations could generate a dominant phenotype, two members of the GPCR family, the hPAFR and a splice variant (hCCR2b) of the human MCP-1 receptor, were co-expressed with mutant receptors incapable of undergoing an agonist-stimulated response or altered in other functions. Cell surface expression, ligand binding, and signaling characteristics were then evaluated. For the hPAFR, the WT receptor was co-transfected with the substitution mutants N285I (37Parent J.-L.

Substitutions of a highly conserved aspartate in the second transmembrane domain (D63N) or in the conserved motif D/NPXXY of the seventh transmembrane domain (D289A) lead to a receptor with reduced internalization capacity but with an increased affinity for PAF (37Parent J.-L.

We also co-expressed the WT hCCR2b and a carboxyl terminus deletion mutant (K311stop), which did not show any detectable 125I-MCP-1 binding capacity, to evaluate whether our observations for the hPAFR could be extended to another member of the GPCR family. The WT hPAFR cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Ye (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The mutant hPAFR-encoding cDNAs were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and characterized as described previously (37Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. Escher E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Staņková J.

The WT hPAFR was subcloned into the pJ3M (tagged with c-myc) and pJ3H (tagged with hemagglutinin) expression vectors (kindly provided by Dr. J. Chernoff, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). hCCR2b WT encoding cDNA was amplified from MonoMac1 total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR using oligonucleotides CKR2-FWD (5′-CGGGATCCCTGTCCACATCTCGTTCTTGGTTTATCAGA-3′) and CKR2b-RVS (5′-GGGGTACCTTATAAACCAGCCGAGACTTCCTGCTCCCC-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI-Acc65I and subcloned into the pJ3M expression vector. The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant K311stop was constructed by PCR using the CCR2-FWD primer and oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGGTACCTCGAGTCGCGACTACTCCCCRACRAACGCGTAGATGATGGG-3′, and the PCR product was subcloned into BamHI-Acc65I of pJ3M. All constructions were sequenced (University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada). COS-7 and CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 30-mm dishes (2.0 × 105 COS-7 cells/dish or 3.0 × 105 CHO cells/dish) and transiently transfected with the constructions encoding WT and mutant receptors or dynamin Ia K44A (a kind gift from M. G. Caron, Duke University, Durham, NC) using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the indicated quantity of cDNA for each clone per dish. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For each experiment, the transfected cDNA quantities were adjusted with the expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Competition binding curves were done on CHO cells co-expressing the WT and mutant receptors. Cells expressing hPAFR were harvested and washed twice in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Preparation of membrane fractions and 3H-WEB2086 (DuPont New England Nuclear) binding on membranes or intact cells were carried out as described previously (39Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Staņková J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For 125I-MCP-1 (Amersham Corp.) binding, cells expressing hCCR2b were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Binding reactions were carried out on 5 × 105 cells in a total volume of 100 μl of Hepes binding buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 50 mmHepes, pH 7.2) containing 100 pm125I-MCP-1 and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive MCP-1 for 90 min at 25 °C. The free radioactivity was separated from the cells by centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque. The radioactivity contained in the cell pellet was counted on a LKB γ counter. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with WT and mutant receptor cDNA and, in the case of hCCR2b, also with the G-protein subunit Gα14 (a generous gift from Dr. Melvin I. Simon (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA)). Cells were labeled the following day for 18–24 h withmyo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Corp.) at 3 μCi/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol; Life Technologies, Inc.). After labeling, cells were washed and preincubated for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C. The phosphate-buffered saline was removed, and cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm LiCl for 5 min (hPAFR) or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing only 10 mm LiCl for 10 min (hCCR2b). Cells were then stimulated for 1 min with the indicated concentrations of PAF or for 30 min with MCP-1. The reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid. Inositol phosphates were extracted and separated on Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) columns. Total labeled inositol phosphates were then counted by liquid scintillation. CHO and COS-7 cells co-transfected with c-myc-tagged hPAFR WT receptor and N285I or D63N constructions were harvested between 48 and 72 h after transfection, and 2.5 × 105 cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. For receptor expression studies (surface staining), labeling with anti-c-myc antibody (9E10 hybridoma; American Type Culture Collection) was performed as described previously (37Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. Escher E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Staņková J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23298-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For internalization inhibitor studies, at 48 h after transfection, cells were pretreated with the internalization inhibitors concanavalin A (0.25 mg/ml, 20 min), sucrose (0.45 m, 20 min), and NH4Cl (10 mm, 10 min) or not pretreated. Cell surface receptor expression was evaluated with an anti-c-myc antibody 30 min after pretreatment. For phophotyrosine staining (40Far F.D. Peyron J.F. Imbert V. Rossi B. Cytometry. 1994; 15: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (0.5% in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min at 4 °C, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, and then labeled overnight with mouse monoclonal anti-phophotyrosine antibody (pTyr-01; a generous gift of Drs. P. Angelisova and V. Horejsi, Prague, Czech Republic). The secondary antibody used in these studies was a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio/Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and labeling was as performed as described previously (37Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. Escher E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Staņková J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23298-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All measures were performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). COS-7 cells co-transfected with WT and pCDNA3 (WT) or WT and D63N (WT+D63N) in a 1:3 ratio were cultivated as described above and lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3V04, 1 mmNa2P207, 1 mm NaF, and 10 mg/ml of the protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin. After the removal of debris by centrifugation, whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine were revealed with anti-pTyr-01 and the ECL detection system (Amersham). Ligand binding was evaluated after co-transfection of WT hPAFR cDNA and different mutant constructs in CHO cells. 3H-WEB2086 binding characteristics were determined by competition with WEB2086. Affinity was not affected by co-expression of the D63N, D289A, or Y293A mutant receptors when compared with cells expressing only the WT (Fig.1 A; TableI). In contrast, the N285I mutant receptor was efficient at preventing WEB2086 binding to either whole cells or membrane preparations (Fig. 1 B). In Fig.1 B, results obtained for 3H-WEB2086 binding and cell surface expression (assessed by flow cytometry) were relative to those of cells expressing only the WT receptor (defined as 100%). Co-expression of the N285I mutant with the WT receptor also caused a significant decrease of cell surface expression of both receptors (Fig.1 B). Although WEB2086 binding was almost completely inhibited (3 ± 1%, residual binding) at a 1:1 ratio, the loss of surface expression of these receptors was only partial (23 ± 8%, residual expression). These results suggested the existence of receptors on the cell surface that are incapable of binding WEB2086. In addition, it is of interest to note that the cell surface expression of the co-expressed receptors was significantly lower (23 ± 8%) than that of the WT (defined as 100%) or of the N285I (65 ± 15%) mutant receptor expressed alone (Fig. 1 B). Confocal microscopy showed that the hemagglutinin-tagged WT and the c-myc-tagged N285I mutant receptors were efficiently expressed on the cell surface. The N285I mutant receptors, however, were not as evenly distributed and seemed to aggregate. When co-expressed, the distribution of these receptors changed to being localized intracellularly, for the most part (results not illustrated). The decreased cell surface expression was not due to an increased internalization rate of the co-transfected receptors because inhibitors of internalization failed to modify the distribution of WT+N285I complexes. No accumulation of receptors on the cell surface was observed by FACScan analysis (WT+N285I untreated, 29 ± 12%; NH4Cl, 31 ± 1.8%; sucrose, 31 ± 8%; dynamin K44A, 15 ± 8%; the percentages are in relation to WT expressed alone after undergoing the same treatment and set at 100%), although these inhibitors have been shown to efficiently block the internalization of hPAFR (38Le Gouill C.

Receptor densities (B max) are indicated in receptor/cell, and dissociation constants (K i) are indicated in nM. The results are the means ± S.E. of three independent determinations. The influence of the K298stop mutant was comparable to N285I, and the extent of inhibition of expression and 3H-WEB2086 binding was dependent on the amount of co-transfected mutant cDNA, even to membrane preparations (data not shown). The similar effects of these two mutants suggest a comparable conformational change induced by the N285I substitution and the deletion of the last 44 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus (K298stop) in the seventh transmembrane domain. We next characterized the binding and cellular response to PAF in cells co-expressing the same combination of constructs, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Affinity for the agonist was assessed by competition of 3H-WEB2086 binding by PAF (Fig.2 A). Transfection conditions were such that high receptor expression levels were attained, allowing for the measurement of binding properties independent of G-protein coupling (41Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding isotherms were all uniphasic and were indicative of only one detectable class of binding sites, even in cells co-expressing receptors with different affinities (Fig. 2 A). For instance, the D63N mutant has an ∼6.7-fold higher affinity for PAF than the WT receptor when expressed individually (39Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Staņková J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but after co-expression with the WT receptor, the apparent affinity was only ∼1.9-fold higher than that of the WT alone (Table I). Similar results were obtained with D289A, which displays a ∼2.8-fold higher affinity than the WT when expressed alone (37Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. Escher E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Staņková J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23298-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and an apparent increase in affinity of 1.3-fold over the WT when these two receptors are co-expressed. These results suggest that a large proportion of the cell surface receptors, which bind WEB2086 and PAF, could be in an associated form of mutant/WT receptors. Co-expression of the WT and Y293A receptors resulted in an apparent affinity very similar to the one displayed by the WT alone. Evaluation of PAF affinity after co-expression of WT and N285I or K298stop receptors could not be done using 3H-WEB2086 because the level of specific binding was negligible. High levels of nonspecific 3H-PAF binding on membrane preparations also prevented an accurate evaluation of PAF binding (data not shown).Figure 2PAF binding and response in IP accumulation of cells co-expressing WT and mutant hPAFRs.

Currently ARNT is known to be involved in such diverse cell signaling events as xenobiotic response (AhR·ARNT dimers), and hypoxic response (HIF1α·ARNT and EPAS·ARNT dimers), as well as pathways involving central midline and central nervous system development (Sim·ARNT) (2Ko H.P.

Importantly, null ARNT allele mice are not viable past embryonic day 10.5, are defective in angiogenesis, and have impaired development (5Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), demonstrating that ARNT plays an essential role in normal cellular metabolism, growth, and development. Finally, the potential importance of regulating ARNT's activity in these different bHLH-PAS dimer contexts is further underscored by the apparent involvement of one of ARNT's dimerization partners, Sim, in mammalian central nervous system development and Down's syndrome (6Yamaki A. Noda S. Kudoh J. Shindoh N. Maeda H. Minoshima S. Kawasaki K. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1996; 35: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ARNT is a phosphoprotein that contains discreet, functionally defined domains. DNA binding and the formation of ARNT heterodimers involves the NH2-terminal half of this protein, which contains a basic region, a helix-loop-helix motif, and the PAS domain (7Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), with these latter two domains being required for optimal dimerization. The COOH-terminal 34 amino acids of ARNT can act as a TAD (8Sogawa K. Iwabuchi K. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but in the AhR·ARNT and HIF1α·ARNT heterodimer contexts the ARNT TAD is not absolutely required for transactivation of target genes (2Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Wilson C. Wormke M. Castro-Rivera E. Hoivik D.J. Safe S. J. Soc. Toxicol. 1998; 42: 247Google Scholar), but appears to be required for a maximal transcriptional response. These observations suggest that modulation of ARNT's transactivation potential 2In this work, “transactivation potential” refers to the ability of a given, assembled, transcription factor complex to activate responsive genes.2In this work, “transactivation potential” refers to the ability of a given, assembled, transcription factor complex to activate responsive genes. in the variety of different dimer contexts involving this bHLH-PAS protein may be an important mechanism contributing to the combinatorial transcriptional regulation of target genes. c-Myc and USF-1 both belong to the bHLH-ZIP family of transcription factors and are capable of transactivating class B, E-box (5′-CACGTG-3′) regulated genes (10Gupta S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), human cyclin B1 (19Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), among others. Importantly, the ability of c-Myc to transactivate class B, E-box-driven reporter constructs is modulated by the phosphorylation status of c-Myc (10Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 6176-6183PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, MAP kinases can phosphorylate Ser-62 of c-Myc in vitro (21Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and modulate c-Myc phosphorylation and transactivation potential in vivo (22Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the serine/threonine kinases PKA and PKC may directly, or indirectly, modulate the ability of c-Myc and USF-1 to transactivate class B, E-box-responsive genes. Recently it has been demonstrated that the bHLH-PAS protein ARNT is capable of forming homodimers that bind class B E-boxes and, like the bHLH-ZIP proteins c-Myc and USF-1, can transactivate class B, E-box-driven reporter constructs (1Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 24Antonsson C. Arulampalam V. Whitelaw M.L. Pettersson S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Like c-Myc, hARNT is predominantly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, suggesting serine/threonine kinases such as PKC and PKA may also be involved, directly or indirectly, in the regulation of ARNT's transactivation potential. A study of the potential regulatory role of the PKC and PKA serine/threonine kinase pathways, in the context of the hARNT·hARNT homodimer, was undertaken to begin to understand the regulation of hARNT's transactivation potential and ultimately the role of ARNT in the combinatorial control of such diverse biological phenomena as xenobiotic-induced toxicity, hypoxic response, central nervous system development, Down syndrome, and other, as yet, unexplored pathways. An important benefit of examining the role of PKC- or PKA-mediated modulation of ARNT transactivation potential in the ARNT homodimer context is that this model is uncomplicated by the presence of ARNT's heterologous dimerization partners. Additionally, the COS-1 model system described here allows the role of PKC and PKA in modulating the transactivation potential of the bHLH-ZIP transcription factors, c-Myc and USF-1, to be examined and compared with the ability of these kinase pathways to regulate the transactivation potential of the bHLH-PAS transcription factor hARNT. In the COS-1 model system presented here, comparison of the consequences of 81 nm PMA and 1 nm 8-Br-cAMP treatments on hARNT-, c-Myc-, and USF-1-driven transactivation of the class B, E-box-driven, reporter construct pMyc3E1bLuc revealed that these compounds have differential effects on the transactivation potentials of these transcription factors. In contrast to the bHLH-ZIP proteins USF-1 and c-Myc, the transactivation potential of the bHLH-PAS protein hARNT is shown to be enhanced approximately 2-fold by both PMA and 8-Br-cAMP, presumably through stimulation of the PKC and PKA serine/threonine kinase pathways. Importantly, these results may indicate that the previously reported ability of PKC to enhance hAhR·hARNT heterodimer-driven transactivation (26Long W.P. Pray-Grant M. Tsai J.C. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) may, at least in part, be due to ARNT's contribution to the transactivation potential of this heterodimer. Taken as a whole, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that the transactivation potential of ARNT in a dimer context can be specifically modulated by PKC or PKA stimulation and that the bHLH-PAS and bHLH-ZIP transcription factors are differentially regulated by these pathways in COS-1 cells.

Yikika Y. Tanaka A. Shimamura S. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All plasmids were propagated inEscherichia coli strain DH5α (supE44lacU169 (φ80 lacZ M15) hsdR17recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1relA1). FBS was obtained from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Opti-MEM® was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Trypsin/EDTA, PBS, and α-MEM were from Sigma. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 94% air, 6% CO2. COS-1 cells to be transiently transfected were grown to 80% confluence in tissue culture vessels and transfected with plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 14 h in complete medium prior to treatment with compounds for 6 h. Cell lysates were then prepared and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Transfected, treated COS-1 cells were washed twice with PBS prior to lysis. Cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega® luciferase assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as specified by the manufacturer. Light output was measured for 15 s at 25 °C using a TD-20e Luminometer (Turner Designs, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the Promega® β-galactosidase assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and spectrophotometrically monitored atA 420 nm as specified by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was expressed as RLU perA 420 nm unit. Protein content of lysates used in luciferase and β-galactosidase assays was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). COS-1 cells were grown to 80% confluence, transfected in 60 × 15-mm tissue culture dishes, washed twice with PBS, and incubated in complete medium for 20 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then covered in 0.4 ml of HSTD lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 17,350 × g, and protein content was determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Protein samples were separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE (3.96% stacking gel/7.92% running gel) for 2.5 h at 30 V, followed by 18 h at 60 V. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrophorectically transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Transfers were performed at 8 V for 6 h in a Genie electroblot unit (Idea Scientific Co., Minneapolis, MN) in transfer buffer (20 mm Tris, 185 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol). Following protein transfer the membrane was blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS containing 10 mmNa2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 for 30 min at 25 °C. The blots were rinsed once in blot wash buffer consisting of 0.1% (w/v) BSA in PBS containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20. The ARNT-specific mAb 2B10 was generated as described (30Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-626PubMed Google Scholar) while the FLAG (M2)-specific mAb was from Kodak Imaging Systems (Rochester, NY). Blots were incubated with mAb 2B10 (1 μg/ml) or M2 (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three 10-min rinses with blot wash buffer. mAb 2B10 probed blots were then incubated with goat anti-mouse HRP-IgG conjugate (1 μg/ml), biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml), or 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C followed by three 10-min rinses with blot wash buffer. mAb M2-probed blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse HRP-IgG conjugate (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C followed by three 10-min rinses with blot wash buffer. Blots probed with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG were then incubated with HRP-streptavidin conjugate (1.0 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C followed by three 10-min rinses with blot wash buffer. HRP conjugate probed blots were then visualized using the Vector® VIP substrate kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for peroxidase staining, as specified by the manufacturer, and dried. Dried,125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG-probed blots were visualized using a Bio-Rad GS-363 Molecular Imager® System phosphorimager and quantified with Molecular Analyst version 1.4 software (Bio-Rad). HRP-probed blots were scanned on an Epson Action Scanner II (Epson America Inc., Torrance, CA), and band quantification was also performed using Molecular Analyst version 1.4 software (Bio-Rad). COS-1 cells were grown to 90% confluence in 175-cm3 tissue culture flasks and treated for 30 min with Me2SO, 81 nm PMA, or 81 nm4-MeO-PMA at which point the preparation of fractions began immediately. Treated cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS and pelleted again. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmbenzamide, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and disrupted by sonication (3 cycles of 5 s at 22 Hz with intervals of 15 s) on ice using a Branson Sonifier 250 (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT). Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected, flash-frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath, and stored at −80 °C until needed. The membrane-containing pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer containing 0.5% Brij 58 by sonication on ice (three cycles of 5 s at 22 Hz with intervals of 15 s). Resuspended pellet mixtures were then incubated on ice and periodically vortexed to extract membrane-associated proteins. After 30 min, resuspended pellet mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C and the supernatant (membrane fraction protein extract) was collected. Protein content of cytosolic and membrane fraction extracts was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Examination of α-PKC levels in the cytosolic protein and the membrane protein-containing fractions was used to assess the ability of a given compound to activate α-PKC. Briefly, 1 μg of recombinant human α-PKC (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI), 100 μg of cytosolic protein, or 100 μg of membrane fraction protein from treated cells was subjected to Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane as described earlier. Blots were then probed with an α-PKC-specific rabbit polyclonal IgG (1 μg/ml; Biomol Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) followed by125I-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml) and visualized using the methods described earlier. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 9 μg of phuARNT in 100 × 20-mm dishes, using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 14 h in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 94% air, 6% CO2. Cells were then rinsed two times with phosphate-free Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 8% dialyzed FBS and placed in this medium.32PO43− was then added to a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml, and cells were promptly incubated with either Me2SO or 81 nm PMA for 6 h prior to lysis and hARNT-specific immunoprecipitations. Prior to hARNT-specific immunoprecipitation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and lysed with MENGPI (25 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10% glycerol, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 0.4 mm NaVO3, pH 7.5) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. Cell debris was then removed from lysates by ultracentrifugation at 42,000 rpm in a 70Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Columbia, MD). 2B10-Protein G-Sepharose sufficient for immunoprecipitation of hARNT from a single 100 × 20-mm dish of cells required that 20 μg of mAb 2B10 be adsorbed to 100 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose conjugate (Sigma) for 1 h in 0.5 ml of MENGPI at 4 °C, followed by two washes of 0.6 ml each in MENGPI + 250 mm NaCl. The washed resin was pelleted and resuspended in 0.6 ml of MENGPI + 250 mm NaCl + 1% CHAPS + 1× protease inhibitor mixture, followed by addition of an equal volume of cell lysate and incubation overnight at 4 °C. This resin suspension was then washed twice with MENGPI + 500 mm NaCl, and the resin was extruded, by centrifugation at 2665 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min, through a 1-ml cushion of MENGPI containing 1 m sucrose + 1% Nonidet P-40 + 500 mm NaCl. This sucrose extruded resin was then washed twice with MENGPI containing 0.5% SDS, 2% Nonidet P-40, 500 mmNaCl and washed two more times with MENGPI, followed by preparation of samples for Tricine SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by Tricine SDS-PAGE and electrophorectically transferred to PVDF membrane as described earlier. 32P-Radiolabeled hARNT bands were visualized with a Bio-Rad GS-363 Molecular Imager® System phosphorimager and quantified with Molecular Analyst version 1.4 software (Bio-Rad). Error bars in all figures represent standard deviations for a given measurement. Statistical analysis of data was performed using SigmaStat® version 2.0 software (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA) for the Windows® 95 operating system (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Statistically significant differences between samples in a given experiment were identified using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's all pairwise multiple comparisons test (α = 0.05). Three to four independent measurements composed each sample set, and data presented are representative of at least two separate experiments. Previously it had been reported that ARNT is capable of forming a homodimer that binds class B E-boxes and can transactivate class B, E-box-driven reporter constructs (1Swanson H.I. Chan W.K.

COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with either the pMyc0E1bLuc or pMyc3E1bLuc reporter constructs, containing zero and three class B E-boxes 5′ toluc +, respectively, alone or in the presence of phuARNT to confirm these observations. Fig.2 A demonstrates that transient expression of hARNT in pMyc3E1bLuc-transfected cells results in a dramatic induction of this class B, E-box-driven reporter construct relative to cells transiently co-transfected with phuARNT and pMyc0E1bLuc.

The gene acmA of ACMS I was identified upstream of the genes acmB andacmC encoding the two peptide synthetases ACMS II and ACMS III, respectively, which assemble the pentapeptide lactone rings of the antibiotic. Sequence analysis and expression of acmA inStreptomyces lividans as enzymatically active hexa-His-fusion confirmed the acmA gene product to be ACMS I. An open reading frame of 234 base pairs (acmD), which encodes a 78-amino acid protein with similarity to various acyl carrier proteins, is located downstream of acmA. TheacmD gene was expressed in Escherichia coli as hexa-His-fusion protein (Acm acyl carrier protein (AcmACP)). ACMS I in the presence of ATP acylated the purified AcmACP with radioactivep-toluic acid, used as substrate in place of 4-MHA. Only 10% of the AcmACP from E. coli was acylated, suggesting insufficient modification with 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor. Incubation of this AcmACP with a holo-ACP synthase and coenzyme A quantitatively established the holo-form of AcmACP. Enzyme assays in the presence of ACMS II showed that toluyl-AcmACP directly acylated the thioester-bound threonine on ACMS II. Thus, AcmACP is a 4-MHA carrier protein in the peptide chain initiation of actinomycin synthesis. Actinomycin synthetase I (ACMS I) activates 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, the precursor of the chromophoric moiety of the actinomycin, as adenylate.

Thus, AcmACP is a 4-MHA carrier protein in the peptide chain initiation of actinomycin synthesis. The actinomycins, a family of bicyclic chromopeptide lactones with strong antineoplastic activity (1Frei E. Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1974; 58: 49-54PubMed Google Scholar), are produced by various streptomycete strains (2Katz E. Gottlieb D. Shaw P.D. Antibiotics II. Springer, New York1967: 276-341Google Scholar, 3Meienhofer J. Atherton E. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1973; 16: 203-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Common to all actinomycins is the chromophoric moiety actinocin, a unique phenoxazinone dicarboxylic acid, to which are attached two pentapeptide lactone rings in amide linkage (Fig. 1). Biogenetic studies have shown that actinocin is derived from 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-MHA), 1The abbreviations used are: 4-MHA, 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; 4-MHB, 4-methyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid; ACMS, actinomycin synthetase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ORF, open reading frame; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTE, 1,4-dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 2, 3-DHB, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reactiona metabolite from tryptophan (4Katz E. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 882-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, actinocin is not synthesized from 4-MHA directly. Instead, phenoxazinone formation takes place by oxidative condensation of preformed 4-MHA pentapeptide lactones most probably catalyzed by a phenoxazinone synthase (5Jones G.H. Keller U. Strohl W.R. Bio/Technology of Antibiotics. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 187-216Google Scholar) (Fig. 2).Figure 2Map of the gene acmAencoding ACMS I and its flanking regions on the chromosome ofS. chrysomallus. Sequencing of the region upstream of the gene of ACMS II (acmB) led to identification of acmA as indicated by an arrow. Downstream ofacmA, partially overlapping its 3′-end, followsacmD, which encodes the 4-MHA carrier protein AcmACP. TheSalI fragment in plasmid pA1sub27 was the template for PCR amplifications of acmA and acmD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The assembly of the 4-MHA pentapeptide lactones proceeds in a nonribosomal mechanism (5Jones G.H. Keller U. Strohl W.R. Bio/Technology of Antibiotics. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 187-216Google Scholar, 6Keller U. Vining L.C. Stuttard C. Peptidolactones. Heinemann-Butterworths Publisher, Toronto1995: 71-94Google Scholar). Two peptide synthetases of 280 and 480 kDa (ACMS II and ACMS III, respectively) were previously identified in actinomycin-producing Streptomyces chrysomallus carrying the five amino acid modules responsible for assembly of the pentapeptide lactone rings as indicated in Fig. 1 (7Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5852-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Stindl A. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10612-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACMS II and III were shown to contain also the functions for epimerization of the valine in position 2 and for introduction of the methyl groups into sarcosine and N-methylvaline in positions 4 and 5, respectively (7Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5852-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stindl A. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10612-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stindl A. Keller U. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9358-9364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 4-MHA, the ultimate amino-terminal residue of the 4-MHA pentapeptide lactone sequence, is activated by a separate adenylating enzyme, ACMS I (10Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has a size of 45 kDa and can adenylate a variety of benzene carboxylic acids structurally related to 4-MHA, e.g.4-methyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-MHB) or p-toluic acid (10Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Keller U. Schlumbohm W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11745-11752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These compounds can replace 4-MHA in the 4-MHA pentapeptide lactone when fed to actinomycin-producingStreptomyces through competition with the endogenous 4-MHA, giving rise to new acyl pentapeptide lactones (12Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8226-8231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACMS I does not detectably bind its substrate as thioester, and therefore the corresponding binding domain would be located on an acceptor protein distinct from ACMS I. Incubation of peptide synthetase ACMS II purified from S. chrysomallus with threonine and p-toluyl-CoA-thioester or p-toluyl-pantetheine-thioester, both nonnatural substrates mimicking a 4′-phosphopantetheine thioester, resulted in the formation of covalently boundp-toluyl-threonine (8Stindl A. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10612-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACMS II also catalyzed, albeit with lower efficiency than in the latter cases, formation ofp-toluyl-threonine from threonine and chemically synthesizedp-toluyl-adenylate. This suggested that ACMS II, which cannot activate 4-MHA, would possess a binding domain with a 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor (ACP domain) as an acceptor site for 4-MHA (8Stindl A. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10612-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of the genes of ACMS II and III (acmB andacmC) showed that they lie closely linked in tandem on the chromosome of S. chrysomallus (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their analysis revealed an organization of the ACMSs into two and three modules, respectively, necessary for pentapeptide lactone assembly. Inspection of the protein sequence of ACMS II, however, showed that the conserved motif of the 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor attachment site occurred only twice, namely in the two amino acid modules of this protein. Thus, the third 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor, which was initially postulated to lie in front of the first (threonine) module (8Stindl A. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10612-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is not located on ACMS II. From the previous work on acmB and acmC in the acm gene cluster we got evidence that the 5′-end of the gene acmA of ACMS I is located upstream of the geneacmB of ACMS II and points in the opposite direction (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show the cloning and expression of acmA and the analysis of the gene product. More importantly, we found directly downstream of the gene of ACMS I a small open reading frame (ORF) encoding a small ACP (acmD), which is the protein harboring the missing third 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor required for condensation of 4-MHA with threonine on ACMS II. 4-MHA was synthesized as described (10Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). p-[1-14C]Toluic acid (8.3 Ci/mol) was from Sigma. Tetrasodium-[32P]pyrophosphate (28.2 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products, and [α-32P]ATP (400 Ci/mmol) was from Hartmann Analytik (Braunschweig, Germany). All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Streptomyces lividans 1326 was from the John Innes strain collection (Norwich, United Kingdom). It was grown and kept on R2YE (14Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces. A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich1985Google Scholar). Submerged growth was for up to 4 days at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm) in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of YEME medium (14Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces. A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich1985Google Scholar). Flasks were equipped with steel springs as baffles. Escherichia coli strains for cloning were DH5α (15Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 166: 557-580Crossref Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) and JM109 (16Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar), and the strain for expression was M15, from Qiagen. They were grown according to standard protocols. Techniques for DNA isolation, manipulation, and transformation were as described by Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and Hopwood et al. (14Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces. A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich1985Google Scholar). The cosmid cosA1 carrying the ACMS gene cluster from S. chrysomallus ATCC 11523 was described previously (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids used for subcloning fragments were pTZ18U (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pSP72 (Promega), pSL1180 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequence determinations were performed with aTaq cycle sequencing kit (United States Biochemicals-Amersham Pharmacia Biotech sequencing kit US71001 or US78500) on plasmid DNA. Fragments were subcloned into pTZ18U. Sequence comparisons, multiple sequence alignments, and identity scores were computed with CLUSTAL W (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar) or with the FASTA data base search results (19Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). The plasmid for expression of acmA and acmBin S. lividans was pIJ702 (20Katz E. Thompson C.J. Hopwood D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 2703-2714PubMed Google Scholar). For expression ofacmA in E. coli, expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) was used, and for expression of acmD in E. coli,pQE32 (Qiagen) was used. For PCRs, Vent DNA polymerase (BioLabs) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression ofacmA in E. coli was as amino-terminal hexa-His-tagged fusion protein. The acmA was amplified with suitable restriction ends by PCR using cosmid cosA1 (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template. Forward and reverse primers were FACMA1 (5′-TAAGAGGAAGCTGGATCCGCCGATAAATGGTG-3′) and RACMA2 (5′-TAGGCGTGGATCCCGTCGACCGAGGTGAA-3′), respectively. The resulting 1.6 kilobase pair PCR fragment was digested with BamHI andSalI and ligated into pQE30. In this construct the amino-terminal end of ACMS I would change from MADK- to MRGSHHHHHHGSADK-. Transformation into E. coli JM109 yielded plasmid pACMA1. After restriction analysis and control sequencing on both ends of the fragment, pACMA1 was transformed into E. coli strain M15. Cultures of M15/pACMA1 (1.6 liters of 2× YT medium, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin) were grown at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.9 and then induced with 2 mm isopropylthiogalactoside. Cells were harvested after a further 14 h of incubation at 30 °C. For the expression of acmA as carboxyl-terminal hexa-His-tagged fusion protein in S. lividans, acmA was placed as a translational fusion in frame into the ATG start codon of the melC1 gene of Streptomyces plasmid pIJ702 (20Katz E. Thompson C.J. Hopwood D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 2703-2714PubMed Google Scholar), which is under control of the mel promoter. The ATG start codon of melC1 is contained in the uniqueSphI restriction site of the plasmid. The acmAwas amplified with synthetic primers to generate a matching 5′-SphI site in its start codon and to create a hexa-His encoding sequence between the last codon and the stop codon. PCR was performed with primers FACEX2 (5′-GAGGGCATGCATATGGCCGATAAATGGTGGGGGGAA-3′) and RACEX2 (5′-GAAGATCTTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGATGGTGCGAGGCCCCCTTGAGCTCAGCGGG-3′) using subclone pA1sub27 containing a 2.8-kilobase SalI fragment from cosA1 cloned into pTZ18U (Fig. 2). A 1.45-kilobase fragment was obtained, which, after cleavage with SphI andBglII, was ligated in pSP72 cleaved with SphI andBglII. After transformation in DH5α, plasmid pACMA10 was obtained. Sequencing on both ends of the insert confirmed the correctness of the modified ends of acmA. pACMA10 was digested with SphI and BglII, and the excised 1.45-kilobase SphI/BglII fragment was isolated and ligated into SphI/BglII-cleaved pIJ702. Transformation into S. lividans resulted in plasmid pACMA11. The recombinant protein encoded by pACMA11 is changed at the amino terminus from MADK- to MHMADK- and at the carboxyl terminus from -AS to -ASHHHHHH. Microsequencing of the purified protein later confirmed the new amino-terminal sequence (not shown). For expression of acmA in S. lividans encoded by pACMA11 as hexa-His-tagged fusion protein, the transformed strain was grown at 30 °C (6 liters of YEME medium, 10 μg/ml thiostrepton) for 4 days and then harvested by suction filtration. The acmB was expressed in S. lividans from plasmid pACM5 as described previously (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The geneacmD encoding the 4-MHA carrier protein was expressed inE. coli as amino-terminal hexa-His-tagged fusion protein. The acmD gene was engineered by PCR with synthetic primers FACPI1 (5′-CCGCATGCTCTCGAAGGACGACATCAGGGCGAT-3′) and RACPI1 (5′-CGAGATCTGTCGTCGGGGCGGTCGCGGCGC-3′) using pA1sub27 as template. This generated a 276-base pair fragment with a SphI site (5′) and the BglII site (3′) necessary for ligation into plasmid pTZ18U cleaved with SphI and BamHI. After transformation into E. coli, the resultant plasmid was cleaved with SphI and KpnI, and the excised approximately 250-base pair fragment was ligated into expression vector pQE32 cleaved with SphI/KpnI. Successive transformation into JM109 and in M15 yielded plasmid pACPI-Q1. Sequence analysis of the cloned fragment in pACPI-Q1 confirmed that in the encoded protein, the amino terminus is changed from MISK- to MRGSHHHHHHGIMLSK-. Cultures of M15/pACPI-Q1 (1.8 liters of 2× YT medium, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin) were grown at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.7 and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside. Cells were harvested after further growth for 14 h at 30 °C. The gene was amplified py PCR with oligonucleotides A (5′-AGCGCGGAATCGACTGAGGATCCATGACGGCCCGACA-3′) and B (5′-TGTTGCTCTCAAGCTTGGTCAGATCACGA-3′). Template for PCR was a genomic 8.5-kilobase BamHI fragment in clone 202, kindly provided by H. G. Floss and colleagues. The PCR-generated fragment was digested with BamHI and HindIII at the sites introduced by the oligonucleotides A and B (underlined) and inserted in the E. coli expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen), resulting in plasmid pPAN-5. Expression of ORF C from pPAN-5 was performed as described for acmD. All operations were carried out at 0–4 °C. A suspension of 16 g (wet weight) of cells in 60 ml of cold Buffer AN (10% glycerol (w/v), 50 mmKPO4 buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF was passed through a French press at 10,000 psi. After treatment with DNase I (Sigma) (20 μg/ml) and stirring for 45 min, the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 ×g. The supernatant (65 ml) was passed through a DEAE-cellulose column (9 × 3.5 cm) to which, at pH 7, ACMS I does not bind. Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled (80 ml). After adding 5 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 15 ml of Buffer NI (15% glycerol (w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmbenzamidine), the protein solution was applied to a nickel-chelate column (3.4 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated previously with Buffer NI. After washing with Buffer NW (same as Buffer NI but at pH 7.0 instead pH 8.0), protein bound was eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole in Buffer NW (40 mm, 145 mm, 250 mm). Fractions with enzymatic activity were pooled (9 ml) and desalted on an AcA202 (Ultrogel) column (12 × 5 cm) equilibrated with Buffer M (10% glycerol (w/v), 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTE, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF). Enzyme was purified further by ion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Buffer M. Enzyme was eluted with a 40 ml gradient (1 ml/min flow rate) from 0–0.2 m NaCl. About 35 g of freshly harvested mycelium ofS. lividans carrying pACMA11 suspended in 70 ml of Buffer A (10% glycerol (w/v), 50 mm KPO4 buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTE, 1 mmPMSF, 1 mm benzamidine) was passed twice through a French press at 10,000 psi. After DNase I treatment (30 μg/ml) and with gentle stirring for 90 min, the suspension was centrifuged (30 min at 25,000 × g). The supernatant (60 ml) was passed through a DEAE-cellulose column (8 × 3.5 cm) to which ACMS I does not bind at neutral pH. Fractions with enzymatic activity were pooled (240 ml). Addition of 28 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, shifted pH from 7.0 to 8.0, and the solution was applied to a nickel-chelate resin column (2.8 × 1.6 cm). After washing the column with Buffer NW (see above), bound proteins were eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of 0–250 mm imidazole in Buffer NW. Fractions of 3.5 ml were collected, and the fractions with enzymatic activity was pooled. This pool was diluted with 5 volumes of 15% glycerol (w/v), 4 mm DTE, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine and applied onto an ω-aminohexyl-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) column (6.5 × 1 cm) for enzyme concentration. After washing with Buffer C (15% glycerol (w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTE, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmbenzamidine), the bound protein was eluted with a step of 0.3m NaCl in Buffer C. The protein (total volume, 6 ml) was purified in 1.5-ml portions to homogeneity by gel filtration on an SuperdexTM75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with Buffer B (15% glycerol (w/v), 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTE, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine). Protein with apparent homogeneity was in the rear half of the activity peak. The purified recombinant protein could be stored at −80 °C for at least 6 months without detectable loss of activity. Approximately 12 g of cell paste was suspended in 34 ml of Buffer NI (see above). After passage of the suspension through a French press at 10,000 psi, DNase I (25 μg/ml) was added, and the suspension was left on ice for 15 min with gentle stirring. After centrifugation (15 min at 20,000 × g), the supernatant was applied to a nickel-chelate column (3 × 1.6 cm) equilibrated with Buffer NI. The column was washed with 15 ml of the same buffer and 80 ml of Buffer NW until no more protein eluted from the column. A 100-ml linear gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole in Buffer NW afforded elution of hexa-His-tagged protein. The bulk of protein appeared at 100–200 mm imidazole, and the corresponding fractions were pooled. 1 m DTE was added to give 4 mm final concentration, and 4.5-ml portions (3 mg protein) were gel filtrated on Ultrogel AcA54 (40 × 25 cm column dimensions) in Buffer B (see above). After this step, enzyme appeared to be pure as judged from SDS-PAGE. Typically, about 4 mg of total protein were obtained by this procedure. Protein could be stored at −80 °C for 4 weeks without loss of p-toluic binding activity in Buffer B. Partially purified recombinant ACMS II was prepared as described previously (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme from the AcA34 gel filtration step was used. The resultant hexa-His-tagged fusion protein was purified analogous to AcmACP as described above. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were done according to Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Antibodies against ACMS I from S. chrysomallus were raised in a rabbit by two administrations of 100-μg portions of the purified enzyme (at a 1-month interval) (courtesy of Prof. F. J. Fehrenbach, Robert-Koch-Institut, Berlin, Germany). The serum was used without further purification in dilutions of 1:1000 to 1:3000 for Western blot analysis by semidry blot standard techniques (provided by Biometra and Schleicher & Schuell). Anti-rabbit-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) served as second antibody for the purpose of nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate detection (both from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Thin-layer chromatography of enzymatically formed acyl adenylates was performed as described (10Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ATP-[32P]pyrophosphate exchange reactions and acyl adenylate formation tests with [α-32P]ATP were as described previously (10Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Keller U. Schlumbohm W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11745-11752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant 4-MHA carrier protein (AcmACP) was tested for thioester formation with p-[1-14C]toluic acid (used as 4-MHA substrate analogue) by measuring the formation of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. One unit of AcmACP was defined as the amount of enzyme that covalently binds 1 nmol of p-toluic acid in 30 min at 29 °C. Standard assay contained 14 mm p-[1-14C]toluic acid, 10 mm ATP, 45 mm MgCl2, 280 nm purified recombinant ACMS I and 100 μl of AcmACP-containing protein fraction. Buffer was Buffer B (see above) and incubation was at 29 °C for 30 min. After addition of 6% trichloroacetic acid and leaving on ice for 15 min, precipitated proteins were collected by suction filtration on membrane filters ME 25 (Schleicher & Schuell). After washing and drying, filter bound radioactivity was counted in a Packard 1600CA scintillation counter. To visualize charged AcmACP as labeled band in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, precipitated protein was resuspended in 70 μl of of 15% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1% SDS. 2 μl of 40% sucrose-0.25% bromphenol blue was added. 5-μl aliquots were usually counted by liquid scintillation counting, and 10-μl portions were separated by SDS-PAGE (17.5% polyacrylamide). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Serva) and, after drying, exposed to x-ray film (NIF100, Konica). Measurement of activity of recombinant ACMS II was as described previously (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay to demonstrate the transfer of p-toluic acid fromp-toluic acid-AcmACP-thioester to ACMS II-threonine thioester was the same as described above to measure charging of AcmACP but with the additional presence of ACMS II and its substrate threonine. Assays contained 200 nm ACMS I, 5.1 μm AcmACP (0.35 units), 0.046 units of partially purified ACMS II, 10 mm ATP, 50 mm MgCl2, 14 mm p-[1-14C]toluic acid, 8 mm threonine and were incubated for 30 min at 29 °C. After addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid, protein was allowed to precipitate overnight on ice. Control reactions involved omission of one component from the reaction in each case. Precipitated proteins were collected, washed twice with 7% trichloroacetic acid and once with 6 ml of 3% trichloroacetic acid, and finally resuspended in a 350-μl solution of 15% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1% SDS. 9 μl of 40% sucrose-0.25% bromphenol blue was added. A 10-μl aliquot was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting, and 8 μl was applied onto a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Staining, drying, and autoradiography was as above. Incubation of AcmACP with the holo-ACP synthase from S. actuosus was performed in a total volume of 600 μl (Buffer B) at 30 °C for 45 min in the presence of 28 μm AcmACP, 1 μm holo-ACP synthase, 290 nm ACMS I, 10 mm p-[1-14C]toluic acid, 10 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 mm CoA. 80-μl aliquots were precipitated with 2 ml of 7% trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of 3% bovine serum albumin at several time points. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitable and filter bound radioactivity was measured as described above (filter GF92, Schleicher & Schuell). The nucleotide sequences from S. chrysomallus obtained in this study has been assigned GenBankTM accession number AF134587 foracmA and AF134588 for acmD. The genes of the actinomycin synthetases II and III, acmB andacmC, are tandemly arranged on the S. chrysomallus chromosome (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the region upstream ofacmB revealed, at a distance of 430 base pairs of noncoding DNA, the start of an ORF in opposite direction to acmB (Fig. 2). The 5′-end of this ORF encodes an amino acid sequence that is identical to the amino-terminal protein sequence of ACMS I, previously determined by microsequencing of the protein (13Schauwecker F. Pfennig F. Schröder W. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From this it became evident that this ORF is the gene coding for ACMS I (acmA). Sequencing further into the 3′-direction revealed the complete ORF of a total length of 1419 base pairs, which would encode a protein of 472 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 51.5 kDa and a pI of 7.36. This fits with the previous determined molecular mass of native ACMS I (52–53 kDa (10Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) but is 6.5 kDa larger than the size of denaturated ACMS I estimated from SDS-PAGE (45 kDa) (11Keller U. Schlumbohm W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11745-11752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The codon usage of acmA is typical for streptomycete genes showing a strong bias for G+C-rich codons with a G+C-contents of 90.4% at the third base in codons. The overall G+C content of the gene is 71.4%. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence revealed similarity (between 20 and 30% identity) with a number of aromatic and heteroaromatic carboxylic acid adenylating enzymes, acyl-CoA ligases and the activation domains of various peptide synthetases (TableI). Among these are the aromatic carboxylic acid-activating enzymes EntE and YbtE from E. coli and Yersinia pestis, respectively (24Staab J.F. Elkins M. Earhart C.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 59: 15-20Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Rusnak F. Sakaitani M. Drueckhammer D. Reichert J. Walsh C.T.

The site of cleavage occurs between G4325 and A4326 (rat ribosome numbering) which are present in one of the most conserved sequences (the α-sarcin loop) among the large subunit ribosomal RNAs of all living species. Amino acid sequence comparison of ribotoxins and guanyl/purine ribonucleases have identified domains or residues likely involved in ribonucleolytic activity or cleavage specificity.

Analyses of the purified mutant proteins identified those regions in fungal ribotoxins contributing to ribosome targeting and modulating the catalytic activity of the toxin; some of the identified motifs are homologous to sequences in ribosomal proteins and elongation factors. This mutational study of mitogillin together with the recently published x-ray structure of restrictocin (a close relative of mitogillin) supports the hypothesis that the specific cleavage properties of ribotoxins are the result of natural genetic engineering in which the ribosomal targeting elements of ribosome-associated proteins were inserted into nonessential regions of T1-like ribonucleases.

Mitogillin and the related Aspergillus fungal ribotoxins restrictocin and α-sarcin, are small basic proteins of ∼17 kDa (kilodaltons). Mitogillin differs from restrictocin by only 1 amino acid and has 86% amino acid sequence identity with α-sarcin (1Fernandez-Luna J.L. Lopez-Otin C. Soriano F. Mendez E.

Endo Y. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Gluck A. Endo Y. Wool I.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and G4319 was proposed to be the identity element for α-sarcin (17Gluck A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the ribosome-targeting elements of the protein toxins. Mitogillin and related ribotoxins are known to share amino acid sequence similarity with T1-like ribonucleases (8Lamy B. Davies J. Schindler D. Frankel A.E. Genetically Engineered Toxins. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 237-257Google Scholar) and α-sarcin has been shown to behave as a cyclizing ribonuclease like many other ribonucleases (18Lacadena J. Martinez del Pozo A. Lacadena V. Martinez-Ruiz A. Mancheno J.M. Onaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but their property to interact specifically with the ribosome and cause a single ribonucleolytic cleavage in the large subunit rRNA is unique. Previous studies indicated that the similarities and differences detected in amino acid sequence comparison of ribotoxins and a large family of other guanyl/purine ribonucleases may represent domains or residues key to ribonucleolytic activity and specificity (19Kao R. Davies J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Kao R. Shea J.E. Davies J. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of these “extra” protein domains (some of which are similar to sequences in ribosome-associated proteins) in fungal ribotoxins led to the hypothesis that fungal ribotoxins are a family of naturally engineered toxins with ribosomal targeting elements acquired from different ribosome-associated proteins (19Kao R. Davies J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The prediction that the fungal ribotoxins are T1-like ribonucleases with additional protein domains extended from the catalytic core of the RNase is confirmed by the crystal structure of restrictocin determined by x-ray analysis (21Yang X. Moffat K. Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the three-dimensional structure of α-sarcin in solution determined by NMR (22Campos-Olivas R. Bruix M. Santoro J. Martinez del Pozo A. Lacadena J. Gavilanes J.G. Rico M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These structural analyses also support the proposal that the ribosomal protein-like region Lys106-Lys113 is the major ribosomal recognition element in mitogillin (19Kao R. Davies J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study we report the characterization and properties of 15 deletion mutants (4 to 8 amino acid deletions) in motifs of mitogillin having little amino acid sequence homology with guanyl/purine ribonucleases and the identification of elements in mitogillin (and related ribotoxins) contributing to its specific cleavage of ribosomes. An Escherichia coli host (derivative of W3110) and the plasmid pING3522 were used for the production of mitogillin and mutant mitogillin proteins. pING3522 is an inducible secretion vector with the expression of the inserted gene under the control of the Salmonella typhimurium araB promoter; the secretion of recombinant proteins through the cytoplasmic membrane is directed by the Erwinia carotovora pelB leader sequence (14Better M. Bernhard S.L. Lei S.P. Fishwild D.M. Carroll S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16712-16718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated site-directed mutagenesis was employed to construct deletion mutants in three regions (Gln8-Thr43, Asp56-Lys88, and Lys106-Lys113) of mitogillin (Fig.1 A). Nucleotide sequences of oligonucleotides used to construct mutants are shown in TableI. PCR-mediated site-specific mutagenesis is described in Fig. 1 B. RK-01 (forward “universal” primer) was mixed with a reverse mutagenic oligo and RK-02 (reverse universal primer) was mixed with a forward mutagenic oligo; PCR was carried out directly on single E. coli colonies (containing pING3522 plasmid) in two separate 100-μl reactions (50 mmKCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 100 pmol of each primer oligonucleotide, and 200 μm of each dNTP). The tubes were heated at 94 °C for 5 min before the addition of 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, overlaid with paraffin oil and 30 cycles of PCR carried out (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min). The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). Purified PCR products were mixed and the volume was brought to 100 μl with 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase, and incubated at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 10 min to achieve the 3′ extension of the mixed PCR products. PCR amplification of the mutagenized mitogillin gene was then accomplished by adding 100 pmol of each of oligomers RK-01 and RK-02, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, overlaid with paraffin oil and reincubated at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min, for 30 cycles. The final PCR product was purified by electrophoresis followed by QIAquick extraction. The purified fragment was ligated to PstI-HindIII-digested pING3522 and transformed into E. coli. The nucleotide sequence of each mutant was verified. Production of mutant mitogillin proteins was detected by SDS-PAGE (0.1% SDS, 15% polyacrylamide) of the induced culture supernatants followed by Western blotting using rabbit antisera raised against mitogillin.Table IOligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis of the mitogillin genePrimerSite of mutagenesisSequenceRK-01Universal, forward5′-GCGACTCTCTACTGTTTCTCCAT-3′RK-02Universal, reverse5′-GCGTTAGCAATTTAACTGTGATA-3′RK-05ΔLys106-Lys113, forward5′-CCAGATGGACATGACTACGAGAATCCAGGTCCAGCACG-3′RK-06ΔLys106-Lys113, reverse5′-CGTGCTGGACCTGGATTCTCGTAGTCATGTCCATCTGG-3′Δ1.1FΔAsp56-Lys60, forward5′-CAGTGGTTCACGAATGGATACTTAATCAAGGGTCGTACGCCA-3′Δ1.1RΔAsp56-Lys60, reverse5′-TGGCGTACGACCCTTGATTAAGTATCCATTCGTGAACCAGTG-3′Δ1.2FΔGly59-Ile62, forward5′-ACGAATGGATACGATGGCAACAAGGGTCGTACGCCAATTAAG-3′Δ1.2RΔGly59-Ile62, reverse5′-CTTAATTGGCGTACGACCCTTGTTGCCATCGTATCCATTCGT-3′Δ1.3FΔLys63-Ile68, forward5′-CGATGGCAACGGTAAGTTAATCAAGTTTGGTAAGGCTGATTGTGACC-3′Δ1.3RΔLys63-Ile68, reverse5′-GGTCACAATTCAGCCTTACCAAACTTGATTAACTTACCGTTGCCATCG-3′Δ1.4FΔLys69-Ala73, forward5′-CAAGGGTCGTACGCCAATTGATTGTGACCGGCCACCTAAG-3′Δ1.4RΔLys69-Ala73, reverse5′-CTTAGGTGGCCGGTCACAATCAATTGGCGTACGACCCTTG-3′Δ1.5FΔArg77-Gln83, forward5′-TGGTAAGGCTGATTGTGACAATGGAATGGGTAAGGACG-3′Δ1.5RΔArg77-Gln83, reverse5′-CGTCCTTACCCATTCCATTGTCACAATCAGCCTTACCA-3′Δ1.6FΔAsn84-Lys88, forward5′-CCACCTAAGCATTCTCAGGACGATCACTATCTATTGG-3′Δ1.6RΔAsn84-Lys88, reverse5′-CCAATAGATAGTGATCGTCCTGAGAATGCTTAGGTGG-3′Δ3.1FΔGln8-Asn11, forward5′-GCAACATGGACCTGTATCAACCCTAAGACGAATAAGTGG-3′Δ3.1RΔGln8-Asn11, reverse5′-CCACTTATTCGTCTTAGGGTTGATACAGGTCCATGTTGC-3′Δ3.2FΔLys13-Lys16, forward5′-CAACCAGCAACTTAATCCTTGGGAAGACAAGCGTCTAC-3′Δ3.2RΔLys13-Lys16, reverse5′-GTAGACGCTTGTCTTCCCAAGGATTAAGTTGCTGGTTG-3′Δ3.3FΔLys16-Asp19, forward5′-GCAACTTAATCCTAAGACGAATAAGAGTCTACTGTACAATCAGG-3′Δ3.3RΔLys16-Asp19, reverse5′-CCTGATTGTACAGTAGACGCTTATTCGTCTTAGGATTAAGTTGC-3′Δ3.4FΔLys20-Leu23, forward5′-GACGAATAAGTGGGAAGACTACAATCAGGCTAAGGCTG-3′Δ3.4RΔLys20-Ile23, reverse5′-CAGCCTTAGCCTGATTGTAGTCTTCCCACTTATTCGTC-3′Δ3.5FΔTyr24-Ala27, forward5′-GGAAGACAAGCGTCTACTGAAGGCTGAATCTAACTCTC-3′Δ3.5RΔTyr24-Ala27, reverse5′-GAGAGTTAGATTCAGCCTTCAGTAGACGCTTGTCTTCC-3′Δ3.6FΔLys28-Ser31, forward5′-CGTCTACTGTACAATCAGGCTAACTCTCATCATGCACCGCTC-3′Δ3.6RΔLys28-Ser31, reverse5′-GAGCGGTGCATGATGAGAGTTAGCCTGATTGTACAGTAGACG-3′Δ3.7FΔAsn32-His35, forward5′-CAGGCTAAGGCTGAATCTGCACCGCTCTCGGATGG-3′Δ3.7RΔAsn32-His35, reverse5′-CCATCCGAGAGCGGTGCAGATTCAGCCTTAGCCTG-3′ΔG1FΔAla36-T43, forward5′-GCTGAATCTAACTCTCATCATGGAAGTTCGTATCCTCAC-3′ΔG1RΔAla36-T43, reverse5′-GTGAGGATACGAACTTCCATGATGAGAGTTAGATTCAGC-3′Oligonucleotides RK-01 and RK-02 were “universal” primers used for site-directed mutagenesis and DNA sequencing.

E. coli harboring pING3522-derived plasmids containing the mutagenized mitogillin gene were grown at 37 °C toA 600 = 0.4 in Tryptone broth (containing 10 μg of tetracycline/ml), induced by the addition of 0.1%l-arabinose (Sigma) and grown for 18 h. Secreted proteins were purified by cation exchange chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography as described previously (20Kao R. Shea J.E. Davies J. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) except that 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was used for cation exchange chromatography. Ribonucleolytic activity of ribonuclease T1, mitogillin, and mutant mitogillins against poly(I) homopolymer (Sigma) was examined by methods described previously (20Kao R. Shea J.E. Davies J. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 200 μm poly(I) homopolymer substrate was used in all cleavage assays. In initial rate experiments, 50 nm of each protein was used and the extent of poly(I) homopolymers hydrolysis was less than 10% of the total and MicroCon-100 concentrators (molecular cut-off = 300 nucleotides for single-stranded RNA; purchased from Amicon) were used to separate cleavage products from poly(I) homopolymers. Ribonucleolytic activity against MS-2 phage RNA was determined by incubating RNA (400 ng) with 300 nm purified protein in 10 μl of reaction buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 15 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, stopped by the addition of 1.0 μl of 5% SDS, and separated by electrophoresis (1.2% agarose) as described previously (19Kao R. Davies J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); the gel was stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the degradation of the RNA substrate. An activity staining assay (zymogram electrophoresis) described by Blank et al. (23Blank A. Sugiyama R.H. Dekker C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was employed to monitor the presence of contaminating ribonucleases. Briefly, SDS-PAGE of 150 ng of each of the mutant mitogillins was performed under nonreducing condition on a 0.1% SDS, 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.3 mg of poly(I) substrate. The gel was treated as described by Blank et al. (23Blank A. Sugiyama R.H. Dekker C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 1 h, stained with 0.2% toluidine blue for 10 min at room temperature and washed extensively with distilled water for 1 h. RNase activity was indicated by the appearance of a clear zone on a dark blue background. Specific cleavage of eukaryotic ribosomes was done in reaction mixtures with 10 μl of untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 600 nm toxin protein, 15 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 15 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm EDTA, incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Extracted RNA was separated by electrophoresis (1.5% agarose) and RNA species visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The specific ribonucleolytic activity of the toxin derivatives was followed by the appearance of the α-fragment, a ∼400 nucleotide RNA species on the gel. A RNA oligonucleotide (a 35-mer) that mimics the α-sarcin domain of the eukaryotic large subunit rRNA was prepared with synthetic DNA templates, T7 RNA polymerase, and the four nucleotide triphosphates and purified using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Endo Y. Chan Y.L. Lin A. Tsurugi K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7917-7920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). 1.0 μm synthetic RNA 35-mer was combined with 600 nm mitogillin or mutant mitogillins for a total volume of 6.0 μl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4.0 μl of deionized formamide and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Cleavage products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the gel stained with SYBR-GOLD nucleic acid stain (Molecular Probes). Fifteen deletion mutants of mitogillin in regions predicted to be functional elements inserted into a T1 ribonuclease core structure were constructed. The mutant genes were completely sequenced to confirm the nature of the deletions; no other alterations were detected. Production of mutant proteins on growth in liquid culture was detected from 10 clones (TableII) by Western blotting with a rabbit antiserum (data not shown). SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of the purified proteins confirmed their purity (Fig. 4 A).Table IIProduction of mutant mitogillin proteinsMutant mitogillinSite of deletionProduction of proteina+, production of protein detected; −, production not detected.ΔGln8-Asn11Gln8to Asn11−ΔLys13-Lys16Lys13 to Lys16+ΔLys16-Asp19Lys16to Asp19+ΔLys20-Leu23Lys20 to Leu23+ΔTyr24 to Ala27Tyr24 to Ala27−ΔLys28 to Ser31Lys28 to Ser31+ΔAsn32 to His35Asn32 to His35−ΔAla36 to Thr43Ala36 to Thr43−ΔAsp56 to Lys60Asp56 to Lys60+ΔGly59 to Ile62Gly59 to Ile62+ΔLys63 to Ile68Lys63 to Ile68+ΔLys69 to Ala73Lys69 to Ala73−ΔArg77 to Gln83Arg77 to Gln83+ΔAsn84 to Lys88Asn84 to Lys88+ΔLys106 to Lys113Lys106 to Lys113+Production was detected by SDS-PAGE of induced culture supernatants followed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-mitogillin antisera.a +, production of protein detected; −, production not detected. Open table in a new tab Production was detected by SDS-PAGE of induced culture supernatants followed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-mitogillin antisera. RNase activity of mitogillin and all 10 mutant proteins was detected when poly(I) homopolymers (Fig. 2) or MS-2 phage RNA (Fig. 3) were used as substrates. The comparison between the ribonuclease activities of mutant and wild-type mitogillin using poly(I) homopolymer is shown in Fig. 2; initial rates of reaction are tabulated in Table III. The data indicates that deleting Lys13-Lys16, Lys16-Asp19, or Lys20-Leu23 increased the RNase activity; Lys28-Ser31, Arg77-Gln83, or Lys106-Lys113 decreased the RNase activity, while the deletion of Asp56-Lys60, Gly59-Ile62, Lys63-Ile68, or Asn84-Lys88 had little effect as judged by the initial rates of ribonucleolytic reaction. Results obtained from the zymogram electrophoresis assay (Fig.4 B) eliminate the possibility of the presence of contaminating ribonucleases in the preparations.Figure 3MS-2 phage RNA degradation assay.

Extensive degradation of 28 S RNA in ribosomes by Lys13-Leu23 deletion mutants suggests that this region in the fungal ribotoxin is involved in modulating the activity and specific recognition of the cleavage site in the ribosome. Results obtained from assays using synthetic α-sarcin loop (a 35-mer) as substrate showed that deletions in regions Lys13-Lys16, Lys16-Asp19, or Lys20-Leu23 gave rise to mitogillin variants with elevated ribonucleolytic activity while deletion of Lys106-Lys113 created a mutant which fails to recognize and cleave the α-sarcin loop (Fig. 5 B). Structural comparison between the three-dimensional structures of restrictocin (99% identity with mitogillin) and T1 ribonuclease reveals strong structural similarities with certain domains in the fungal ribotoxins absent from the T1 ribonucleases; the most obvious differences are the β1-loop 1-β2 region, the loop 3 region, and the loop 4 region of restrictocin (Fig. 6). It has been postulated that these domains are “inserted” elements contributing to the specific targeted, cytotoxicity of this class of proteins; preliminary studies on the loop 4 region indicated that this region indeed is the major ribosome-targeting elements of mitogillin (19Kao R. Davies J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have generated deletions (4–8 amino acid residues) in those regions of mitogillin proposed to be inserted elements. Deletions were preferred over amino acid substitutions for this analysis in order to identify domains responsible for targeting mitogillin to the ribosome and examine the influence of these inserted regions on the general properties of the fungal ribotoxin. Ten of the 15 deletion mutants produce biologically active proteins using the E. coliexpression system. It is interesting to note that the five non-expressible mutant mitogillin proteins have deletions located near or extending into elements such as disulfide bridge-forming cysteine residues, proline residues, or helixes, which are likely to be susceptible to host protease activity. The majority of the deletions obtained retain the catalytic activity of the ribotoxin which supports the proposal that these domains have roles in ribotoxin function distinct from the RNase activity. Deletions in loop 4 and in β1-loop 1-β2 regions generate mutants with interesting properties in terms of their ribonucleolytic activities. We have shown that the octapeptide Lys106 to Lys113 in the loop 4 region has sequence similarity to various ribosome-associated proteins (19Kao R. Davies J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and that the heptapeptide Thr14 to Lys20 in the β1-loop 1-β2 region is strongly related to motifs in various elongation factors (TableIV). Although the significance of these relationships has yet to be examined, it is noteworthy that the ΔLys106-Lys113 mutant (previously termed Δ2 mutant in Ref. 19Kao R. Davies J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) has lost the ability to recognize and cleave the α-sarcin loop (19Kao R. Davies J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, A and B, this study), and that the ribonucleolytic activity of the deletion mutants in the β1-loop 1-β2 region is greatly elevated (20–30-fold higher than that of wild-type mitogillin, Table III). The α-sarcin loop/restrictocin docking model of Yang and Moffat (21Yang X. Moffat K. Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggests that the loop 4 region of mitogillin is in close proximity to the 28 S rRNA identity element (G4319) of the fungal ribotoxin; our results support the conclusion that elements in the loop 4 domain interact with the “bulged” G4319 in the α-sarcin loop to promote specific recognition and cleavage of the substrate.Table IVHomologous motifs found in mitogillin and in translation elongation factorsProteinSourceResiduesSequenceMitogillinA. restrictus14–20TNKWEDKRestrictocinA. restrictus14–20TNKWEDKα-SarcinA. giganteus15–21TNKYETKEF-1αE. gracillis152–158TNKFDDKEF-2Yeast254–260TKKWTNKEF-3Yeast140–146TNKWQEK Open table in a new tab However, the β1-loop 1-β2 region of mitogillin is relatively distant from the catalytic center of the nuclease; the role of this domain in attenuating the catalytic activity of the toxin is intriguing. We propose that this is the result of hydrogen bond formation between amino acid residues in β1 and β2, and residues in β6 in which the catalytic residue His136 is situated (Fig. 7). It is possible that the β1-loop 1-β2 domain attenuates the catalytic activity of the toxin by keeping the catalytic residue His136 in a configuration suboptimal for nucleolytic activity through hydrogen bonding with β6. Upon binding to the ribosome, the interactions between loop 4 and the α-sarcin loop trigger a conformational change in the protein which disrupts the interactions between the β1-loop 1-β2 domain and β6, so positioning the catalytic residue His136 in a optimal environment for cleavage of phosphodiester bond of the RNA substrate. Evidence in favor of this interpretation comes from the analysis of a N7A mutant of mitogillin (which presumably eliminates the hydrogen bonding between Asn7 and His136) which shows greatly elevated ribonuclease activity (Table III). The detailed biochemical properties of the N7A mutant are currently under investigation. Our interpretation also agrees with the findings of Takeda et al. (27Takeda E. Bi X. Yoshinari S. Endo Y. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 131-132Google Scholar) which suggest that the fungal ribotoxins bind to two sites in the RNA substrate; one through the bulged G4319 and the other around the GAGA tetraloop cleavage site. An RNA oligomer substrate with the deleted bulged G is unsusceptible to α-sarcin cleavage but becomes a strong noncompetitive inhibitor of the wild-type RNA molecule (with the bulged G), which suggests that the association between the RNA recognition element (bulged G4319) and the first substrate-binding site in mitogillin (elements in loop 4 of the protein) may trigger a conformational change in the active site of the ribotoxin which permits the efficient cleavage of the GAGA tetraloop. Shapiro (26Shapiro R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6847-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the enzymatic potency and specificity of human angiogenin are partly modulated by hydrogen bonding between two distant amino acid residues (Thr44 and Thr80) that inability to form the hydrogen bond (made possible by a T80A mutation) increases the ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin 11–15-fold (26Shapiro R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6847-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that substrate-specific ribonucleases other than fungal ribotoxins may also modulate their specific activity by similar mechanisms. Deletions in region Asp56 to Lys88 (loop 3) of mitogillin do not appear to interfere with the ribonucleolytic activity or the specificity of mitogillin. The dramatic decrease in RNase activity in ΔArg77-Gln83 may be due to the deletion of a catalytically important residue(s) or a change in the structure of the toxin affecting its catalytic activity. The latter interpretation is more likely since the active site of mitogillin does not indicate the involvement of any residues in region Arg77-Gln83 for catalysis (20Kao R. Shea J.E. Davies J. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, these residues being adjacent to Cys75 which forms a disulfide bond with Cys5 in mitogillin and deletion of Arg77-Gln83 would presumably induce a change in the microenvironment of the active site of mitogillin and, as a result, reduce RNA cleavage activity. Based on available information we cannot define further the functions of loop 3 of mitogillin. Yang and Moffat (21Yang X. Moffat K. Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggest that this region may influence mitogillin/cell surface receptor recognition or translocation of the toxin through the lipid bilayer of the cell; mutants constructed in this region would be good candidates to elucidate the functions of this extra loop of the fungal ribotoxins. In conclusion, we have described the production and properties of 10 deletion mutants of mitogillin, predicated on the hypothesis that motifs showing little amino acid sequence homology with guanyl/purine ribonucleases are functional domains inserted into T1-like ribonucleases through natural genetic engineering. Characterization of the enzymatic properties of the mutant proteins suggests that elements in loop 4 region of mitogillin are involved in the specific recognition of the toxin to the ribosome and elements in β1-loop 1-β2 region involved in modulating the catalytic activity of the toxin. Our studies also suggest that loop 3 of mitogillin may be involved in functions other than targeting mitogillin to the ribosome. It is evident that these additional elements, which appear to have been engineered naturally into T1-like ribonucleases, are not required for RNase activity but have functions specific to cytotoxic activity. The availability of these mutants will aid in further investigation of the biochemical and/or physiological roles of ribotoxin function. An interesting question is whether it will be possible to insert such targeting motifs into other protein sequences to generate other types of ribosome-specific toxins. We thank Dr. M.

https://openalex.org/W2168079577,"Cellular trafficking of subtilisin/kexin-like precursor convertases (PCs) may be regulated by a number of motifs, some of which are present within the P-domain and in the C-terminal sequence. Six of the seven known PCs contain a conserved RGD sequence within the P domain. In order to investigate the functional importance of this motif, we generated mutants of PC1 that contain a Myc tag epitope inserted between the prosegment and the catalytic subunit. Cellular expression of vaccinia virus recombinants revealed that this tag did not seem to influence the autocatalytic conversion of proPC1 into PC1 or its bioactivity. The two PC1 variants produced possess either the wild type RGD sequence or its RGE mutant. Stable transfectants of these variants in AtT20 cells revealed that similar to the wild type enzyme, PC1-RGD-Myc is sorted to secretory granules. In contrast, PC1-RGE-Myc exits the cell via the constitutive secretory pathway. In vitro, a 14-mer peptide spanning the RGD sequence of PC1, but not its RGE mutant, binds to cell surface vitronectin-binding integrins of Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, within the endoplasmic reticulum and in an RGD-independent fashion, integrin α5β1 associates primarily with the zymogens proPC1, proPC1-ΔC (missing the C-terminal 137 residues), as well as proPC2.

Limited proteolysis of prohormones and proproteins is a general mechanism generating bioactive peptides and proteins in a regulated fashion.

The expression of PC1 and PC2 is mostly restricted to endocrine and neural cells. All of these PCs exhibit an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a prosegment, a catalytic domain, a P domain, and an enzyme-specific C-terminal segment (4Seidah N.G. Mbikay M. Marcinkiewicz M.

The most conserved catalytic domain of eukaryotic precursor convertases exhibits the closest similarity to bacterial subtilisins and contains the catalytic triad Asp, His, and Ser, as well as the oxyanion hole Asn (4Seidah N.G.

In contrast to the relatively short bacterial subtilases, the catalytic domain of eukaryotic convertases is extended at the C terminus by a 140–150 amino acid P domain, the function of which is less well understood.

J. 1997; 326: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on molecular modeling, it has recently been suggested that the P domain is an independently folded structure and that in PC1 it consists of 8-stranded β-barrels with a well organized inner hydrophobic core (14Lipkind G.M. Zhou A. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7310-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because it is different from subtilisins, the dibasic cleavage specificity of PCs may require the presence of a large number of acidic (Asp and Glu) residues within the substrate binding region. It was suggested that the P domain, unique to PCs, contributes to the stabilization of their catalytic subunit (14Lipkind G.M. Zhou A. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7310-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Studies of various chimeras implied that the P domain is necessary to both fold and maintain the catalytic pocket in an active form and to regulate the calcium and pH dependence of PCs (15Zhou A. Martin S. Lipkind G. LaMendola J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Within the P domain, a conserved RRGDL sequence is observed in six (except for PC7) of the seven mammalian PCs, and itsRG dipeptide is always present in all PC orthologues (13Lusson J. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For PC7, which exhibits an RRGSL sequence, the C-terminal border is more extended (16Munzer J.S. Basak A. Zhong M. Mamarbachi M. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Lazure C. Benjannet S. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19672-19681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that the RGD sequence in PCs lies in between two β-strands (β3 and β4), which contain 6 of the predicted 22 residues forming the inner hydrophobic core of the P domain (14Lipkind G.M. Zhou A. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7310-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because an RGD sequence is found in a number of proteins that bind cell adhesion integrins, such as fibronectin and vitronectin, it was originally suggested that this motif might be important for the interaction of the PCs with integrins (17Seidah N.G. Gaspar L. Mion P. Marcinkiewicz M. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. DNA. 1990; 9: 415-424Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Binding of fibronectin to its integrin receptor was shown to be dependent on the RGD sequence and to be abrogated when replaced by RGE (18Ruoslahti E. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). The conservation of the RGD motif in mammalian PCs suggested a structural and/or functional role, which may be common to all of them. In a previous report, we showed that the RGD sequence of PC1 is critical for the efficient folding and zymogen processing of proPC1 (89 kDa) into PC1 (83 kDa) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and for its ability to be processed into the C-terminally truncated 66-kDa PC1-ΔC (13Lusson J. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated that the 66-kDa form of PC1 is formed inside granules (19Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem.

Accordingly, data derived from vaccinia virus expression of the RGE mutant of PC1 suggested that the RGD motif is important for the sorting of PC1 into the regulated secretory pathway (13Lusson J. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the functional importance of the RGD sequence in the cellular sorting of PC1 in AtT20 cells that normally express this enzyme endogenously. This was achieved using stable transfectants of PC1-RGD and PC1-RGE containing a Myc epitope tag. Biosynthetic and immunocytochemical data provided strong evidence for the critical importance of the RGD motif in the sorting of PC1 to secretory granules. Cell adhesion assays showed that in vitro, a synthetic 14 amino acid (aa) peptide spanning the RGD sequence of PC1 can bind to integrins. In contrast, co-expression studies in AtT20 cells provided evidence for an RGD-independent ER-localized binding of integrin α5β1 to proPC1, proPC1-ΔC (missing the 137-aa C-terminal segment ΔC but still containing the RGD sequence (23Jutras I.

Their sequences were as follows: sense, 5′-CGTTCAGTTGAACAAAAGCTCATCTCAGAGGAAGATCTT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CGAAGATCTTCCTCTGAGATGAGCTTTTGTTCAACTGAA-3′. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was then ligated into the Psp1406-I site of the cDNA of mPC1. The mutated mPC1-RGD-Myc and mPC1-RGE-Myc were then subcloned either into the 5′HindIII/SalI 3′ sites of PMJ602 vector, and vaccinia virus recombinants were isolated, as described Ref. 20Benjannet S.

J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, or into the 5′ HindIII/EcoRV 3′ sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The isolation of recombinant vaccinia viruses (vvs) expressing mPC1 and mPC2, as well as their RGD mutants, was previously reported (13Lusson J. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Chrétien M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The recombinant vv:mPOMC was a generous gift of Dr. Gary Thomas (Portland, OR). We have similarly isolated vaccinia virus recombinants of the human (h) integrins α5 and β1, kindly provided by Dr. E. Ruoslahti (La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA). GH4C1 or AtT20 cells were infected with the specified plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell vv:mPC1-RGD, vv:mPC2-RGD, vv:mPC1-RGE, vv:mPC2-RGE, vv:mPC1-RGD-Myc, vv:mPC1-RGE-Myc, vv:mPOMC, vv:hα5, and vv:hβ1. Full-length mPC1-RGD-Myc and mPC1-RGE-Myc cDNAs cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) or an empty pcDNA3 vector were transfected into AtT20 cells using a DOSPER reagent as suggested by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Six G418-resistant clones expressing each enzyme were isolated. One of the clones expressing the highest amount of mPC1-RGD-Myc was chosen for further analyses. All mPC1-RGE-Myc G418-resistant clones expressed low levels of the enzyme, as estimated by Western blots using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and the Myc-specific antibody at a dilution of 1:2000. Based on immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled protein, the highest expressor (clone I) was selected for further investigation by biosynthetic analyses and by immunocytochemistry. Seventeen hours postinfection with vv recombinants, GH4C1 cells (3 × 106) were radiolabeled with 200 μCi of [35S]Met for 3 h. The media and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either an N-terminal mPC1-antibody (20Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); an antiserum to β-endorphin (26Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on either 8% or 15% polyacrylamide gels, and the dried gels were autoradiographed (20Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C.

A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). All biosynthesis experiments were performed at least twice. For stable transfectants, AtT20 cells were pulsed for 15 min with [35S]Met followed by a chase of 1 or 3 h in the presence or absence of 5 mm of the secretagogue 8-Br-cAMP (27De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M. Seidah N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because the monoclonal antibody to Myc was not found to be suitable for immunofluorescence cytochemistry, mPC1-Myc was localized in transfected AtT20 cells by using the peroxidase/diamino benzamidine technique (28Benjannet S. Marcinkiewicz M. Falgueyret J.-P. Johnson D.E. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 874-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The primary Myc-1–9E10.2 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100, and the secondary antibody consisted of horseradish anti-mouse IgG coupled to peroxidase used at a 1:75 dilution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The synthetic peptides GRGDSP and GRGESP were purchased from Bachem. The synthetic 14-mer mPC1 peptides, TIEYSRRGD520LHVTL, representing aa 512–525 (24Seidah N.G. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. Gaspar L. Beaubien G. Mattei M.G. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and its D520E mutant TIEYSRRGE520LHVTL, were prepared by solid phase synthesis using fast Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a 431A ABI-solid phase peptide synthesizer. Their quality and purity were verified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, giving the expected molecular masses of 1658 and 1672 Da, respectively. Adhesion substrates were prepared by coating flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μl of vitronectin (prepared as described in Ref.29Yatogho T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) at 1 μg/ml. Coated wells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. CHO cells were obtained in a single cell suspension by treatment of subconfluent cell monolayers with 0.53 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (adhesion buffer) and preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with synthetic peptides. Cells (50,000 cells in 50 μl) were added to each well and allowed to adhere to the substrata for 1 h at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. Unattached cells were removed by gently washing three times with adhesion buffer and residual attached cells were fixed by 1% glutaraldehyde. After staining by 0.1% crystal violet, cells were lysed with 1% SDS, and the absorbance was measured at 600 nm by a microplate reader (model 960 from Metertech). AtT-20 cells were solubilized with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and 1 mm o-phenanthroline). Samples were incubated for 5 h at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal portion of the α5-integrin subunit. Control experiments included a preincubation of the anti-α5 antibody with excess of the C-terminal peptide immunogen. Immunoprecipitated material was submitted to SDS-PAGE on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose. For Western blot analyses, polyclonal antibodies against the N terminus of PC1 and the C terminus of PC2 were used. The labeled proteins were detected using the above enhanced chemiluminescence system. In order to differentiate the expression of exogenous PC1 from its endogenous homologue in cells, we introduced a 10-aa Myc epitope tag between the prosegment and the start of the catalytic subunit. This strategic site was chosen because it was previously shown that insertion of a FLAG-epitope tag at a similar site in furin did not affect its enzymatic properties (30Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Vanslyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). As a test for the effect introducing the Myc tag, we overexpressed vaccinia virus recombinants of PC1-RGD and PC1-RGE in GH4C1 cells (devoid of endogenous PC1 (31Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Day R. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar)) and compared their biosynthesis to those of their Myc-tagged derivatives PC1-RGD-Myc and PC1-RGE-Myc. As shown in Fig. 1, the insertion of a Myc epitope does not affect the autocatalytic conversion (32Goodman L.J. Gorman C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of proPC1 (89 kDa) into PC1 (83 kDa) for either the wild type enzyme or its RGE mutant. Because the extent of processing of PC1-RGD and PC1-RGD-Myc into the 66-kDa PC1-ΔC is quite similar (Fig.1 A), this demonstrates that the Myc tag does not significantly affect the late processing (19Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24702-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) of the 83-kDa form of the wild type PC1 into its 66-kDa derivative. In addition, our data show that the Myc monoclonal antibody allows the immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled Myc-tagged PC1s (Fig. 1 B). Finally, it is clear that no 66-kDa form of PC1-RGE-Myc is secreted into the medium (Fig. 1,A and B) and that both PC1-RGE and PC1-RGE-Myc exhibit lower levels in the medium as compared with their RGD parents (Fig. 1 A) (13Lusson J. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexposure of the autoradiogram did not reveal the presence of any trace of 66-kDa PC1-RGE in either media (not shown). Intracellularly, because both the N-terminal PC1 antibody (Fig. 1 A, CTL) and the monoclonal Myc antibody (Fig. 1 B, RGD andRGE) detect either a nonspecific protein or the endogenous (nonsecretable) c-Myc protein migrating closely to the 66-kDa position (33Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 501-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (325) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B), it is difficult to assess the level of intracellular 66-kDa PC1. As a functional test for the Myc-tagged PC1 activity, we compared theex vivo ability of PC1 and PC1-Myc enzymes to process POMC into β-lipotrophic hormone (26Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, the levels of secreted β-lipotrophic hormone are similar in the presence or absence of the Myc epitope tag. This demonstrates that the introduction of the Myc tag at the selected position did not affect the intracellular enzymatic activity or cleavage selectivity of PC1. Finally, and in accordance with the lower overall levels of PC1-RGE and PC1-RGE-Myc as compared with their RGD parents (Fig. 1), we note that the former produces less β-lipotrophic hormone than the latter, as was previously observed for the RGE mutant of PC1 (13Lusson J. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In order to study the importance of the integrity of RGD motif on the sorting of PC1 to secretory granules, we chose the widely used AtT20 cells (which endogenously synthesize large amounts of wild type PC1) as the ideal cell type to perform this investigation. We thus generated stable transfectants of both PC1-RGD-Myc and PC1-RGE-Myc and selected the highest expressing clones for each, based on levels estimated by Western blots using the Myc antibody (Fig.3). Although at least three clones exhibiting high expression levels of PC1-RGD-Myc were isolated (we only show one of them), all positive PC1-RGE-Myc clones revealed relatively much lower intracellular levels of Myc-tagged PC1. Again, no 66-kDa form of PC1 was observed for the latter clones (Fig. 3). We thus selected one of them (clone I) for biosynthetic analyses (Fig.4) and immunocytochemical localization (Fig. 5).Figure 4Biosynthetic analysis of stable transfectants of mPC1-Myc in AtT20 cells. AtT20 cells (3 × 106) stably transfected with either mPC1-Myc-RGD or mPC1-Myc-RGE in pcDNA3 were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]Met and chased for either 1 or 3 h in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 5 mm 8-Br-cAMP. The mPC1-Myc proteins in the cells and media were analyzed under the same conditions as in Fig. 1 using the Myc monoclonal antibody. The resulting autoradiogram also depicts the migration positions of proPC1 (89 kDa), PC1 (83 kDa), and the C-terminally truncated PC1-ΔC (66 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Comparative immunocytochemistry of mPC1-RGD-Myc and mPC1-RGE-Myc in AtT20 cells. Distribution pattern of mPC1-RGD-Myc (A) and mPC1-RGE-Myc (B) revealed with a Myc monoclonal antibody using the diamino benzamidine-immunoperoxidase technique (28Benjannet S. Marcinkiewicz M. Falgueyret J.-P. Johnson D.E. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 874-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunostaining to mPC1-RGD-Myc was found paranuclearly and in some tips of the cellular extensions (A, dark triangles). This pattern resembles that of ACTH in AtT20 cells (34Benjannet S. Savaria D.

In contrast, for the mPC1-RGE-Myc, immunostaining was predominantly found paranuclearly (B), suggesting a Golgi-like localization similar to that reported for the TGN marker TGN38 (34Benjannet S.

Furthermore, within cellular extensions, very little Myc immunoreactivity was found (B, arrows). Magnification, × 500; scale bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The stable transfectants were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met for 15 min, followed by a chase of either 1 or 3 h in the presence or absence of 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, after 1 h of chase, the ratio of the levels of PC1-RGD-Myc (83 kDa) in cAMP treated versus control cells was 1.8, as compared with 3.1 for the 66-kDa derivative. In contrast, the ratio of the levels of secreted 83-kDa PC1-RGE-Myc in the presence versus absence of cAMP was 0.9. At the 3 h-chase time, the corresponding values for the secreted 83- and 66-kDa RGD forms were 1.1 and 2.7, respectively. Concomitantly, the corresponding intracellular ratios of the 83- and 66-kDa forms of PC1-RGD-Myc were 0.9 and 0.5, respectively. Thus, following the 3-h chase, practically all the 83-kDa form of PC1 is converted into PC1-ΔC (which lacks the C-terminal 137 aa but still contains the RGD sequence), and cAMP can only stimulate the secretion of the latter form. These results are in agreement with the fact that the 66-kDa form is primarily found in granules, whereas the 83-kDa form is mostly in the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) (19Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem.

At the 3-h chase period, the level of secreted 83-kDa PC1-RGE-Myc is also slightly lower in the presence of cAMP. These data strongly suggest that the majority of PC1-RGE-Myc exit the cells via the unregulated, constitutive secretory pathway. Finally, it seems that the major intracellular form of PC1-RGE-Myc exhibits a lower molecular mass than the secreted form and that its levels did not appreciably diminish after 3 h chase, suggesting a low turnover of this likely immature ER-associated form. As shown in Fig. 5 A, immunostaining for PC1-RGD-Myc was observed both paranuclearly and at the cellular tips (dark triangles). This pattern is ver"

M. F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 1149–1155; Fagan, K. A., Mahey, R., and Cooper, D. M. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12438–12444; Fagan, K. A., Mons, N., and Cooper, D. M. F. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 9297–9305). These findings led to the suggestion that adenylyl cyclases and capacitative Ca2+entry channels were localized in the same functional domain of the plasma membrane. In the present study, we have asked whether a heterologously expressed Ca2+-permeable channel could regulate the Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase of C6-2B glioma cells. The cDNA coding for the rat olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel was inserted into an adenovirus construct to achieve high levels of expression. Electrophysiological measurements confirmed the preservation of the properties of the expressed olfactory channel. Stimulation of the channel with cGMP analogs yielded a robust elevation in cytosolic Ca2+, which was associated with an inhibition of cAMP accumulation, comparable with that elicited by capacitative Ca2+ entry. These findings not only extend the means whereby Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases may be regulated, they also suggest that in tissues where they co-exist, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases may reciprocally modulate each other's activity.

Cation-permeable, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNG channels) 1The abbreviations used are: CNG channel, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel; CCE, capacitative calcium entry; [Ca2+]i, cytosolic Ca2+concentration; [Ca2+]ex, extracellular Ca2+ concentration; CPT-cGMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; TG, thapsigargin; ACVI, adenylyl cyclase type VI; CNGC, CNG channel; TP, terminal proteinhave traditionally been considered in terms of their roles in visual and olfactory signal transduction. The retinal channel, which is activated by cGMP, is responsible for the “dark” current (1Fesenko E.E. Kolesnikov S.S. Lyubarsky A.L. Nature. 1985; 313: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 2Finn J.T. Grunwald M.E. Yau K.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 395-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), while the closely related olfactory channel is gated by cAMP, and is thought to lead to activation of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents and membrane depolarization (3Lowe G. Gold G.H. Nature. 1993; 366: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Increasingly, however, a more widespread function for these channels in cell physiology has been envisioned, partially due to the finding that the channels are expressed in a wide range of tissues and cell types. For instance, proteins homologous to the CNG channel have been cloned from such diverse tissues as heart, kidney, and testis, as well as from liver and skeletal muscle (4Ruiz M.L. London B. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Ding C. Potter E.D. Qiu W. Coon S.L. Levine M.A. Guggino S.E. Am. J.

CNG channels have also been found in various brain regions, namely, the hippocampus, cortex, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and other neural derived tissues such as pineal and pituitary gland (5Ding C. Potter E.D. Qiu W. Coon S.L. Levine M.A. Guggino S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1335-C1344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kingston P.A. Zufall F. Barnstable C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1994; 368: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The observation that these channels are widely expressed prompts a reevaluation of their role in signal transduction. Functionally, the CNG channels belong to the family of ligand-gated channels, but, structurally, they are similar to voltage-gated channels. CNG channels also share the important feature of Ca2+ permeation with voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. At physiological [Ca2+], an expressed, homomeric version of the olfactory CNG channel exhibits a nearly “pure” Ca2+ current (11Frings S. Seifert R. Godde M. Kaupp U.B. Neuron. 1995; 15: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In comparison, only ∼5% of the current through the NMDA channel is carried by Ca2+ (12Schneggenburger R. Zhou Z. Konnerth A. Neher E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 133-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, these channels provide a second messenger-regulated form of Ca2+ entry into the cell whose primary function may be to elevate [Ca2+]i. Adenylyl cyclases are regulated by physiological transitions in [Ca2+]i (reviewed in Refs. 13Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Fagan K. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 14Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar)). In fact, of the nine currently described isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, Ca2+ directly regulates four. Adenylyl cyclase types I and VIII are stimulated, while types V and VI are inhibited by submicromolar [Ca2+]. We have previously shown that Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases are regulated by capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) while they are refractory to [Ca2+]i rises produced by other means, such as release from internal stores or entry mediated by ionophore in nonexcitable cells (15Fagan K.A.

The dependence of these adenylyl cyclases on Ca2+ entering through CCE channels suggested a functional colocalization of CCE channels and Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether Ca2+ entry through heterologously expressed CNG channels might regulate these enzymes. C6-2B cells, which endogenously express a Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase (type VI) (17Debernardi M.A. Munshi R. Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Brooker G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were used to determine whether Ca2+ entry through an olfactory CNG channel could regulate cAMP accumulation. Expression of the rat olfactory CNG channel (18Dhallan R.S. Yau K.W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) was accomplished by creating an adenovirus construct containing the channel. Infection with the adenovirus/CNG channel permits efficient expression in a large majority of the cells. The expression of the channel was evaluated by both [Ca2+]imeasurements in cell populations and electrophysiological methods. Activation of the CNG channel with the cell-permeant cGMP analog, CPT-cGMP, generated a [Ca2+]i rise that was dependent on [CPT-cGMP], time of exposure to CPT-cGMP, and [Ca2+]ex. Furthermore, activation of the channel with CPT-cGMP and its associated [Ca2+]irise produced a substantial inhibition of cAMP accumulation. The magnitude of the global [Ca2+]i rise generated by the CNG channel was modest in comparison with capacitative Ca2+ entry, but both modes of Ca2+ entry were equally efficacious in their ability to reduce cAMP levels. Therefore, Ca2+ entry through a heterologously expressed CNG channel can modulate endogenous cAMP levels. These data not only show that a Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase can be regulated by a heterologously expressed Ca2+ channel, but also, that CNG channels may play a role in modulating cAMP accumulation in tissues where channels and adenylyl cyclases are co-expressed. Thapsigargin, forskolin, and Ro 20-1724 were from Calbiochem. [2-3H]Adenine and [α-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fura-2/AM and pluronic acid were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Other reagents were from Sigma. C6-2B rat glioma cells were maintained in 13 ml of F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (Gemini) in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were plated at approximately 70% confluency in 100-mm culture dishes for infection with the CNG channel construct. 48 h postinfection, cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.03% EDTA and immediately used for measurement of cAMP accumulation or [Ca2+]i. A fragment encoding the rat olfactory CNG channel α-subunit cDNA (18Dhallan R.S. Yau K.W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) was ligated between theBamHI and SalI sites in the plasmid pACCMV, which encodes the left end of the adenovirus chromosome with the E1A gene and the 5′-half of the E1B gene replaced by the cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter, a multiple cloning site, and intron and polyadenylation sequences from SV40 (19Gomez-Foix A.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield the plasmid pACCMV-CNGC. pACCMV-CNGC was digested with SalI and ligated with a BstBI adaptor in order to create pACCMV-CNGCBst, such that sequences encoding CNGC and the left end of the adenovirus chromosome could be ligated directly to the right arm of the adenovirus chromosome to create a transducing vector using a newly developed protocol. 2J. Schaack, unpublished data.pACCMV-CNGCBst was digested with BstBI (to provide an end to ligate with adenovirus DNA) and XmnI (to provide a blunt end that would inhibit recircularization of the plasmid as well as the formation of concatamers). The digested plasmid DNA was ligated with BstBI-digested Ad5dl327Bstβ-Gal-TP complex (20Schaack J. Langer S. Guo X. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3920-3923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ad5dl327Bstβ-Gal has a deletion of the fragment between the XbaI sites at 28,593 and 30,471 base pairs and therefore does not encode any of the products of the E3 region. The ligated DNA was used to transfect 293 cells using Ca3(PO4)2 precipitation (21Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were incubated for 7 days. A freeze-thaw lysate was prepared from the cells, and dilutions were used to infect 293 plates for plaque purification. The infected 293 plates were overlaid with medium in Noble agar, fed after 4 days, and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside and neutral red (20Schaack J. Langer S. Guo X. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3920-3923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clear plaques, which are derived from recombination that results in deletion of the lacZ gene present in the parental viral chromosome, were amplified and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction digestion for the presence of the CNGC cDNA. Plaques that proved positive by polymerase chain reaction and restriction digestion analysis were tested for the ability to direct expression of CNGC. This procedure resulted in efficient production of viruses encoding CNGC. The virus, termed Ad5dl327CMV-CNGC, was grown in large scale, purified by successive banding on step and isopycnic CsCl gradients, and dialyzed versus three changes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH. 7.9, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 50% glycerol at 4 °C. Virus particle concentration was quantitated by determination of the absorbance at 260 nm. Virus was stored at −20° until use. cAMP accumulation in intact cells was measured according to the method of Evans et al. (22Evans T. Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (16Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with some modifications. C6-2B cells on 100-mm culture dishes were incubated in F-10 medium (60 min at 37 °C) containing [2-3H]adenine (20.0 μCi/dish) to label the ATP pool. The cells were then washed once and detached using phosphate-buffered saline-containing EDTA (0.03%). The cells were then resuspended in a nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2 m Tris base. The resuspended cells were then aliquotted (approximately 3 × 105cells/tube) and used for cAMP determination assays in triplicate. All experiments were carried out at 30 °C in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm) and Ro 20-1724 (100 μm), which were preincubated with the cells for 10 min prior to a 1-min assay. Assays were terminated by the addition of 10% (w/v, final concentration) trichloroacetic acid. Unlabeled cAMP (100 μl, 10 mm), ATP (10 μl, 65 mm), and [α-32P]ATP (∼7000 cpm) were added to monitor recovery of cAMP and ATP. After pelleting, the [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP content of the supernatant were quantified according to the standard Dowex/alumina methodology (23Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Accumulation of cAMP is expressed as the percentage of conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP; means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations are indicated. Currents through CNG channels were measured using the whole-cell patch clamp technique and an Axopatch-200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and heat-polished. To ensure adequate voltage control in the whole cell configuration pipette, resistance was limited to 3.5 megaohms and averaged 2.8 ± 0.1 megaohms (n = 39). Voltage offsets were zeroed with the pipette in the bath solution. Pipettes were then lowered onto the cells, and gigaohms seals were formed by applying light suction (12.8 ± 0.9 gigaohms). After achieving whole cell configuration, capacitive transients were elicited by applying 20-mV steps from the holding potential (0 mV), filtered at 10 kHz, and recorded at 40 kHz for calculation of access resistance and input impedance. In all experiments, the voltage error due to series resistance was less than 5 mV. Current records were filtered at 1 kHz, sampled at 5 kHz, and analyzed on an IBM-compatible computer using Pclamp6 software (Axon Instruments). The intracellular pipette filling solution contained 145 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and either 0 or 1 mm cGMP, and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The bath solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, and either 10 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm EGTA, and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. [Ca2+]i was measured in populations of C6-2B cells, using fura-2 as the Ca2+indicator, exactly as described earlier (16Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Analyses were performed using the PRISM statistical software package (version 2.00, GraphPad Software, Inc.) Initial experiments were conducted to optimize the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) for the adenovirus/CNG channel construct (Ad5dl327CMV-CNGC) in C6-2B rat glioma cells, using cytosolic Ca2+ rises ([Ca2+]i) in response to CPT-cGMP as the functional readout (Fig. 2). Following a 48-h incubation of the cells with the CNG channel construct at an m.o.i. of 10, 100, or 200 (A, B, orC), the cells were loaded with fura-2 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and subsequently resuspended in a nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer for Ca2+ measurements in cell populations. Cells were pretreated with various CPT-cGMP concentrations (0, 100, or 300 μm) 8 min prior to the addition of [Ca2+]ex, and the resultant [Ca2+]i rise was measured. Infection of the cells with an m.o.i. of 10 (Fig. 1 A) showed no increase in [Ca2+]i as a result of CPT-cGMP pretreatment, indicating little or no expression of the CNG channel. The small [Ca2+]i rise observed following the addition of [Ca2+]ex, from a resting level of approximately 60 nm to approximately 180 nmresults from the cells being maintained in a nominally Ca2+-free buffer for 8 min and reflects limited CCE. When the cells were infected at higher m.o.i. values (100 and 200; Fig. 2,B and C), pretreatment with CPT-cGMP resulted in a greatly augmented [Ca2+]i rise, which was dependent on the [CPT-cGMP]. Cells infected with an m.o.i. of 100 (Fig. 2 B) gave a maximal [Ca2+]i rise to approximately 600 nm following pretreatment with 300 μm CPT-cGMP and the addition of [Ca2+]ex. When the cells were not pretreated with CPT-cGMP, the resultant rise in [Ca2+]i was similar to that seen in cells infected with an m.o.i. of 10 (approximately 180 nm). Increasing the m.o.i. to 200 slightly augmented the [Ca2+]i rise, which reached approximately 700 nm with a [CPT-cGMP] of 300 μm. Again, in the absence of CPT-cGMP pretreatment, the [Ca2+]i rise was similar to that observed in cells not expressing the CNG channel (to approximately 170 nm, Fig. 2 A). Therefore, an m.o.i of 100 or larger results in the expression of the CNG channel. All subsequent experiments used an m.o.i. of 100. Electrophysiological experiments were conducted to evaluate channel expression.Figure 1Construction of Ad5dl327CMV-CNGC. The Ad5dl327Bstβ-Gal-TP complex (see “Experimental Procedures”) is represented at the top, with thethick line indicating the foreshortened adenovirus chromosome and TP indicated by filled in circlesat either end of the chromosome. The inverted terminal repeats (ITR), which act as origins of replication, and thecis-acting packaging sequence (PKG) are indicated. The pACCMV-CNGC plasmid is indicated immediatelybelow the Ad5dl327Bstβ-Gal-TP complex. Adenovirus sequence and the CMV-CNGC cassette are indicated bythick lines, and plasmid vector (of which only the ends associated with adenovirus sequence are shown) is indicated bythin lines. Ad5dlBst-β-Gal and pACCMV-CMV-CNGC were restriction-digested as indicated, the restriction digests were ligated together, and the ligated sample was used to transfect HEK 293 cells. A lysate of the transfected cells was used to infect new 293 cells, and plaques that were clear in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside were examined for the presence of the CNGC gene. The recombinant viral chromosome encoding CNGC, Ad5dl327CMV-CNGC, is schematically represented at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effectiveness of using an adenovirus construct to heterologously express the olfactory CNG channel was assessed by monitoring currents in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration. Currents were elicited by 250-ms steps from the holding potential, 0 mV, to membrane potentials between −80 and +60 mV in 10 mV increments, followed by a 100-ms step to −40 mV. To determine if CNG channels were present in the infected cells, the pipette solution contained either 0 or 1 mm cGMP, which is a saturating cGMP concentration (18Dhallan R.S. Yau K.W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The bath solution initially contained 10 mmMg2+, which blocks >95% of inward current and >80% of outward current through the olfactory CNG channel (11Frings S. Seifert R. Godde M. Kaupp U.B. Neuron. 1995; 15: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, if CNG channels are present and cGMP is in the patch pipette, only a small outwardly rectifying current should be observed in the presence of 10 mm external Mg2+. Removal of Mg2+from the bath solution would be expected to reveal a substantially larger, nonrectifying current. When recording from cells infected with the adenovirus encoding the CNG channel, only small leak currents (<‖6 pA‖ at ± 40 mV) were observed in 10 mm external Mg2+ when the patch pipette did not contain cGMP (Fig.3 A). Removal of Mg2+ from the bath solution caused a reversible, 2–3-fold increase in leak (Fig. 3, B and C). The addition of the membrane-permeant cGMP analogue, CPT-cGMP (100 μm), to the bath solution induced a large current that was subsequently blocked by 10 mm external Mg2+(data not shown). However, when the patch pipette contained 1 mm cGMP, a small outward current was observed in the presence of 10 mm external Mg2+ (Fig.3 D). Removal of external Mg2+ revealed a substantially larger, nonrectifying current that could be blocked by 10 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 3, E andF). The collected results from 39 cells are shown in Fig.4. Uninfected cells in the presence (n = 9) or absence (n = 10) of cGMP and infected cells in the absence of internal cGMP (n = 9) displayed small inward leak currents, <15 pA at −40 mV, in 0 mm external Mg2+. Infected cells that gave a measurable response in the presence of internal cGMP (n= 11) displayed large inward currents, >700 pA at −40 mV in 0 mm external Mg2+. The cGMP-dependent current was observed in >70% (13 of 18, including 2 of 3 cells exposed to CPT-cGMP) of infected cells and no (0 of 9) uninfected cells.Figure 4Expression levels of CNG channels in infected and uninfected cells. Cells infected with the CNG channel construct displayed only small leak currents in the absence of cGMP in the patch pipette (CNGC, 0 mm cGMP, n = 9) in 10 mm Mg2+ (+), after the washout of Mg2+ (−), or after the subsequent wash in 10 mm Mg2+ (+). With cGMP in the patch pipette, infected cells (CNGC, 1 mm cGMP, n = 11) displayed large inward currents. Uninfected cells displayed only small leak currents in either the absence (uninfected, 0 mm cGMP,n = 10) or presence (uninfected, 1 mm cGMP,n = 9) of cGMP in the pipette solution. Measurements are presented as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The next experiments aimed to determine whether the Ca2+ entry through the expressed CNG channel could regulate a Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase that is endogenously expressed in C6-2B cells. The effect of CPT-cGMP pretreatment followed by the addition of varying [Ca2+]ex on cAMP accumulation in uninfected versus infected cells was examined (Fig. 5). cAMP accumulation was measured over a 1-min period following the addition of [Ca2+]ex along with forskolin and isoproterenol to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). All cells were pretreated with the phosphodiesterase inhibitors 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm) and Ro 20-1724 (100 μm) 10 min prior to the 1-min assay. In cells expressing the CNG channel, pretreatment with CPT-cGMP (300 μm) caused steadily increasing inhibition in cAMP accumulation as a function of the [Ca2+]ex. [Ca2+]exof 1, 2, and 4 mm inhibited cAMP accumulation by 20, 25, and 34%, respectively. This was in contrast to uninfected cells, also pretreated with CPT-cGMP (300 μm), which gave a maximal inhibition of 20% at a [Ca2+]ex of 4 mm. The modest degree of inhibition of cAMP accumulation seen with increasing [Ca2+]ex in the cells not infected with the CNG channel construct was the result of limited capacitative Ca2+ entry (see Fig. 2). The above data support the idea that Ca2+ entry through the CNG channel can be sensed by the Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase. To further understand the functional relationship between the CNG channel and the Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase, detailed manipulations of the CPT-cGMP concentration and exposure time, as well as the [Ca2+]ex, were carried out. The ability of the cGMP analog, CPT-cGMP, to activate the CNG channel partly depends on its ability to cross the plasma membrane and reach an effective concentration at the CNG channel. Permeation of CPT-cGMP was examined by varying the amount of time the cells were exposed to the cGMP analog prior to the addition of [Ca2+]ex. Fura-2-loaded C6-2B cells were pretreated with varying amounts of CPT-cGMP for either 2 or 5 min prior to the addition of [Ca2+]ex. The 2-min exposure to CPT-cGMP (Fig. 6 A) resulted in a [Ca2+]i rise following the addition of [Ca2+]ex that depended on the [CPT-cGMP]. At the highest [CPT-cGMP], 100 μm, the [Ca2+]i rise reached a peak of approximately 370 nm after approximately 2 min. The 50 μmCPT-cGMP condition did not reach a plateau in the course of the experiment but reached a slightly lower maximum value (approximately 330 nm) than the 100 μm condition. At even lower [CPT-cGMP], 20 μm, the rate of the [Ca2+]i rise was even slower, and the maximum value achieved was substantially less (approximately 200 nm). In the absence of CPT-cGMP pretreatment, a very modest [Ca2+]i rise was observed, due to the fact that the cells were being maintained in a nominally Ca2+-free medium. When the time of exposure to CPT-cGMP was increased to 5 min, the rate of the [Ca2+]i rise following the addition of [Ca2+]ex was considerably faster, reaching a plateau within the course of the experiment (Fig.6 B). Although the rates of the [Ca2+]irise increased with longer exposure to CPT-cGMP, the peak values reached were very similar to the 2-min exposure (see Fig.6 A) with 20, 50, and 100 μm CPT-cGMP treatments reaching peaks of approximately 200, 320, and 360 nm, respectively. These results showed that permeation of the cGMP analog across the plasma membrane is rather slow, but once maximal activation of the channel has been reached, the peak [Ca2+]i rises are very similar for a given [CPT-cGMP]. In order to consolidate the regulatory consequence of Ca2+entry through the CNG channel on the adenylyl cyclase, different CPT-cGMP exposure times were compared in terms of their effect on cAMP accumulation and Ca2+ entry. Fig.7 shows the effect of varying both the CPT-cGMP concentration and the exposure time to the cGMP analog on the cAMP accumulation in C6-2B cells infected with the CNG channel construct. Following a 2-min exposure to CPT-cGMP, a combination of [Ca2+]ex as well as forskolin and isoproterenol were added to the cells with cAMP accumulation measured over the subsequent minute. With increasing [CPT-cGMP], there was a stepwise increase in the inhibition of cAMP accumulation ranging from 7% inhibition with 20 μm CPT-cGMP to 32% with 300 μm CPT-cGMP (Fig. 7 A). It should be noted that the extent of inhibition observed with increasing [CPT-cGMP] agrees well with the extent of Ca2+ entry (Fig. 6 A). Without CPT-cGMP pretreatment of the cells, a minimal inhibition of cAMP accumulation (8%) was observed, which is very similar to the 20 μm CPT-cGMP condition. As seen in Fig. 6 A, 0 and 20 μm CPT-cGMP produce a similar [Ca2+]i rise within the first minute, the period over which cAMP accumulation is measured. Therefore, the similarities in the extent of the inhibition seen with 0 and 20 μmCPT-cGMP are consistent with the Ca2+ data. In Fig.7 B, the effects of a 5-min exposure to varying CPT-cGMP concentrations on cAMP accumulation are shown. Again, increasing the CPT-cGMP concentration produced further inhibition of cAMP accumulation following the addition of [Ca2+]ex, with maximal inhibition (31%) observed at 300 μm CPT-cGMP. The amount of inhibition observed in the absence of CPT-cGMP was again 8%, which, following a 5-min exposure to CPT-cGMP, differs greatly from the 20 μm CPT-cGMP condition (22%). This result was also in good agreement with the corresponding Ca2+ data (Fig. 6 B), where the longer pretreatment with CPT-cGMP resulted in a faster [Ca2+]i rise and, therefore, a higher [Ca2+]i level achieved within the 1-min assay pe"

Because mosquitoes rest vertically after feeding, the effect of gravity on the ingested blood has been proposed as the cause of such a biased distribution. In this paper, we examined the oocyst distribution on the midguts of mosquitoes that were continuously rotated to nullify the effect of gravity and found that the typical pattern of oocyst distribution did not change. Invasion of the midgut epithelium by ookinetes was similarly found to be biased toward the posterior part of the posterior midgut. We examined whether the distribution of oocysts depends on the distribution of vesicular ATPase (V-ATPase)-overexpressing cells that Plasmodium ookinetes preferentially use to cross the midgut epithelium. An antiserum raised against recombinant Aedes aegypti V-ATPase B subunit indicated that the majority of V-ATPase-overexpressing cells inAe. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae are localized at the posterior part of the posterior midgut.

Designing rational strategies to block transmission of malaria can benefit from understanding how the Plasmodium parasite has adapted to the mosquito midgut cellular environment (1Shahabuddin M. Parasitology. 1998; 116 (suppl.): S83-S93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until now, the cellular and biochemical basis of Plasmodium development in the mosquito has been poorly understood. During most of their development in a vector mosquito, malaria parasites remain associated with the midgut. The posterior midgut is the primary site of storage of ingested blood, of the absorption of salts and fluids, and of the digestion of blood components. Within a day after ingestion, the parasites develop in the posterior midgut as motile ookinetes that escape from the blood bolus and invade the epithelium. Invasion of the mosquito midgut is obligatory for further development and transmission. After escaping from the invaded cells, the ookinetes remain associated with the midgut under the basal lamina for about 1 week and are then transformed into oocysts, which leads to the development of sporozoites that are infectious to the vertebrate host. In Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes, the oocysts are primarily distributed at the posterior portion of the posterior midgut. The anterior portion has relatively fewer oocysts, especially when the infection rate is low (<100 oocysts/gut). Previously, this biased distribution was explained by the fact that mosquitoes rest on a wall for a day or two after feeding, their abdomen being in a vertical position. It has therefore been proposed that, because of gravity, the ingested blood cells and parasites settle at the bottom portion of the midgut and that ookinetes only get a chance to invade this part of the midgut (2Neumann R.O. Arch. Protistenkd. 1908; 13: 23-69Google Scholar, 3Shute P.G. Arch. Roum. Pathol. Exp. Microbiol. 1938; 11: 351-359Google Scholar, 4Huff C.G. Am. J. Hyg. 1934; 19: 123-147Google Scholar). One argument against the above explanation comes from the finding that diuresis rapidly compacts the blood meal long before the ookinetes invade the midgut epithelium (5Clements A.N. The Biology of Mosquitoes. 1. Chapman & Hall, New York1992: 304-326Google Scholar), thereby reducing the possibility for the ookinetes to settle down. Here, we examine whether gravity is indeed involved in determining the distribution of oocysts on the mosquito midgut. The mosquito midgut is a complex tissue composed of a variety of cell types (6Clements A.N. The Biology of Mosquitoes. 1. Chapman & Hall, New York1992: 263-271Google Scholar). We have recently found that a specific type of cell (Ross cells) is preferentially invaded by Plasmodium gallinaceumookinetes (7Shahabuddin M. Pimenta P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3385-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ross cells are less basophilic than other cells in the epithelium, they are devoid of microvilli on their surface, and their cytoplasm appears less osmiophilic by electron microscopy. They also overexpress a vesicular ATPase (V-ATPase). 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vesicular ATPase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidBecause of the parasite's preferential invasion of Ross cells, the development of the parasite was thought to possibly depend on the presence, number, and location of these cells in the midgut. We have cloned the Aedes aegypti V-ATPase B subunit cDNA and used the recombinant protein to prepare an antibody to investigate the distribution of V-ATPase-overexpressing cells in the midgut ofAe. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. The oocyst distribution was studied in mosquitoes kept in a device designed to nullify the effect of gravity, and the location of P. gallinaceum ookinete invasion of the midgut epithelium was assessed at the peak invasion period. We provide evidence that Ross cells, rather than gravity, determine the typical distribution pattern of the oocysts in infected mosquitoes. Ae. aegypti black-eye strain and An. gambiae G3 were raised under standard conditions (26 °C, 80% humidity, photoperiodism (12 h dark-12 h light)) and fed on diluted Karo syrup (CPC International Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ). P. gallinaceum (8A strain) was maintained by serial subpassages in 4–5-week-old white Leghorn chickens. Adult mosquitoes were fed on an infected chicken for 20 min. Fed mosquitoes were transferred into two cylindrical containers (9 cm high, 9 cm in diameter). One container was kept on an immobile rack, thus allowing mosquitoes to rest on the wall. The other container was rotated for 48 h at a speed of 10 rpm. The rotation prohibited any specific orientation of the abdomens of the blood-fed mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were then kept in an insectary and dissected for oocyst counting at 8 days post-blood meal. Oocysts were counted separately in the anterior and posterior halves of the posterior midgut with a microscope equipped with an eyepiece micrometer. The statistical comparison (nonparametric) and the significance test of the oocyst numbers between two groups of infected mosquitoes were determined using Wilcoxon rank sum analysis. All of the mosquitoes in the test and control groups that received a blood meal were included in analysis regardless of whether they had oocysts. Two degenerate primers designed from the predicted amino acid sequence of the V-ATPase B subunit from yeast (8Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1775-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were as follows: sense primer, 5′-GG(ACGT)TT(TC)CC(ACGT)GGITA(TC)ATGTA(TC)A-3′ (degeneracy = 1/128); and antisense primer, 5′-GC(TC)TC(TC)TCICCIAC(ACGT)AC(ACGT)GC(TC)TTC-3′ (degeneracy = 1/128). Thirty-five cycles of PCR were performed with these primers using 1 ng of Ae. aegypti genomic DNA as target. The conditions for the PCR were 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 45 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, performed in an automatic thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9600, Perkin-Elmer). The amplified product was subcloned into the pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and its nucleotide sequence determined. A cDNA library made with the mRNA of unfed and blood-fed midguts of Ae. aegypti and the Lambda Zap Express cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was a kind gift of Dr. Anthony James (University of California at Irvine). The unamplified library consisted of 12.9 × 106 λ phages, of which 95.3% were recombinant as determined by blue/white screening. This library was amplified before screening (final titer = 2.3 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml in Escherichia coliXL1-Blue cells). The library was screened with a digoxygenin-labeled PCR-amplified fragment of the Ae. aegypti V-ATPase B subunit gene (see above). The preparation, hybridization, and detection of the probe were performed using the DIG/Genius kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Nine positive clones were purified and excised in vivo to produce pBK-CMV recombinant phagemids (Stratagene). Once the identity of the clones was confirmed by initial sequencing, the complete nucleotide sequence of one clone was performed by primer walking using a modified dideoxynucleotide-based sequencing method (ABI model 377; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For cloning, the ORF of the Ae. aegypti V-ATPase B subunit cDNA was amplified by PCR with a 5′ primer containing the start codon ATG and an antisense 3′ primer containing the stop codon TAA.NdeI and BamHI sites were added for directional cloning. The conditions for the PCR were the same as above, except that the extension time was 3 min. The 1.5-kilobase ORF was cloned into the pET11a bacterial expression vector (Stratagene) and introduced intoE. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside into the growth medium and was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on cells harvested 3 h post-induction. To produce antiserum, the Coomassie Blue-stained recombinant V-ATPase B subunit band from a preparatory SDS-polyacrylamide gel was excised, homogenized with Freund's complete adjuvant in PBS, and used to immunize a New Zealand White rabbit (Spring Valley Laboratories, Sykesville, MD). Subsequent boosts, performed at 14-day intervals, were done with incomplete adjuvant. After the third boost, the serum was tested by Western blot analysis. To deplete E. coli-specific antibodies, the antiserum was preabsorbed twice with heat-denatured and sonicated extracts of E. coli BL21(DE3). Midguts from sugar-fed, blood-fed, and infected blood-fed mosquitoes were dissected in PBS and heated at 80 °C for 30 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Chicken blood (negative control) was treated the same way. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% milk in TBS (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and probed with a 1:100 dilution of the preabsorbed polyclonal antiserum. Blots were developed using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:500, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and the Western Blue kit (Promega, Madison, WI). To detect V-ATPase-overexpressing cells, sugar-fed mosquitoes were dissected 4–6 days after emergence. Gut tissues were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1m PIPES buffer (7Shahabuddin M. Pimenta P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3385-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fixed tissues were dehydrated by incubating 5 min each with 20, 40, 60, and 80% methanol in PBS, pH 7.2, and then for 15 min with 100% methanol. Tissues were rehydrated by sequentially washing them with decreasing concentrations of methanol in PBS. Rehydrated and permeabilized tissues were blocked overnight at 4 °C with PBTG (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2% goat serum in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with preabsorbed V-ATPase antiserum diluted in PBTG. After three washes (1 h each) with PBTG, the tissues were incubated for 4 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) diluted in PBTG and 0.005% bisbenzimide H33258 fluorochrome (nuclear stain, Calbiochem). To examine the early invasion of the midgut epithelium by ookinetes,P. gallinaceum-infected blood-fed mosquitoes were treated the same way, except that the blood-fed midguts were dissected in PBS 42 h post-feeding and cut longitudinally to remove the blood meal. An additional incubation with a rhodamine-labeled anti-Pgs28 monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:500) was performed to detect the parasites that had invaded the epithelium. The tissues were then washed five times with PBTG (1 h each), mounted, and examined with a Leitz Ortholux 2 fluorescent microscope using appropriate filter blocks for rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate. In a defined area of the mosquito tissues, the total number of cells, the number of V-ATPase-overexpressing cells, and the number of ookinetes that invaded the epithelium were determined, respectively, by nuclear staining, V-ATPase staining, and Pgs28 staining. In a preliminary experiment, 12 infected blood-fed mosquitoes were individually kept head down in small tubes. After 48 h, which is enough for the food bolus to concentrate in the midgut epithelium and for the majority of ookinetes to invade the midgut epithelium, the mosquitoes were transferred into a cage until dissected and examined for the distribution of oocysts. The distribution of oocysts in these mosquitoes remained biased toward the posterior portion of the posterior midgut (data not shown), similar to the oocyst distribution in the control mosquitoes. We repeated the experiment with 60 fully engorged mosquitoes that were rotated for 48 h to avoid orientation in a particular direction. A control group of mosquitoes from the same cohort, fed on the same infected chicken, was kept in a cage and allowed to rest vertically after feeding. Eight days later, oocyst distributions were determined for the midguts of mosquitoes from both groups. No significant difference (p > 0.1) was observed in the mean number of oocysts per midgut between the control (74.2 ± 15.8, n = 13) and test (102.9 ± 8.6, n = 60) groups. This result suggests that the rotation does not significantly influence the total number of oocysts per midgut; however, the difference between the mean numbers of oocysts present on the anterior part (32.6 ± 2.8) and on the posterior part (70.3 ± 6.3) of the posterior midgut was highly significant (p < 0.001) in the rotated mosquitoes. This finding indicates that gravity does not determine the oocyst distribution. Indeed, all of the mosquitoes in the control group had a majority of the oocysts distributed toward the posterior part of the posterior midgut as expected (Fig. 1; see also Fig. 5 A). Of the 60 mosquitoes that were rotated, only two had slightly more oocysts on the anterior part of the posterior midgut. In four other mosquitoes, the oocysts were equally distributed between the anterior and the posterior parts of the posterior midgut. All of the other mosquitoes (90%) had oocysts primarily in the posterior half of the posterior midgut. The lack of difference in the distribution of oocysts between the control and test mosquitoes suggests that gravity does not have a detectable effect on oocyst distribution in the posterior midgut of the mosquito.Figure 5P. gallinaceum ookinete invasion and oocyst development in the Ae. aegypti posterior midgut.

G, magnification of the boxed area in E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the stage at which the spatial distribution of oocysts is defined, we examined the early invasion of ookinetes in the mosquito midgut. The number of parasites that invaded the midgut epithelium was estimated at 42 h after infection, when the majority of invasion is complete but no oocysts are yet formed (9Sieber K.P. Huber M. Kaslow D. Banks S.M. Torii M. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The invaded parasites were detected on the surface of intact midguts using rhodamine-labeled monoclonal antibodies raised against the ookinete surface protein Pgs28 (10Duffy P.E. Pimenta P. Kaslow D.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The majority of parasites were found in the posterior half of the posterior midgut, whereas only a few invasion events were detected in the anterior half (see Fig. 5, B andC), suggesting that the oocyst distribution is determined at or prior to the time of invasion. Because in Ae. aegypti the parasites preferentially invade a particular type of cell known as Ross cells (7Shahabuddin M. Pimenta P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3385-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we examined whether the distribution of these cells in the mosquito midgut could determine the location of the oocysts. One of the characteristics of Ross cells is their overexpression of a V-ATPase. We therefore chose to use the Ae. aegypti V-ATPase as a marker to examine the distribution of these specialized cells in the mosquito midgut. The sequence of the B subunit of V-ATPase enzymes is well conserved among organisms as evolutionarily separated as bacteria and humans. We prepared two degenerate primers from the amino acid sequence of the yeast V-ATPase B subunit, ranging from amino acid 303 to 310 for the 5′ primer and amino acids 417 to 424 for the 3′ primer (8Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1775-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A PCR product of the expected size (365 base pairs) was amplified from genomic DNA prepared from newly emerged larvae of Ae. aegypti. Data base comparisons using the sequenced PCR product demonstrated 100% identity at the amino acid level with V-ATPase B subunit sequences from the dipterans Culex quinquefasciatus (11Filippova M. Ross L.S. Gill S.S. Insect Mol. Biol. 1998; 7: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Drosophila melanogaster (12Davies S.A. Goodwin S.F. Kelly D.C. Wang Z. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30677-30684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the lepidopterans Manduca sexta (13Novak F.J. Graf R. Waring R.B. Wolfersberger M.G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) andHelicoverpa virescens (14Gill S.S. Ross L.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This identity suggests that the amplified DNA fragment derives from the Ae. aegypti V-ATPase B subunit gene. A specific digoxygenin-labeled probe made from this PCR-amplified gene fragment was used to screen an Ae. aegypti midgut cDNA library prepared from a pool of sugar-fed and uninfected blood-fed adult mosquito midgut mRNA. Nine positive clones were identified and found by sequence analysis to contain the PCR probe sequence. The complete sequence of one of these cloned cDNAs was determined by primer walking. This cDNA is 2538 base pairs long and contains a 1491-base pair ORF encoding a 496-amino acid protein (Fig.2). The calculated mass of the protein is 55,221 Da and is within the predicted size of V-ATPase B subunits from other organisms (range 54–58 Da). A Prosite analysis identified the signature sequence for the V-ATPase B subunit (PPVNVLPSLS; amino acids 376–385). The predicted amino acid sequence is 98.4% identical with the C. quinquefasciatus V-ATPase B subunit (11Filippova M. Ross L.S. Gill S.S. Insect Mol. Biol. 1998; 7: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), 97.8% identical with the D. melanogaster protein (12Davies S.A. Goodwin S.F. Kelly D.C. Wang Z. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30677-30684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and 97.0% identical with the M. sexta protein (14Gill S.S. Ross L.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This sequence also shares high similarities (50–95%) with its counterparts from organisms as different as bacteria, fungi, plants, parasites, and vertebrates (Fig. 3).Figure 3Sequence comparison of the Ae. aegypti V-ATPase B subunit with V-ATPase B subunits from evolutionary diverse organisms: insects (D. melanogaster), vertebrates (Homo sapiens), plants (Arabidopsis thaliana), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), fungi (Neurospora crassa), and parasites (P. falciparum). Alignments were performed using the Clustal method. Dots represent amino acids that are identical to the mosquito sequence. Dashes represent gaps introduced to maximize the alignments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ORF from the cloned Ae. aegypti V-ATPase B subunit cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted downstream of the T7 promoter of the pET11a vector between the NdeI andBamHI sites. This recombinant plasmid (pSC1) was then introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). After induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the transformedE. coli produced high levels of the recombinant protein (Fig. 4, lane 2). No expression was detected in uninduced transformed bacteria (Fig. 4,lane 1) or in induced nontransformed bacteria (data not shown). The estimated mass of the recombinant protein is similar to the predicted size of the protein encoded by the ORF of the cloned cDNA. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised to Ae. aegyptiV-ATPase B subunit recombinant protein. The antiserum was preabsorbed with heat-denatured and sonicated extracts of the parent E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. As determined by Western blot, this preabsorbed serum recognized the recombinant protein (Fig. 4,lane 3) but no other E. coli or chicken blood antigens (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, the preabsorbed antiserum was used for all subsequent experiments. To determine whether the native mosquito V-ATPase B subunit was recognized by the antiserum, we performed a Western blot analysis with mosquito proteins prepared from sugar-fed adult Ae. aegyptimidguts. One polypeptide of the same estimated size as the recombinant protein was detected in the midgut tissue (Fig. 4, lane 5), suggesting that the antiserum primarily recognizes the mosquito V-ATPase. Protein extracts prepared from midguts of sugar-fed mosquitoes and uninfected or infected mosquitoes 24 h after the blood meal were compared by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4, lanes 5–7). An equivalent of two midguts was used in each case. Within the sensitivity range of the Western blot, no difference was noted in the intensity of the bands between these differently fed midguts. This indicates that blood feeding or infection with Plasmodiumdoes not affect V-ATPase expression in the mosquito midgut. We then used immunofluorescence assay to determine whether the antiserum detects V-ATPase-expressing cells in sugar-fed Ae. aegypti midguts. As seen in Fig. 5,E and G, the antiserum recognizes a subset of cells in the mosquito midgut. This is similar to our previous finding with a C. quinquefasciatus V-ATPase antiserum (7Shahabuddin M. Pimenta P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3385-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have examined the distribution of V-ATPase-overexpressing cells in the posterior midgut of Ae. aegypti. Most notable during this analysis was the nonrandom distribution of these cells in this region; ∼90% were present at the posterior portion of the posterior midgut versus ∼10% at the anterior part of the posterior midgut (Fig. 5, D and E). An. gambiae G3 mosquitoes are vectors for human malaria but are considered to be refractory toP. gallinaceum development (15Huff C.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1965; 16: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, in a small proportion of these mosquitoes, a few parasites develop as oocysts, again at the posterior half of the posterior midgut. 2S. O. Cociancich and M. Shahabuddin, unpublished observations. In our previous attempts with Culex V-ATPase antiserum, we failed to detect V-ATPase-overexpressing cells in An. gambiae midguts, precluding the study of whether cells similar to Ross cells were present in Anopheles mosquitoes. Here, we examined whetherAe. aegypti V-ATPase antiserum can detect V-ATPase-overexpressing cells in An. gambiae. By Western blot, we detected a single protein of similar size to the one found inAe. aegypti (Fig.6 A). We then used the antiserum in an immunofluorescence assay to detect cells that express the enzyme. Similar to Ae. aegypti, the antiserum specifically recognized V-ATPase-overexpressing cells in the An. gambiae midgut epithelium (Fig. 6 D). Because our V-ATPase antiserum was able to detect the Anopheles enzyme and the cells that express this enzyme, we examined whether P. gallinaceum also invades V-ATPase-overexpressing cells inAn. gambiae and whether the oocyst distribution is determined by the presence of these cells. An. gambiae were fed with P. gallinaceum-infected blood, and 36–40 h later, their midguts were dissected and probed with V-ATPase B subunit and Pgs28 antisera. We found that, as in Ae. aegypti, P. gallinaceum ookinetes invade An. gambiae cells that express high levels of V-ATPase (Fig.6 B). When the distribution of V-ATPase-overexpressing cells was examined, we found that the anterior half of the posterior midgut had very few of these cells (less than 10% of the total V-ATPase-overexpressing cells) and that more than 90% of them were present at the posterior half. These data indicate that althoughAn. gambiae G3 is refractory to P. gallinaceum,P. gallinaceum ookinetes do invade functionally related cells in both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae. In this paper, we provide evidence that the distribution ofPlasmodium oocysts on the posterior midgut of mosquitoes is related to the presence and distribution of V-ATPase-overexpressing Ross cells. We also present evidence indicating that gravity plays no major role in the phenomenon. Indeed, when mosquitoes were kept under conditions in which gravity could not have any effect on the distribution of the ingested blood cells and parasites in the posterior midgut, we found that the pattern of oocyst distribution remains biased toward the posterior end of the posterior midgut. In only 10% of mosquitoes did we find oocysts distributed in equal or greater numbers on the anterior half of the posterior midgut (Fig. 1). The reasons for this unusual distribution pattern are unclear but may involve individual differences in the vector or alternative distribution of Ross cells or other invaded cell types in the midgut. We have also shown that the initial invasion of the midgut epithelium by ookinetes primarily occurs at the posterior part of the posterior midgut. When the distribution of V-ATPase-overexpressing cells in Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae was examined, we found that these cells were also primarily located at the posterior part of the posterior midgut. V-ATPases are members of the class of ATP-hydrolyzing proton pumps ubiquitous among living organisms (16Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The ATPase family can be divided into three distinct groups (17Lichko L.P. Okorokov L.A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar): i) the P-ATPases, which are localized in plasma membranes; these are composed of a single subunit, and the degradation of ATP involves a phosphorylated intermediate; ii) the F0/F1-ATPases, which are multisubunit molecules found in eubacteria and in organellar membranes (mitochondria and chloroplasts); and iii) the V-ATPases, which were first identified in vesicular membranes but have recently been found in the cytoplasmic membrane of epithelial cells. They resemble the F0/F1-ATPases both in their structure and in the way they catalyze ATP but are classified as a distinct family because they are not sensitive to F0/F1-ATPase inhibitors. V-ATPases are composed of nine subunits organized in two domains: one transmembrane domain and one cytoplasmic (catalytic) domain. The catalytic domain includes three copies of both the A (catalytic) and B (regulatory) subunits. Taking advantage of the high degree of sequence conservation among organisms as different as bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, and vertebrates, we have cloned and expressed the B subunit of the Ae. aegypti V-ATPase. The production of an antiserum raised against the recombinant protein allowed us to study both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae cells that overexpress this enzyme. The role of V-ATPases in the mosquito midgut is not known. In M. sexta larvae midguts, specialized cells resembling vertebrate goblet cells overexpress V-ATPase and appear to be involved in ion and water transportation from the midgut lumen to the hemolymph (18Wieczorek H. Weerth S. Schindlbeck M. Klein U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11143-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that malpighian tubules, which play an important role in fluid absorption, overexpress a V-ATPase at their surface (19Maddrell H.P. O'Donnell M.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 417-429PubMed Google Scholar). It might therefore be possible that the V-ATPase-overexpressing cells present in the posterior midgut of mosquitoes are involved in the diuresis that occurs immediately after blood feeding. However, it is not known why the parasites prefer to use these cells to cross the midgut. This study was undertaken in the context of how the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum develops in its vector and is transmitted. P. gallinaceum is better adapted to use in the laboratory and hence is commonly used as a model for malaria transmission-blocking studies. Several genes have been cloned fromP. gallinaceum and reveal greater homology with P. falciparum than with any other Plasmodium spp. (20Waters A.P. Higgins D.G. McCutchan T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3140-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Also, the blocking of P. gallinaceum oocyst development inAedes mosquitoes by the chitinase inhibitor allosamidin can be reproduced with P. falciparum in Anophelesmosquitoes (21Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results presented here might apply toP. falciparum, allowing us to initiate work on V-ATPase-overexpressing cells in An. gambiae to determine their role in human malaria transmission.

The family of SLRPs include decorin, biglycan, and epiphycan, all of which contain chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains attached to the N-terminal domain of the core protein and fibromodulin, lumican, keratocan, PRELP, and osteoglycin which often have keratan sulfate linked to asparagine residues in the central region of the core protein. The extracellular matrix glycoprotein chondroadherin has a structural organization similar to the core proteins of the SLRPs but has not been shown to be substituted with glycosaminoglycan chains (11Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological importance of the different SLRPs is unclear. In vitrobinding studies have shown that decorin, biglycan, and fibromodulin can interact with several types of collagen (12Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biolchem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 14Bidanset D.J.

Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and different SLRPs are believed to be important regulators of collagen fibrillogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, a decorin-deficient mouse was found to have fragile skin with an abnormal organization of collagen fibers (17Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). The phenotype appears to be largely restricted to the skin, perhaps suggesting that other SLRPs have similar functions and may fulfill this role in other collagenous tissues. In fact, a lumican-deficient mouse also exhibited abnormal collagen fibers both in the skin and cornea (18Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Decorin may also affect the production of other extracellular matrix components by regulating the activity of transforming growth factor-β (19Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 20Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegård D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Additionally, decorin can modulate the interactions of matrix molecules such as fibronectin with cells (21Schmidt G. Robenet H. Harrach B. Glossl J. Nolte V. Hormann H. Richter H. Kresse H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1683-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Lewandowska K. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L. Culp L.A. J.

These observations suggest that decorin and perhaps other SLRPs regulate at several levels the production and assembly of the extracellular matrix and hence the remodeling of connective tissue. Zinc, a divalent cation, is one of the essential trace elements for eukaryotic organisms. Zinc ions play a key role in biological processes by being directly involved in enzyme catalysis or by binding to specific sites in a protein to stabilize the conformations which are of importance to the function of the protein (24Vallee B.L. Auid D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar, 25Jacobs G.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the extracellular matrix, zinc is required for the activity of matrix metalloproteases which are responsible for the degradation of structural extracellular matrix components (26Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar). Breakdown and remodeling of the ECM occur in normal embryo development, wound healing, and many pathological processes such as cancer, arthritis, and osteoporosis (26Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar, 27Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 67-85PubMed Google Scholar). Structural extracellular matrix molecules such as laminin (29Ancsin J.B. Kisilevsky R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6845-6851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), link protein (30Rosenberg L. Choi H.U. Tang L-H. Pal S. Johnson T. Lyons D.A. Laue T.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind zinc ions. The Zn2+-binding sites have been located to subdomains of some of these proteins (31Reinhardt D. Mann K. Nischt R. Fox J.W. Chu M-L. Krieg T. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10881-10887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Varelas J.B. Kollar J. Huynh T.D. Hering T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a previous study, biglycan was shown to self-associate in the presence of zinc ions and shown to bind Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ in metal chelate affinity chromatography studies (34Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding affinity and binding domain, however, have not been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that decorin is a metalloprotein and binds two zinc ions per core protein with an average K D of ∼1 μm. The Zn2+-binding domain is mapped to the N-terminal region in the decorin core protein and a short (41 amino acid long) peptide is shown to have full Zn2+ binding activity. Furthermore, the Zn2+ binding activity of the corresponding segments in the structurally related core proteins of biglycan, epiphycan, and osteoglycin are analyzed. Decorin was extracted and purified from bovine skin under denaturing conditions as described previously (3Choi H.U. Neame P.J. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L-H. Rosenberg L.C Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intact recombinant decorin was produced in HT1080 cells using a vaccinia virus-based expression system. The recombinant virus construct contains a segment encoding a N-terminal polyhistidine tag, a Factor Xa cleavage site, and the mature human decorin core protein starting with an Asp residue found at position 31 of the full-length human sequence (35Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The polyhistidine tag in the recombinant protein allows for its efficient purification by Ni2+ chelating chromatography. The resulting decorin preparation contains a mixture of proteoglycan and core protein forms. The details of this system have been described earlier (35Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Hocking A.M. Strugnell R.A. Ramamurthy P. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19571-19577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the studies described here, the polyhistidine tag was removed from the recombinant decorin by digestion with Factor Xa (Pierce, Rockford, IL) followed by reapplication of the digestion mixture to a Ni2+ charged column. The final product of cleaved recombinant decorin was collected in the “flow-through” fractions whereas the polyhistidine tag and uncleaved protein were retained on the column. A series of recombinant decorin core protein fragments were produced inEscherichia coli. A mouse embryo cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used as a template along with appropriate primers (Table I) to PCR amplify the decorin cDNA segments. Conditions for PCR were 94 °C for 7 min, followed by 35 cycles involving 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The individual segments were purified, cleaved with appropriate restriction enzymes, and ligated into the pMAL-p2 expression vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) which contain a segment encoding the maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the 5′ end of the expression cassette. The cDNA fragments (MD and MD3) generated with the DCNR2 primer which contains aEcoRI site at 3′ end were first subcloned into the pBluscript SK± vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) throughBamHI and EcoRI sites. Subsequently, the MD/pBluscript and MD3/pBluscript constructs were digested withBamHI and HindIII and then ligated into the pMAL-p2 expression vector. To produce MBP as a control protein without any segment of decorin fused to it, a modified pMAL-p2 vector containing a stop codon and a short polylinker was constructed. The complementary oligonucleotides, MBPF (5′-gatcctgatctagagcatgcctgca-3′) and MBPR (5′-ggcatgctctagatcag-3′) were obtained and allowed to form a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a cohesive BamHI site at the 5′-end followed by a stop codon, XbaI,SphI, and PstI sites. The original pMAL-p2 vector digested with BamHI and PstI was then ligated with that double-stranded oligonucleotide. The newly introducedSphI site which is not present in the original pMAL-p2 vector was used in a restriction enzyme digestion screen to isolate clones carrying the engineered plasmid. The sequences of all decorin/pmAL-p2 constructs isolated from selected clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX).Table IPrimers for PCR amplification of different decorin and biglycan fragments (A) and the corresponding primer pairs for expressed protein subdomains (B)ADCNF9cgcggatccgatgaggcttctggcataatcBamHI D E A S G I IDCNR2ccggaattcttacttgtagtttccaagttgaatggcEcoRI * K Y N G L Q I ADCNR18cccctgcagttacccaactgcggagatgttgttPstI * G V A S I N NDCNF17gccggatcctgggattttccacccgacacBamHI W D F P P DDCNR19cccctgcagttagggcactttgtccaaPstI * P V K D LBGNF11ggcggatccgatgaggaggcttcaggttcaBamHI D E E A S G SBGNR13cccgaattcctagcactgaacaacccgcagEcoRI * C Q V V R LBFragmentPrimersNumber of base pairsb,cThe nucleotide assigned number and amino acid numbers were based on the mouse decorin (PGS2) sequence search from data base with accession number P28654, and mouse bigycan (PGI), accession numberX53928.Number of amino acid residuesb,cThe nucleotide assigned number and amino acid numbers were based on the mouse decorin (PGS2) sequence search from data base with accession number P28654, and mouse bigycan (PGI), accession numberX53928.MDDCNF9232–129631–354DCNR2MD1DCNF9232–114031–303DCNR18MD2DCNF17445–114072–303DCNR18MD3DCNF17445–129672–354DCNR2MD4DCNF9232–44431–71DCNR19MB-NBGNF11346–46538–77BGNR13a Asterisk, stop codon.b,c The nucleotide assigned number and amino acid numbers were based on the mouse decorin (PGS2) sequence search from data base with accession number P28654, and mouse bigycan (PGI), accession numberX53928. Open table in a new tab a Asterisk, stop codon. Previously, a method developed for the production of full-length bovine decorin core protein using a pMAL expression system has been reported (37Hering T.M. Kollar J. Huynh T.D. Varelas J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This procedure involved solubilization and refolding of protein recovered from inclusion bodies. In our case, we obtained significant amounts of soluble recombinant protein from all constructs and we did not attempt to solubilize protein from inclusion bodies. The expression vector constructs were used to transform E. coli strain TB1. The procedure adopted for the expression and purification of the MBP-decorin fusion protein was based on the manual provided by New England Biolabs. In brief, a flask containing 950 ml of Lennox LB (Sigma) was inoculated with 50 ml of a TB1/MBP-decorin overnight culture and grown on a platform shaker for 3∼4 h at 37 °C when the culture reached an OD600 of 0.6–0.8. Expression of fusion protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) to the culture at a final concentration of 0.2 mm and incubation was continued for another 3 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (20 mmTris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) to a final volume of 10 ml/liter of culture and frozen at −80 °C for a minimum of 18 h. To purify the fusion proteins, the cells were thawed and lysed using a French press. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was applied to a 5-ml amylose affinity column (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) equilibrated with 25 ml of Buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A and the MBP-decorin fusion protein was eluted by Buffer A containing 10 mm maltose. The purity of the fusion protein was >70% as judged by SDS-PAGE and the yield was 5–10 mg/liter of culture. To improve the purity of fusion proteins, an additional purification step was required. Ion exchange chromatography was used for further purifying MBP-MD2 and MBP-MD3 protein. The proteins were dialyzed into a buffer composed of 25 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and applied to a column of Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was subsequently eluted with a NaCl gradient (25–500 mm) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Metal ion chelating chromatography on iminodiacetic acid immobilized Sepharose 6B resin (Sigma) charged with Zn2+ was used to further purify MBP-MD, MBP-MD1, and MBP-MD4. The procedure used for charging the column with Zn2+ ions is described in the following section. The purified recombinant proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and Western blot using two polyclonal antibodies that were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 31–47 and 309–326 of the mouse decorin core proteins, respectively. 2V. W-C. Yang, W. Zhou, J. Johnson, and M. Höök, manuscript in preparation. The protein concentrations were determined based on the absorbance atA 280 and the calculated molar extinction coefficient of the different protein constructs (38Gill S.C. Hippel H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). To produce a large quantity of MD4 peptide, we used a pGEX-2T expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). This MD4/pGEX-2T construct encodes glutathione S-transferase (GST) followed a thrombin cleavage site and the MD4 fragment. The cDNA fragment encoding MD4 was obtained by PCR using the mouse embryo cDNA library and primers DCNF9 and DCNR19 as described above (Table IA). The resulting PCR fragment was cleaved by BamHI and PstI, purified, and subcloned into pBluscript. The isolated MD4/pBluscript plasmid was digested with BamHI andEcoRI and ligated into the pGEX-2T expression vector. The recombinant MD4/pGEX-2T plasmid was then transformed into E. coli strain BL-21 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An isolated clone containing the MD4/pGEX-2T plasmid was used after the plasmid had been analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. To express the GST-MD4 fusion protein, flasks containing 950 ml of Lennox LB were inoculated with 15 ml of a BL21/GST-MD4 overnight culture and incubated for 3–4 h when the culture reached an A 600 of 0.4–0.5. Recombinant protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside to the culture at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Bacterial cells were harvested 3 h later by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (8.4 mmNa2HPO4, 1.9 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and adjusting the pH 7.5 to a final volume of 10 ml/liter of culture and frozen at −80 °C for a minimum of 18 h. The cells were thawed and lysed using a French press. One ml of 10% Triton X-100 (Sigma) was added to the cell lysate and mixed until homogeneous. The cell homogenate was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane to remove cell debris. The GST-MD4 fusion protein present in the filtered supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography on a 10-ml column of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated with 50 ml of Buffer B (phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The column was washed with 75 ml of Buffer B and the GST-MD4 protein was eluted from the column with 20 ml of Buffer C (50 mm Tris, 10 mm glutathione, pH 7.5). The purity of GST-MD4 in the eluate was >90%, as judged by SDS-PAGE and the yield was 25–30 mg/liter of culture. To isolate the MD4 peptide, the fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin. The pH and the concentration of NaCl of the eluant containing GST-MD4 was adjusted to pH 8.3, 0.15 m NaCl using 1m NaOH and 3 m NaCl stock solutions. Bovine thrombin (Sigma) was added to give a 1/40 (w/w) enzyme/substrate ratio. The digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature. Subsequently, β-mercaptoethanol was added to the incubation mixture to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) and the solution was adjusted to pH 9.5 by addition of 1 m NaOH. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane to remove any particulate material. The MD4 peptide was purified on a Waters 25 × 200-mm RCM semi-preparative C18 HPLC column and eluted with a gradient of 28 to 36% solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 5% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in solvent A (95% H2O, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 10 min at a flow rate of 25 ml min−1. The purity of the peptide was monitored by running a three-layer Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel consisting of a 15% acrylamide slab, 10% acrylamide spacer, and a 3.5% acrylamide stacker (39Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The identity of the peptide was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectroscopy (The Center for Analytical Chemistry, University of Texas in Houston, Houston, TX). Biglycan isolated from bovine articular cartilage was extracted and purified under denaturing conditions as described previously (3Choi H.U. Neame P.J. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L-H. Rosenberg L.C Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant biglycan containing a N-terminal polyhistidine tag was produced in HT1080 cells using the vaccinia virus expression system as described (36Hocking A.M. Strugnell R.A. Ramamurthy P. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19571-19577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The polyhistidine tag was removed and the recombinant proteoglycan was re-isolated as described above. The preparation of recombinant biglycan contains a mixture of proteoglycan and core protein forms (36Hocking A.M. Strugnell R.A. Ramamurthy P. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19571-19577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The N-terminal segment of the biglycan core protein was produced as a recombinant MBP fusion protein in E. coli. The encoded fusion protein MBP-MB-N is composed of the maltose-binding protein followed by a biglycan peptide, corresponding to amino acid residues 38 to 77. The primers BGNF11 and BGNR13 (Table I) and the mouse embryo cDNA library were used to PCR amplify an appropriate cDNA fragment. The resulting PCR product was cleaved, purified, and ligated into the pMAL-p2 vector. Protein expression and purification protocols were the same as those described above in the preparation of MBP-decorin fusion proteins. In preparation for Zn2+binding experiments, all proteins were dialyzed against Buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA (Sigma) to remove possibly contaminating divalent metal ions and subsequently dialyzed against Buffer D (without EDTA) with three changes. Buffer D was shown to contain less than 5 × 10−8m Zn2+ ions as analyzed by 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) (Sigma) complex formation (40Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Jezorek J.R. Freiser H. Anal. Chem. 1979; 51: 373-376Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A resin composed of iminodiacetic acid-immobilized Sepharose 6B (Sigma) was charged with 10 volumes of 2 mg/ml ZnCl2 (Sigma) in deionized water. The resin was then washed with 5 volumes of Buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8). The charged Sepharose 6B was packed on top of an equal amount of uncharged iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose 6B that has been pre-equilibrated in Buffer E. The purpose of having the uncharged resin on the bottom of the column is to trap zinc ions released from the charged resin during the experiment. The dialyzed test sample was applied to the column. The column was washed with excess amount of Buffer E and the bound protein was eluted by Buffer F in which the pH of Buffer E was titered to 4.0 by addition of glacial acetic acid. The equilibrium dialysis experiments were carried out in a double acrylic microdialysis module (Hoffer, San Francisco, CA). A dialysis membrane was assembled between the two modules to separate each of the eight chambers into two compartments. The molecular weight cut-off of the dialysis membrane was chosen depending upon the molecular size of the test protein. The 12,000–14,000 Da cut-off membrane (Hoffer) was used for the proteoglycan preparations and the MBP fusion proteins. The 2,000 Da cut-off membrane (Spectra/Pro, Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Houston, TX) was used for the MD4 peptide. Aliquots of 150 μl of test protein in Buffer D were added to the inner compartments. The same volume of Buffer D containing increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 μm) was added to the outer compartments. The assembled modules were fitted on a rotating axis and incubated at 4 °C for at least 40 h to reach equilibrium. After incubation, the concentration of Zn2+ in the outer compartments was determined using the metallochromic indicator PAR (41Jezorek J.R. Freiser H. Anal. Chem. 1979; 51: 373-376Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An aliquot of 120 μl from each outer compartment was added to glass tubes containing 2.4 μl of a 5 mm PAR. The components were mixed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow the red PAR·Zn2+ complex to form. The absorbance atA 500 from each sample was determined using a DU-70 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). A standard curve of ZnCl2 (0–40 μm) in Buffer D was generated which showed a linear relationship by plottingA 500 versus the increasing concentration of Zn2+. The concentration of free Zn2+ in solution from each outer compartment was determined by inserting the observed absorbance into the standard curve equation. The concentration of Zn2+ bound to protein was determined using Equation 1,[Zn2+]Total=2[Zn2+]free+[Zn2+]boundEquation 1 [Zn2+]Total is the total concentration of Zn2+ added to the outside compartment of the equilibrium dialysis chamber at the beginning of the experiment. The [Zn2+]free term is multiplied by a factor of 2 to take into account the dilution of [Zn2+]Total at equilibrium in the absence of protein. An equation derived for multiple, independent binding sites (Equation2) was used to analyze the equilibrium binding data (42Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry: Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1982: 654-684Google Scholar),[Zn2+]bound/total protein=n([Zn2+]free/KD)/(1+([Zn2+]free/KD))Equation 2 Total protein is the concentration of protein used in the equilibrium dialysis experiment, n is the number of Zn2+ molecules binding to each protein molecule, andK D is the observed dissociation constant for the Zn2+-protein complex. The reportedK D ± S.E. and Zn2+ binding curves represent the average of at least three independent experiments. CD spectra were collected on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarim"
https://openalex.org/W1968506050,"A number of cell types have previously been shown to bind tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which in some cases can remain active on the cell surface resulting in enhanced plasminogen activation kinetics. We have investigated several cultured cell lines, U937, THP1, K562, Molt4, and Nalm6 and shown that they bind both tPA and plasminogen and are able to act as promoters of plasminogen activation in kinetic assays. To understand what structural features of tPA are involved in cell surface interactions, we performed kinetic assays with a range of tPA domain deletion mutants consisting of full-length glycosylated and nonglycosylated tPA (F-G-K1-K2-P), ΔFtPA (G-K1-K2-P), K2-P tPA (BM 06.022 or Reteplase), and protease domain (P). Deletion variants were made in Escherichia coli and were nonglycosylated. Plasminogen activation rates were compared with and without cells, over a range of cell densities at physiological tPA concentrations, and produced maximum levels of stimulation up to 80-fold with full-length, glycosylated tPA. Stimulation for nonglycosylated full-length tPA dropped to 45–60% of this value. Loss of N-terminal domains as in ΔFtPA and K2P resulted in a further loss of stimulation to 15–30% of the full-length glycosylated value. The protease domain alone was stimulated at very low levels of up to 2-fold. Thus, a number of different sites are involved in cell interactions especially within finger and kringle domains, which is similar to the regulation of tPA activity by fibrin. A model was developed to explain the mechanism of stimulation and compared with actual data collected with varying cell, plasminogen, or tPA concentrations and different tPA variants. Experimental data and model predictions were generally in good agreement and suggest that stimulation is well explained by the concentration of reactants by cells. A number of cell types have previously been shown to bind tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which in some cases can remain active on the cell surface resulting in enhanced plasminogen activation kinetics. We have investigated several cultured cell lines, U937, THP1, K562, Molt4, and Nalm6 and shown that they bind both tPA and plasminogen and are able to act as promoters of plasminogen activation in kinetic assays. To understand what structural features of tPA are involved in cell surface interactions, we performed kinetic assays with a range of tPA domain deletion mutants consisting of full-length glycosylated and nonglycosylated tPA (F-G-K1-K2-P), ΔFtPA (G-K1-K2-P), K2-P tPA (BM 06.022 or Reteplase), and protease domain (P). Deletion variants were made in Escherichia coli and were nonglycosylated. Plasminogen activation rates were compared with and without cells, over a range of cell densities at physiological tPA concentrations, and produced maximum levels of stimulation up to 80-fold with full-length, glycosylated tPA. Stimulation for nonglycosylated full-length tPA dropped to 45–60% of this value. Loss of N-terminal domains as in ΔFtPA and K2P resulted in a further loss of stimulation to 15–30% of the full-length glycosylated value. The protease domain alone was stimulated at very low levels of up to 2-fold. Thus, a number of different sites are involved in cell interactions especially within finger and kringle domains, which is similar to the regulation of tPA activity by fibrin. A model was developed to explain the mechanism of stimulation and compared with actual data collected with varying cell, plasminogen, or tPA concentrations and different tPA variants. Experimental data and model predictions were generally in good agreement and suggest that stimulation is well explained by the concentration of reactants by cells. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; F, finger domain; E, epidermal growth factor domain; K, kringle; P, protease domain; tPA*, glycosylated tPA; Pgn, plasminogen; 6-AHA, 6-aminohexanoic acid1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; F, finger domain; E, epidermal growth factor domain; K, kringle; P, protease domain; tPA*, glycosylated tPA; Pgn, plasminogen; 6-AHA, 6-aminohexanoic acidis a multidomain serine protease responsible for converting the zymogen plasminogen into the broad specificity serine protease plasmin. Plasmin is involved in a range of biological processes, including fibrinolysis, tissue development, and tumor invasion and metastasis (1Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A. Hoover-Plow J.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Fibrin binding is a critical step in the expression of significant tPA activity because this enzyme is not produced as a zymogen but has only low levels of activity in free solution (2Rijken D.C. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2920-2925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although tPA is mainly associated with hemostasis, in contrast to urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which is considered to be more important in pericellular proteolysis, several groups have identified or isolated a number of different cell surface tPA receptors on endothelial cells and shown that binding of tPA and plasminogen to the same cell can lead to accelerated plasmin generation (3Plow E.F. Felez J. Miles L.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4Bu G. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hajjar K.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Published dissociation constants for cell-tPA interactions vary over a wide range, 10−11–10−7m, although it now appears that the highest affinity interactions may be due to cell surface-associated plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (6Barnathan E.S. Kuo A. Van der Keyl H. McCrae K.R. Larsen G.R. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7792-7799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of tPA to plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 requires the enzyme active site and results in an inactive complex. The physiological significance of putative tPA receptors of lower affinity is unclear considering the low plasma level of tPA (70 pm). For example, the tPA receptor annexin II, which binds tPA with aK d of 48 nm, is capable of producing modest stimulation of enzyme activity (<10-fold) in vitro(7Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes and monocytoid cells have been studied and found to bind tPA with a low affinity, but high capacity, and are able to stimulate tPA enzyme activity up to around 20-fold (8Felez J. Chanquia C.J. Fabregas P. Plow E.F. Miles L.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 2433-2441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Felez J. Miles L.A. Fabregas P. Jardi M. Plow E.F. Lijnen R.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other receptors on liver cells have also been investigated in an attempt to understand the structural features of tPA, both protein and carbohydrate, involved in receptor binding and responsible for its short in vivohalf-life and rapid clearance from the circulation when tPA is administered as a thrombolytic agent (10Higgins D.L. Bennett W.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is known that tPA-surface interactions are critical for the regulation of plasminogenolytic activity, and this has been investigated extensively where fibrin is the biological surface (11Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Jones A.J. Meunier A.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Detailed structure/function studies on a large number of mutant enzymes indicate that many areas of the protein are involved in modulating the interaction with fibrin and hence regulating tPA activity (13Bennett W.F. Paoni N.F. Keyt B.A. Botstein D. Jones A.J. Presta L. Wurm F.M. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5191-5201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to look at the regulation of tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation on cell surfaces using a number of cultured cell lines and to identify structural features involved in tPA-cell interactions leading to stimulation of plasminogen activation. Five cell types have been investigated in conjunction with five tPA variants lacking various domains and/or carbohydrate. To understand the factors regulating the kinetics of plasminogen activation, our studies included ranges of cell (receptor) concentration, as well as tPA and plasminogen concentration. Using this approach, it has been possible to develop a model that explains how cell interactions with tPA and plasminogen regulate the generation of plasmin activity and changes in apparent K m andk cat. tPA is a multidomain protein comprising finger-epidermal growth factor-kringle 1-kringle 2-protease domains (F-E-K1-K2-P) and is glycosylated. In this study, full-length glycosylated tPA was compared with nonglycosylated enzyme and deletion mutants as follows (structure and alternative names): F-E-K1*-K2*-P*, full-length glycosylated tPA (asterisk indicates glycosylated domain); F-E-K1-K2-P, full-length nonglycosylated tPA; E-K1-K2-P, ΔFtPA; K2-P, kringle 2 and protease, K2P, BM 06.022, Reteplase; P, protease domain. Full-length glycosylated tPA was International Standard melanoma tPA (code 86/670, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, United Kingdom). Full-length nonglycosylated tPA was a gift from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (Vitry sur Seine, France) expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (14Sarmientos P. Duchesne M. Denefle P. Boiziau J. Fromage N. Delporte N. Parker F. Lelievre Y. Mayaux J.-F. Cartwright T. BioTechnology. 1989; 7: 495-501Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both full-length enzymes had similar specific activities in fibrinolytic assays. ΔFtPA and protease domain were generated as described below using the same plasmid as for the full-length protein (pXL130), provided by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and expressed and renatured from E. coliinclusion bodies in the same way as full-length nonglycosylated tPA (14Sarmientos P. Duchesne M. Denefle P. Boiziau J. Fromage N. Delporte N. Parker F. Lelievre Y. Mayaux J.-F. Cartwright T. BioTechnology. 1989; 7: 495-501Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression of tPA was induced by addition of 40 mg/ml naladixic acid (15Power R.F. Conneely O.M. McDonnell D.P. Clark J.H. Butt T.R. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1419-1424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to cultures of E. coli strain N99cI+(Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) grown at 37 °C with aeration up to anA 600 nm of approximately 1.0. Cultures were grown at 37 °C for a further 90–120 min before harvesting and processing as described previously for the full-length enzyme (14Sarmientos P. Duchesne M. Denefle P. Boiziau J. Fromage N.

After concentrating renatured protein using SP Trisacryl (IBF Biotechnics, Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France). The final lysine-Sepharose column step was replaced by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono S column (Pharmacia) run in 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.3, containing 0.01% Tween 80, and purified tPA was eluted with a gradient of 0–1 mNaCl. The serine protease domain purification was further modified by omitting the pH 5.5 wash step on the SP Trisacryl column. ΔFtPA was produced by deleting residues Ser-1–Lys-49 and serine protease domain by deleting residues Ser-1–Arg-275 using the polymerase chain reaction technique of deletion by overlap extension (16Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar, 17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pXL130. Primers A and D were used for both mutant proteins: primer A, 5′-ACCTGCAGCCAAGCTT-3′, and primer D, ATCCTGAAATCAGACCAAGTCCTG. For ΔFtPA, additional primers were B, TCGCTGCAACTCATATGTAAGTAT, and C, ACTTACATATGAGTTGCAGCGAGC. For serine protease domain generation, primers were B, CCTCCTTTGATCATATGTAAGTAT, and C, ATACTTACATATGATCAAAGGAGGGCTC. The final polymerase chain reaction product, ABCD, was digested with AvaI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for insertion into pXL130. Re-ligated plasmids were checked for correct size on agarose gels, and proteins were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to ensure correct molecular weights. The final step in protein purification was fast protein liquid chromatography and variants were checked for purity and correct molecular weight by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. K2P (also known as BM 06.022 or Reteplase) was a gift from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. This protein was expressed, renatured and purified in a nonglycosylated form from E. coli (18Kohnert U. Rudolph R. Verheijen J.H. Weening-Verhoeff E.J. Stern A. Opitz U. Martin U. Lill H. Prinz H. Lechner M. Kresse G.-B. Buckel P. Fischer S. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All tPA variants were measured in direct assays against chromogenic substrate S-2288 (Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden), and activity was quantitated against the 2nd International Standard for tPA (code 86/670, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, United Kingdom) in a plasminogen activation assay in the absence of stimulator as outlined below. THP1, U937, Nalm6, Molt4, and K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 2–4 mm glutamine, 7–10% fetal bovine calf serum, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (pyruvate excluded for U937 cells) (Sigma or Life Technologies Ltd.). Cells were grown to a density of 1.5 × 106 to 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at 0–4 °C. The cell pellet was drained and resuspended with gentle vortexing and washed with 0.05 m glycine buffer, pH 3.5, containing 0.1m NaCl for 2–3 min on ice (19Stoppelli M.P. Tacchetti C. Cubellis M.V. Corti A. Hearing V.J. Cassani G. Appella E. Blasi F. Cell. 1986; 45: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with RPMI medium for final counting, resuspension and dilution in assay buffer (below) containing albumin at 1 mg/ml. Plasminogen activation reactions were carried out in microtitre plates in reaction volumes of 100 μl. In initial studies using full-length tPA enzymes, reaction mixtures were 20 μl of tPA (final concentration 5 ng/ml, ≫70 pm), 40 μl of cells (final concentration, between 103 and 108 cells/ml) and 40 μl of substrate mix containing Glu-plasminogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Swansea, United Kingdom) at a final concentration of 100 nm and chromogenic substrate S-2251 (Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide, Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden) at a final concentration of 0.15 mm. Reactions were performed in assay buffer consisting of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C and a final ionic strength of 0.12, containing 1 mg/ml human serum albumin. In experiments with higher concentrations of tPA (up to 1.5 nm), reaction volumes remained the same. In experiments with tPA variants having different molecular weights, starting activities of tPA had equivalent activation rates with Glu-plasminogen in the absence of cells and stimulation was calculated as activation rate with cells/activation rate without cells under identical conditions. In studies using a range of plasminogen concentrations reaction mixtures were made up of 20 μl of tPA, 20 μl of cells (to give a range of cell densities as above), 20 μl of plasminogen (to give a range of concentrations up to a final concentration of 520 nm), and 40 μl of substrate solution containing S-2251 as above. Cells were incubated for 15 min with tPA to equilibrate to 37 °C before substrates were added to begin the reaction. Absorbance was monitored at 405 nm, using a Thermomax thermostatted plate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Stanford, CA), producing the expected exponential increase forp-nitroanilide resulting from plasmin production. Rates of plasmin production were calculated from slopes of plots of A versus s2 generated automatically from Thermomax data by a program specifically written for this purpose (J Waterman-Smith, Molecular Devices, Crawley, United Kingdom). These slopes are proportional to plasmin generation and were calculated using Enzfitter (Elsevier, Cambridge, United Kingdom), as outlined previously (20Longstaff C. Clough A.M. Gaffney P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 173-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Longstaff C. Merton R.E. Sinniger V. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 178-187Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Plasmin generation could be calculated from rates ofA/s2 by dividing by 22 310 A m−1 s−1 from previously determined values for the K m andk cat of plasmin on S-2251 and the extinction coefficient of p-nitroanilide under these conditions (21Longstaff C. Merton R.E. Sinniger V. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 178-187Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Simultaneous kinetic experiments were carried out with and without tPA to control for intrinsic activator (most probably uPA) synthesized by the cells and bound to the surface, which was not removed in the low pH wash. Different cell lines had reproducible levels of associated intrinsic activator giving background rates in the order THP1 > U937 > K562 > Molt4 > Nalm6 (essentially zero background rate). Where background rates were high, i.e.>10% of maximum rate achieved with added tPA (found with THP1 and U937 cells), these were subtracted from observed rates with added tPA in order to calculate rates due to exogenous activator only. Plasminogen activation kinetics in the presence of varying concentrations of 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) (Sigma) to investigate conformational changes and enzyme resulting from lysine analogue binding were conducted in a similar manner. Concentrations used for these experiments were 50 pm tPA, 1 pm uPA, and 450 nm plasminogen. To investigate the involvement of oligosaccharide moieties in binding to cells, kinetic experiments were performed in the presence of 20 mm monosaccharides, mannose, fucose,N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine,N-acetylneuraminic acid, and ovalbumin (10 mg/ml) (all from Sigma). Nalm6 and U937 cells were washed as described above and finally resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Ligand binding assays were performed by incubating full-length125I-tPA (0.25–8.0 nm in a total reaction volume of 100 μl) or K2P (0.5–16 nm in a total reaction volume of 200 μl) with the washed cells (107 cells/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were then separated from the whole reaction mixture by centrifugation of aliquots, in triplicate, in 20% sucrose solution. A parallel set of reactions were incubated in the presence of an excess of cold, unlabeled full-length tPA (glycosylated) or K2P to determine nonspecifically bound radioactive counts. Low affinity binding sites were investigated using higher concentrations of tPA (up to 12 μm), and cell-bound tPA was measured by enzyme activity as described previously (22Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments 200 μl of 107 cells/ml were incubated with a range of tPA concentrations for 30 min at room temperature before bound and free tPA were separated by centrifugation through 20% sucrose, as above. Bound enzyme was determined in plasminogen activation assays, as described above. Parallel experiments were performed without cells to determine the amount of free tPA carryover in kinetic assays. These activities were subtracted from specifically bound rates prior to data analysis. Each tPA concentration was incubated and activity measured in triplicate. The usual way to analyze tPA data in the presence of a stimulator is to use a simple Michaelis-Menten equation,rate=[tPA]·kcat′·[Pgn]/(Km′+[Pgn])Model1Equation 1 where [tPA] and [Pgn] are the total added concentrations of enzyme and substrate, respectively. K m′ andk cat′ refer to the kinetic parameters of the bound enzyme. The contribution of the solution reaction is ignored. Model 2 is based on the concentration effect of cells on tPA and plasminogen, which interact with cell surface binding sites leading to a localized raised reactant concentration in a cell-associated compartment. The principle of the model is as previously developed by Nesheim et al. (23Nesheim M.E. Tracy R.P. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1447-1453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to study regulation of the prothrombinase complex on phospholipid vesicles and can be understood in our system with reference to SchemeFS1. The abbreviations used in Scheme FS1 are listed below, and the prime notation denotes cell-associated protein or parameter. Thus, Pgn′ and tPA′ are bound plasminogen and tPA, respectively;v c is the cell volume;v ca is the volume of the cell-associated compartment. V c and V caare the corresponding volumes for the whole reaction mixture.V t is the total reaction volume, andV bulk = V t − (V c + V ca). The intrinsic catalytic parameters and binding constants applied in the present study are shown in Table I. Molar concentrations of bound enzyme and substrate, relative to the whole reaction mixture, can be calculated from simple equilibrium considerations knowing K d, the number of binding sites/cell, and cell concentration (hence receptor concentration). However, rateca will depend not only on the equilibrium between free and bound reactants but also on the local concentration, which will depend on the size ofV ca. Thus it is necessary to calculate [tPA′l]and [Pgn′l] (local concentration of tPA′ and Pgn′, respectively) in order to calculate the local rate usingK m′ and k cat′.Vt=Vbulk+Vc+VcaEquation 2 Vt≅Vbulk(becauseVca+Vc≪Vbulk)Equation 3 Thus, it can be seen that the concentration factor (R) for reagents in the cell-associated compartment relative to the concentration for the whole reaction mixture is a ratio of 2 volumes and will vary with the cell concentration,R=Vt/VcaEquation 4 R=Vt/vca·number of cells inVtEquation 5 or for a fixed reaction volume (e.g. 1 ml), as follows.R=1ml/vca·cells/mlEquation 6 Table IModel parameters for the cell associated plasminogen activation used in conjunction with model 2ParameterValueK d, plasminogen-cellaTaken from previous studies that show that tPA and plasminogen interact with the same cellular binding sites (3, 8).1 μmK d, tPA-cellbK d values determined in the present study (Fig. 4).0.487 μmK d, K2P tPA-cellbK d values determined in the present study (Fig. 4).1.127 μmBinding sites, plasminogenaTaken from previous studies that show that tPA and plasminogen interact with the same cellular binding sites (3, 8).1.6 × 107 sites/cellBinding sites, tPAaTaken from previous studies that show that tPA and plasminogen interact with the same cellular binding sites (3, 8).1.6 × 107 sites/cellBinding sites, K2PcCell-bound activity was lower for K2P than full-length tPA (Fig. 4).

Open table in a new tab K m and k cat are the enzyme parameters for the activation of plasminogen by tPA in free solution.K m′ and k cat′ are the parameters for the cell associated reaction. λ is a measure of the concentration effect of cells for plasminogen activation. Because we are assuming that v ca is a constant, we define λ as a constant equivalent to 1/v ca in ml. Thus, under these conditions, the following equation is used.R=λ/cells/mlEquation 7 λ can be used to calculate the volume ofv ca for one cell and also h in SchemeFS1. To calculate local concentrations, a concentration relative to the whole solution is multiplied by R. That is, [tPA′l ] = [tPA′]·R and [Pgn′l ] = [Pgn′]·R, etc. An equation for the reaction rate in the cell-associated compartment can be derived using the Michaelis-Menten approach for the reaction A + S ⇔ AS → A + X, where A is enzyme (tPA) and S is substrate (plasminogen).rateca=kcat′[ASl′]Equation 8 The measured rate, relative to the whole reaction mixture, is as follows.rateca=kcat′[ASl′]/REquation 9 This is a result of the following equation,Km′=[Al′]·[Sl′]/[ASl′]Equation 10 [ASl′]=[A′]·R·[S′]·R/Km′Equation 11 and therefore the following equations are used.rateca=kcat′·[A′]·[S′]·R/Km′Equation 12 Applying the enzyme conservation equation,[Ao]=[Afree]+[A′]+[AS′]Equation 13 [Ao]=Kd·[A′]/[B]+[A′]+[A′]·[S′]·R/Km′Equation 14 where [B] is the molar concentration of enzyme receptors andK d is the dissociation constant for enzyme and receptor. Rearranging results in the following equation.[Ao]=A′(Kd/[B]+1+[S′]·R/Km)Equation 15 Then, dividing Equation 12 by Equation 15 results in the following equation.rateca/[Ao]=kcat′·[S′]/(Kd/[B]+1+[S′]·R/Km)·Km/REquation 16 This can be rearranged as follows and used as model 2, with respect to tPA and plasminogen.rateca=[Ao]·kcat′·[Pgn′]/((Kd/[B]+1)·Km′/R+[Pgn′])Model2Equation 17 Bound plasminogen [Pgn′] is calculated in the usual way,[Pgn']=([Pgno]+KD+[D]−(([Pgno]+KD+[D])2−4⋅[Pgno]⋅[D])1/2)/2Equation 18 where [Pgno] is added plasminogen,K D is the dissociation constant for plasminogen-receptor binding, and [D] is the molar concentration of plasminogen receptors. Because [tPA] ≪ [Pgn] in the system, there is no need to account for enzyme-substrate complex in the distribution of bound and free plasminogen. This equation is closely related to the relationship for specific activation of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction (24Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd., London1996: 112-115Google Scholar) but with the modification of K m′ toK m′/R. This model was used to derive values for k cat′ and λ (and hencev ca and h) by nonlinear regression analysis using Grafit version 4 (25Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, version 4.0. Erithacus Software, Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1998Google Scholar). Model data were generated using Mathcad, version 7 (Mathsoft Inc., Cambridge, MA). Model 3 was also considered; it could account for the observed data and is related to the model of Lu and Nelsestuen (26Lu Y. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8201-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for prothrombinase activity on vesicles. This model was similar to model 2, being a version of the specific activation equation, although in this case it was assumed that binding (giving tPAb*) modified the intrinsic enzyme parameters K m′ andk cat′ directly. To account for the profile of rateca with cell concentration (the “template effect”), it was necessary to assume that bound enzyme could only react with nonbound plasminogen in free solution (pgnf). This is shown in Scheme FS2. Model 2 can then be modified to give model 3.rateca=[Ao]·kcat′·([Pgno]−[Pgn′])/((Kd/[B]+1)·Km′+([Pgno]−[Pgn′]))Equation 19 Model3 All of the cell types tested in these studies, U937, THP1, K562, Molt4, and Nalm6, were able to act as promoters in kinetic assays measuring plasminogen activation by full-length tPA.

https://openalex.org/W1968595539,"The PRS gene family inSaccharomyces cerevisiae consists of five genes each capable of encoding a 5-phosphoribosyl-1(α)-pyrophosphate synthetase polypeptide. To gain insight into the functional organization of this gene family we have constructed a collection of strains containing all possible combinations of disruptions in the five PRS genes. Phenotypically these deletant strains can be classified into three groups: (i) a lethal phenotype that corresponds to strains containing a double disruption in PRS2 and PRS4 in combination with a disruption in either PRS1 orPRS3; simultaneous deletion of PRS1 andPRS5 or PRS3 and PRS5 are also lethal combinations; (ii) a second phenotype that is encountered in strains containing disruptions in PRS1 and PRS3together or in combination with any of the other PRS genes manifests itself as a reduction in growth rate, enzyme activity, and nucleotide content; (iii) a third phenotype that corresponds to strains that, although affected in their phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate-synthesizing ability, are unimpaired for growth and have nucleotide profiles virtually the same as the wild type. Deletions ofPRS2, PRS4, and PRS5 or combinations thereof cause this phenotype. These results suggest that the polypeptides encoded by the members of the PRS gene family may be organized into two functional entities. Evidence that these polypeptides interact with each other in vivo was obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system. Specifically PRS1 and PRS3 polypeptides interact strongly with each other, and there are significant interactions between the PRS5 polypeptide and either the PRS2 or PRS4 polypeptides. These data suggest that yeast phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase exists in vivo as multimeric complex(es).

The enzyme 5-phosphoribosyl-1(α)-pyrophosphate synthetase (ATP:d-ribose-5-phosphate pyrophosphotransferase; EC2.7.6.1) (PRS) 1The abbreviations used are: PRS, 5-phosphoribosyl-1(α)-pyrophosphate synthetase; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl-1(α)-pyrophosphate; PAP, PRPP synthetase-associated protein; NHR, nonhomologous region; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s)1The abbreviations used are: PRS, 5-phosphoribosyl-1(α)-pyrophosphate synthetase; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl-1(α)-pyrophosphate; PAP, PRPP synthetase-associated protein; NHR, nonhomologous region; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s)catalyzes the reaction at a key junction in intermediary metabolism. PRS transfers the pyrophosphate moiety released from ATP to ribose-5-phosphate, thus giving rise to phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate (PRPP) (1Khorana H.G. Fernandes J.F. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 230: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the enzyme therefore directs ribose-5-phosphate from energy generated by the pentose phosphate pathway to the important biosynthetic intermediate PRPP. PRPP is a precursor for the production of purine, pyrimidine, and pyridine nucleotides and the amino acids histidine and tryptophan (2Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PRPP is required for both the de novo and thesalvage pathways of nucleotide metabolism (3Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2854-2863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that in Mycobacterium spp. PRPP is also required for the biosynthesis of polyprenylphosphate pentoses that contribute to the arabinosyl residues of the cell wall (4Scherman M.S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16491-16497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemistry of the rat liver enzyme has been widely studied and led to the identification of the genes encoding it. PRSI andPRSII encode the catalytic subunit, which consists of two highly homologous isoforms, PRSI and PRSII, each with a molecular mass of 34 kDa (17Taira M. Ishijima S. Kita K. Yamada K. Izasa T. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14867-14870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kita K. Otsuki T. Ishizuka T. Tatibana M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The enzyme has two additional components of 39 and 41 kDa (24Kita K. Otsuki T. Ishizuka T. Tatibana M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which have been designated PRPP synthetase-associated proteins (PAPs). A negative regulatory role has been proposed for these PAPs because their removal from the rat liver enzyme complex results in an increased enzymatic activity (25Kita K. Ishizuka T. Ishijima S. Sonoda T. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8334-8340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs corresponding to the rat PAP39 and PAP41 have been obtained, the deduced amino acid sequences of both are very similar to each other and to those of the PRS catalytic subunits; therefore broadly speaking on the basis of sequence similarity PAP39 and PAP41 can be considered to be members of the PRS family (25Kita K. Ishizuka T. Ishijima S. Sonoda T. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8334-8340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sonoda T. Ishizuka K. Kita K. Ishijima S. Tatibana M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In humans the situation appears to be comparable with that in rat because human PAP39 and PAP41 cDNAs have been obtained and found to be very similar to each other and to rat PAP39 and PAP41 and human PRSI and PRSII (27Ishizuka T. Kita K. Sonoda T. Ishijima S. Sawa K. Suzuki N. Tatibana M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1306: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Katashima R. Iwahana H. Fujimura M. Yamaoka T.

Our analysis of the PRS gene family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has identified five genes, each located on a different chromosome (29Carter A.T. Narbad A. Pearson B.M. Beck K.F. Logghe M. Contreras R. Schweizer M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Hernando Y. Parr A. Schweizer M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6404-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The five predicted PRS polypeptides contain the characteristic motifs of PRS: a divalent cation-binding site and a PRPP-binding site (5Hove-Jensen B. Harlow K.W. King C.J. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6765-6771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bower S.G. Harlow K.W. Switzer R.L. Hove-Jensen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10287-10291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted PRS2, PRS3, and PRS4 polypeptides are 318–320 amino acids long, whereas PRS1 and PRS5 polypeptides are longer and more divergent in their sequences because they contain in-frame insertions bearing no similarity to any knownPRS and, in fact, to any known gene product. We have named these regions nonhomologous regions (NHRs). PRS1 contains one NHR (NHR1–1) that is neither an intron nor processed by protein splicing (29Carter A.T. Narbad A. Pearson B.M. Beck K.F. Logghe M. Contreras R. Schweizer M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Carter A.T. Beiche F. Hove-Jensen B. Narbad A. Barker P.J. Schweizer L.M. Schweizer M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and PRS5 contains two NHRs, NHR5–1 and NHR5–2, that are not introns (30Hernando Y. Parr A. Schweizer M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6404-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our preliminary analyses of the phenotypes associated with strains containing disruptions in each of the PRS genes have shown that none of the five genes is essential, although the contribution of each to the cell's metabolism does not appear to be equal because Prs1p and Prs3p make a more significant contribution than the other members of the family (30Hernando Y. Parr A. Schweizer M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6404-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Carter A.T. Beiche F. Hove-Jensen B. Narbad A. Barker P.J. Schweizer L.M. Schweizer M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the PRS5 null mutation is synthetically lethal in combination with a disruption in either PRS1 orPRS3, implying an important role for Prs5p in the production of PRPP (30Hernando Y. Parr A. Schweizer M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6404-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because all PRS genes sequenced to date have a high degree of similarity, studies on PRS in S. cerevisiaecould provide valuable information on the genetics and biochemistry of eukaryotic PRS. In the present study we have constructed a collection of strains bearing all the possible combinations of disruptions in the five PRS genes and analyzed their phenotypes. The data described here are consistent with the existence of two functionally different entities, one consisting of Prs1p and Prs3p and the other consisting of Prs2p, Prs4p, and Prs5p. Standard DNA manipulations were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Preparation of yeast genomic DNA, total RNA, Northern blotting, and hybridization were performed as described previously (29Carter A.T. Narbad A. Pearson B.M. Beck K.F. Logghe M. Contreras R.

Genet. 1997; 254: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In Northern analysis32P-labeled actin-encoding DNA was used as the loading control. Unless otherwise stated yeast transformation was carried out according to Elble (34Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of radioactive signals were performed using a Fujix BAS-1500 phosphorimager. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The strains were grown at 30 °C in yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (YEPD) or in YEPD containing 200 mg/liter of the aminoglycoside antibiotic geneticin G418 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (35Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar) or synthetic complete medium (36Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 209-210Google Scholar). Tetrads were dissected using a Singer® micromanipulator, model MSM (Singer Instruments). 5-Fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to select against uracil prototrophy (37Boeke J.D.

(i) a PCR-based method using the loxP-KanMX-loxP module as a marker (38Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). DNA fragments containing the disruption cassette together with 40–45-nucleotide extensions at their ends that are homologous to the regions immediately upstream and downstream of the start and stop codons of each PRS gene were obtained by PCR (30Hernando Y. Parr A. Schweizer M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6404-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These DNA fragments were used to transform (39Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Johnson J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 121-131Google Scholar) S. cerevisiae strains already disrupted in a PRS gene (30Hernando Y. Parr A. Schweizer M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6404-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting transformants were selected on YEPD containing G418. The correct integration of the KanMX r cassette was verified by PCR and Southern blotting. Derivatives from the strain HF7c (40Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddel C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) containing disruptions in each PRS gene were obtained by the same procedure. The KanMX marker was excised from the deletants by a recombination event between the two flankingloxP sites after transforming the corresponding strains with plasmid pSH47, which contains the Cre recombinase under theGAL1 promoter. Plasmid pSH47 (URA +) was removed from these strains by streaking the cells onto plates containing 5-FOA, which counterselects URA3 +plasmids (37Boeke J.D. Lacroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). (ii) Strains YN94-22 and YN95-100 were obtained by appropriate crosses of available strains (32Carter A.T. Beiche F. Hove-Jensen B. Narbad A. Barker P.J. Schweizer L.M. Schweizer M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The diploids obtained were sporulated, the resulting tetrads were dissected, and the spores were selected for the presence of the markers used for the disruptions. In all cases the disruptions were checked by PCR and Southern blotting. Plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 (Φ80 lacZΔM15)hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96thi-1 relA1; Ref. 41Hanahan D. J. Mol.

Plasmid pRS21 consists of the 2562-bp HindIII fragment containing the PRS2coding sequence plus 1470 and 135 bp upstream and downstream, respectively (29Carter A.T. Narbad A. Pearson B.M. Beck K.F.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total nucleotides were extracted from wild type andΔprs::loxP strains after growth in complete medium to approximately mid-log phase (46Ochi K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2787-2795Google Scholar). The extracts were resuspended in 150 μl of 7 mmKH2PO4, pH 4.0. Nucleotide pools were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography using 50 μl of the extract (47Strauch E. Takano E. Baylis H.A. Bibb M.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The elutant was monitored with a diode array detector, and peaks were quantified by comparison of peak areas at 260 nm with those of known amounts of 98% pure standards (Sigma-Aldrich). PRS genes were cloned in the two-hybrid system (48Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) vectors pGAD424 and pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which contain the Gal4p activation domain or DNA-binding domain, respectively. For this purpose each PRS gene was amplified by PCR using primers that placed an EcoRI restriction endonuclease site immediately upstream of the initiation codon and a PstI restriction endonuclease site immediately downstream of the stop codon (PRS1–4) or placed BamHI restriction endonuclease sites at both ends (PRS5). The DNA fragments obtained were cloned into appropriately restricted pGAD424 and pGBT9, and the constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct insertion and to check for PCR-induced errors. The yeast reporter strain HF7c (40Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddel C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was transformed with every possible pairwise combination of Gal4pAD-Prsp and Gal4pDBD-Prsp plasmids to tryptophan and leucine prototrophy. Crude cell extracts were prepared from mid-log phase cultures. Two-hybrid analyses were performed by assaying for β-galactosidase activity using a chemiluminescent substrate (Galacto-Light PlusTM, Tropix Inc, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescence was measured using a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Results were recorded as relative light units/μg protein and expressed relative to the values obtained with control strains containing empty two-hybrid vectors. A collection of S. cerevisiae strains containing all possible combinations of disruptions in the five PRS genes has been created by targeted gene disruption. TheloxP-KanMX-loxP cassette together with the Cre recombinase expression system allows for repeated use of theKanMX r marker and is therefore ideal for the functional analysis of gene families. The strains created by this system have the advantage that the only foreign DNA contained therein is the loxP site remaining after the Cre recombinase-induced event and all the deletants will be congenic (38Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Using this procedure the viable double deletants listed in TableI were obtained. The viable double deletant strains Δprs2::loxP Δprs5::loxP (YN97-89) andΔprs4::loxP Δprs5::loxP (YN97-90) have been described previously, and we have shown that the double deletant strains Δprs1::loxP Δprs5::loxP and Δprs3::loxP Δprs5::loxP are inviable (30Hernando Y. Parr A. Schweizer M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6404-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The triple deletantsΔprs1::loxP Δprs2::loxP Δprs3::loxP (YN97-169), Δprs1::loxP Δprs3::loxP Δprs4::loxP (YN97-170), andΔprs2::loxP Δprs4::loxP Δprs5::loxP (YN97-91) (Table I) were obtained by transformation of appropriate double deletant strains. Our success in constructing these deletant strains shows that the combined loss of these PRS genes is not a lethal event. Repeated attempts were made to obtain the triple disruptantsΔprs1 Δprs2 Δprs4 and Δprs2 Δprs3 Δprs4, but none was successful. This observation suggested that a double disruption of PRS2 and PRS4 might be synthetically lethal in combination with a disruption in eitherPRS1 or PRS3. To analyze this possibility we performed a cross between the strain YN97-3 (Δprs2::loxP-KanMX-loxP) containing aURA3-based plasmid with an intact copy of eitherPRS2 (pRS21), PRS4 (pRS41), or PRS1(pVT1) with the double disruptant strain YN94-22 (Δprs1::HIS3 Δprs4::LEU2) (a similar experiment was performed for PRS3 using the strain YN95100 (Δprs3::TRP1 Δprs4::LEU2) containing one of the following plasmids: pRS21, pRS41, or pVT3). The resulting diploids were sporulated, the tetrads were dissected, and the spores were incubated at 30 °C. Viable Δprs1::HIS3 Δprs2::loxP-KanMX-loxP Δprs4::LEU2 and Δprs2::loxP-KanMX-loxP Δprs3::TRP1 Δprs4::LEU2 isolates were now recovered but always containing the corresponding plasmid (TableII). These strains were sensitive to medium containing 5-FOA, indicating that any cells losing the plasmid were inviable. Wild type, single deletant, and double deletant strains carrying the relevant plasmids gave rise to colonies in 5-FOA-containing medium indicating their survival after plasmid loss. This observation was also confirmed by transformation of the double deletant strain Δprs2::loxP Δprs4::loxP (YN97-13) containing plasmid pRS21 with a DNA fragment containing eitherΔprs1::loxP-KanMX-loxP orΔprs3::loxP-KanMX-loxP. In both cases all the transformants (5 and 7, respectively) with the correct integration of the cassette failed to survive in medium containing 5-FOA, whereas the recipient strain gave rise to colonies on this medium (data not shown). These data confirm that a PRS2 PRS4 null mutant is synthetically lethal in combination with a deletion in eitherPRS1 or PRS3. Therefore although PRS2and PRS4 are not essential genes, loss of Prs2p and Prs4p together cannot be tolerated if either the Prs1p or Prs3p function is compromised.Table IISynthetic lethal combinations of PRS deletionsCrossNumber of tetradsRandom sporesSegregation patternNumber of triple mutantsPDNPDTT[pRS21]11612 (2 RS)[pRS41]1968199 (6 TT/3 RS)[pVT1]954188 (3 TT/5 RS)[pRS21]2222[pRS41]1359137 (1 TT/6 RS)[pVT3]14271136 (5 (TT/1 RS)The heterozygous diploids Δprs1::HIS3 PRS2 Δprs4::LEU2 × PRS1 Δprs2::loxP-KanMX-loxP PRS4 and PRS2 Δ"
https://openalex.org/W2014666214,"Viral infection has been implicated as a triggering event that may initiate β-cell damage during the development of autoimmune diabetes. In this study, the effects of the viral replicative intermediate, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (in the form of synthetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC)) on islet expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), production of nitric oxide, and islet function and viability were investigated. Treatment of rat islets with poly(IC) + interferon-γ (IFN-γ) stimulates the time- and concentration-dependent expression of iNOS and production of nitrite by rat islets. iNOS expression and nitrite production by rat islets in response to poly(IC) + IFN-γ correlate with an inhibition of insulin secretion and islet degeneration, effects that are prevented by the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG). We have previously shown that poly(IC) + IFN-γ activates resident macrophages, stimulating iNOS expression, nitric oxide production and interleukin-1 (IL-1) release. In addition, in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) + lipopolysaccharide, activated resident macrophages mediate β-cell damage via intraislet IL-1 release followed by IL-1-induced iNOS expression by β-cells. The inhibitory and destructive effects of poly(IC) + IFN-γ, however, do not appear to require resident macrophages. Treatment of macrophage-depleted rat islets for 40 h with poly(IC) + IFN-γ results in the expression of iNOS, production of nitrite, and inhibition of insulin secretion. The destructive effects of dsRNA + IFN-γ on islets appear to be mediated by a direct interaction with β-cells. Poly IC + IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression and inhibits insulin secretion by primary β-cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In addition, AG prevents the inhibitory effects of poly(IC) + IFN-γ on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by β-cells. These results indicate that dsRNA + IFN-γ interacts directly with β-cells stimulating iNOS expression and inhibiting insulin secretion in a nitric oxide-dependent manner. These findings provide biochemical evidence for a novel mechanism by which viral infection may directly mediate the initial destruction of β-cells during the development of autoimmune diabetes.

These findings provide biochemical evidence for a novel mechanism by which viral infection may directly mediate the initial destruction of β-cells during the development of autoimmune diabetes. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease characterized by an inflammatory reaction in and around pancreatic islets followed by selective destruction of insulin secreting β-cells (1Gepts W. Diabetes. 1965; 14: 619-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that lead to the development of autoimmune diabetes are unknown; however, the expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) 1The abbreviations used are: iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; IL, interleukin; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; AG, aminoguanidine; poly(IC), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; ds, double-stranded; LPS, lipopolysaccharideby β-cells and the resulting production of nitric oxide may be one factor that mediates β-cell dysfunction and eventual β-cell death. We and others (2Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Bendtzen K. Sandler S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3167-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Hughes J.H.

In the presence of IFN-γ, the concentration of IL-1 required to induce iNOS expression by β-cells is reduced 10-fold (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recently, Okamoto and co-workers (6Takamura T. Kato I. Kimura N. Nakazawa T. Yonekura H. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2493-2496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have examined the development of diabetes in transgenic mice that express iNOS under control of the rat insulin promotor (6Takamura T.

These mice spontaneously develop diabetes in a nitric oxide-dependent manner that occurs in the absence of insulitis. Administration of the iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine (AG) (200 mg/kg/2 times daily) prevents the spontaneous development of diabetes in these mice (6Takamura T. Kato I. Kimura N. Nakazawa T.

These results support an effector role for nitric oxide in mediating β-cell damage during the development of autoimmune diabetes. Viruses have been implicated as one environmental factor that may initiate or trigger an autoimmune reaction that targets and destroys β-cells in genetically susceptible individuals (7Yoon J.-W.

Mouse models of virus-induced autoimmune diabetes implicate increased cytokine and iNOS expression and nitric oxide production in the development of the disease. Encephalomyocarditis virus-induced diabetes in DBA/2 mice correlates with an increased level of IL-1β and TNF mRNA expression in islets as determined by in situ hybridization of pancreatic sections (12Hirasawa K. Tasutsui S. Takeda M. Mizutani M. Itagaki S. Doi K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Daily administration of antiserum specific for IL-1β or TNF-α (0.5 mg/mouse) starting on the day of viral infection attenuates encephalomyocarditis virus-induced diabetes in DBA/2 mice (12Hirasawa K. Tasutsui S. Takeda M. Mizutani M. Itagaki S. Doi K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, encephalomyocarditis virus stimulates iNOS mRNA expression in islets at early stages of infection, and iNOS expression persists until the onset of diabetes in DBA/2 mice. Daily administration of the iNOS inhibitor, AG, (at 2 mg/mouse/day) significantly attenuates the development of encephalomyocarditis virus-induced diabetes (12Hirasawa K. Tasutsui S. Takeda M. Mizutani M. Itagaki S. Doi K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings implicate cytokines and nitric oxide in the development of viral-induced diabetes. dsRNA, formed during viral replication, is an active component of a viral infection that stimulates antiviral activities in infected cells (13Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In vivo, dsRNA (in the form of poly(IC)) stimulates the development of diabetes in diabetes-resistant BioBreeding (BB) rats, and accelerates the development of diabetes in diabetes prone BB rats (14Ewel C.H. Sobel D.O. Zeligs B.J. Bellanti J.A. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sobel D.O. Newsome J. Ewel C.H. Bellanti J.A. Abbassi V. Creswell K. Blair O.

Immunity. 1994; 1: 469-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that viral infection and dsRNA modulate islet function; however, the mechanisms associated with viral-induced β-cell dysfunction are unknown. The goal of these studies was to determine whether dsRNA directly modulates islet function and viability. We show that in combination with IFN-γ, dsRNA stimulates the time- and concentration dependent expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide by rat islets. We provide evidence that the islet cellular source of iNOS in response to poly(IC) + IFN-γ is the β-cell. In addition, we show that poly(IC) + IFN-γ induces islet degeneration and inhibits insulin secretion by rat islets and β-cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and that these effects are mediated by increased nitric oxide production. These results indicate, for the first time, that the viral replicative intermediate, dsRNA (in combination with IFN-γ) directly modulates islet viability and β-cell function by a mechanism that involves β-cell production of nitric oxide.

All other reagents were from commercially available sources. Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (17McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Following isolation, islets were cultured overnight in complete CMRL-1066 (CMRL-1066 containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Before each experiment, islets were washed three times in complete CMRL-1066, counted, and then cultured for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Experiments were initiated by the addition of poly(IC), cytokines, and iNOS inhibitors, followed by culture for the indicated times. Isolated rat islets were dispersed into individual cells by treatment with trypsin (1 mg/ml) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' solution at 37 °C for 3 min as stated previously (5Heitmeier M.R.

Experiments were conducted as described above for freshly isolated islets. Islets isolated from 12 rats were cultured overnight (∼1,200/3 ml) in complete CMRL-1066 under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Islets were then dispersed into individual cells as stated above. Dispersed islet cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in complete CMRL-1066 before cell sorting.

The cells were illuminated at 488 nm, and emission was monitored at 515–535 nm. The sorting process yielded a 95% pure population of β-cells and an 80–85% pure population of α-cells. Islets (220/ml of complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 40 h with the indicated concentrations of poly(IC), IL-1, IFN-γ, and AG.

FACS-purified β-cells were treated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of IL-1, poly(IC), IFN-γ, and AG. The cells were washed three times with KRB containing 3 mm d-glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. β-cells were aliquoted into 96-well microtiter plates (15,000 cells/250 μl of KRB containing either 3 mm or 20 mm d-glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and insulin secretion was performed as described (24Corbett J.A.

Islets (25/500 μl of complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 96 h in 24-well microtiter plates with the indicated concentrations of poly(IC), IL-1, IFN-γ, and AG. Islet degeneration was determined in a double-blind manner by phase-contrast microscopic analysis. Islet degeneration is characterized by the loss of islet integrity, disintegration, and partial dispersion of islets as described previously (4Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Biochem.

After culture, the cells were washed three times with 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Total cellular RNA (5–10 μg) was denatured, fractionated, and transferred to Duralon UV nylon membranes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol.

The cDNA probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Prime-a-Gene nick translation system from Promega (Madison, WI). iNOS cDNA probe corresponds to bases 509–1415 of the rat iNOS coding region. Cyclophilin was used as an internal control for RNA loading. Hybridization and autoradiography were performed as described previously (28Burd P.R. Rogers H.W. Gordon J.R. Martin C.A. Jayaraman S. Wilson S.D. Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Dorf M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Nitrite production was determined by mixing 50 μl of culture medium with 50 μl of Griess reagent (29Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 540 nm was measured, and nitrite concentrations were calculated from a sodium nitrite standard curve. Autoradiograms were scanned into NIH Image version 1.59 using a COHU high performance CCD camera (Brookfield, WI), and densities were determined using NIH Image version 1.59 software. Phosphorimaging analysis of rat islet mRNA accumulation levels was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant Software version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Statistical comparisons were made between groups using a one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences between treatment groups compared with untreated controls (indicated by *;p < 0.05) were evaluated using a Scheffe's F-testpost hoc analysis. To determine whether poly(IC) stimulates nitric oxide formation, rat islets were incubated for 40 h with 1–100 μg/ml poly(IC) and 150 units/ml IFN-γ. Alone, neither IFN-γ (5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) nor poly(IC) stimulates nitrite production by rat islets; however, in combination with IFN-γ, poly(IC) stimulates the concentration-dependent increase in nitrite formation that is maximal at 50 μg/ml poly(IC) (Fig.1 a). The level of nitrite produced in response to 50–100 μg/ml poly(IC) + IFN-γ is similar in magnitude to the levels produced in response to 1 unit/ml IL-1. The effects of poly(IC) + IFN-γ on iNOS mRNA accumulation and protein expression are shown in Fig. 1, b and c. Alone, poly(IC) and IFN-γ do not induce iNOS mRNA accumulation by rat islets (data not shown); however, in combination, poly(IC) + IFN-γ induce the time-dependent accumulation of iNOS mRNA that is first apparent at 6 h and maximal following an 18-h incubation period (Fig. 1 b). Similarly, poly(IC) and IFN-γ alone do not induce iNOS protein expression by rat islets (data not shown, and Ref. 5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); however, poly(IC) + IFN-γ induce the time-dependent expression of iNOS protein that is first apparent following a 24-h incubation period and maximal following a 48-h incubation period (Fig. 1 c). The stimulatory effects of poly(IC) + IFN-γ on iNOS expression by rat islets are delayed in comparison to IL-1-induced iNOS expression, which is first apparent following a 6-h incubation period and maximal following a 24-h incubation period (Ref. 5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 c). In addition, poly(IC) + IFN-γ stimulate iNOS expression to levels ∼2-fold higher than the maximal level of iNOS expressed in response to IL-1 (compare iNOS expression following a 48-h incubation period with poly(IC) + IFN-γ to a 24-h incubation period with IL-1). These findings provide the first evidence that dsRNA, in combination with IFN-γ, stimulates the time- and concentration-dependent expression of iNOS expression and nitrite production by rat islets. Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide mediates the inhibitory and destructive actions of cytokines (such as IL-1 and IL-1 + IFN-γ) on islet function and viability (4Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L.

We therefore examined the effects of dsRNA, alone and in combination with IFN-γ, on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Treatment of rat islets for 40 h with 50 μg/ml poly(IC) + 150 units/ml IFN-γ results in the inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to levels comparable with the inhibitory effects induced by 1 unit/ml IL-1 (Fig.2 a). AG completely prevents poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced inhibition of insulin secretion suggesting that the inhibitory effects are mediated by nitric oxide. Individually, neither poly(IC) nor IFN-γ inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by rat islets (data not shown). In addition, we have previously shown that AG alone does not inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by rat islets (34Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5301-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results indicate that nitric oxide mediates the inhibitory actions of dsRNA + IFN-γ on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by rat islets. Treatment of rat islets with IL-1, or the combination of IL-1 + IFN-γ, for 96 h induces islet degeneration that is characterized by the loss of islet integrity, disintegration, and partial dispersion of islets into individual cells (4Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol.

The effects of dsRNA on islet viability are shown in Fig. 2 b. Rat islets were incubated for 96 h with IL-1, poly(IC), IFN-γ, and poly(IC) + IFN-γ in the presence or absence of AG. Individually, poly(IC) and IFN-γ do not induce islet degeneration; however, the combination of poly(IC) + IFN-γ stimulates islet degeneration to levels comparable with the destructive effects of IL-1 (Fig. 2 b). Islet destruction appears to be mediated by nitric oxide as AG completely prevents islet degeneration in response to IL-1 (Ref. 5Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and Fig.2 b) and poly(IC) + IFN-γ. These findings provide evidence that dsRNA, in combination with IFN-γ, induces islet degeneration in a nitric oxide-dependent manner. We have recently shown that poly(IC) + IFN-γ activate resident mouse macrophages, stimulating iNOS expression, nitric oxide formation, and IL-1 release (35Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of resident macrophages by treatment of islets with TNF + LPS results in the expression of iNOS, production of nitric oxide, and inhibition of insulin secretion by a mechanism associated with the intraislet release of IL-1 (20Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar, 24Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Because poly(IC) + IFN-γ activates macrophages, stimulating nitric oxide production and IL-1 release, and resident islet macrophage IL-1 release (in response to TNF + LPS) results in the inhibition of insulin secretion, we examined the role of islet macrophages in poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression, nitric oxide formation, and inhibition of insulin secretion by depleting rat islets of this cell population. Rat islets were dispersed into individual cells and then allowed to reaggregate during a 7 day culture at 37 °C. These reaggregated islet cells, termed pseudoislets, are composed of only endocrine cells (18Hopcroft D.W. Mason D.R. Scott R.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1985; 21: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the combination of poly(IC) + IFN-γ stimulates the production of nitrite and expression of iNOS to levels comparable with IL-1-induced nitrite formation and iNOS expression by rat pseudoislets (Fig. 3, a andb, respectively). As a control for macrophage depletion, we show that TNF + LPS fail to stimulate iNOS expression or nitrite production by rat pseudoislets. We have confirmed these findings using rat islets depleted of resident macrophages by culturing for 7 days at 24 °C. Previous studies have shown that these culture conditions deplete greater than 95% of islet macrophages (19Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1183-1190PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 c, a 40 h incubation period of macrophage-depleted rat islets (by culturing for 7 days at 24 °C) with poly(IC) + IFN-γ results in an ∼3-fold increase in nitrite production and a potent inhibition of insulin secretion. The stimulatory effects of poly(IC) + IFN-γ on nitrite formation and inhibitory effects on insulin secretion are similar in magnitude to the actions of IL-1. Importantly, TNF + LPS fails to inhibit insulin secretion or induce nitrite formation, indicating that resident macrophages have been depleted by the 7 day culture at 24 °C. These results suggest that resident islet macrophages are not required for poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression, nitrite formation, or the inhibition of insulin secretion by rat islets. Because resident macrophages are not required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression by rat islets, the effects of dsRNA + IFN-γ on α- and β-cell expression of iNOS were examined. α- and β-cells purified by FACS were treated for 40 h with IL-1, poly(IC), IFN-γ, and poly(IC) + IFN-γ. As shown in Fig.4, poly(IC) + IFN-γ induce β-cell expression of iNOS to levels that are ∼2-fold higher than the levels of iNOS expressed in response to 1 unit/ml IL-1. Alone, neither poly(IC) nor IFN-γ induces iNOS expression by primary β-cells, and poly(IC) + IFN-γ (alone or in combination) do not induce iNOS expression by primary α-cells. These results indicate that the β-cell is one islet cellular source of iNOS in response to poly(IC) + IFN-γ. Our previous studies have shown that treatment of FACS-purified β-cells for 18 h with IL-1 results in an inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is attenuated by coincubation with AG (22Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2384-2391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Treatment of primary β-cells with poly(IC) + IFN-γ for 24 h results in a complete inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig.5). AG prevents poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced inhibition of insulin secretion suggesting that the inhibitory effects are mediated by nitric oxide. In addition, we have previously shown that AG does not inhibit insulin secretion by purified β-cells in the absence of cytokine treatment (22Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2384-2391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These results show that dsRNA, in combination with IFN-γ, is able to act directly on the β-cell, stimulating iNOS expression and inhibiting insulin secretion in a nitric oxide-dependent manner. The biochemical events that precipitate the initial destruction of pancreatic β-cells during the development of autoimmune diabetes have remained elusive. It has been proposed that viral infection of islets may “trigger” or initiate an autoimmune process in genetically predisposed individuals by stimulating the initial destruction of β-cells (7Yoon J.-W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1995; 11: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8von Herrath M.G. Evans C.F. Horwitz M.S. Oldstone M.B. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 152: 111-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9von Herrath M.G. Homann D. Gairin J.E. Oldstone M.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Yoon J.-W. Pickup J. Williams G. Textbook of Diabetes.

Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 3339-3349Google Scholar). However, few studies have examined the effects of viral infection on the function and viability of isolated islets. In this study, we have examined the effects of the viral replicative intermediate, dsRNA, on islet function and viability. dsRNA is the active component of a viral infection that stimulates antiviral responses in infected cells (13Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). We show that treatment of rat islets with dsRNA + IFN-γ results in the time- and concentration- dependent expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide. dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced nitric oxide production results in a potent inhibition of insulin secretion and islet degeneration. One islet cellular source of iNOS appears to be the β-cell, because poly(IC) + IFN-γ induces iNOS expression and inhibits insulin secretion by primary β-cells purified by FACS. In addition, treatment of primary β-cells with dsRNA + IFN-γ results in the inhibition of insulin secretion. AG prevents the inhibitory effects of dsRNA + IFN-γ on β-cell function indicating that the destructive effects are mediated by β-cell production of nitric oxide. These results suggest that one potential mechanism by which a viral infection may mediate the initial damage to β-cells during the development of autoimmune diabetes is by the induction of iNOS expression by β-cells followed by nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of β-cell function and eventual islet damage. In support of this hypothesis, we have recently shown that incubation of rat islet cells with dsRNA + IFN-γ stimulates an ∼3–4-fold increase in both β-cell DNA damage (colocalization of insulin with DNA damage assessed by immunohistochemistry and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining) and islet cell necrosis (determined by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining), and that both effects are attenuated by NMMA. 2A. L. Scarim, M. R. Heitmeier, and J. A. Corbett, manuscript in preparation. Viral infection and poly(IC) are classic activators of macrophages, stimulating antiviral responses such as type I interferon production and nitric oxide production (36Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. J.

We have recently shown that activation of resident mouse macrophages, by treatment with poly(IC) + IFN-γ, results in the induction of iNOS, the production of nitric oxide, and the release of IL-1 (35Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment of rat islets with TNF + LPS (conditions known to activate macrophages) results in a potent inhibition of insulin secretion (20Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar, 24Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of TNF + LPS on insulin secretion are mediated by intraislet IL-1 release followed by IL-1-induced iNOS expression by β-cells. Resident macrophages appear to be the source of IL-1, as a 7-day culture of rat islets at 24 °C (conditions known to deplete islets of class II+ lymphoid cells, see Refs. 19Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1183-1190PubMed Google Scholar and 20Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar) prevents TNF + LPS-induced iNOS expression, nitric oxide formation and the inhibitory effects on insulin secretion. Immunocytochemical colocalization of IL-1β with the macrophage surface marker, ED1, directly supports the resident islet macrophage as the islets cellular source of IL-1 (20Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the effects of TNF + LPS, poly(IC) + IFN-γ may activate resident islet macrophages, stimulating nitric oxide production and IL-1 release; however, our studies indicate that resident macrophages are not required for the inhibitory effects of poly(IC) + IFN-γ on islet function and viability. Removal of resident macrophages by culture for 7 days at 24 °C or pseudoislet formation does not inhibit poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression, nitric oxide production or the inhibition of insulin secretion. In addition, poly(IC) + IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression and inhibit insulin secretion by β-cells purified by FACS. These results indicate that the inhibitory and destructive effects of dsRNA on rat islet function are not dependent upon resident macrophage production of nitric oxide or IL-1 but appear to be associated with a direct interaction of dsRNA with the β-cell. These findings provide evidence for a novel biochemical mechanism by which a viral infection may trigger the initial damage to β-cells leading to the development of autoimmune diabetes. Viral infection of β-cells and the accumulation of the viral replicative intermediate, dsRNA, in combination with IFN-γ supplied by peri-insulitic T-cells, would result in the induction of iNOS and the production of nitric oxide by β-cells, followed by nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of β-cell function and eventual β-cell damage.

ATP, the phosphate donor in the above phosphorylation reactions, is synthesized mainly in the mitochondrial matrix. To be accessible to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, where these reactions occur, it must first cross the mitochondrial membranes through a specific and well characterized transporter and then the Golgi membrane. The existence of a specific transporter in the latter membrane has been demonstratedin vitro using intact rat liver and mammary gland Golgi membrane vesicles (5Capasso J.M. Keenan T.W. Abeijon C.

Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 455-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that ATP is required for protein translocation into the ER of yeast and mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 15Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar and16Wickner W.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1197-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To understand the importance of phosphorylation as a post-translational Golgi lumenal event and to analyze the possibility that regulation of ATP transport into the Golgi lumen can affect the biosynthesis and function of macromolecules being synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, we need initial knowledge of the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of such transporter. Moreover, the existence of specific ATP transporters located in the membranes of three different intracellular organelles, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and ER, raises the question of how these proteins with the same function are localized in different organelles and whether or not they share common structural features. Here we used a reconstituted phosphatidylcholine proteoliposome system (17Milla M.E. Clairmont C.A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to monitor the purification of the ATP transport activity from a rat liver Golgi membrane preparation. Column chromatography and photoaffinity radiolabeling followed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis were used to identify a 60-kDa protein as the ATP transporter. Proteoliposomes containing this protein were active in ATP but not in nucleotide sugars or PAPS transport; a similar apparentK m of ATP transport than previously reported for intact Golgi vesicles was determined. Finally, native functional size determination on a glycerol gradient suggested that the ATP transporter exists as a homodimer in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus. Frozen rat livers were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals. [2,8-3H]ATP (15–30 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., [125I]NaI (350–600 mCi/ml) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP (2–15 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Extracti-Gel G was purchased from Pierce. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. All the operations described below were performed at 4 °C. A crude Golgi fraction was prepared from 6 kg of frozen rat livers according to the procedure of Leelavathi et al. (18Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This fraction was resuspended in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm sucrose, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v) with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.1 μg/ml antipain, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The suspension was stirred for 45 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 45 min. The supernatant solution was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in the above buffer containing a final concentration of 1.1% Triton X-100. The mixture was stirred and centrifuged again as described above. The supernatant was decanted, yielding a Triton X-100 extract that was saved. The pellet was resuspended, and the extraction was repeated as described above. Both detergent extracts were combined together and adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.2 m NaCl. The above Triton X-100 extract was applied to three DEAE-Sephacel columns (Sigma; 25 cm ×5 cm each) equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 0.2 m NaCl. Elution was with six column-volumes of equilibration buffer followed by four column-volumes of buffer A containing 0.7 m NaCl. The salt-eluted material containing the ATP transport activity was then concentrated and diluted to 0.3 m NaCl final concentration by use of a Minitan ultrafiltration system (Millipore). The above fraction was applied to three Blue-Sepharose columns (Amicon; 20 cm × 5 cm, each) equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl. The ATP transport activity eluted in the flow-through. The flow-through from the Blue-Sepharose column was diluted to 0.1 m NaCl with buffer A and applied to 8 DEAE-Sephacel columns (Sigma; 23 cm ×2.7 cm each) equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. The ATP transport activity eluted in the flow-through. The second DEAE-Sephacel flow-through was applied to 12 carboxymethylcellulose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 23 cm ×3 cm each) equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. After washing with four column-volumes of the equilibration buffer, elution was achieved with a linear gradient of 0.1–1.5 m NaCl and 20–1% glycerol. Fractions of 16 ml each were collected. Transport activity was eluted at approximately 0.6 m (fractions 12–15). The active fractions were pooled, desalted, and adjusted up to a final concentration of 10% glycerol and 0.5% Triton. The above fraction was applied to 19 3′,5′-ADP-agarose columns (Sigma; 5 cm ×1.5 cm each) equilibrated in buffer A containing 10% glycerol. After washing with four column-volumes of the equilibration buffer, elution was achieved with a linear gradient of 0–1.5 m NaCl and 10–1% glycerol. Fractions of 2.5 ml each were collected, and the transport activity was eluted at approximately 0.25 m (fractions 5–15). The apparent functional mass of the ATP transporter was estimated by analytical ultracentrifugation using an 8–30% glycerol gradient in buffer A. The active fraction obtained from purification Step 6 was concentrated and dialyzed against buffer A in Centricon filters (Amicon) to obtain a final glycerol concentration of 8%. The 10-ml glycerol gradient was equilibrated at 4 °C for 17 h before loading of the sample (0.5 ml) and then centrifuged in a SW 50 rotor at 46,000 rpm for 40 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.35 ml were collected. β-Amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-galactosidase (120 kDa), phosphorylase B (100 kDa), tumor necrosis factor α-convertase (80 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) were used as internal molecular markers. All the following experiments were performed in a dark room in the presence of a filtered safe-light. Fractions to be photolabeled were incubated with 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP (0.2 μm final concentration) at 0 °C for 1 min in 25 μl of buffer A. The mixture was irradiated on ice for 1 min in a Stratalinker UV 2400 oven (Stratagene; 5 cm of distance, maximum energy), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of loading buffer. Samples were then immediately subjected to 10% SDS/PAGE, and the autoradiography of the dried gel was done at −80 °C on Kodak film. For the characterization of the ATP transporter, rat liver Golgi vesicles were isolated as described (18Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and resuspended in cryoprotective buffer (19Mandon E. Kempner E.S. Ishihara M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11729-11733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sialyltransferase activity was enriched ∼50-fold over crude homogenate. Approximately 90% of the vesicles were sealed and of the same membrane topographical orientation asin vivo (20Carey D.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 989-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transport of solutes into intact rat liver Golgi vesicles was assayed as described before (21Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To follow the transporter purification, the ATP transport activity was reconstituted in phosphatidylcholine liposomes (17Milla M.E. Clairmont C.A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture was then applied to a 3-ml Dowex 1 × 2–100 column (Sigma) as described previously (22Mandon E.C. Milla M.E. Kempner E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fractions of 300 μl were collected, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The purity of the various fractions active and inactive in ATP transport activity was determined by SDS/PAGE. Visualization was done by Coomassie Blue/silver nitrate staining (OWL Separation System) or by labeling proteins with 300 μCi of Na125I and chloramine T (22Mandon E.C. Milla M.E. Kempner E.

The rat liver Golgi membrane ATP transporter was purified ∼70,000 over the crude Golgi membrane preparation with a yield of 2% (TableI). To monitor the purification through the different purification steps, membrane proteins were reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes by freeze-thawing and then assayed for their ability to translocate radiolabeled ATP in vitro. The purity of the ATP transporter during the purification was determined by SDS/PAGE (Fig. 1). We began the purification with a crude Golgi membrane preparation; the ATP transport activity was extracted after a two-step solubilization with Triton X-100. In the first step, Golgi membranes were treated with a low concentration of Triton X-100 (0.3%, v/v). These conditions removed the peripheral membrane proteins and did not result in a significant loss of transport activity or in its extraction from the membrane. In the second step, a higher concentration of Triton X-100 was used (1.1%, v/v) to almost completely solubilize the membrane proteins. Approximately 85% of the total ATP transporter activity from the Golgi membrane preparation could be solubilized under these conditions, with a 15-fold purification over the crude Golgi membrane preparation.Table IPurification of the Golgi membrane ATP transporterStepTotal proteinSpecific activityActivityFold purification over crude Golgi% Yieldmgpmol/mg in 5 minpmol in 5 minTriton extract25,4001343,400,000151001st DEAE-Sephacel2,0401,1762,400,00013072Blue-Sepharose5403,7032,000,000390592nd DEAE-Sephacel5226,9231,400,0002,70041Carboxymethylcellulose3303,333910,00030,000273′-5′-ADP-agarose0.5566,000283,00060,0008Glycerol gradient0.1656,00065,65670,2002Membrane proteins were reconstituted in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine liposomes by freeze-thawing and then assayed for their ability to translocate radiolabeled ATP in vitro, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Membrane proteins were reconstituted in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine liposomes by freeze-thawing and then assayed for their ability to translocate radiolabeled ATP in vitro, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Triton X-100 extract was then applied to a combination of conventional ion exchange, dye color, and affinity chomatography columns. Details of the different chromatographic steps are given under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results of each step are given in Table I. The Triton X-100 extract (Fig. 1, lane 1) was loaded onto a first DEAE-Sephacel column followed by elution with 0.7 mNaCl in buffer A. 72% of the transport activity was recovered with a 130-fold purification over the crude Golgi preparation (Fig. 1,lane 2). In the next two chromatographic steps, the Blue-Sepharose and the second DEAE-Sephacel column, the transport activity was found in the flow-through (negative columns). These two negative columns combined together, resulted in the binding of most of the applied proteins but not the ATP transport activity (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4). 41% of the initial activity was recovered after these two steps with a 2,700-fold overall purification. The active fraction obtained from the second DEAE-Sephacel was then loaded onto a carboxymethylcellulose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1.5 m NaCl and 20–1% glycerol (Fig.2) with a 30,000-fold overall purification (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). In the next step we used a 3′-5′-ADP-agarose column, which provided an important and substantial purification (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and8). The transport activity was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.5 m NaCl and 10–1% glycerol (Fig.3). This strategy resulted in a 60,000-fold overall purification with a recovery of 8% of the initial transport activity. In order not to use high volumes of this active fraction, small aliquots of the sample were subjected to radioiodination with chloramine T before electrophoresis and visualization by autoradiography. The SDS-gel profile of the active fraction (Fig. 1, lane 7) showed two protein bands of 60- and 58-kDa. These were not visualized in fractions inactive for ATP transport activity (Fig. 1, lane 8).Figure 3Elution profile of the ATP transport activity from the 3′-5′-ADP-agarose column.

The rationale for this was based on the fact that other Golgi nucleotide sugar and nucleotide sulfate transporters appear to be homodimers in the membrane (9Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B.

The pooled active fraction from the 3′-5′-ADP-agarose column was loaded on top of a 8–30% glycerol gradient and centrifuged for 40 h, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.4 A shows the profile of the transporter activity throughout the gradient; a peak in the 120-kDa area, corresponding to the native protein, was observed with a single protein band of 60 kDa in the denaturating gel (Fig. 1, lane 9, and Fig. 4 B), which correlated with the ATP transport activity (Fig. 4). This latter strategy gave a 70,000-fold overall purification and a recovery of 2% of the initial transport activity. Photoaffinity radiolabeling was used as an independent criterion to demonstrate that the transport activity is a protein of 60 kDa. We reconstituted into proteoliposomes active fractions from the glycerol gradient (see Fig. 1, lane 9) and inactive fractions from the carboxymethylcellulose (see Fig. 1, lane 6); these were then subjected to photolabeling with 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP, an azido derivative of ATP. Only fractions active in ATP transport showed a radiolabeled protein band of 60 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 1), whereas inactive fractions did not (Fig. 5, lane 2). Neither UV irradiation, used without the photoprobe, nor the photoprobe by itself, without UV irradiation, resulted in photolabeling of protein bands (results not shown). To characterize the ATP transporter, we reconstituted the highly purified 3′-5′-ADP-agarose fraction (Fig. 1, lane 7) into phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Transport of ATP into proteoliposomes was saturable with an apparent K m of 3.3 μm (Fig.6), very similar to that of intact Golgi vesicles (1.3 μm; Fig. 6, inset). The same fraction was inactive in transport of PAPS, CMP-sialic acid, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (TableII).Table IISubstrate specificity of the 3′-5′-ADP-agarose column eluateSubstratecpm/100 μlpmol/100 μlATP829030PAPS200CMP-sialic acid00UDP-GalNAc00Aliquots of fraction number 9 from the 3′-5′-ADP-agarose column were reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes as described under “Experimental Procedures” and assayed for transport of ATP, PAPS, CMP-sialic acid, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine.

The transporter showed an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa, and its identity was confirmed by functional reconstitution of the purified protein into liposomes as well as photoaffinity labeling. To purify the ATP transporter protein by column chromatography to apparent homogeneity, a ∼70,000-fold purification was required. This fold of purification was expected because a similar apparent fold was required for other low-abundance Golgi membrane proteins such as the UDP-GalNAc transporter (23Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4474-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the PAPS transporter (22Mandon E.C. Milla M.E.

After glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, the transporter migrated in the 120-kDa area, twice its apparent molecular mass as determined by reducing gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the ATP transporter is functional as a homodimer in Golgi membranes. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that some nucleotide derivative transporters are arranged in the Golgi membrane as homodimers (9Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B.

In addition to the results obtained after column chromatography and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation (see Figs. 1 and 4), independent evidence suggesting that the 60 kDa is indeed the ATP transporter was obtained by functional reconstitution of the transporter into proteoliposomes and photoaffinity radiolabeling using 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP, an azido anilide derivative of ATP. When reconstituted into proteoliposomes, the highly purified transporter was active in ATP transport, and the transport activity was saturable with an apparent K m very similar to that of intact Golgi vesicles, suggesting that the two activities are identical. The possibility that the 60-kDa protein we purified as the Golgi membrane ATP transporter is instead the ATP transporter from a different membrane, i.e. mitochondria or the ER, is very unlikely because the mitochondrial ATP transporter has a different molecular mass, ∼35 kDa (25Klingenberg M. Martonosi A.N. 2nd Ed. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes: Bioenergetics of Electron and Proton Transport. 4.

Understanding the importance of phosphorylation as a post-translational event and evaluation of how the possible regulation of ATP transport into the Golgi lumen can affect the biosynthesis/modification and function of macromolecules represents a major biological question. The purification of the ATP transporter constitutes an important step toward this direction. It will enable us to obtain the peptide sequence of the transporter, and from this, it will allow us to proceed toward its cloning. This in turn will enable us to study how the transporter is arranged in the membrane, if it is structurally related to the ATP transporter from mitochondria and ER, and whether its expression can regulate the post-translational modifications of the above macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W2060520623,"SHP-2, an SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, plays an important role in receptor tyrosine kinase-regulated cell proliferation and differentiation. Little is known about the activation mechanisms and the participation of SHP-2 in the activity of G protein-coupled receptors lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. We show that the activity of SHP-2 (but not SHP-1) is specifically stimulated by the selective α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist UK14304 and by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. UK14304 and LPA promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and its association with Grb2. The agonist-induced direct interaction of Grb2 with SHP-2 is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb2 and the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2. Rapid activation of Src family kinase by UK14304 preceded the SHP-2 activation. Among the Src family members (Src, Fyn, Lck, Yes, and Lyn) present in MDCK cells, Fyn was the only one specifically associated with SHP-2, and the physical interaction between them, which requires the Src family kinase activity, was increased in response to the agonists. Pertussis toxin, PP1 (a selective Src family kinase inhibitor), or overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of Fyn blocked the UK14304- or LPA-stimulated activity of SHP-2, SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and SHP-2 association with Grb2. Therefore, we have demonstrated for the first time that the activation of SHP-2 by these Giprotein-coupled receptors requires Fyn kinase and that there is a specific physical interaction of Fyn kinase with SHP-2 in MDCK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2112622582,"Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a food-borne mycotoxin produced by Fusarium moniliforme. Structurally FB1 resembles sphingoid bases, and ingestion of FB1 causes several animal diseases. FB1 will cause hepatic carcinoma in rats and is implicated as a cofactor in esophageal or hepatic carcinoma. Previous studies concluded that FB1 repressed cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity but induced CDK inhibitors p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 in monkey kidney cells (CV-1). In contrast, CV-1 cells transformed by simian virus 40 are resistant to the antiproliferative or apoptotic effects of FB1. Consequently, FB1 treatment of CV-1 cells leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate that FB1 transcriptionally activates the p21promoter. Functional analysis of the p21 promoter by reporter gene assays mapped the FB1-responsive region to −124 to −47. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed two protected motifs that span the FB1-responsive region, −124 to −101 (footprint II) and −89 to −67 (footprint III). Further studies demonstrated that DNA sequences from −124 to −101 were sufficient for FB1 stimulation. DNA sequences from −124 to −101 contain two Sp1 binding sites, and gel shift assays provided evidence that nuclear factors specifically bind to this region. Disruption of the two Sp1 binding sites abrogated the binding of nuclear proteins and prevented activation by FB1. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp1 or Sp1-related proteins mediate FB1-induced activation of the p21 promoter. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a food-borne mycotoxin produced by Fusarium moniliforme. Structurally FB1 resembles sphingoid bases, and ingestion of FB1 causes several animal diseases. FB1 will cause hepatic carcinoma in rats and is implicated as a cofactor in esophageal or hepatic carcinoma. Previous studies concluded that FB1 repressed cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity but induced CDK inhibitors p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 in monkey kidney cells (CV-1). In contrast, CV-1 cells transformed by simian virus 40 are resistant to the antiproliferative or apoptotic effects of FB1. Consequently, FB1 treatment of CV-1 cells leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate that FB1 transcriptionally activates the p21promoter. Functional analysis of the p21 promoter by reporter gene assays mapped the FB1-responsive region to −124 to −47. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed two protected motifs that span the FB1-responsive region, −124 to −101 (footprint II) and −89 to −67 (footprint III).

Disruption of the two Sp1 binding sites abrogated the binding of nuclear proteins and prevented activation by FB1. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp1 or Sp1-related proteins mediate FB1-induced activation of the p21 promoter. Fumonisin B1(FB1) 1The abbreviations used are: FB1, fumonisin B1; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; FP, footprint; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TK, thymidine kinaseis a mycotoxin, produced by Fusarium moniliforme, a fungal pathogen that causes stalk and ear rot of maize (1Thiel P.G. Marasas W.F.O. Sydenham E.W. Shephard G.S. Gelderblom W.C.A. Mycopathologia. 1992; 117: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). F. moniliforme is prevalent throughout the world and as such is an important plant pathogen. FB1 ingestion is associated with increased incidence of esophageal cancer in southern regions of Africa and parts of China (2Marasas W.F.O. Cancer Esophagus. 1982; 1: 29-40Google Scholar, 3Chu F.S. Li G.Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 847-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FB1 is hepatocarcinogenic and causes primary hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma in rats (4Gelderblom W.C.A. Kriek N.P.J. Marasas W.F.O. Thiel P.G. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1247-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). FB1 is also a potent tumor promoter in rat liver after initiation with diethylnitrosoamine (5Gelderblom W.C.A.

Natural Toxins. 1993; 1: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). FB1 is also nephrotoxic to several animal species, and kidney tissue is very sensitive to its toxic effects (10Riley R.T.

An in vivo study demonstrated that FB1 induced apoptosis in rat kidney or livers (12Tolleson W.H. Dooley K.L. Sheldon W.G. Dale Thurman J. Bucci T.J. Howard P.C Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 392: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Sharma R.P. Dugyla R.R. Voss K.A. J. Comp. Pathol. 1997; 4: 371-381Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, ingestion of FB1 by humans or food animals is a health concern. Structurally, FB1 is similar to sphinganine or other sphingoid bases (14Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 15Merrill A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and is the first known naturally occurring inhibitor of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Sphinganine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the sphingosine backbone of ceramide, sphingomyelin, cerebrosides, gangliosides, and sulfatides. FB1 inhibits ceramide synthase, which alters sphinganine:sphingosine ratios (16Merrill A.H.M. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits the synthesis of ceramide. Sphingolipids are involved in the regulation of cell contact, cell growth, and differentiation primarily since sphingomyelin is part of a signal transduction pathway generating ceramide as second messenger (18Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus disruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis by FB1 is likely to be important for the toxic effects of FB1. FB1 is cytotoxic to certain mammalian cells including baby hamster kidney cells, rat primary hepatocytes, turkey lymphocytes, or chicken macrophages (19La Grenade C.E.F. Bean G.A. Biodet.

The most sensitive cell lines are rat hepatoma H4TG and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with IC50values of 4 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively (23Shier W.T. Abbas H.K. Mirocha C.J.

Dickman M.B. Henderson G. Jones C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1655-1659PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity, and reduces cyclin E protein levels (27Ciacci-Zanella J.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Jones C. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1998; 36: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, CDK inhibitors, p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 are induced after FB1treatment. Consequently dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB) occurs. In recent years, numerous studies have established that cell cycle progression is controlled by CDKs and cyclins (28Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 29Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). CDK inhibitors, such as p21, bind CDK-cyclin complexes and inhibit CDK activity (30Peter M. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1994; 79: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 31Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 32Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar). Induction of p21 expression occurs in response to a variety of antiproliferative stimuli thus resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (33Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar, 34White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). p21 expression is induced by the p53 protein upon DNA damage (35Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 36EI-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Vaculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parson R. Trent J.M. Jin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). However, p53-independent expression of p21 occurs during cell growth and differentiation (37Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3393-3395Google Scholar, 38Parker S.B. Eichele G. Zhang P. Rawls A. Sands A.T. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), suggesting that the function of p21 is not limited to cell cycle arrest following DNA damage. At low concentrations, p21 promotes the assembly of CDK4-cyclin D complexes, whereas at high concentrations it inhibits kinase activity (39LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p21 can interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen to inhibit DNA replication by preventing proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding to DNA polymerases (40Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). The p21 promoter contains several cis-acting elements that are transcriptionally activated by different transcription factors in response to various agents. For example, twop53 binding sites are located at −2.2 and −1.3 kilobases upstream of the transcription start site (41Appella E. Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Harrington R.E. J. Prot. Chem. 1998; 17: 527-528Google Scholar). These sites are required for p53-dependent transactivation of the p21promoter. MyoD is a skeletal muscle-specific transcription factor that recognizes sequences between −1749 and −1717. During skeletal muscle differentiation, MyoD induces p21 expression, resulting in cell cycle arrest (42Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Stat1 is a cytokine-induced signal transducer and an activator of transcription which recognizes DNA sequences between −698 and −689 in response to interferon-γ-induced growth suppression (43Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.-C.S. You Z.-H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.-Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter of p21 contains a GC-rich region with several potential Sp1 binding sites that regulatep21 promoter activity (44Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 45Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although extensive studies have been conducted concerning the toxicity and biological effects of FB1, the molecular mechanisms of FB1 action are not well understood. To understand the means by which FB1 induces expression of p21, we analyzed the region of the p21 promoter necessary for FB1activation. These studies demonstrated that the two Sp1 binding sites within −124 to −101 were necessary and sufficient for FB1-induced p21 transcription in CV-1 cells. Mutagenesis of the Sp1 binding sites abrogated the binding of nuclear factors and inhibited FB1 activation. Thus FB1induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by transcriptionally activatingp21 via Sp1 binding sites. CV-1 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were grown in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. FB1 was obtained from Sigma, R. D. Plattner (>99% pure) (USDA, Peoria, IL), or R. Eppley (>99.9% pure) (USDA). FB1 was dissolved at 5 mm in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and kept in the dark at 4 °C. Four p21 promoter fragments, −124 to −47, −124 to −101 ( (FP II), −89 to −67 (FP III), and −124 to −101 in which the two Sp1 binding sites were mutated (FP II-mut), were synthesized with 5′-CTAG overhangs and purified from 15% urea-polyacrylamide gel. The purified complementary strands of oligonucleotides were annealed at 50 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.1 m NaCl by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by incubating at 5 °C below the melting point for 1 h, and subsequent storage at 4 °C. The full-length human p21 promoter construct pWWP and a series of 5′-processive deletion constructs were obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein. The 3′-end of all of the promoter segments extended to +16 from transcription start site (47EI-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Velculescu V. Oliner J.D. Burell M. Hill D.E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). To insert p21 promoter fragments upstream of a heterologous promoter, the full-lengthp21 promoter from −2328 to +16 was released from plasmid pWWP by HindIII digestion, and this 2.4-kilobase fragment was gel purified and digested with PstI. The resulting two fragments corresponding to −2328 to −210 and −210 to +16 were recovered and inserted into the respective sites of vector pBLcat (Promega, Madison, WI). To clone multimers of the p21promoter fragment upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, the respective double-stranded oligonucleotides were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase before ligation into the unique Xba I site of pBLcat. The copy numbers of each insert were determined by both 2% agarose gel and 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All plasmids were prepared by alkaline lysis followed by two CsCl gradients. p21promoter reporter constructs were transfected into CV-1 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (48Doyle K. The Source for Discovery: Protocols and Applications Guide. 3rd Ed. Promega, Madison, WI1996: 241Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a 1:5 ratio into 100-mm culture dishes the day before transfection. 3 h before transfection the old medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. For each transfection, 21 μg of reporter plasmid was used to form DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitates. This solution was incubated with cells for 12 h and then replaced with fresh medium. 24 h later, cells were split at a 1:2 or 1:4 ratio; half of the cells were treated with 5 μm FB1 and incubated for 24 h. Total cell lysate was prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles in 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.0. CAT activity was measured in the presence of 0.2 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol and 0.5 mmacetylcoenzyme A for 3 h or longer. All forms of chloramphenicol were separated by thin layer chromatography. The amount of acetylated chloramphenicol was measured with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nuclear extract was prepared as described by Dignam et al. (49Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The crude nuclei obtained from at least 5 × 107 cells were resuspended in 500 μl (equal to half the nuclei pellet volume) of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml proteinase inhibitor mixture containing leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain, respectively). Another 500 μl of buffer C (the same as buffer B except for 1.2 m KCl) was added drop by drop with continuous agitation. The nuclei were incubated for 30 min and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed for 1 h and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −110 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (50Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The p21 promoter segment from −210 to +16 was cloned into pBLcat and subjected to DNase I footprinting analysis. To label the coding strand, the construct was digested by HindIII, and the overhang was filled in with [α-32P]dATP and Klenow polymerase. The radiolabeled fragment was released by digestion with XhoI and purified from a 5% native acrylamide gel. The noncoding strand was labeled by digestion with XhoI, incubation with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow to fill in the 5′-overhang, and release of the fragment by HindIII digestion. The binding reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 75 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 2 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 10 min prior to the addition of 0.5–0.6 ng of radiolabeled probe. The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm, and freshly diluted DNase I was subsequently added to digest the probe. For the naked probe, 0.11, 0.036, or 0.012 unit of DNase I was used in separate reactions. For reactions in the presence of nuclear extracts, 1, 0.33, or 0.11 unit of DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. The digestion reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 min at room temperature and were stopped by adding equal volume of stop buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mmEDTA, 1% SDS).150 μg of proteinase K was then added and incubated at 56 °C for 45 min. The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1) followed by ethanol precipitation. The digested probes were analyzed on 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel. Chemical (G+A) sequencing analysis was performed by the Maxam and Gilbert method (51Maxam A.M. Gibert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow polymerase and purified by passing through a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA-protein binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 12 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC). 10 μg of crude nuclear extract was incubated with 250 pg of end-labeled probe at room temperature for 20 min, and the reactions were subsequently resolved on a 5% native acrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE running buffer. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added to the binding reactions and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probes. A previous study demonstrated that expression of the p21 protein was induced by FB1 treatment (27Ciacci-Zanella J.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Jones C. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1998; 36: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate whether thep21 promoter was transcriptionally activated by FB1, a series of deletion constructs spanning thep21 promoter (Fig.1 A) was transfected into CV-1 cells, and promoter activities were compared in cells treated with FB1 or without. As shown in Fig. 1 B,p21 promoter activity (−2328/+16) was stimulated by FB1 after 24 h of treatment. The deletion constructs were also stimulated when cells were treated with FB1. Whenp21 promoter sequences spanning −124 to −47 were inserted at the 5′-terminus of a TK construct (3×−124/−47), FB1reproducibly stimulated this construct up to 10-fold. In contrast, sequences from −2328 to −210 were not stimulated when linked to the TK promoter. Thus, p21 promoter sequences between −124 and −47 contained crucial elements that were necessary for activation by FB1 treatment of CV-1 cells. To determine if FB1 induces nuclear proteins that interact with DNA sequences in the region between −124 and −47, in vitro DNase I footprinting analysis was performed. To generate strand-specific probes for DNase I footprinting, sequences from −210 to +16 were obtained from the pWWP construct and inserted into pBLcat. Nuclear extracts were prepared from CV-1 cells that were treated with 5 μm FB1 for 48 h. As a control, nuclear extracts were prepared from untreated CV-1 cells. Three distinct areas of the p21 promoter were protected from DNase I digestion regardless of whether the nuclear extracts were prepared from normal or FB1-treated cells. Analysis on both strands showed nearly identical protection regions (Fig. 2), and these were designated I, II, or III, respectively. No dramatic or reproducible differences were detected in the footprints from CV-1 cells relative to CV-1 cells treated with FB1. Two canonical Sp1 binding sites were contained within FP II, and one Sp1 binding site was contained within FP III. Because FP II and FP III were within the −124 to −47 region that was necessary for FB1 stimulation, gel shift assays were performed using oligonucleotides spanning FP II or III (Fig.3 B). An oligonucleotide containing mutated Sp1 binding sites from −124 to −101(FP II-mut) was also utilized in the gel shift assay. Four specific shifted complexes (A, B, C, and D) were detected using FP II. Complex A or B was efficiently competed by FP II and a Sp1 oligonucleotide but not by FP II-mut, suggesting that A or B was bound by proteins that bind consensus Sp1 sites. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that FP II-mut did not contain complex A or B but did contain complexes C and D. It is also possible that D was bound by a protein that binds Sp1 sites because the Sp1 oligonucleotide diminished the intensity of D. Two specific DNA-protein complexes were detected using the FP III oligonucleotide. Consistent with the DNase I footprinting analysis, no difference was detected in DNA-binding proteins using nuclear extracts prepared from FB1-treated or untreated CV-1 cells. To determine whether FP II, FP II-mut, or FP III contributed to FB1-induced transcription of the p21 promoter, the three oligonucleotides were multimerized, inserted into the 5′-terminus of the TK promoter, and CAT expression measured. For each construct, two clones containing different copies of the oligonucleotides were selected to transfect CV-1 cells. Transfected cells were then treated with 5 μm FB1 for 24 h, and promoter activity was compared with that of untreated cells. Constructs containing FP II were consistently activated up to 5-fold by FB1 treatment. However, promoter activity of constructs containing FP II-mut or FP III were not activated by FB1(Fig. 4). In fact, CAT activity of FP II-mut or FP III was reduced compared with that of untreated controls. Based on this result, we concluded that DNA sequences within FP II were necessary for FB1-induced transcription of thep21 promoter and that the two Sp1 consensus binding sites within FP II were important. p21 expression is induced by many agents including transforming growth factor β, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, growth factors, interleukin 2, retinoids, and calcium or vitamin D (44Biggs J.R.

To investigate the mechanism involved in the stimulation of p21 by FB1, deletion analysis of the p21 promoter demonstrated that the FB1-responsive region was localized between −124 and −101 (FP II). Induction of p21 promoter activity by FB1 was p53-independent because the twop53 binding sites were not required for FB1stimulation. This result is consistent with our previous observations that p53 protein levels do not increase dramatically after treatment with FB1 (27Ciacci-Zanella J.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Jones C. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1998; 36: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DNA sequences containing two Sp1 sites were necessary for FB1-induced transcription. This conclusion was based on the following results. 1) The FB1-responsive region from −124 to −101 contains two consensus Sp1 binding sites. 2) Nuclear proteins specifically recognized this region, and a Sp1 oligonucleotide competed for binding. 3) Mutations of the two Sp1 binding sites prevented protein binding and abolished stimulation by FB1. However, the binding pattern and intensity of the Sp1 binding proteins were not changed dramatically after FB1treatment. Although FB1 does not appear to stimulate the synthesis of Sp1 or enhance the binding of Sp1 to its recognition site, we propose that post-translational modification of Sp1-like factors or protein-protein interactions occurs after FB1 treatment, and these changes are responsible for p21 promoter activation. A previous study has demonstrated that neoplastic CV-1 cells (COS-7) are resistant to the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of FB1. Consistent with the observation is the fact that p21 levels in COS-7 cells are low and not induced following FB1 treatment (27Ciacci-Zanella J.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Jones C. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1998; 36: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of FB1 to induce p21 levels correlates with growth arrest and as such may play a role in the pathogenic potential of FB1. Sp1 or Sp1-related proteins transactivate numerous cellular or viral genes (55Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 56Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21260-21267Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and Sp1-mediated transactivation is complex. The activity of Sp1 is regulated by O-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation (58Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 59Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Glycosylation appears to regulate transcriptional activation but not DNA binding. Sp1 is phosphorylated by a DNA-dependent protein kinase, but phosphorylation does not appear to affect DNA binding or transcription activation. Protein-protein interactions also regulate Sp1 activity. For example, Sp1 activation requires coactivator dTAF II110, which associates with TATA-binding protein (60Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Sp1 also interacts with the cell cycle-regulated transcription factor, E2F, and this interaction leads to activation of Sp1 or E2F consensus sites (61Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 62Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). E2F also binds to GC-rich regions of promoters and activates these sequences (63Shin E.K. Tevosian S.G. Yee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12261-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that E2F-Sp1 interactions can activate promoters by more than one mechanism. Finally, a negative regulator of Sp1 is released by the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (64Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li Y. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 65Chen L.I. Nishinaka T. Kwan K. Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama K. Fu Y.-H.F. Grunwald S. Chiu R. Mol. Cell.

Wang E. Jones C. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1998; 36: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is not known if E2F or retinoblastoma protein interaction with Sp1 is altered in CV-1 cells after FB1 treatment. The Sp1 binding sites in the p21 promoter are required for induction by phorbol ester, okadaic acid, or transforming growth factor β (44Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 45Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Because FB1 represses certain protein kinase C isoforms (26Huang C. Dickman M.B. Henderson G. Jones C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1655-1659PubMed Google Scholar), and phorbol esters induce protein kinase C activity, it appears that activation of the p21 promoter by phorbol esters is not the same as FB1. Transforming growth factor β activation of the p21 promoter requires the Sp1 binding site located between −84 and −74. These DNA sequences are contained within FP III and were not required for FB1 activation. FB1 can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (66Wattenberg E.V. Badria F.A. Shier W.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the induction of p21 by FB1 was not affected by several mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (data not shown), suggesting that mitogen-activated protein kinase does not play a role in p21 activation by FB1. Recent reports have demonstrated that the tumor suppressor BRCA1 activates the p21 promoter and that DNA sequences located between −117 and −93 (FP II) are necessary for activation (67Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. EI-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Because BRCA1 is a transcription factor that associates with RNA polymerase II (68Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that FB1 regulates p21 promoter activity by a BRCA1-dependent mechanism. In summary, our results show that FB1 induces transcription ofp21 via two Sp1 sites in the p21 promoter. The activity is likely mediated by a post-translational modification of Sp1 factors which has not yet been identified. The induction of p21 activity by FB1 is consistent with G1 arrest and apoptosis, both of which occur following toxin treatment. We are very grateful to Dr. Bert Vogelstein for generous gifts of the p21 promoter constructs."

Conversion of inactive ARF-GDP to active ARF-GTP is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange proteins such as cytohesin-1. Cytohesin-1 and its Sec7 domain (C-1Sec7) exhibit guanine nucleotide exchange protein activity with ARF1 but not ARF-like protein 1 (ARL1), which is 57% identical in amino acid sequence. With chimeric proteins composed of ARF1 (F) and ARL1 (L) sequences we identified three structural elements responsible for this specificity. Cytohesin-1 increased [35S]guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate binding to L28/F (first 28 residues of L, remainder F) and to a much lesser extent F139/L, and mut13F139/L (F139/L with random sequence in the first 13 positions) but not Δ13ARF1 that lacks the first 13 amino acids; therefore, a nonspecific ARF N terminus was required for cytohesin-1 action. The N terminus was not, however, required for that of C-1Sec7. Both C-1Sec7 and cytohesin-1 effectively released guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate from ARF1, but only C-1Sec7 displaced the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog bound to mut13F139/L, again indicating that structure in addition to the Sec7 domain is involved in cytohesin-1 interaction. Some element(s) of the C-terminal region is also involved, because replacement of the last 42 amino acids with ARL sequence in F139L decreased markedly the interaction with cytohesin-1. Participation of both termini is consistent with the crystallographic structure of ARF in which the two terminal α-helices are in close proximity. ARF1 residues 28–50 are also important in the interaction with cytohesin-1; replacement of Lys-38 with Gln, the corresponding residue in ARL1, abolished the ability to serve as substrate for cytohesin-1 or C-1Sec7. These studies have defined multiple structural elements in ARF1, including switch 1 and the N and C termini, that participate in functional interactions with cytohesin-1 (or its catalytic domain C-1Sec7), which were not apparent from crystallographic analysis.

Proteins synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum are, in part, transported among intracellular compartments by membrane vesicles with COPI, COPII, or clathrin-coats (1Rothman J.E.

Mammalian ARFs and ARF-like proteins (ARLs) are ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are very similar in structure. ARFs were grouped into class I (ARFs 1–3), class II (ARFs 4 and 5), and class III (ARF6), based on size, amino acid sequence, and phylogenetic analysis (6Tsuchiya M. Price S.R. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Class I ARFs were initially identified as components of vesicles that originate in the Golgi (7Stearns T.

ARLs, like ARFs, are widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms; five human ARL cDNAs have been cloned (13Lee F.-J.S. Huang C.F. Yu W.L. Buu L.M. Lin C.Y. Huang M.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ARLs may also play a role in vesicular trafficking. ARFs are known additionally as activators of phospholipase D and cholera toxin (CTA) ADP-ribosyltransferase, properties that ARLs were believed to lack (15Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M.

Activation of inactive ARF-GDP, which is soluble, is accelerated by guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (GEPs) that promote GDP release and thereby GTP binding (16Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

The brefeldin A-sensitive GEPs, which are larger molecules (∼200 kDa), include p200 (19Morinaga N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 4204-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cytohesin-1 molecule comprises a coiled coil N terminus, a central Sec7 domain (C-1Sec7), and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, the last ∼100 residues of which are required for phospholipid binding (23Chardin P.

The solution structure of the C-1Sec7 has been recently solved by NMR spectroscopy (25Betz S.F. Schnuchel A. Wang H. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Lipsky B.P. Harris E.A.S. Staunton D.E. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7909-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It consists of two domains, each with five α-helices. The active site of C-1Sec7 resides in the C-terminal portion and sequences critical for catalysis include motifs 1 and 2, which had been assigned that role in crystal structures of the closely related ARNO Sec7 domain (26Mossessova E. Gulbis J.M. Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 92: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 27Cherfils J. Ménétrey J. Mathieu M. Le Brass G. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S.

All members of the ARF family contain the GTPase fold or G-domain composed of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices with five loops that are involved in guanine nucleotide binding (28Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). ARF1 differs from other members of the ras superfamily in containing an amphipathic N-terminal α-helix and an extra β-sheet (29Greasely S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M. Cockcroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). ARF1 in the GDP-bound form was crystallized as a dimer, with the extra β-sheet described as a region for protein-protein interactions. The N-terminal glycine of native ARF1 is myristoylated, which influences its membrane association (31Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). ARFs interact with several regulatory proteins (e.g. GEPs, GTPase-activating proteins, and arfaptins), effector proteins (coatomer, phospholipase D, and G protein βγ subunits), as well as cholera toxin and phospholipids. The N- and C-terminal regions of ARF1 differ from those of ARL1 in several specific amino acids that are required for phospholipase D and CTA activation, respectively (32Zhang G.-F. Patton W.A. Lee F.-J.S. Liyanage M. Han J.-S. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In ARF1, Lys-15, Lys-16, Lys-181, and Arg-178 are critical for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding, and the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix participates in membrane association (33Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Information about other GTP-binding proteins suggests that switches I and II of ARF1 are also involved in guanine nucleotide exchange. We recently reported that cytohesin-1 catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange on nonmyristoylated ARF1, and its Sec7 domain accelerated GTPγS binding by ARF1, ARF5, and ARF6 (34Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To define structural elements of ARF required for catalysis of guanine nucleotide exchange by cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7, we took advantage of the observation that both intact cytohesin-1 and its Sec7 domain accelerated GTPγS binding by nonmyristoylated ARF1, and both failed to alter binding by ARL1. Chimeric proteins composed of sequences from hARF1 and hARL1 were synthesized and tested for exchange activity with C-1Sec7 and cytohesin-1. l-α-Phosphatidyl-l-serine, cardiolipin, β-NAD+, and agmatine were purchased from Sigma; GTPγS was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; and [35S[GTPγS and [adenine-14C]βNAD+ were from DuPont NEN.

Incubation with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was started at anA 600 of 0.6 and continued for 2 h. After incubation of the cell pellet with lysozyme, followed by sonification and centrifugation (100,000 × g, 35 min), the supernatant was applied to a column (2.5 × 100 cm) of Ultrogel AcA54, which was eluted with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 200 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2). Fractions containing ARF activity were pooled and stored at −20 °C. Cytohesin-1 and its Sec7 domain were prepared as described previously (22Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc.

Briefly, single colonies expressing the desired protein were incubated in 5 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) for 3–4 h at 37 °C and transferred to 100 ml of the same medium with antibiotics. After reaching anA 600 of 0.5, cells were incubated with 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C and then harvested for protein purification as described by Meacci et al. (22Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). GEP activities of cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7 were regularly assayed with a mixture of purified native bovine brain ARFs (chiefly ARFs 1 and 3) as a basis for comparsion of activities with other substrates. GTPγS binding and GEP activity assays have been published (34Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μl of a mixture containing ARF or related protein (1 μg unless otherwise indicated), 40 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 μg ofl-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 0.1 μg of each protease inhibitor (aprotinin, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and lima bean trypsin inhibitor), 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride, cytohesin-1 or C-1Sec7 as indicated, and 4 μm [35S]GTPγS (∼2.5 × 106 cpm) was incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Tubes were then placed in ice, and contents were transferred to nitrocellulose filters followed by washing of the incubation tube and filter with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Scintillation fluid was added to dried filters before radioassay of bound [35S]GTPγS. Other details are described in figure legends. ARF1 or related protein (usually 50 pmol or ∼1 μg) was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in a mixture (50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm NaN3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm sucrose, 10 μg of l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 40 μg of bovine serum albumin, protease inhibitors as used in binding assays, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm NaCl, and 4 μm [35S]GTPγS (∼2.5 × 106 cpm). Nucleotide release with or without cytohesin-1 (1 μg) or C-1Sec7 (1 μg) was then determined after addition of a 1 mm concentration of the indicated nonradiolabeled nucleotide and 3 mm MgCl2(final concentrations in 100 μl of reaction mixture) and incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time (100 μl). [35S]GTPγS bound to ARFs was quantified as described for the binding assay. To identify structural elements of ARF1 required for functional GEP interaction, we took advantage of our observations that cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7 accelerated GTPγS binding to ARF1 (34Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but both failed to enhance GTPγS binding to ARL1 (Fig.1). The amino acid sequences of ARF1 and ARL1 are overall 57% identical (32Zhang G.-F. Patton W.A. Lee F.-J.S. Liyanage M. Han J.-S. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), including the conserved residues involved in GTP binding. We therefore prepared the ARF(F) and ARF(L) chimeric proteins shown diagramatically in Fig.2 and tested these as substrates for cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7 GEP activity.Figure 2Structures of chimeric proteins.Abbreviations for chimeras are on the left. Residuenumbers are at the top. Segments of human ARF1 and ARL1 sequences are black and white, respectively. Of the first 28 residues of ARF1 and ARL1, 16 (57%) are identical, and 17 of the last 42 (40%) are identical. The gray segment in mut13F139 is a random sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cytohesin-1, as well as C-1Sec7, increased [35S]GTPγS binding to recombinant L28/F composed of the first 28 amino acids of ARL1 and the remainder of ARF1 (Fig.3). Although binding at 37 °C was too rapid to permit meaningful comparison of initial rates, it seemed clear at 25 °C that C-1Sec7 was much more active than cytohesin-1. Conclusions were similar when [35S]GTPγS release from L28/F in the presence of both cytohesin-1 or C-1Sec7 was measured (Fig.4). Thus, cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7 can use an ARF with ARL1 sequence at its N terminus, consistent with the conclusion that the ARL1 N terminus can replace that of ARF1 for cytohesin-1-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange.Figure 4Effect of cytohesin-1 or C-1Sec7 on release of bound [35S]GTPγS from ARF1 or L28/F. ARF1 (1 μg) or L28/F (0.7 μg) with [35S]GTPγS bound was incubated as described under “Experimental Procedures” without (■) or with 1 μg of cytohesin-1 (▪) or C-1Sec7 (▴). [35S]GTPγS bound at zero time (100%) was 7.02 ± 0.00 and 0.44 ± 0.04 pmol for ARF1 and L28/F, respectively. Data are means ± S.E. of values from triplicate assays in one experiment representative of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate further effects of the ARF1 N terminus, rates of guanine nucleotide exchange catalyzed by 4.3 pmol of cytohesin-1 or C-1Sec7 were compared using as substrates native ARF1/3, ARF1 and Δ13ARF1. Cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7 increased the initial rate of GTPγS binding by native ARF (∼4- and 10-fold), respectively (Fig.5). Thus, C-1Sec7 was the more efficient in catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange, as had been reported for nonmyristoylated ARF1 (34Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Binding by Δ13ARF1 was >10 times that by ARF1 in the absence of GEP and was accelerated by C-1Sec7 >40-fold at 2 min, whereas binding to ARF1 was increased much less (Fig.6). Thus, although the N terminus of ARF1 was not required for C-1Sec7-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange, it did appear to influence guanine nucleotide exchange. The rates of release of bound [35S]GTPγS from native ARF1/3 and ARF1 in the presence of C-1Sec7 were similar, whereas release from Δ13ARF1 was twice as fast (Fig. 7). In addition, cytohesin-1 failed to stimulate release GTPγS from Δ13ARF1.Figure 6[35S]GTPγS binding by ARF1 and Δ13ARF1 without or with cytohesin-1 or C-1Sec7. Duplicate assays containing 50 pmol of ARF1 or Δ13ARF1 were incubated without (■) or with 4.3 pmol of cytohesin-1 (▪) or C-1Sec7 (▴). Similar results were obtained with three different preparations of cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7. Data are reported as in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Release of bound [35S]GTPγS from native ARF1/3, ARF1, and Δ13ARF1.[35S]GTPγS bound at zero time (100%) was 0.93 ± 0.05, 1.17 ± 0.06, and 2.471 ± 0.10 pmol, respectively, for ARF1/3, ARF1, and Δ13ARF1. Samples were incubated for the indicated time without (■) or with (▴) 45 pmol of C-1Sec7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the N- and C-terminal helices of ARF1 are in close proximity on the same side of the ARF1 molecule (29Greasely S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M. Cockcroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we wondered whether parts of both might interact with cytohesin-1 to influence guanine nucleotide exchange. To address this question, the last 42 residues of ARF1 were replaced with those of ARL1 in F139/L, which bound GTPγS much more slowly than did ARF1 (Fig. 1). Rates of binding in the presence of cytohesin-1 or C-1Sec7 were also considerably less (Fig. 8) than they were with ARF1. In fact, 10-fold more cytohesin-1 was required to obtain a rate of GTPγS binding to F139/L similar to that of ARF1 (Figs. 6 and8). It appears that the C terminus of ARF1 may influence basal as well as catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange, consistent with, but not in itself proof of, the presence of an interaction site outside of the Sec7 domain. GTPγS binding to mut13F139/L, with a random sequence (2-GNISPTSSRAFLA-13) at the N terminus replacing the ARF1 sequence (2-GNIFANLFKGLF-13), was much more rapid than that to ARF1 (Fig. 1) and was only minimally affected by cytohesin-1. C-1Sec7, however, dramatically accelerated GTPγS binding, which was almost 50% of maximal at zero time (Fig. 8). To assess further the role of the ARF1 C terminus, [35S]GTPγS release from mut13F139/L without and with cytohesin-1 or C-1Sec7 was determined. Although C-1Sec7 accelerated GTPγS release from mut13F139/L, intact cytohesin-1 did not (Fig.9), consistent with the notion that the C terminus of ARF1 does restrain release of bound nucleotide and is involved in the functional interaction with cytohesin-1 but is not as critical for C-1Sec7. The experiments with mut13F139/L are also consistent with other evidence that cytohesin-1 does not require a specific sequence at the ARF1 N terminus. The observation that C-1Sec7 increased GTPγS binding to ARFs 1, 5, and 6 suggested that it interacts with structure conserved in all three classes of ARFs. Because the region, between residues 21 and 100, has the least variability, we first prepared L50/F in which the first 50 amino acids of ARF1 were replaced with the corresponding ARL1 sequence. Both cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7 failed to accelerate [35S]GTPγS binding to L50/F (Fig.10). Because the protein was essentially as effective as ARF1 in activating cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in a GTP-dependent manner (data not shown), it appeared that residues 28–50 of ARF1 contain elements critical for functional interaction with cytohesin-1 or its Sec7 domain. In this region, ARF and ARL are 83% identical, and lysine 38 of ARF1 is the only amino acid conserved among mammalian and yeast ARFs that has a nonconservative replacement (glutamine) in ARL (Fig.11). Both cytohesin-1 and C-1Sec7 failed to increase [35S]GTPγS binding to ARF1K38Q in which lysine 38 was replaced with glutamine (Fig. 10), although the mutant protein was as effective as ARF1 in stimulating cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in a GTP-dependent manner (Fig. 12). It appears that lysine 38 is critical either for the proper structure of this region of ARF1 or for its effective interaction with GEP.Figure 11Comparison of amino acid sequences of ARF proteins (ARF1 residues 28–50).

Following enrichment for peptides cross-linked to guanosine by boronate chromatography, we confirmed that the cysteine 12 residue was the major site of cross-linking. However, significant radiolabel was also incorporated into a peptide containing amino acid residues 206 through 224. Although every amino acid in this peptide except cysteine 211 was identified by sequential Edman degradation, implying that this was the amino acid residue cross-linked to guanosine, radiolabel at C-8 was usually lost during peptide processing (probably during chromatography at pH 10). Consequently, the radiolabeled amino acid could not be unambiguously identified.

Because the nucleotide on β-tubulin is readily replaced with exogenous nucleotide, including radiolabeled compounds, its binding site has been called the exchangeable site (E site) 1The abbreviations used are: E site, exchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin; N site, nonexchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin; [8-14C]GDP-, GDP-, and dGDP-tubulin, tubulin with the indicated nucleotide bound in the exchangeable site; EP-GC, endoproteinase Glu-C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride1The abbreviations used are: E site, exchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin; N site, nonexchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin; [8-14C]GDP-, GDP-, and dGDP-tubulin, tubulin with the indicated nucleotide bound in the exchangeable site; EP-GC, endoproteinase Glu-C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride(1Weisenberg R.C.

Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4248-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The α-tubulin nucleotide is always in the form of GTP, and it probably derives from the tissue of origin of the tubulin because it has never been replaced with exogenous nucleotide (11Spiegelman B.M. Penningroth S.M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1977; 12: 587-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Shearwin K.E. Perez-Ramirez B. Timasheff S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The GTP bound to α-tubulin is thus described as being in the nonexchangeable site (N site).To determine which amino acid(s) of β-tubulin were near the E site, Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employed boronate column chromatography to isolate tryptic peptides enriched for guanosine after direct photoaffinity labeling of tubulin bearing E site [3H]GTP.

Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found most of the radiolabel retained by the boronate matrix had reacted with Cys-12 of β-tubulin. Earlier, Little and Ludueña (13Little M. Ludueña R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) had demonstrated that tubulin depleted of E site nucleotide was susceptible to cross-link formation between Cys-12 and either Cys-201 or Cys-211 byN,N′-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide). The second amino acid involved in the cross-link was not precisely determined. Formation of this dicysteine cross-link was inhibited by guanine nucleotides and by antimitotic drugs that themselves inhibit nucleotide exchange at the E site (14Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).We recently applied the boronate methodology to isolate a peptide of α-tubulin cross-linked to the N site GTP by direct photoaffinity labeling by replacing E site GDP with dGDP (15Bai R. Choe K. Ewell J.B. Nguyen N.Y. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9894-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Following exposure of this tubulin to UV light, E site peptide(s) were not retained by the boronate matrix, and the predominant retained peptide was derived from α-tubulin. Sequence analysis indicated that the modified amino acid was α-Cys-295.Although we had no radiolabel to assist in optimization of the photoreaction and peptide isolation, we had an ample supply of [8-14C]GDP-tubulin (16Grover S. Hamel E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and used this material to define conditions for the photoreaction and optimal use of the boronate matrix. Unlike Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who used high performance liquid chromatography to purify further peptides retained by the boronate matrix before sequencing, we used SDS-PAGE and blot transfer methodologies for this purpose, and we usually observed several radiolabeled bands derived from [8-14C]GDP-tubulin. The most prominent yielded a sequence consistent with a guanosine-β-Cys-12 cross-link, as described by Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This paper describes studies that demonstrate that a second reactive amino acid is probably β-Cys-211.RESULTSFollowing exposure to UV light, [8-14C]GDP-tubulin was digested with either CNBr or EP-GC. The lyophilized peptide mixtures were applied to boronate matrix columns in glycine buffer at pH 10, and bound peptides were eluted with formic acid. A typical experiment with EP-GC peptides is shown in Fig.1, and the pattern obtained with CNBr peptides was similar (data not shown). About 25% of the recovered radiolabel was in the unbound fractions and 75% in the bound fractions. Without UV irradiation no radiolabel was retained by the boronate column. SDS-PAGE, with subsequent electrophoretic transfer of the peptides to PVDF membranes for protein staining, autoradiography, and sequencing was performed on total peptides, unbound peptides, and bound peptides. Selected gel patterns for CNBr peptides are shown in Fig. 2 A, and for EP-GC peptides in Fig. 2, B and C.Figure 2SDS-PAGE patterns obtained with peptides derived from UV irradiated [8-14C]GDP-tubulin.

There were three prominent peptides, but the relative amounts varied in different digests. Even though these were not pure peptides (Coomassie Blue staining revealed a broad streak of peptides), sequence analysis was performed. These studies indicated that the upper band was the CNBr β165–233 peptide and the two lower bands were the β2–73 peptide (sequence of Krauhs et al., Ref. 18Krauhs E. Little M. Kempf T. Hofer-Warbinek R. Ade W. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4156-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The β165–233 peptide includes β-Cys-201 and β-Cys-211, identified by Little and Ludueña (13Little M. Ludueña R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as the two possibilities for the residue linked to β-Cys-12, and the β2–73 peptide includes the β-Cys-12 residue itself, identified by Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the residue that cross-links to [3H]GTP during direct photoaffinity labeling.When the bound peptides were analyzed, we obtained a different gel pattern (Fig. 2 A, II, Coomassie Blue stained, and III, autoradiogram). We cannot explain the faster mobility of the bound radiolabeled peptides, but this did not interfere either with resolution or subsequent sequencing.The stained gel II (Fig. 2 A) showed three major bands and one minor band. All except the upper band 1 were radiolabeled (Fig.2 A, III). Note that the specific activity of the upper radiolabeled band 2 is substantially lower than that of the lower radiolabeled bands 3a and 3b. Band 1 yielded a sequence through 19 cycles of Edman degradation (Table I) consistent with the CNBr peptide α204–302. Note that α-Cys-213 was not positively identified because cysteine residues are destroyed during the Edman procedure. This is the same peptide we obtained previously from dGDP-tubulin (15Bai R.

Open table in a new tab The upper radiolabeled band 2 yielded a sequence through 16 cycles of Edman degradation consistent with the CNBr β165–233 peptide (TableI), and it thus corresponds to the upper radiolabeled band in gel I.Bands 3a and 3b both yielded sequences through 12 cycles of Edman degradation consistent with the CNBr β2–73 peptide (Table I), and these bands thus correspond to the lower radiolabeled bands in gel I.To more precisely define the positions of the radiolabel in β-tubulin, we turned to enzymatic digestion to obtain smaller peptides. EP-GC yielded the best results (studies also performed with endoproteinase Lys-C and trypsin). It should be noted that EP-GC will cleave after aspartate as well as glutamate residues.Initially we obtained puzzling results. Fig. 2 B presents a Coomassie Blue pattern (I) together with its autoradiogram (II) of the peptide fraction bound to and eluted from the boronate column. The most heavily stained band in the electroblot was not radiolabeled. Nevertheless, it yielded the sequence of the EP-GC β206–224 peptide, which is a sequence within that of the radiolabeled CNBr peptide represented by band 2 of the gels shown in Fig. 2 A. This peptide should not have been retained by the boronate matrix unless it possessed the ribose cis-diol, but not necessarily the radiolabel at the C-8 position in guanine. The heavily radiolabeled bands yielded a sequence consistent with the EP-GC β4–22 peptide, which would contain the known target Cys-12.We continued to investigate the peptides generated by EP-GC digestion. We noted that before SDS-PAGE the bromphenol blue tracking dye added to the peptide sample had a green color. Small amounts of NaOH added to the sample restored the blue color of the dye. Sometimes this resulted in an additional radiolabeled band, and the most dramatic example of this change is shown in Fig. 2 C (Coomassie Blue pattern, I, compared with the autoradiogram, II). The Coomassie Blue stained sample showed two minor bands (1a and 1b) and three major bands (2, 3a, and 3b), with only the latter being radiolabeled.The nonradiolabeled bands, 1a and 1b, yielded sequences for 16 and 12 cycles, respectively, of sequential Edman degradation consistent with the EP-GC peptide α291–306 (Table I), the same peptide identified earlier from dGDP-tubulin (15Bai R. Choe K. Ewell J.B. Nguyen N.Y. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9894-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that led us to propose α-Cys-295 as the reactive amino acid at the N site (note that α-Cys-305 is not included in the large CNBr peptide derived from α-tubulin, which should terminate at α-Met-302).Radiolabeled band 2 yielded a sequence for 19 degradation cycles consistent with the EP-GC peptide β206–224 (Table I). The mobility of this band does not differ substantially from the analogous band shown in Fig. 2 B. Because all residues were positively identified except Cys-211, this suggests that the radiolabeled amino acid is in fact Cys-211. If the modification had occurred at a different residue, that amino acid should have either been unidentifiable or misidentified following the Edman procedure (but see “Discussion”). The microsequencing technique does not permit specific localization of the radiolabel in the peptides purified by SDS-PAGE, because specific activity is too low.Radiolabeled bands 3a and 3b yielded sequences for 17 degradation cycles consistent with the EP-GC peptide β4–22 (lacking only Trp-21, which would have been destroyed during the Edman procedure, and the terminal Glu-22). These bands, also, have similar mobility to the analogous bands shown in Fig. 2 B. Only Cys-12 was not identified in this sequence, consistent with its bearing the radiolabeled guanosine fragment shown directly by Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that there is much less difference in the specific activities of the band 2 and band 3 EP-GC peptides than in the analogous CNBr peptides (Fig. 2 A).Our finding of a second peptide cross-linked to radiolabeled E site nucleotide by direct photoaffinity labeling differs from the result of Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in our studies β-Cys-12-containing peptides were always more heavily labeled than those containing β-Cys-211 (see “Discussion”). Besides differences in reaction conditions, our tubulin contained [8-14C]GDP and theirs contained [3H]GTP in the E site. It was thus possible that the difference in results was due to a subtle conformational change in the tubulin as a consequence of the change in nucleotide. However, using CNBr digestion followed by SDS-PAGE as our assay, we could find no condition that caused significant reduction in the upper radiolabeled band (Fig.2 A, gel I).The sole remaining possibility was that the lability of the link from the nucleotide to the Cys-211 peptide caused substantial loss of radiolabel at some point during sample processing by Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiment presented in Fig.3 demonstrates that this is a reasonable explanation, and, in addition, explains the erratic retention of radiolabel we observed. A CNBr digest was prepared and dialyzed against 0.05 m glycine-NaOH (pH 10), the application buffer for the boronate column. SDS-PAGE was performed with the original digest and with samples that had been dialyzed for different times. The radiolabel initially present in the β165–233 peptide (gel I) was reduced after 2 h and nearly completely gone after 12 h (gel II) of dialysis.Figure 3Effect of dialysis against 0.05 mglycine-NaOH (pH 10) of a CNBr digest of irradiated [8-14C]GDP-tubulin.

The cleavage sites by CNBr (CB) and EP-GC (GC) are shown above the amino acid sequences with the presumptive carboxyl cleavage sites in parentheses. Our data agree (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that β-Cys-12 is the primary reactive amino acid with E site nucleotide when tubulin is exposed to UV light. We, however, also find significant radiolabel bound to a second region of β-tubulin. The CNBr digestion data establish that the secondary site is within the β165–233 sequence, and the EP-GC data narrow the location of the reactive residue to the β206–224 sequence. The likely specific amino acid is β-Cys-211.Figure 4Diagram of the two E site peptide sequences and cleavage sites described in this study. CB, CNBr cleavage sites; GC, EP-GC cleavage sites.

Ludueña R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) found that the cross-link formed byN,N′-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide) in β-tubulin depleted of E site nucleotide was between β-Cys-12 and either β-Cys-201 or β-Cys-211. Nogales et al. (3Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar) recently presented a three-dimensional structure of tubulin in zinc-induced sheets and noted that the E site GDP was located between β-Cys-12 and β-Cys-211 and that it was closer to Cys-12 than to Cys-211. This is in accord with our observation of more extensive incorporation of radiolabel in Cys-12-containing peptides than Cys-211 peptides.However, we have not actually demonstrated that the labeled position in either the radiolabeled CNBr peptide or the radiolabeled EP-GC peptide is β-Cys-211. In the microsequencing technique, it is the sliced PVDF membrane electroblot that is placed in the sequencing apparatus, with the Edman degradation performed on the membrane fragment, and generally fewer than 5–10 pmol of amino acid derivative is recovered at even the initial position of the sequenced peptide. The radiolabel in the EP-GC peptide (β206–224) is labile, even though the peptide is clearly bound by the boronate matrix. This suggests that the cross-linked peptide undergoes some sort of “depurination” reaction, with retention of the C2′-C3′-cis-diol responsible for binding of the peptide to the boronate column but loss of the radiolabeled C-8 atom in the guanine residue.Although the thus far uncontrollable loss of radiolabel in the EP-GC β206–224 peptide probably accounts for the difference in our results from those of Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it limits our confidence in assigning the position of the cross-link to Cys-211. Specific identification of all residues except β-Cys-211 in the EP-GC peptide β206–224 favors Cys-211 as being the site of the cross-link, but this requires that the peptide modification causing retention of the peptide on the boronate column is stable throughout the sequential Edman degradation. The ready loss of C-8 (the radiolabel) from the EP-GC peptide is worrisome in this regard, but the cross-link to the C2′-C3′-cis-diol segment appears to be more stable chemically. Because Cys residues are destroyed during the Edman procedure, failure to identify them cannot be taken as positive evidence that they are the site of the cross-link. As a minimum, it is unlikely that the photoreactions between Cys-12 and Cys-211 proceed by the same chemical mechanism (cf. Refs. 7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 15Bai R. Choe K. Ewell J.B. Nguyen N.Y. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9894-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus it remains possible that another amino acid residue in the β206–224 peptide is cross-linked to the C2′-C3′-cis-diol derived from [8-14C]GDP and that the chemical bond is hydrolyzed during sequential Edman degradation, regenerating an unaltered amino acid residue. The α-β-tubulin heterodimer contains two tightly bound molecules of guanosine nucleotide (1Weisenberg R.C. Borisy G.G. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4466-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 2Stephens R.E. Renaud F.L. Gibbons I.R. Science. 1967; 156: 1606-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), one bound to each subunit (3Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Because the nucleotide on β-tubulin is readily replaced with exogenous nucleotide, including radiolabeled compounds, its binding site has been called the exchangeable site (E site) 1The abbreviations used are: E site, exchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin; N site, nonexchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin; [8-14C]GDP-, GDP-, and dGDP-tubulin, tubulin with the indicated nucleotide bound in the exchangeable site; EP-GC, endoproteinase Glu-C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride1The abbreviations used are: E site, exchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin; N site, nonexchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin; [8-14C]GDP-, GDP-, and dGDP-tubulin, tubulin with the indicated nucleotide bound in the exchangeable site; EP-GC, endoproteinase Glu-C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride(1Weisenberg R.C.

Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 643-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Kobayashi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 77: 1193-1197PubMed Google Scholar, 10Weisenberg R.C. Deery W.J. Dickinson P.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4248-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The α-tubulin nucleotide is always in the form of GTP, and it probably derives from the tissue of origin of the tubulin because it has never been replaced with exogenous nucleotide (11Spiegelman B.M. Penningroth S.M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1977; 12: 587-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Shearwin K.E. Perez-Ramirez B. Timasheff S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The GTP bound to α-tubulin is thus described as being in the nonexchangeable site (N site). To determine which amino acid(s) of β-tubulin were near the E site, Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employed boronate column chromatography to isolate tryptic peptides enriched for guanosine after direct photoaffinity labeling of tubulin bearing E site [3H]GTP. Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found most of the radiolabel retained by the boronate matrix had reacted with Cys-12 of β-tubulin. Earlier, Little and Ludueña (13Little M. Ludueña R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) had demonstrated that tubulin depleted of E site nucleotide was susceptible to cross-link formation between Cys-12 and either Cys-201 or Cys-211 byN,N′-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide). The second amino acid involved in the cross-link was not precisely determined. Formation of this dicysteine cross-link was inhibited by guanine nucleotides and by antimitotic drugs that themselves inhibit nucleotide exchange at the E site (14Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We recently applied the boronate methodology to isolate a peptide of α-tubulin cross-linked to the N site GTP by direct photoaffinity labeling by replacing E site GDP with dGDP (15Bai R. Choe K. Ewell J.B. Nguyen N.Y. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9894-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Following exposure of this tubulin to UV light, E site peptide(s) were not retained by the boronate matrix, and the predominant retained peptide was derived from α-tubulin. Sequence analysis indicated that the modified amino acid was α-Cys-295. Although we had no radiolabel to assist in optimization of the photoreaction and peptide isolation, we had an ample supply of [8-14C]GDP-tubulin (16Grover S. Hamel E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and used this material to define conditions for the photoreaction and optimal use of the boronate matrix. Unlike Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who used high performance liquid chromatography to purify further peptides retained by the boronate matrix before sequencing, we used SDS-PAGE and blot transfer methodologies for this purpose, and we usually observed several radiolabeled bands derived from [8-14C]GDP-tubulin. The most prominent yielded a sequence consistent with a guanosine-β-Cys-12 cross-link, as described by Shivanna et al. (7Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This paper describes studies that demonstrate that a second reactive amino acid is probably β-Cys-211. RESULTSFollowing"
