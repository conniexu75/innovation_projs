However, downstream signaling pathways activated by nonbacterial agonists are not known. Thus, we determined the downstream signaling pathways derived from saturated fatty acid-induced TLR4 activation. Saturated fatty acid (lauric acid)-induced NFkappaB activation was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF6, or IkappaBalpha in macrophages (RAW264.7) and 293T cells transfected with TLR4 and MD2. Lauric acid induced the transient phosphorylation of AKT. LY294002, dominant-negative (DN) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or AKT(DN) inhibited NFkappaB activation, p65 transactivation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by lauric acid or constitutively active (CA) TLR4. AKT(DN) blocked MyD88-induced NFkappaB activation, suggesting that AKT is a MyD88-dependent downstream signaling component of TLR4. AKT(CA) was sufficient to induce NFkappaB activation and COX-2 expression. These results demonstrate that NFkappaB activation and COX-2 expression induced by lauric acid are at least partly mediated through the TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT induced by lipopolysaccharide or lauric acid. DHA also suppressed NFkappaB activation induced by TLR4(CA), but not MyD88(CA) or AKT(CA), suggesting that the molecular targets of DHA are signaling components upstream of MyD88 and AKT. Together, these results suggest that saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate the activation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathways involving MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 and PI3K/AKT and further suggest the possibility that TLR4-mediated target gene expression and cellular responses are also differentially modulated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids."

Using recombinant envelope glycoprotein E2 and virus-like particles as ligands for cellular binding, we demonstrate that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) play an important role in mediating HCV envelope-target cell interaction. Heparin and liver-derived highly sulfated heparan sulfate but not other soluble glycosaminoglycans inhibited cellular binding and entry of virus-like particles in a dose-dependent manner. Degradation of cell surface heparan sulfate by pretreatment with heparinases resulted in a marked reduction of viral envelope protein binding. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated a high affinity interaction (KD 5.2 × 10–9m) of E2 with heparin, a structural homologue of highly sulfated heparan sulfate. Deletion of E2 hypervariable region-1 reduced E2-heparin interaction suggesting that positively charged residues in the N-terminal E2 region play an important role in mediating E2-HSPG binding. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that cellular binding of HCV envelope requires E2-HSPG interaction. Docking of E2 to cellular HSPG may be the initial step in the interaction between HCV and the cell surface resulting in receptor-mediated entry and initiation of infection.

A vaccine for prevention of infection is not available and treatment options for chronic HCV infection are limited (2Lauer G.M. Walker B.D. N. Engl. J.

Therefore, novel antiviral treatment strategies are needed.HCV has been tentatively classified in a separate genus (hepacivirus) of the Flaviviridae family (4Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen.

The genome encodes a single polyprotein of 3,010 to 3,030 amino acids that is processed into functional proteins by host and viral proteases (4Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen.

However, it is still unclear whether any of these molecules can act as a functional cellular receptor mediating viral entry and initiation of infection. The study of HCV envelope binding, membrane fusion, and cellular entry has been hampered by the lack of a cell culture system for the large scale synthesis of infectious virions.The HCV structural proteins have been shown to assemble into hepatitis C virus-like particles (HCV-LPs) with morphological, biophysical, and antigenic properties similar to putative virions from infected humans (15Baumert T.F.

In line with these observations, we and others have demonstrated that the interaction of insect cell-derived HCV-LPs with defined human cells lines and hepatocytes represents a convenient high-throughput model system for studying viral binding and entry (18Wellnitz S.

GAGs are present almost ubiquitously on cell surfaces but vary with respect to their composition and quantity among different species, cell types, tissues, and cellular development stages (28Bernfield M.

The GAG heparan sulfate is an important initial cellular binding molecule for several viruses. These viruses include several members of the Flaviviridae family such as Dengue (29Chen Y. Maguire T.

It has been proposed that the affinity of the viral surface molecules to heparan sulfate may be an important determinant for tissue tropism and pathogenicity (36Putnak J.R. Kanesa-Thasan N. Innis B.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 828-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Shukla D. Spear P.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Apart from mediating virus binding to target cells, heparan sulfate carrying a specific sulfation pattern can also act as a cell surface receptor mediating entry of herpes simplex virus type 1 (34Shukla D.

Combet C. Germanidis G. Frainais P.O. Deleage G. Pawlotsky J.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5703-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This finding led to the conclusion that E2 may bind to negatively charged compounds such as cell surface GAGs. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that E2 interacts with highly sulfated heparan sulfate and that this interaction plays a major functional role in mediating cellular binding of HCV glycoprotein E2 to target cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Cell Lines—HCV-LPs of genotypes 1a and 1b were synthesized and purified as described (15Baumert T.F.

Recombinant C-terminal-truncated envelope glycoprotein E2 (comprising amino acids 384–673) and E2 containing a deletion of HVR1 (ΔE2; comprising amino acids 412–715) were generated using recombinant vaccinia viruses containing HCV envelope cDNAs of a European HCV 1b isolate (39van Doorn L.J. van Hoek K. de Martinoff G.

Recombinant NS5A and NS5B proteins (Mikrogen Corp., Martinsried, Germany) were generously provided by H. Diepolder, Dept. of Medicine II, University of Munich. Heparin, kidney-derived normally sulfated heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, dextran sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin ABC lyase, and heparinases I and III were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. Highly sulfated liver-derived heparan sulfate was isolated as previously described (40Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem.

HCV-LPs or recombinant HCV proteins were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, heparin- or BSA-bound proteins were detected by the addition of mouse anti-envelope or anti-NS5A/B monoclonal antibodies (dilution 1:500 in PBS; 45 min at 37 °C). The plates were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000 in PBS; 30 min at 37 °C). Protein-bound antibodies were detected by colorimetry as described recently (41Baumert T.F. Wellnitz S. Aono S. Satoi J. Herion D. Tilman Gerlach J. Pape G.R. Lau J.Y. Hoofnagle J.H. Blum H.E. Liang T.J. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The plates were washed six times with PBS and with 0.1% Tween-20 between each step.Measurement of Envelope Protein-Heparin Interaction by SPR—SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore 3000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using the BIAcore 3000 version software. Pioneer Sensor C1 Chips (BIAcore AB) with a flat carboxymethylated surface were used in this study to reduce nonspecific binding. BSA-heparin (Sigma) was covalently immobilized to the sensor surface (Fc2) through its primary amino groups (42Zhang F. Fath M. Marks R. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, the carboxymethyl groups on the chips surface were first activated using an injection pulse 10 min (50 μl, with the flow rate 5 μl/min) of an equimolar mix of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and N-ethyl-N-(dimethyaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) (final concentration is 0.05 m, mixed immediately prior to injection). A solution of BSA-heparin (obtained from Sigma; 200 μg/ml in sodium acetate buffer with the addition of 2 m guanidine, pH 4.0), was then applied (20 μl) by manual injection. Excess unreacted sites on the sensor surface were blocked by injection with 50 μlof 1 m ethanolamine. The successful immobilization of BSA-heparin was confirmed by the observation of an ∼250 RU increase in the sensor chip. To prepare the control flow cell (Fc1), BSA (Amresco, Solon, OH) was immobilized on the surface with a similar amine coupling procedure. After the surface was activated with NHS/EDS, 5 μl of BSA solution (20 μg/ml in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0) were injected manually to obtain 250 RU immobilized.Measurement of heparin-protein interaction was performed as follows: different dilutions of protein samples in PBS containing 0.05% betaine were injected (30 μl) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. At the end of the sample injection, the same buffer flew over the sensor surface to facilitate dissociation. After a 3-min dissociation time, the sensor surface was regenerated by injecting first with 10 μl of 2 m NaCl, then with 10 μl of glycine-HCl, pH 2 buffer (BIAcore) and 10 μl of NaOH 50 (BIAcore). The response was monitored as a function of time (sensorgram) at 25 °C.Analysis of Binding of HCV-LP E2 and Recombinant E2 to Human Cell Lines by Flow Cytometry—To investigate whether binding of HCV-LP E2 or recombinant E2 can be blocked by soluble GAGs, HCV-LPs (corresponding to an E2 concentration of 2.5 μg/ml) or recombinant E2 (2.5 μg/ml) were preincubated with defined GAGs at various concentrations for 20 min at room temperature in Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen). Protein-GAG complexes were added to cells (1.5 × 105 cells per assay), and cellular binding of HCV-LP and recombinant E2 was analyzed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies as described (18Wellnitz S.

For pretreatment with GAG lyases, HepG2 cells were removed from culture plates by incubation in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA as described (29Chen Y. Maguire T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Esko J.D.

HepG2 or MOLT-4 cells (1.5 × 105 cells per assay) were then incubated in Dulbecco's PBS or 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.01% BSA, pH 6.8 (24Giroglou T. Florin L. Schafer F. Streeck R.E. Sapp M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) containing heparinase I, heparinase III, or chondroitin ABC lyase. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were put on ice and washed once with ice-cold PBS. HCV-LPs and E2 were added to pretreated cells, and HCV-LP or E2 binding was analyzed as described above.Inhibition of Cellular GAG Sulfation by Sodium Chlorate—To reduce the extent of sulfation of heparan sulfate on the cell surface, HepG2 cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of the sulfation inhibitor sodium chlorate as described (24Giroglou T. Florin L. Schafer F. Streeck R.E. Sapp M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, cells were supplemented with sodium sulfate (2 mm) for 48 h to assess the sulfation specificity of inhibition of HCV-LP binding. HCV-LP E2 binding to HepG2 cells after sodium chlorate treatment and addition of sodium sulfate was analyzed by flow cytometry as described above.Analysis of HCV-LP Internalization—HCV-LPs were preincubated with or without heparin (10 μg/ml in Dulbecco PBS) as described above. HCV-LP binding was measured by incubation of HepG2 cells (grown on cover slides) with HCV-LP or HCV-LP-heparin complexes at 4 °C for 40 min. For temperature-dependent HCV-LP entry, cells were incubated for additional 60 min at 37 °C. After removal of non-bound HCV-LPs by washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed with PBS containing 3.5% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were stained for HCV-LP binding and entry using mouse anti-E2 antibody 16A6 (dilution 1:100 in PBS) and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany; dilution 1:250 in PBS). For the co-staining of the cytoskeleton, cells were co-incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich; dilution 1:200 in PBS) and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA; dilution 1:500 in PBS). Between antibody incubations (1 h at room temperature) cells were washed three times in PBS. For co-staining of the nucleus, cells were incubated with DRAQ-5 (Biostatus; Leicestershire, UK), a highly permeable DNA-interactive agent, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Prior to analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy, cover slides were mounted in antifade reagent (Fluoroguard, Bio-Rad) to minimize photobleaching. Stained cells were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 410 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Corp., Jena, Germany) with argon (488 nm) and helium/neon (543 and 633 nm) lasers. Digitalized images were analyzed using Zeiss-LSM Image Browser version 2.8 (Carl Zeiss Corp.).Immunostaining of Cell Surface Heparan Sulfate by Single Chain Antibodies—To assess whether HepG2 and MOLT-4 cells express highly sulfated heparan sulfate on their cell surface, HepG2 and MOLT-4 cells were incubated with VSV-tagged single chain anti-heparan sulfate antibody HS4C3 (bacterial periplasmatic fraction diluted 1:2 in PBS/BSA, incubation time 90 min). HS4C3 has been shown to interact with highly sulfated heparan sulfate on a variety of tissues (43van Kuppevelt T.H. Dennissen M.A. van Venrooij W.J. Hoet R.M. Veerkamp J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12960-12966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Parallel incubation of cells with VSV-tagged single chain antibody MPB49 served as a negative control. Control antibody MPB49 was selected for its similar amino acid sequence compared with HS4C3 (Vh3 family and DP 38 gene number) and does not recognize a defined epitope. 2T. H. van Kuppevelt, unpublished results. For detection of bound antibodies, cells were incubated with Cy3-labeled mouse anti-VSV antibody P5D4 (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:100 in PBS/BSA; 1-h incubation time). Between antibody incubations cells were washed three times in PBS. Labeled cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry or laser scanning confocal microscopy as described above.Analysis of Cellular Heparan Sulfate Structure and Sulfation—Disaccharide analysis of cell surface heparan sulfate from freeze-dried HepG2 and MOLT-4 cells using was performed using high performance liquid chromatography with post-column fluorescence detection as previously described (44Toyoda H. Nagashima T. Hirata R. Toida T. Imanari T. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 704: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Toida T. Huang Y. Washio Y. Maruyama T. Toyoda H. Imanari T. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of kidney and liver heparan sulfate by capillary electrophoresis has been recently described (40Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).RESULTSHigh Affinity Interaction of Envelope Glycoprotein E2 with the Heparan Sulfate Homologue Heparin—Since the structural organization of the envelope glycoprotein E2 suggests an interaction with cellular GAGs (38Penin F. Combet C. Germanidis G. Frainais P.O. Deleage G. Pawlotsky J.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5703-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we first assessed whether E2 interacts with heparin. Heparin is not a constituent of cell membranes but is a close structural homologue of highly sulfated heparan sulfate, which is expressed in various forms on the surface of defined cells and extracellular matrices including hepatocytes (28Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar). Using heparin complexed with BSA as a capture antigen in an ELISA, E2 showed a strong and concentration-dependent interaction with heparin. Heparin binding profiles of E2 from HCV-LPs and recombinant E2 had similar features (Fig. 1). By contrast, no E2 binding was observed to BSA-coated control ELISA plates, indicating that the observed interaction was specific in the established assay (Fig. 1). E2-heparin binding was subtype-independent since HCV-LP E2 from genotype 1a and 1b demonstrated a similar interaction with heparin (data not shown). With our heparin-capture ELISA under the conditions described above, no interaction between heparin and recombinant HCV non-structural proteins NS5A and NS5B could be detected (data not shown). These data indicate that E2 interacts specifically with the heparan sulfate homologue heparin in vitro.To characterize the affinity of heparin-E2 interaction in detail, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed. SPR allows a direct quantitative analysis of label-free molecular interactions in real-time. Highly purified BSA-heparin was covalently immobilized on a biose"

Mitochondrial and microsomal vitamin D 25-hydroxylase enzymes catalyze the first reaction. The mitochondrial activity is associated with sterol 27-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 (CYP27A1); however, the identity of the microsomal enzyme has remained elusive. A cDNA library prepared from hepatic mRNA of sterol 27-hydroxylase-deficient mice was screened with a ligand activation assay to identify an evolutionarily conserved microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP2R1) with vitamin D 25-hydroxylase activity. Expression of CYP2R1 in cells led to the transcriptional activation of the vitamin D receptor when either vitamin D2 or D3 was added to the medium. Thin layer chromatography and radioimmunoassays indicated that the secosteroid product of CYP2R1 was 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Co-expression of CYP2R1 with vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) elicited additive activation of vitamin D3, whereas co-expression with vitamin D 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) caused inactivation. CYP2R1 mRNA is abundant in the liver and testis, and present at lower levels in other tissues. The data suggest that CYP2R1 is a strong candidate for the microsomal vitamin D 25-hydroxylase.

Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism by activating the vitamin D receptor, a transcription factor and member of the nuclear receptor family. In the 1920s, McCollum, Mellanby, and Pappenheimer (see Ref. 1Simoni R.D. Hill R.L. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) showed that deficiency of vitamin D caused rickets in experimental animals. Subsequently, the structure of vitamin D and its origins from plant and animal steroids were determined, and the roles of the vitamin in the mobilization of minerals from the diet and in bone were defined. The liver was shown to be required for the activation of vitamin D by 25-hydroxylation (2Ponchon G. DeLuca H.F. J. Clin.

Although 25-hydroxyvitamin D was more active than vitamin D in many bioassays (4Blunt J.W. DeLuca H.F. Schnoes H.K. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3317-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), the most potent hormone was 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (5Haussler M.R. Myrtle J.F. Norman A.W. J. Biol.

Loss of this enzyme has profound effects on cholesterol metabolism, as CYP27A1 catalyzes an essential reaction in bile acid synthesis. In contrast, vitamin D metabolism is normal in individuals and mice with no functional CYP27A1. These findings indicate that the microsomal vitamin D 25-hydroxylase can compensate for loss of the mitochondrial activity. In the current study, a cDNA library made from hepatic mRNA of mice deficient in the gene encoding the mitochondrial CYP27A1 enzyme was screened using a vitamin D receptor-based, ligand activation assay (18Takeyama K. Kitanaka S. Sato T. Kobori M. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Science. 1997; 277: 1827-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). A single cDNA specifying a microsomal P450 enzyme termed CYP2R1 with previously unknown substrate specificity was identified. The biochemical properties and tissue distribution of CYP2R1 are consistent with this enzyme being the microsomal vitamin D 25-hydroxylase. Expression Plasmids—A mouse adrenodoxin cDNA (mAdx, nucleotides 41–772 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. L29123) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from random hexamer-primed mouse hepatic cDNAs using the following oligonucleotide primers: Forward (5′-GCCTATGTCGACTCAGCACTGCGCAGGACTCC-3′) and Reverse (5′-GCGGGATCCGACAGCACAGCTACTCACAC-3′). The amplified DNA was digested with the enzymes SalI and BamHI and ligated into pCMV6 (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. AF239250). The adrenodoxin expression vector encoded the expected electron transport enzyme activity in transfected cells, as judged by the ability of the protein to stimulate the vitamin D 25-hydroxylase activity of sterol 27-hydroxylase. A mouse vitamin D 24-hydroxylase cDNA (mCYP24A1, nucleotides 281–2200 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. D89669) was amplified by PCR from random hexamer-primed kidney cDNA. The RNA for this cDNA synthesis reaction was isolated from a mouse injected intraperitoneally with 36 pmol of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D/g of body weight for 5 h prior to tissue harvest. Oligonucleotide primers for the amplification reaction were: Forward (5′-GCCTATGTCGACACTTCAGAACCCAACAGCAC-3′) and Reverse (5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCAGTGACATCAGGCTCTTGAG-3′). The amplified DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI and ligated into the pCMV6 vector. Human cytochrome P450 subfamily 3A, polypeptide 4 (hCYP3A4, nucleotides 98–1617 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. NM_017460), and cytochrome P450 2R1 (hCYP2R1) cDNAs were amplified by PCR from liver QUICK-clone cDNA (Clontech). Oligonucleotide primers for the hCYP3A4 cDNA were: Forward (5′-GCCTATGTCGACAGTGATGGCTCTCATCCCAG-3′) and Reverse (5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCTTCAGGCTCCACTTACGGTG-3′). The amplified DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI and then ligated into the pCMV6-SPORT vector (Invitrogen). The CYP3A4 expression vector encoded testosterone 6β-hydroxylase enzyme activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, as judged by thin layer chromatography. Oligonucleotide primers for the hCYP2R1 cDNA were: Forward (5′-GCCTATGTCGACTGTGGAGTTCGCACCTCCAG-3′) and Reverse (5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCAACCAAGTTCAGGGATAAGG-3′). The amplified DNA was digested with the enzymes SalI and NotI and then ligated into the pCMV6 vector. A DNA fragment encompassing the 5′-flanking region of the mouse osteopontin gene (nucleotides 1–862 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no.

Oligonucleotide primers were: Forward (5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCTTCAGGCTCCACTTACGGTG-3′) and Reverse (5′-CCGCTCGAGCTTGGCTGGTTTCCTCCGAGAATG-3′). The amplified DNA product was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and XhoI and then ligated into the pTK-LUC reporter plasmid (27Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A.

Nucleic acids in the ligation mixture were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 5 μl of deionized, distilled H2O. Escherichia coli Electromax DH10B cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with 1 μl of the resuspended DNAs. The transformation mixture was diluted into 500 ml of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml). An aliquot (1.25 ml) of the diluted culture (containing ∼100 transformants) was added to each well of a 96-well block (Qiagen) and incubated with shaking for 20–24hat37 °C. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the bacterial cultures using the QIAprep96 Turbo Miniprep kit (Qiagen). HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL no. 1573) were transfected with pools of ∼100 cDNAs using the FuGENE™ 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). The cells were maintained in mono-layer culture at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 8.8% CO2, 91.2% air in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. On day 0 of an expression cloning experiment, 25,000 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates (Corning Costar, no. 3595) in a volume of 100 μl of high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) dextran-charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. On day 1, cells were transfected with a mixture containing 0.45-μl FuGENE™ 6 and 150 ng of plasmid DNA comprising 20 ng of pCMX-β-galactosidase (29Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K.

Cells were returned to the incubator for 8–10 h, and then vehicle (ethanol) or 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 (Sigma) substrate was added to a final concentration of 10 nm. After an additional 16–20 h of incubation, cells were lysed by the addition of 100 μl/well Lysis Buffer (2% (v/v) CHAPS, 0.6% (w/v) phosphatidylcholine, 2.5 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.6% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 4 mm EGTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and 1% (w/v) Pefabloc SC (Centerchem)). The 96-well plates were shaken for 5 min at 23 °C, and then 20 μl of cell lysate from each well were transferred to a fresh 96-well assay plate (Corning Costar no. 3922). Thereafter, 100 μl of Luciferase Assay Buffer (4 mm ATP (Roche Applied Science), 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m KPO4) was added to each well, and luciferase activity was measured in a Dynex MLX microtiter plate luminometer running the Revelation MLX version 4.25 software after the addition of 100 μl of Luciferin Solution (1 mm d-luciferin (Molecular Probes) in 0.1 m KPO4). β-Galactosidase enzyme activity was determined in cell lysates using a Dynex Opsys MR machine running the Revelation Quicklink software; an aliquot (40 μl) of cell lysate was transferred to each well of a fresh 96-well plate (Corning Costar no. 3598), followed by the addition of 125-μl of β-Galactosidase Assay Buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.4% (w/v) 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science), and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and an incubation of 10 min at 37 °C prior to measuring the absorbance at A 405. Relative luciferase units were calculated by dividing the measured luciferase activities by the absorbance values per min determined in the β-galactosidase assay. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. of measurement derived from triplicate wells.

The VDR/vitamin D response element (VDRE)-luciferase system used here consisted of the SPPX3-TK-LUC plasmid (31Choi M. Yamamoto K.R. Itoh T. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Moras D. DeLuca H.F.

Biol. 2003; 10: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and a plasmid expressing the full-length mouse vitamin D receptor (pCMX/mVDR, nucleotides 109–1377 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. D31969) (32Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xie W. Whitfield G.K. Domoto H. Evans R.M. Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The VDR/osteopontin-luciferase system was composed of the osteopontin-LUC plasmid (0.862-kb DNA fragment encompassing the mouse osteopontin gene promoter ligated into the pTK-LUC vector (Ref. 27Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar)), and the pCMX/mVDR DNA described above. Transfection experiments with the GAL4-VDR/GAL4-luciferase receptor-reporter systems were carried out as described under “Expression Cloning.” For the VDR/VDRE-luciferase and VDR/osteopontin-luciferase systems, the plasmid DNA mixtures (150 ng of DNA total) contained 5 ng of pCMX/mVDR, 20 ng of pSPPX3-TK-LUC or pOsteopontin-LUC, 20 ng of pCMX-β-galactosidase, 10 ng of pVA1, and 95 ng of CYP expression vector or pCMV6 plasmid DNA. Secosteroids used in the experiments reported here (vitamin D2, vitamin D3, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) were obtained from Sigma and added to the culture medium in ethanol (1 μl/ml of medium). Stock solutions of these compounds ranged in concentration from 10-2 to 5 × 10-7m and were stored at -20 °C. Thin Layer Chromatography—HEK 293 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in 2.5 ml of high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) dextran-charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. On day 2, cells were transfected with FuGENE™ 6 reagent and a mixture of plasmid DNAs (3.5 μg total) containing 0.5 μg of pVA1, and either 3 μg of pCMV6, 3 μg of pCMV6-h2R1, 1.5 μg of pCMV6, and 1.5 μg of pCMV6-mAdx, or 1.5 μg of pCMV6-mCYP27A1 and 1.5 μg of pCMV6-mAdx. After 18 h, the transfection medium was removed from the dish and replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium supplemented as above and containing 4.6 × 10-7m [4-14C]vitamin D3 (Amersham Biosciences). For cells transfected with the pCMV6-mCYP27A1 plasmid, the medium was brought to a final concentration of 10-6m vitamin D3 by the addition of unlabeled secosteroid. Cells and medium were harvested 96 h later, and vitamin D metabolites were extracted with 8 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), and then dried under a stream of N2. The extracted metabolites were resuspended in 50 μl of acetone and resolved by thin layer chromatography on pre-scored LD5DF silica gel 150-Å plates (Whatman). Solvent systems of cyclohexane:ethyl acetate (3:2, v/v), chloroform:ethyl acetate (3:1, v/v), and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane:ethyl acetate:acetic acid (50:50:17, v/v/v) were used. Radiolabeled vitamin D metabolites were detected by phosphorimage analysis on a BAS1000 machine (Fuji Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). Aliquots (5 μl) of 10-2m stock solutions of unlabeled standards (vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) dissolved in ethanol were chromatographed in adjacent lanes on the plates and visualized by iodine staining (33Touchstone J.C. Practice of Thin Layer Chromotography. 3rd ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassays—The γB 25 hydroxyvitamin D radioimmunoassay kit (Alpco Diagnostics) was used for the quantitative determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in medium from HEK 293 cells cultured in the 96-well plate format described above. Cells were transfected via the FuGENE™ 6 reagent with 150 ng of total plasmid DNA comprising 5 ng of pCMX/mVDR, 20 ng of SPPX3-TK-LUC, 20 ng of pCMX-β-galactosidase, 10 ng of pVA1, and either 95 ng of pCMV6, pCMV6-h2R1, or pCMV6 SPORT-m2R1, or 45 ng of pCMV6-mCYP27A1 and 45 ng of pCMV6-mAdx. After 10 h, ethanol vehicle, or vitamin D3 at final concentrations of 0.5 or 1 μm, was added to the medium. Radioimmunoassays were performed 44 h later on 50-μl aliquots of pooled medium from triplicate wells following directions provided by the manufacturer. The correlation coefficient of accuracy for the radioimmunoassay kit was r = 0.95. Sensitivity was >3 nmol/liter. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays also were performed on cell lysates to ensure that transfected plasmids were expressed. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Aliquots (100 μg) of total RNA were treated with deoxyribonuclease I (DNA-free; Ambion). cDNA synthesis was initiated from 2 μg of deoxyribonuclease I-treated RNA using random hexamer primers and Taqman reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems (ABI)). For each real time PCR reaction, which was carried out in triplicate, cDNA synthesized from 20 ng of deoxyribonuclease I-treated RNA was mixed with 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (ABI). Samples were analyzed on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system. Oligonucleotide primer sequences used in these experiments were: CYP2R1 mRNA, 5′-CAGAAAGACGCTGAAAGTGCAA-3′ and 5′-CAGTGTATTTGTGTTTACTTGGCTTTATAA-3′; CYP24A1 mRNA, 5′-CTCCCTATGGATGCAGTATGTATAGTG-3′ and 5′-TTTAAAAACGTTGTCAGTAGGTCATAACT-3′; CYP27A1 mRNA, 5′-GGAGGGCAAGTACCCAATAAGA-3′ and 5′-TGCGATGAAGATCCCATAGGT-3′; CYP27B1 mRNA, 5′-TCAGCAGGCATCGCAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GCATTGGATCCTGAGGAATGA-3′; cyclophilin mRNA, 5′-TGGAGAGCACCAAGACAGACA-3′ and 5′-TGCCGGAGTCGACAATGAT-3′. An expression cloning assay was established in cultured cells and optimized to isolate cDNAs encoding enzymes capable of activating vitamin D3 by 25-hydroxylation. The vitamin D-responsive reporter system consisted of a plasmid encoding a chimeric protein composed of the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor fused to the ligand binding domain of the human vitamin D receptor, and a reporter plasmid in which luciferase expression was directed by a heterologous promoter consisting of four GAL4 DNA response elements linked to basal expression elements from the herpes simplex 1 TK gene; this receptor-reporter system is referred to as GAL4-VDR/GAL4-luciferase. The introduction of these plasmids into HEK 293 cells followed by the addition of saturating levels of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to the culture medium led to a >700-fold increase over background of luciferase enzyme activity versus that observed in the absence of ligand (data not shown). To determine the maximum number of cDNAs that could be assayed at one time in the expression screen, dilution experiments were performed with the CYP27A1 expression plasmid, the receptor-reporter system, and the precursor substrate, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3. A luciferase enzyme activity that was 3-fold over background was observed when the sterol 27-hydroxylase plasmid was diluted 190-fold with a control plasmid lacking a cDNA insert. These results indicated that a cDNA pool size of ∼100–200 could be reliably screened in the expression cloning assay when 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 was used as the precursor. They also confirmed that the sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme is capable of 25-hydroxylating both vitamin D3 and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 (11Guo Y.-D. Strugnell S.A. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 34Saarem K. Pedersen J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Holmberg I. Berlin T. Ewerth S. Bjorkhem I. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1986; 46: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To avoid isolating cDNAs encoding the sterol 27-hydroxylase, the cDNA library used in these studies was constructed using poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from livers of mice lacking sterol 27-hydroxylase (25Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The resulting library was estimated to contain 7.9 × 106 independent transformants with an average cDNA insert size of 1.5 kb. Aliquots of the library containing ∼100 cDNAs were transfected together with the GAL4-VDR/GAL4-luciferase receptor-reporter plasmids into HEK 293 cells. The data generated from one such experiment is shown in Fig. 1. One cDNA pool (A11) produced a luciferase enzyme activity that was ∼2-fold over that generated in mock transfected cells. Subsequent cycles of cDNA purification and screening were performed on the A11 pool to identify a single cDNA that encoded the vitamin D-activating activity. A total of ∼110,000 cDNAs in 1056 pools were screened. Seven positive cDNA pools were identified, revealing four different encoded proteins. cDNAs for the retinoid X receptor α, hypoxia induction factor 1α, and the SEC14-related protein (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. NM_144520) produced a luciferase signal over background. Stimulation by the retinoid X receptor α protein may reflect a shortage of this vitamin D receptor heterodimerization partner in the HEK 293 cells. Similarly, enhancement by the hypoxia induction factor 1α is most likely the result of synergism between the receptor and this transcription factor. The mechanism by which the SEC14-related protein stimulated expression remains unknown, but the effect was modest (≤2-fold). The cDNA in the A11 pool that stimulated vitamin D receptor activity encoded cytochrome P450 2R1 (CYP2R1) based on sequence comparisons among gene family members (drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html). The amino acid sequence of the CYP2R1 protein was deduced from the isolated mouse cDNA (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. AY323818), and the amino acid sequence of the human enzyme (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession no. AY323817) was generated from a cDNA isolated from liver mRNA using PCR (Fig. 2A). The two enzymes share 89% sequence identity at the amino acid level (Fig. 2A), and the coding regions of the two cDNAs share 89% identity at the nucleic acid level. The human CYP2R1 gene is located on chromosome 11, band p15.2, and contains five exons distributed over ∼15.5 kb (Fig. 2B). The mouse Cyp2r1 gene occupies a syntenic location on chromosome 7, band 7E3. The mouse CYP2R1 mRNAs are ∼1.6 and 1.1 kb in length, with the larger form being more abundant than the smaller form (data not shown). The high degree of sequence conservation between mouse and human CYP2R1 protein sequences, and the ability of this enzyme to activate 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3, suggested that it might be a vitamin D 25-hydroxylase. This hypothesis was tested further in a series of transfection experiments with different cytochrome P450 cDNAs, vitamin D receptor constructs, and reporter genes. Vitamin D3 rather than 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 was utilized as a precursor because 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 also activates the vitamin D receptor, albeit with decreased potency compared with the 1α,25-dihydroxy compound (18Takeyama K. Kitanaka S. Sato T. Kobori M. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Science. 1997; 277: 1827-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Transfection of the mouse or human CYP2R1 cDNA increased luciferase expression ∼7–10-fold in the GAL4-VDR/GAL4-luciferase reporter system (Fig. 3A). A similar stimulation was observed when a plasmid encoding the mouse sterol 27-hydroxylase (mCYP27A1) was introduced into the HEK 293 cells. As negative controls, neither the expression vector alone (pCMV6), nor a vector exp"
https://openalex.org/W2154514232,"CLOCK is a positive component of a transcription/translation-based negative feedback loop of the central circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mammals. To examine CLOCK-regulated circadian transcription in peripheral tissues, we performed microarray analyses using liver RNA isolated from Clock mutant mice. We also compared expression profiles with those of Cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2) double knockout mice. We identified more than 100 genes that fluctuated from day to night and of which expression levels were decreased in Clock mutant mice. In Cry-deficient mice, the expression levels of most CLOCK-regulated genes were elevated to the upper range of normal oscillation. Most of the screened genes had a CLOCK/BMAL1 binding site (E box) in the 5′-flanking region. We found that CLOCK was absolutely concerned with the circadian transcription of one type of liver genes (such as DBP, TEF, and Usp2) and partially with another (such as mPer1, mPer2, mDec1, Nocturnin, P450 oxidoreductase, and FKBP51) because the latter were damped but remained rhythmic in the mutant mice. Our results showed that CLOCK and CRY proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of many circadian output genes in the mouse liver. In addition to being a core component of the negative feedback loop that drives the circadian oscillator, CLOCK also appears to be involved in various physiological functions such as cell cycle, lipid metabolism, immune functions, and proteolysis in peripheral tissues.

Many organisms display rhythms of physiology and behavior which are entrained to the 24-h cycle of light and darkness which prevails on Earth. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 1The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; CT, circadian time(s); DBP, D site-binding protein; GADD, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible; GC, glucocorticoid; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; Id, inhibitors of differentiation/DNA-binding proteins; TEF, thyrotroph embryonic factor; WT, wild-type.1The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; CT, circadian time(s); DBP, D site-binding protein; GADD, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible; GC, glucocorticoid; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; Id, inhibitors of differentiation/DNA-binding proteins; TEF, thyrotroph embryonic factor; WT, wild-type. is considered the master circadian pacemaker that controls most of the physical circadian rhythms including behavior (1Pando, M.

Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Studies of clock genes have recently implied that oscillatory mechanisms function in peripheral organs and isolated cells and that they appear to be entrained to the SCN (1Pando, M. P., and Sassone-Corsi, P. (2001) Sci. STKE http://www.stke.org/egi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/107/re16.Google Scholar, 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Although the peripheral oscillators seem to play an important role in regulating various physiological functions, little is known about the circadian oscillatory mechanism in peripheral tissues. Recent studies at the molecular level in bacteria, plants, and animals have provided a general model of the circadian pacemaker that is based on a self-sustained transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop (1Pando, M. P., and Sassone-Corsi, P. (2001) Sci. STKE http://www.stke.org/egi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/107/re16.Google Scholar, 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Clock was the first clock gene identified in vertebrates by forward mutagenesis using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in a behavioral screening (3Vitaterna M.H. King D.P. Chang A.M. Kornhauser J.M. Lowrey P.L. McDonald J.D. Dove W.F. Pinto L.H. Turek F.W. Takahashi J.S. Science. 1994; 264: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). When transferred from a light-dark cycle to constant darkness, the periodicity of behavior exhibited by homozygous Clock mutants is abnormally long for the initial 5–15 cycles, and circadian rhythmicity is consequently lost (3Vitaterna M.H. King D.P. Chang A.M. Kornhauser J.M. Lowrey P.L. McDonald J.D. Dove W.F. Pinto L.H. Turek F.W. Takahashi J.S. Science. 1994; 264: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). The Clock gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS transcription factor (1Pando, M. P., and Sassone-Corsi, P. (2001) Sci. STKE http://www.stke.org/egi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/107/re16.Google Scholar, 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Like other bHLH transcription factors, CLOCK binds DNA and modulates transcription after dimerization with BMAL1 (a bHLH-PAS transcription factor) (1Pando, M. P., and Sassone-Corsi, P. (2001) Sci. STKE http://www.stke.org/egi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/107/re16.Google Scholar, 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). As the Clock allele is truncated and causes a deletion of 51 amino acids, the mutation presumably would not have a significant effect on the N-terminal bHLH and PAS domains, leaving CLOCK dimerization and DNA binding intact (1Pando, M. P., and Sassone-Corsi, P. (2001) Sci. STKE http://www.stke.org/egi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/107/re16.Google Scholar, 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Actually, the mutant CLOCK protein can still form heterodimers with BMAL1 which bind to DNA, but the heterodimers are deficient in transactivation (1Pando, M. P., and Sassone-Corsi, P. (2001) Sci. STKE http://www.stke.org/egi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/107/re16.Google Scholar, 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer drives the rhythmic transcription of period (mPer1, mPer2, and mPer3) and cryptochrome (mCry1 and mCry2) genes through the E box (CACGTG) in Per and Cry promoters (1Pando, M. P., and Sassone-Corsi, P. (2001) Sci. STKE http://www.stke.org/egi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/107/re16.Google Scholar, 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). As the PER and CRY proteins are translated, they form multimeric complexes that are translocated to the nucleus. The CRY proteins are essential for the negative feedback loop that regulates the central clock (4Vitaterna M.H. Selby C.P. Todo T. Niwa H. Thompson C. Fruechte E.M. Hitomi K. Thresher R.J.

The primary function of the CRY proteins in mammals is to inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transactivation (1Pando, M. P., and Sassone-Corsi, P. (2001) Sci. STKE http://www.stke.org/egi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/107/re16.Google Scholar, 2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). However, how the CRY proteins negatively regulate CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transactivation remains obscure. A recent study has shown that H3 histone acetylation is a potential target of CRY inhibitory action, as CRY proteins inhibit the increase in CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transactivation induced by histone acetyltransferase p300 (6Etchegaray J.P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M. Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis is a powerful tool with which to evaluate the expression of many genes in various experimental systems, and it can identify target genes for transcription factors. Hundreds of tissue-specific circadian clock-controlled genes, which regulate an impressive diversity of biological processes, have been identified by DNA microarray technology (7Panda S. Antoch M.P.

CLOCK protein is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several circadian output genes as well as in the core circadian clock (7Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I. Schook A.B. Straume M.

We speculated that transcripts that are rhythmic in a circadian manner, down-regulated in homozygous Clock mutant mice, and elevated at high or intermediate levels in Cry-deficient mice would potentially be direct targets of CLOCK protein. Thus, to examine the CLOCK-regulated genes that express in a circadian manner in mice, we performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis at circadian times (CT) 14 and CT2, when CLOCK/BMAL1 transcriptional activity is maximal and minimal, respectively (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), using RNA isolated from the livers of wild-type (WT), Clock mutant, and Cry-deficient mice. We also searched for an E box element in the 10-kb region 5′-upstream from these genes and their respective human homologs. Our results revealed that several circadian expressing output genes are probably regulated by CLOCK and CRY proteins via the E box element(s) in the mouse liver. Mice—Clock mutant mice were derived from animals supplied by J. S. Takahashi (Northwestern University, Evanston IL). The animals had the Clock allele originally on a BALB/c and C57BL/6J background. A breeding colony was established by further backcrossing with Jcl:ICR mice (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cry1 and Cry2 double knockout mice were generated as described previously (4Vitaterna M.H. Selby C.P. Todo T. Niwa H.

Mice with WT Jcl:ICR and C57BL/6 backgrounds were Northern blot controls for Clock mutant and Cry-deficient mice, respectively. All male mice of 8–10 weeks of age were maintained under a 12:12-h light-dark cycle for at least 2 weeks before the day of the experiment. After being placed in constant darkness (DD), the animals were sacrificed at CT2 and CT14 on the 2nd day of DD. The livers were dissected, quickly frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples and GeneChip Hybridization—Total RNA was purified from a pool of two to three animal tissues collected at each time point using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd., Japan). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from the total RNA using an Oligotex™-dT30 mRNA Purification kit (Takara). Double stranded cDNA containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′-end was synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA using a SuperScript double stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Biotinylated amplified RNA was then synthesized using a BioArray™ HighYield™ RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Life Sciences) and purified using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The labeled RNA was partially hydrolyzed and hybridized in duplicate (or more) to Affymetrix GeneChip (MG-U74Av2) arrays. The arrays were hybridized, washed, and analyzed using standard Affymetrix reagents and protocols. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting proceeded as described previously (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Random primed 32P-labeled probes were generated from cDNA fragments of mPer1 (bases 2358–3114; GenBank AB002108), mPer2 (bases 1123–1830; GenBank AF036893), FKBP51 (bases 191–1069; GenBank U16959), NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase (bases 60–1013; GenBank D17571), mDec1 (bases 722–1333; GenBank Y07836), Nocturnin (bases 901–1730; GenBank AF199491), TEF (bases 141–1020; GenBank BC036982), Usp2 (bases 89–384; GenBank AB041799), and DBP (bases 1138–1602; GenBank J03179). Samples were normalized to the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (data not shown). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR and in Situ Hybridization— Complementary DNA generated using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) was amplified by PCR using a LightCycler™ (Roche Applied Science). The primers were as follows: Usp2 forward, 5′-TGTATGCTGTGTCCAATCA-3′ and reverse 5′-TAGAAGAGCAAATAGGCGT-3′. To quantify and confirm the integrity of each RNA sample, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was the internal standard. A standard curve was constructed with serial dilutions of cDNA obtained from hypothalamic RNA. Data were analyzed using LightCycler™ analysis software and are expressed as ratios to the highest value of the eight time points of the day. In situ hybridization proceeded as described previously (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused from the left ventricle with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The animals were dissected under a dim red light in the dark. The tissues were fixed for 2.5 h at 4 °C, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Miles), and cut into 8-μm cryosections. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were generated from Usp2 (bases, 89–384; GenBank AB041799) using a DIG RNA labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science). Transcripts were hybridized and detected as described (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Screening of CLOCK-regulated Rhythmic Genes—Average difference values for each gene were calculated using Affymetrix microarray analysis software, and average difference values of 1 or lower were set to 1, to avoid division by 0 or a negative number. Other studies have demonstrated that CLOCK-regulated gene expression levels in Clock (Clk/Clk) mutant mice are generally lower than those in the WT (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and that an expression ratio of 2-fold is the approximate limit of sensitivity (15Su A.I. Cooke M.P. Ching K.A. Hakak Y. Walker J.R. Wiltshire T. Orth A.P. Vega R.G. Sapinoso L.M. Moqrich A. Patapoutian A. Hampton G.M. Schultz P.G. Hogenesch J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Therefore, we applied three criteria to the selection of circadianrelated genes: WT14 (the value of WT at CT14)/WT02 > 2, (WT02 + WT14)/2 > Clk02, and (WT02 + WT14)/2 > Clk14. Under these criteria, not only the genes that show the damped expression in Clock mutants, but also the genes that show the changing in phase of circadian expression will be identified. Actually, known components of the CLOCK-regulated genes such as mPer1, mPer2, mDec1, and albumin D site-binding protein (DBP) were identified, suggesting that this screening strategy was appropriate for an examination of directly or indirectly CLOCK-regulated circadian gene expression in the mouse liver. Computational Analysis of E Box Motif—The protein-coding sequences of each cycling gene were used for BLAST as queries for corresponding genome contigs of mouse draft genome sequences (ftp.ensembl.org/pub/mouse-7.3/data/golden_path/). The consensus E box element (CACGTG) was searched against the 10-kb genome sequences upstream from the first methionine for the respective cycling genes (when the positions of coding regions were unavailable, we used the 10-kb genome sequences upstream from the mRNA start site instead). We identified 1216 genes that fluctuated day/night in the liver of WT mice. In these genes, 108 known genes (Fig. 1) and 27 unknown genes (Fig. 2) showed reduced expression levels in Clock mutant mice. Among them, known components of the circadian clock such as mPer1, mPer2, mDec1, and DBP were identified, suggesting that our current strategy was appropriate to examine CLOCK-regulated circadian gene expression in the mouse liver. Furthermore, BLAST search results of the screened expressed sequence tag clones revealed that our experiments were accurate because identical genes such as Nocturnin, long chain fatty acyl elongase (Lce), P450 oxidoreductase, a DnaJ homolog (mDj7), RAN GTPase-activating protein 1, and adenylate kinase 4 (Ak4) were screened using different probe sets (Fig. 1). The present study included known components of CLOCK-regulated circadian expressing genes such as mPer1, mPer2, and DBP (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in the screened genes (Fig. 1). Thus, our screening strategy could screen CLOCK-regulated circadian expressing genes in the liver. However, the timing of many systems such as locomotion (16Sei H. Oishi K. Morita Y. Ishida N. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1461-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), neuroendocrine (17Sei H. Sano A. Oishi K. Fujihara H. Kobayashi H. Ishida N. Morita Y. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and feeding/drinking (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) would be expected to change in the Clock mutant mice. Therefore, some of the observed changes in gene expression may be caused by alteration in these systems.Fig. 2Pseudo-color image of expressed sequence tag gene expression by WT, Clock mutant (Clk/Clk), and double knockout (Cry1 and Cry2) mice (WKO) under constant darkness (see Fig. 1 ).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We found that the expression of mDec1 mRNA is circadian in the liver (Fig. 3) as well as in the SCN (18Honma S. Kawamoto T. Takagi Y. Fujimoto K. Sato F. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Honma K. Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). DEC1 has shown to repress CLOCK/BMAL1-induced transactivation by direct protein-protein interaction and/or competition for E box elements (18Honma S. Kawamoto T. Takagi Y. Fujimoto K. Sato F. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Honma K. Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In turn, the circadian expression of mDec1 mRNA was considered to be positively regulated by CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers (18Honma S. Kawamoto T. Takagi Y. Fujimoto K. Sato F. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Honma K. Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). However, mDec1 mRNA in Clock mutant mice was expressed in a circadian manner, although the expression phase was changed (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the peak expression levels of mDec1 mRNA were not changed by the Clock mutation. It seems that CLOCK-independent oscillating mechanisms exist in peripheral tissues (see below) (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our present results indicated that the circadian expression of bHLH transcription factors such as mDec1, Arnt2, Hes6, and Hes3 is regulated by CLOCK, which is also a bHLH transcription factor (Figs. 1 and 3). We showed previously that the circadian expression of BMAL1 mRNA is blunted at the upper range of normal oscillation in the peripheral tissues of Clock mutant mice (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, these bHLH transcription factors appear to be expressed in a circadian manner, and the regulation of their expression may be interdependent in the mouse liver. The inhibitors of differentiation/DNA-binding proteins (Id) act as dominant negative regulators of bHLH proteins and are important for the control of differentiation and cell cycle progression in organisms ranging from flies to humans (19Nakamura W. Honma S. Shirakawa T. Honma K. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 399-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We found that Id-1 mRNA levels were damped in the liver of Clock mutant mice (Fig. 1). Because Id lacks a basic DNA binding domain, heterodimers between Id and bHLH proteins cannot bind DNA. Primary targets for Id proteins are the bHLH transcription factors that regulate cell type-specific gene expression and the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes. Id-1 exhibits circadian rhythms of mRNA and protein expression in the pineal gland, whereas the related genes, Id-2 and Id-3, do not (20Humphries A. Klein D. Baler R. Carter D.A. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2002; 14: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dominant negative regulators of bHLH proteins might be involved in clock or clock-related circadian transcriptional regulation via the E box in various tissues including the pineal gland (20Humphries A. Klein D. Baler R. Carter D.A. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2002; 14: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and liver. The present study shows the circadian expression of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible (GADD) 45α, GADD45β, and GADD153 mRNAs in the mouse liver. Moreover, the circadian expression of these GADDs seems to be regulated by CLOCK (Fig. 1). In response to DNA-damaging stress, including UV radiation, γ-radiation, and exposure to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, mammalian cells can prevent cell cycle progression by controlling critical cell cycle regulators. The main role of GADDs is to block proliferation at G1 and G2 checkpoints in response to DNA damage. The GADD genes are up-regulated in response to a variety of stressors (21Fornace Jr., A.J. Jackman J. Hollander M.C. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The G2/M transition is a crucial point for progression through the cell cycle and is controlled by the Cdc2 kinase-cyclin B complex. We also showed that the circadian mRNA expression of Wee1 (this kinase inhibits mitotic cell division by inactivating the M phase-promoting factor) was extremely reduced in the liver of Clock mutant mice, and the mRNA levels were continuously high in Cry-deficient mice (Fig. 1). A recent study has shown that mPER2 protein is involved in tumor suppression by regulating DNA damage-responsive pathways (22Fu L. Pelicano H. Liu J. Huang P. Lee C. Cell. 2002; 111: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Growth control and the DNA damage response may be affected by Clock mutation because the circadian expression of mPer2 mRNA is regulated by the CLOCK protein (14Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In fact, some aged-Clock mutant mice developed salivary gland hyperplasia like mPer2 mutant mice (data not shown). Considering the current data and reported findings (22Fu L. Pelicano H. Liu J. Huang P. Lee C. Cell. 2002; 111: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), mammalian cell cycle-regulating mechanisms appear to be regulated by the circadian clock at the molecular level. The circadian expression of molecular chaperones such as Hsp105 and mDj7 was depressed in Clock mutant mice (Fig. 1). Many heat-shock genes are expressed in a circadian manner both in the SCN and in the liver (7Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I. Schook A.B. Straume M. Schultz P.G. Kay S.A. Takahashi J.S.

Wong W.H. Weitz C.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The decreased expression of these chaperones in Clock mutant mice suggests an altered response to external stress. Ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated protein degradation are involved in the core mechanism of the circadian oscillator (23Yagita K. Tamanini F. Yasuda M. Hoeijmakers J.H. van der Horst G.T. Okamura H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The present study found that the circadian expression of ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (Usp2) and Rad23 mRNAs was regulated in a CLOCK-dependent manner in the mouse liver (Figs. 1 and 3). Rad23 contains a ubiquitin-like domain and translocates ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome (10Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Usp2 has shown to be expressed in a circadian manner in the mouse liver but not in the SCN (7Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I. Schook A.B. Straume M. Schultz P.G. Kay S.A. Takahashi J.S. Hogenesch J.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 307-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Its expression is reduced significantly in the liver of Clock mutants (7Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I. Schook A.B. Straume M. Schultz P.G. Kay S.A. Takahashi J.S. Hogenesch J.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 307-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). In this study, however, reverse transcription-PCR analysis and in situ hybridization showed that Usp2 mRNA is expressed in a circadian manner in the SCN (Fig. 4) as well as in the liver (Fig. 3) and that the expression levels were damped in Clock mutant mice. Most of the cyclic transcripts are tissue-specific, and only a few genes are rhythmically expressed in both the SCN and in the liver (7Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I. Schook A.B. Straume M.

https://openalex.org/W2139514626,"Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, which justifies the increasing interest in mapping the different components of these organelles. Here we have focused our study on the identification of proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM). This membrane is of particular interest because, besides the well known components of the respiratory chain complexes, it contains several ion channels and many carrier proteins that certainly play a key role in mitochondrial function and, therefore, deserve to be identified at the molecular level. To achieve this goal we have used a novel approach combining the use of highly purified mouse liver mitochondrial inner membranes, extraction of membrane proteins with organic acid, and two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This procedure allowed us to identify 182 proteins that are involved in several biochemical processes, such as the electron transport machinery, the protein import machinery, protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, and ion or substrate transport. The full range of isoelectric point (3.9–12.5), molecular mass (6–527 kDa), and hydrophobicity values (up to 16 transmembrane predicted domains) were represented. In addition, of the 182 proteins found, 20 were unknown or had never previously been associated with the MIM. Overexpression of some of these proteins in mammalian cells confirmed their mitochondrial localization and resulted in severe remodeling of the mitochondrial network.

This study provides the first proteome of the MIM and provides a basis for a more detailed study of the newly characterized proteins of this membrane. Mitochondria are eukaryotic organelles that play a crucial role in several cellular processes, including energy production, β-oxidation of fatty acids, the urea cycle, and programmed cell death. These complex organelles are composed of an outer and inner membrane defining an intermembrane space in which key regulators of apoptosis have recently been localized (1Parone P.A. James D. Martinou J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and a matrix where the mitochondrial genome is confined. In mammals, the mitochondrial genome is about 16,500 base pairs long and encodes the 12 and 16 S rRNA, 22 tRNAs, and 13 polypeptide genes, all of which encode essential components of the respiratory chain. The low complexity of the mitochondrial genome indicates that the vast majority of the mitochondrial proteins (estimated to be 1,000) (2Lopez M.F. Kristal B.S. Chernokalskaya E. Lazarev A. Shestopalov A.I. Bogdanova A. Robinson M. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3427-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) are encoded by the nuclear genome. The mitochondrial inner membrane is of particular interest because it contains proteins of the respiratory chain as well as many carrier proteins and ion channels that certainly play a key role in mitochondrial function and cell homeostasis. Over the past few years, a number of approaches, such as two-dimensional PAGE and more recently one-dimensional PAGE, have allowed partial characterization of the proteome of entire mitochondria from various species (3Rabilloud T. Kieffer S. Procaccio V. Louwagie M. Courchesne P.L. Patterson S.D. Martinez P. Garin J. Lunardi J. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 4Fountoulakis M.

Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar). However, our knowledge of the protein composition of the mitochondrial inner membrane is still largely incomplete. Because such information would be invaluable for our understanding of the mitochondrial function, we have mapped the proteome of this membrane. Until recently, the identification of new mitochondrial proteins mostly involved solubilization of entire cells or isolated mitochondria followed by two-dimensional gel analysis. However, the two-dimensional gel approach suffers from several major drawbacks. For example, many membrane proteins cannot be identified because of precipitation in the first dimension. Similarly, highly basic proteins are difficult to focus in the first dimension and thus are underrepresented in two-dimensional gel maps. Furthermore, low molecular mass proteins cannot be readily detected using this approach. Recently, a new method based on a two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC) 1The abbreviations used are: LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; pI, isoelectric point; HA, hemagglutinin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FLAG, flu antigen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MIM, mitochondrial inner membrane; SLP, stomatin-like protein. coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used for the analysis of the yeast proteome (7Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). Using this method, Washburn et al. (7Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar) identified 1,484 proteins, of which 131 harbor three or more predicted transmembrane domains. Therefore, two-dimensional LC/MS/MS can be successfully used to identify transmembrane proteins. In this study we have used a similar approach to map the proteome of the mitochondrial inner membrane from mouse liver (Scheme 1) and identified 182 proteins, of which 20 are to date uncharacterized. Isolation and Purification of Mitochondria—Four female mice were killed by exposure to CO2. Livers were excised and rinsed twice with ice-cold MB buffer (Mannitol 210 mm, Sucrose 70 mm, Hepes 10 mm, EDTA 1 mm, pH 7.5). The washed livers were finely minced and hand-homogenized in 60 ml of MB buffer using a glass homogenizer. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The 2,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged twice at 11,700 × g for 10 min. The mitochondria-enriched pellet was gently homogenized in 50 ml of MB buffer in order to be purified on a discontinuous Nycodenz (Sigma) gradient (8Stromhaug P.E. Berg T.O. Fengsrud M. Seglen P.O. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This gradient was prepared by carefully layering stepwise 10 ml of 22.5% and 17 ml of 9.5% Nycodenz solution in centrifuge tubes (35 ml). The 22.5 and 9.5% Nycodenz solutions were diluted in MB buffer from a stock of 36% Nycodenz in MB buffer. Crude mitochondrial fractions (8 ml) were layered on top of the discontinuous Nycodenz gradient and centrifuged at 141,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet obtained was resuspended in 20 ml of MB buffer and further centrifuged twice at 11,700 × g for 5 min before further purification on a continuous Nycodenz gradient. This gradient was prepared by carefully layering 30 ml of a 33% MB Nycodenz solution over 5 ml of a 36% MB Nycodenz solution. The mitochondrial pellet obtained after the discontinuous Nycodenz gradient was resuspended in 6 ml, loaded on six continuous gradients, and centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The major band at the interface of the 36 and 33% Nycodenz solutions was collected, diluted in 3 volumes of MB buffer, and centrifuged twice at 11,700 × g for 10 min. The pellet obtained was resuspended in 2 ml of MB buffer, and the protein concentration was assessed using a BioRad Bradford assay. Purification of Mitochondrial Inner Membrane (MIM)—Mitochondria were re-suspended in H2O at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and stirred for 20 min on ice. The mixture was homogenized 20 times with a glass homogenizer and centrifuged twice at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The mitoplasts obtained were treated with Na2CO3 0.1 m, pH 11.5, at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 20 min on ice. The mitochondrial inner membrane was pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Solubilization and Digestion of MIM—500 μg of MIM were solubilized in 100 μl of 90% formic acid. After adjusting the pH to 8.5 with ammonium carbonate, the sample was sequentially treated with 8 m urea, reduced by adding dithiothreitol (1 mm), and carboxyamidomethylated in 10 mm iodoacetamide. The solution was diluted to 2 m urea with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and finally digested with trypsin (1/20) for 24 h. The tryptic digest was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. A solid phase extraction with SPEC-PLUS C18 columns (Ansys) was carried out to concentrate the supernatant and buffer exchange the mixtures into acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid. The sample was then dried. Strong Cation Exchange—500 μg of peptide digest was loaded onto a strong cation exchange Polysulfoethyl A column (2.1 mm × 20 cm) (PolyLC Inc.) 0.2 ml/min. The peptides were eluted on a salt step gradient: 0, 30, 50, 70, and 100% B. Mobile phase buffers were A (10 mm KH2PO4, 25% acetonitrile) and B (10 mm KH2PO4, 25% acetonitrile, 500 mm KCl). 23 fractions were collected and concentrated using SPEC PLUS C18 columns as described above. Electrospray LC/MS/MS—Each fraction was further analyzed by LC/MS/MS. All data were acquired using a Q-Tof Ultima mass spectrometer, hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer, fitted with a nanoflow electrospray source, coupled on line with an analytical CapLC system (Waters, Manchester, UK). The HPLC was configured with a preconcentration column to allow large volume sample injection and a nanoscale column and a nanobore column. The trapping column was packed with 5 μm Symmetry C18 stationary phase (300 μm inner diameter × 5 mm), whereas the analytical column was a 150-mm × 75-μm column packed with PepMap C18 material. The reverse phase column was eluted into the mass spectrometer with a linear gradient from 5 to 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid at 200 nanoliters/min. Analysis of MS/MS data—To analyze the 21,000 spectra in a semi-automated fashion, a set of tools has been developed around the Mascot program (9Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). The approach was to incorporate rules derived from a set of manually curated MS/MS spectra in the Mascot search and to use this set of spectra to train our algorithm similarly to Keller's SEQUEST approach (10Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Receiver-to-operator plots were used to define ranges of accuracy and coverage. Using the training data set without these rules, only ∼40% of the training spectra were assigned. However, using these rules ∼80–85% of the training's spectra were correctly interpreted. Still, 15–25% of the MS/MS spectra were either unidentified or incorrectly assigned, mainly because of very low signal to noise ratio, chemical noise, and peptide mixtures. The final assessment of each protein identified was performed manually. DNA Cloning—All the constructs in this study were generated by standard PCR cloning procedures using either a mouse liver Marathonready cDNA library (Clontech) or human colon, follicular dendritic, and myeloma cDNA libraries (generously provided by Dr. Garry Buell, Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute). The amplified sequences were N- or C-terminal-fused to FLAG (DYKDDDDK) or HA (YPYDVPDYA) tags by PCR and cloned into the pCI mammalian expression vector (Promega). All the constructs were sequenced to verify the fidelity of the cDNA sequences obtained. Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips in 12-well plates (Nunc) at a density of 0.5 × 105 per well. 12–16 h after plating, the cells were transfected with the relevant constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized in 0.1% saponin/PBS for 15 min at RT, and blocked for 1 h in 0.1% saponin/PBS with 5% goat serum. The coverslips were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies in 0.1% saponin/PBS with 5% goat serum: polyclonal anti-FLAG (DYKDDDDK) (1:1000; Sigma), monoclonal anti-HA (YPYDVPDYA) (1:100; Babco), and monoclonal anti-mitochondrial HSP70 (1:50; BIOSOURCE). The cells were washed three times in 0.1% saponin/PBS with 5% goat serum, and the immune complexes were revealed by incubating the coverslips with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse (1:100; Vectorlabs) or FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:100; Vectorlabs) and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse (1:100; Vectorlabs) secondary antibodies. Finally, the cells were washed three times in 0.1% saponin/PBS and mounted using Vectashield H-100 fluorescent mounting medium (Vectorlabs). Transfected cells were viewed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135TV; Zeiss) with a ×100 objective, and images were captured using a CCD camera (photometric CE200A) with IP Lab software. The resulting images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6. Cell Viability Assay—HeLa cells were transfected as above with 0.5 μg of target DNA together with 0.5 μg of pCI-Luc, in the absence or in the presence of zVAD (50 μm). All transfections were performed in duplicate. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed once in PBS and lysed in 300 μl of luciferase assay buffer (Promega) for 20 min at room temperature. 10 μl of the extract was mixed with 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent II (Promega) and immediately measured using a Turner TD-20e luminometer. Morphology Studies—HeLa cells were plated on glass-bottom dishes (Mattek) at a density of 1.5 × 105 per well. 12–16 h after plating, the cells were transfected as above. Cells were co-transfected with the relevant constructs and a mitochondrially localized YFP fusion protein (Clontech) using the same method as above. Fluorescent cells were visualized as above. Purification of the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane—Mitochondria from mouse liver have been purified on a Nycodenz gradient, and mitoplasts were obtained following mechanical disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane. An alkali treatment of the mitoplasts resulted in highly enriched MIM. The goal of the alkali treatment was to eliminate peripherally associated membrane proteins and proteins from the matrix. The mitochondrial and MIM purifications were assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against bona fide markers of the different mitochondrial compartments (matrix, mHsp70; mitochondrial outer membrane, Bcl-XL; inner mitochondrial membrane, COX IV, Prohibitin, ANT). Enrichment of the MIM was monitored by the increase in the ratio of levels of the MIM markers/mg of protein. The purest MIM preparations obtained had a ratio of Prohibitin/mg of protein between 10–20-fold higher than that of purified intact mitochondria (Fig. 1A and data not shown). A similar enrichment was obtained with ANT and COXIV (Fig. 1B). Neither catalase nor calnexin were detected in the MIM fraction, indicating that the contamination of the mitochondrial preparation by peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum was negligible (Fig. 1A). Identification of Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Proteins—In general, membrane-inserted proteins display one or several transmembrane domains separated by extramembrane loops of variable lengths. In many cases positively charged amino acids such as lysines and arginines are found at the junction between the transmembrane segments and the loops (11Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and represent potential trypsin digestion sites. To generate as many peptides as possible from membrane-inserted proteins and thereby maximize the chances of their identification by MS, the MIMs were solubilized with formic acid to allow access of transmembrane segments to trypsin as well as to the extramembrane loops, as previously described (7Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). To reduce the complexity of the sample, the peptides resulting from the above treatment were separated on a strong cation exchange (SCX) column. Each fraction collected from the SCX column was then analyzed by nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to LC/MS/MS. 21,000 MS/MS spectra were obtained, and a first analysis was performed using Mascot. Because of the large amount of data generated, it was necessary to develop a software tool to automate the analysis of the spectra (see “Experimental Procedures”). The list of proteins presented in Supplementary Table I was obtained using this software and confirmed by manual analysis. In total, 182 proteins were identified, of which 45% harbor 2–16 transmembrane domains (as predicted using TMpred), indicating that the procedure used is appropriate to identify membrane-inserted proteins. A few proteins (19%) do not display a transmembrane domain and are therefore unlikely to be inserted in the membrane. These proteins are probably peripherally attached to the membrane and were resistant to the alkali treatment. Our approach allowed the characterization of proteins with a wide pI range (3.9–12.5); in fact, 50% of the proteins analyzed display a pI over 9 or below 4. It also allowed the identification of 11 proteins with a mass lower than 10 kDa and 8 larger than 100 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 1). The number of peptides leading to the identification of each protein varied from one, for proteins of low abundance, to several hundred for abundant proteins. For example, 840 peptides were found for ANT and 504 for F1F0ATPase, which is consistent with these two proteins being the most abundant proteins of the MIM (25Taylor S.W. Warnock D.E. Glenn G.M. Zhang B. Fahy E. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 5: 451-458Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, in addition to the abundance criteria, the number of tryptic peptides generated for a given protein may be modulated by factors such as the size, the amino acid composition, and the accessibility to trypsin. Therefore, the number of peptides contributing to the identification of a protein can only be taken as a semi-quantitative measure of its abundance in the sample. 3.5% of the proteins listed in Supplementary Table I are known to reside outside of mitochondria. These proteins could either be minor contaminants or could have a mitochondrial residence so far ignored. In addition, the MIM preparation appeared to be slightly (5%) contaminated by proteins known to localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane, including voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. These proteins are known to be present at contact sites between the inner and the outer mitochondrial membranes (12Crompton M. Barksby E. Johnson N. Capano M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Hoppel C. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Tandler B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Their presence indicates that segments of the outer mitochondrial membrane forming these contact sites were purified with the MIM. In addition, a number of mitochondrial matrix proteins (14% of the total number of proteins identified), such as the carbamoyl phosphate synthase or the malate dehydrogenase, were found in their precursor form. This suggests the N-terminal targeting signals of these proteins had not yet been processed by the mitochondrial matrix peptidase and thus might not have yet been released from the translocase of outer membrane (TOM)/translocase of inner membrane (TIM) protein translocation complex. Alternatively, these matrix proteins that display a putative transmembrane domain could actually be integral membrane proteins of the inner membrane that have substantial domains on the matrix side of the membrane. In summary, the approach used in this study successfully led to the identification of proteins with widely varied molecular mass ranges, pI values, and hydrophobicities. Moreover, the list in Supplementary Table I shows that there are representative proteins for most, if not all, of the known functions of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Novel Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Proteins—Of a total of 182 proteins identified in this study, 15 are unknown and 5 had previously been described but had never been localized to the mitochondria (Table I). To determine whether these uncharacterized proteins are truly associated with the mitochondria, several software programs designed to predict subcellular localization were used (MITOPROT, Predotar). However, the results of these predictions were often divergent, depending on which software was used. Therefore, some of the uncharacterized proteins were fused to HA or FLAG epitope tags and their subcellular localization was assessed after overexpression in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2, all fusion proteins showed a punctate or filamentous pattern after immunostaining with an anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. In each case the anti-HA or anti-FLAG staining co-localized with the mitochondrial network visualized by co-expression with a mitochondrially targeted YFP fusion protein or by co-immunostaining with an antibody against the mitochondrial form of Hsp70.Table IUncharacterized proteinsEnsembl nameaAccession number in Ensembl mouse genome.TM segmentsbNumber of transmembrane segments predicted by TMpred.NB peptidescNumber of peptides identified by LC/MS/MS.Swiss-ProtdAccession number in Swiss-Prot.Protein nameENSMUS P00000035804189Q9CW42Unknown (39270 Da), (pI = 7.82)ENSMUS P00000027930149Q922Q1Unknown (protein for MGC:6272) (38194 Da), (pI = 9.39)ENSMUS P00000024330125Q9ER48Up-regulated during skeletal muscle growth 5 (6381 Da), (pI = 10.32)ENSMUS P00000030903119Q925I1TOB3 (66742 Da), (pI = 9.32)ENSMUS P00000049338018O55125NIPSNAP1 protein (33363 Da), (pI = 9.85)ENSMUS P00000005431117Q9Z2I0Leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1 (82988 Da), (pI = 6.47)ENSMUS P00000030169017Q9DCG8Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2) (38385 Da), (pI = 9.25)ENSMUS P0000002307118Q9Y512Protein CGI (51905 Da), (pI = 8.555)ENSMUS P0000003177607Q9D9P1RIKEN CDNA L09 (26334 Da), (pI = 8.57)ENSMUS P0000002659937Q9CZB49430083G14Rik Protein (29260 Da), (pI = 9.8)ENSMUS P0000004565425Q9JLG5Brain protein 44-like protein (18258 Da), (pI = 10.02)ENSMUS P00000032634163O88473HERC2 protein (527369 Da), (pI = 6.02)ENSMUS P0000002768302Q91Z67GAP2 (45597 Da), (pI = 5.35)ENSMUS P0000004246941Q9JIZ0Putative N-acetyl transferase camello1 (25010 Da), (pI = 9.61)ENSMUS P0000002879311Q96TC7Unknown (30967 Da), (pI = 8.48)ENSMUS P0000001891331Q9D8W31810027O10Rik protein (11655 Da), (pI = 9.19)ENSMUS P0000003103921Q9D8W71810027120Rik protein (16925 Da), (pI = 9.95)ENSMUS P0000002497301Q9JJB2Ambiguous (25172 Da), (pI = 7.8)ENSMUS P0000004302831BAC35287Hypothetical DNAJ N-terminal domain containing protein (63336 Da), (pI = 8.03)ENSMUS P0000000240331Q9D1481110029G07Rik protein (34005 Da), (pI = 8.46)a Accession number in Ensembl mouse genome.b Number of transmembrane segments predicted by TMpred.c Number of peptides identified by LC/MS/MS.d Accession number in Swiss-Prot. Open table in a new tab During the course of these experiments, it was observed that overexpression of some of these proteins was followed by a drop in the number of healthy transfected cells. To quantify the toxic effects of the expression of some of these proteins, HeLa cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct and the activity of luciferase, 48 h after transfection, was taken as an index for cell viability (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3, expression of all the fusion proteins, except for the HA-tagged stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2), resulted in a distinct drop in luciferase activity as compared with the vector alone, suggesting that overexpression of these proteins was toxic for these cells. To test whether apoptosis was induced by overexpression of these proteins, zVAD, a pan-caspase peptide inhibitor, was added to the culture medium following transfection of the different constructs. Addition of zVAD resulted in a significant increase in luciferase activity, suggesting that overexpressionoftheseproteins(exceptSLP-2·HA)inducesacaspase-dependent apoptosis. As shown in Table I, the majority of 20 uncharacterized proteins display one or more transmembrane domains, their molecular mass ranges from 6 to 527 kDa, and some appeared to be abundant (89 and 49 peptides were obtained for Q9CW42 and Q922Q1, respectively). Q922Q1 cDNA, encoding one of these abundant novel proteins, was cloned in a mammalian expression vector fused to a FLAG tag. This protein harbors a MOSC sequence predicted to be a sulfur-carrier domain that delivers sulfur for the formation of diverse sulfur-metal clusters (14Anantharaman V. Aravind L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 207: 55-61PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, upon overexpression in HeLa cells, the FLAG·Q922Q1 fusion protein co-localized with mitochondrial Hsp70, thus confirming its association with the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, overexpression of FLAG·Q922Q1 induced the collapse of the mitochondrial tubular network and its aggregation around the nucleus. Among the uncharacterized proteins listed in Table I, Q925I1 (also called TOB3) was examined in more detail. TOB3 displays a single predicted transmembrane segment and an AAA-ATPase domain that can also be found in other mitochondrial inner membrane proteases such as AFG3L (15Kremmidiotis G. Gardner A.E. Settasatian C. Savoia A. Sutherland G.R. Callen D.F. Genomics. 2001; 76: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which was also identified in our study. When the localization of TOB3 fused to a FLAG tag was assessed using the same approach as presented above, it was found to be clearly mitochondrial (Fig. 2). In addition, prolonged expression of the FLAG·TOB3 protein resulted in fragmentation of the mitochondrial network (Fig. 4) and cell death as mentioned above (Fig. 3). Interestingly, sequence analysis shows that the closest homologue of TOB3 in yeast is YME1, a mitochondrial I-AAA protease (Table II). YME1 plays an essential role in the degradation of unassembled or misassembled subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (16Weber E.R. Hanekamp T. Thorsness P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). YME1 gene disruption led to several dysfunctions, including a reduced activity of the respiration chain complexes, slow growth, and lethality when the mutation is expressed in a ρ– mitochondrial background (17Thorsness P.E. White K.H. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inactivation of the homologue of TOB3 in Caenorhabditis elegans is lethal (Table II) (18Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S. Sohrmann M. Welchman D.P. Zipperlen P. Ahringer J. Nature. 2003; 421: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar). Conversely, the data presented in Fig. 3 indicate that the overexpression of TOB3 in mammalian cells led to a drop in cell survival. Thus, it seems that either the lack or the excess of TOB3 at the mitochondria might upset the homeostasis of this organelle and thus lead to cell death.Table IIFeatures and interspecies homology of the uncharacterized proteinsSwiss-ProtaAccession number Swiss-Prot.Functional DomainbPfscan profiles.C. elegans cWormBase.YeastdSaccaromyces genome database.HomologyKnockdownHomologyKnockoutQ9CW42MOSCF56a 11.5 (36%)RNAi: WTQ922Q1MOSCF56a 11.5 (37%)RNAi: WTQ9ER48Q925I1AAA-ATPaseF54B3.3 (49%)Larval arrestYME1 (28%)ViableO55125O61223 (40%)(FRAGMENT)Q9Z2I0Calcium EF-hand domainF58G11.1A (32%)RNAi: WTY0L027c (34%)ViableQ9DCG8StomatinF30a 10.5 (69%)RNAi: WTQ9Y512Bacterial surface antigenC34E10.1 (33%)Lethal (Embryo)YNL026w (32%)LethalQ9D9P1NitroreductaseM176.3 (27%)LethalQ9CZB4K02F3.10 (32%RNAi: WTQ9JLG5R07E5.13 (62%)RNAi: WTYGL080w (57%)O88473Zn-finger; Guanine nucleotide exchange factorQ91Z67RhoGAPF12F6.5 (45%)RNAi: WTBAG7 (25%)ViableQ9JIZ0N-acyltransferaseQ96TC7F33H2.6 (27%)Postembryonic defectQ9D8W3Integral membrane proteinY106G6H.8 (38%)RNAi: WTQ9D8W7Q9JJB2FAA-hydrolaseZK688.3 (46%)RNAi: WTYNL168c (35%)ViableBAC35287DNA JF11G11.7 (27%)YLR090w (44%)ViableQ9D148ADH shortY32H12A.3 (47%)RNAi: WTYIR036c (31%)a Accession number Swiss-Prot.b Pfscan profiles.c WormBase.d Saccaromyces genome database. Open table in a new tab Another uncharacterized protein, Q99JB2 or SLP-2, was investigated further. No transmembrane domain is predicted for this protein. To confirm that SLP-2 was not a cytoplasmic contaminant of our MIM preparation, the protein fused to an HA tag was ectopically expressed in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2, SLP-2·HA co-localizes with mitochondrially targeted YFP fusion protein. Our results are also supported by a recent study (6Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M. Warnock D.E. Wiley S. Murphy A.N. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar) of the human mitochondrial proteome showing that SLP-2 is a mitochondrial protein. However, Wang and Morrow (19Wang Y. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have presented data suggesting that SLP-2 is localized in the plasma membrane of mature human erythrocytes. We speculate that this protein could reside both in the plasma membrane and in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Another example of a mitochondrial inner membrane protein found in the plasma membrane is β-chain ATP synthase (20Martinez L.O. Jacquet S. Esteve J.P. Rolland C. Cabezon E. Champagne E. Pineau T. Georgeaud V. Walker J.E. Terce F. Collet X. Perret B. Barbaras R. Nature. 2003; 421: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis shows that SLP-2 has a cognate stomatin signature but lacks the N-terminal hydrophobic domain that is commonly found in the stomatin gene family. Stomatins are integral membrane proteins that play a major role in the regulation of ion channels by interacting with proteins of the cytoskeleton. In C. elegans, a stomatin homologue (MEC-2) is required for sensory mechanoreception and the gating of an oligomeric sodium channel (21Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G. Chelur D.S. O'Hagan R. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). UNC-24, a protein most similar to a human stomatin homologue (SLP-1), is also required for locomotor response to volatile anesthetics in C. elegans (22Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, SLP-2 might be involved in regulating ion channels of the MIM and could represent an interesting tool to identify these ion channels. Using a preparation of highly purified MIM, we have identified 20 unknown mitochondrial proteins. Although our approach represents major progress compared with previous studies, the proteome of the mitochondrial inner membrane is still incomplete because our studies did not allow identification of ion channels such as calcium or ATP-dependent potassium channels that are supposed to be present in this membrane (23Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Schindler P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 24Xu W. Liu Y. Wang S. McDonald T. Van Eyk J.E. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Science. 2002; 298: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, novel proteins have been identified, the function of which may be crucial for mitochondrial function and mammalian cell homeostasis as predicted by the severe phenotypes resulting from mutations of their homologues in yeast and in C. elegans. Our discovery that these genes encode mitochondrial inner membrane proteins is a first step toward a better understanding of the mechanism of action of these crucial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2047615974,"Large amounts of dust (>10(8)M(o)) have recently been discovered in high-redshift quasars and galaxies corresponding to a time when the Universe was less than one-tenth of its present age. The stellar winds produced by stars in the late stages of their evolution (on the asymptotic giant branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) are thought to be the main source of dust in galaxies, but they cannot produce that dust on a short enough timescale (&<1 Gyr) to explain the results in the high-redshift galaxies. Supernova explosions of massive stars (type II) are also a potential source, with models predicting 0.2-4M(o) of dust. As massive stars evolve rapidly, on timescales of a few Myr, these supernovae could be responsible for the high-redshift dust. Observations of supernova remnants in the Milky Way, however, have hitherto revealed only 10(-7)-10(-3)M(o) each, which is insufficient to explain the high-redshift data. Here we report the detection of approximately 2-4M(o) of cold dust in the youngest known Galactic supernova remnant, Cassiopeia A. This observation implies that supernovae are at least as important as stellar winds in producing dust in our Galaxy and would have been the dominant source of dust at high redshifts."

IKKα and IKKβ are serine/threonine protein kinases, whereas NEMO contains several protein interaction motifs but no apparent catalytic domains. Subunit reconstitution experiments in yeast and mammalian cells suggest that IKK is composed of a NEMO homodimer bound together with either an IKKα/IKKβ heterodimer or an IKKβ homodimer (18Miller B.S.

IKKβ phosphorylates IκB and is critical for IKK and NF-κB activation in response to proinflammatory stimuli (19Tanaka M. Fuentes M.E. Yamaguchi K. Durnin M.H. Dalrymple S.A. Hardy K.L. Goeddel D.V.

In contrast, IKKα phosphorylates the NF-κB2/p100 precursor and stimulates its processing in a fashion that is independent of the IKK complex (22Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G.

The biochemical mechanisms underlying the activation of IKK in response to proinflammatory stimuli are not well understood. Although it is known that phosphorylation of Ser179 and Ser181 in the activation loop of IKKβ is required and may be sufficient for IKK activation by proinflammatory stimuli (12Mercurio F. Zhu H.

It was subsequently also isolated by biochemical purification of the IKK complex and microsequencing (14Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A.

A subset of patients with HED-ID carry mutations in the predicted zinc finger domain of NEMO and the integrity of this domain has been shown to be important for full IKK activation in response to TNF-α in murine embryonic fibroblasts (32Makris C. Roberts J.L. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6573-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although it is known that NEMO is required for the formation of a high molecular weight IKK complex (16Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), the exact role of NEMO in IKK activation remains unclear. Because NEMO has been found to interact with a variety of signaling molecules, it has been proposed that NEMO may link upstream activators to the IKK complex (7Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).In this report, we identify a role for the NEMO zinc finger in NEMO ubiquitination. We find that NEMO is ubiquitinated in response to TNF-α in a manner that does not appear to target it for degradation and that is dependent on an intact zinc finger. The inhibitor of apoptosis protein c-IAP1 mediates the ubiquitination of NEMO in response to TNF-α and functions as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate NEMO both in vitro and in vivo.In addition, NEMO proteins containing mutations in the zinc finger show impaired ubiquitination both by c-IAP1 and in response to TNF-α. These mutants also demonstrate impaired abilities to rescue TNF-α-induced IKK activation in a NEMO-deficient cell line. Our results suggest that NEMO ubiquitination mediated by c-IAP1 is essential for the proper activation of the IKK signalsome complex by TNF-α.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—HEK 293T and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Jurkat cells and the NEMO mutant JM4.5.2 cell line (gift of S.-C. Sun) were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were grown in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Transfections of 293T and HeLa cells were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections of the JM4.5.2 cell line was performed using DEAE-dextran.Plasmids—The human NEMO cDNA was PCR amplified from an IMAGE Consortium expressed sequence tag clone (number 41072) and inserted into pcDNA3-HA. The ΔZF (codons 1–392) and C417R (Cys417 mutated to Arg) NEMO mutants were created using standard PCR procedures. Human ubiquitin (Ub) cDNA were PCR amplified from a human lymphocyte/leukocyte cDNA library (Clonetech) and subcloned into pcDNA3-FLAG and pcDNA3-AU1. The Ub 7R, K48R, and G76A mutants were created by standard PCR procedures. c-IAP1 and XIAP cDNAs were PCR amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3-FLAG and pcDNA3-Myc vectors. The Δ121 (codons 122–618), Δ321 (codons 322–618), 1–396 (codons 1–396), ΔRING (codons 1 to 570), C605A (Cys605 mutated to Ala), and RING (codons 562–618) c-IAP1 mutants were constructed using standard PCR procedures. Mutations were verfied by automated DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core).Immunoprecipitations—For the visualization of endogenous modified NEMO protein, HeLa cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm N-ethylmaleimide) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated with NEMO antibody and protein G-Sepharose, and immunoprecipitates were washed four times with IP lysis buffer and once with IP lysis buffer supplemented with 3 m urea. All immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with Ub or NEMO antibodies. To minimize the detection of the IgG heavy chain, protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as a secondary antibody for anti-NEMO immunoblots.For coimmunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed in EBC150 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and with protein G-Sepharose for 1 additional h. All immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel.RNA Interference (RNAi) Knockdown Experiments—For the knockdown of c-IAP1 expression, we employed a strategy similar to that described previously (33Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide corresponding to a hairpin short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting a unique 19-bp c-IAP1 mRNA sequence (GGAAAUGCUGCGGCCAACA) was subcloned into pTKO, a vector that directs the expression of siRNAs driven by the H1 RNA promoter and contains a puromycin selection marker. 2E. D. Tang and K.-L. Guan, manuscript in preparation. One day following transfection of 293T cells with pTKO plasmids, transfected cells were selected for by incubation in media containing puromycin (3 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 72 h. Whole cell lysates were subsequently prepared for immunoblot or immunoprecipitation analysis.Ub Conjugation Assays—Ubiquitination reactions were performed in 20-μl reactions containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm DTT. Where necessary, rabbit E1 (Boston Biochemical) (40 ng), bovine Ub (Sigma) or His6-tagged Ub (1 μg), His6-UbcH5C, or related E2 (0.2 μg), GST-c-IAP1 (0.2 μg), and MBP-NEMO (0.1 μg), and mutant variants were included. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with MBP antibody. AU1-tagged wild-type and mutant Ub cDNAs were cloned into pET3E-His. Wild-type and mutant NEMO coding sequences were cloned into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) for expression as MBP fusion proteins. c-IAP1 wild-type and mutant cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-KG for expression as GST fusion proteins. GST fusion, MBP fusion, and His6-tagged proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)RIL (Stratagene), which harbors a helper plasmid that encodes the AGA-specific ArgU tRNA. His-tagged UbcH3, UbcH6, UbcH10, UbcH13, and UbcH7 were purchased from Boston Biochemical.Retroviral Infections—JM4.5.2 cells stably expressing NEMO proteins were created by retroviral infections. HA-tagged wild-type and mutant (C417R) NEMO cDNAs were PCR amplified and subcloned into the retroviral expression vector pPGS-CMV-CITE-neo (gift of G. Nabel). Amphotropic Phoenix packaging cells (gift of G. Nolan) in 6-well plates were transfected with 2 μg of retroviral expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). 48 h following transfection, the viral supernatants were supplemented with polybrene (9 mg/ml) and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Viral supernatants were incubated with 1 × 106 JM4.5.2 cells and spun at 1800 rpm for 45 min at room temperature. Infected cells were resuspended in regular growth medium containing 1 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and stably infected cells were selected for 1 week.Kinase Assays—To measure IKK activity, cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT), and anti-NEMO immunoprecipitates were incubated in 20-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg GST-IκBα (1–54), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and exposed to x-ray film. GST-IκBα-(1–54) was purified from DH5α bacteria transformed with pGEX-IκBα-(1–54) (gift of M. Karin).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONUbiquitination of NEMO in Cells—An earlier report (34Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) described the purification of a multiprotein IκBα kinase complex that could be activated in vitro by a ubiquitination event. One possibility is that ubiquitination of IKK may regulate its activity. To investigate whether IKK may be ubiquitinated during the course of its activation by TNF-α, we immunoprecipitated individual IKK subunits from HeLa cells following stimulation for various time periods. Interestingly, TNF-α treatment induced the accumulation of a ladder of slower migrating forms of NEMO (Fig. 1A). These modifications on NEMO paralleled the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. On the other hand, we failed to detect similar modification of IKKα or IKKβ under the same conditions (data not shown). Immunoblotting using an Ub antibody suggested that TNF-α stimulated the modification of NEMO by different numbers of Ub molecules (Fig. 1B). NEMO-Ub conjugates were also detected in transient transfection experiments using 293T cells in which both epitope-tagged Ub and NEMO were expressed (Fig. 1C). An “inactive” Ub mutant that contained a substitution of Ala for the terminal Gly residue (G76A) (35Pickart C.M. Kasperek E.M. Beal R. Kim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7115-7123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was unable to support NEMO ubiquitination.Because the experiments described above were performed in the absence of proteasome inhibitor, the NEMO-Ub conjugates seen in vivo were apparently not targets for immediate destruction by the proteasome. To examine this idea further, we compared NEMO-Ub conjugates with E2F-4-Ub conjugates, which are known to be targeted for degradation by the Ub-proteasome pathway (36Hateboer G. Kerkhoven R.M. Shvarts A. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2960-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As expected, E2F-4-Ub conjugates were detectable only when cells were incubated with a proteosome inhibitor (Fig. 1D). In contrast, NEMO-Ub conjugates were readily visible in the absence of proteasome inhibitor and were only slightly altered in the presence of proteasome inhibitor. Thus, the ubiquitination of NEMO may have primarily a regulatory role, rather than a role in protein stability.Ubiquitination of NEMO Is Dependent on Its Zinc Finger— All NEMO orthologs identified to date contain predicted zinc finger motifs at their extreme C termini (5Silverman N.

Recently, the zinc finger was reported to be partially required for IKK activation in response to TNF-α in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (32Makris C. Roberts J.L. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6573-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We found, however, that deletion of the zinc finger in NEMO did not affect its binding to IKKα, IKKβ, RIP, or A20 in coimmunprecipitation assays (data not shown). To test whether the zinc finger might be important for NEMO ubiquitination, we examined two NEMO mutants. One mutant contained a deletion of the last 27 residues comprising the predicted zinc finger (ΔZF), and another had a substitution of Arg for Cys417 (C417R) as seen in an HED-ID patient (29Doffinger R.

When wild-type and mutant NEMO proteins were coexpressed with Ub in cells, the ubiquitination of wild-type NEMO was enhanced by TNF-α, as seen with endogenous NEMO (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the ubiquitination of neither of the two zinc finger mutants was enhanced by TNF-α treatment. An intact zinc finger in NEMO therefore appears to be necessary for the stimulation of NEMO ubiquitination by TNF-α.Fig. 2An intact zinc finger in NEMO is required for ubiquitination in vivo. A, depicted is an alignment of the sequences of the predicted zinc fingers found in the C termini of NEMO orthologs from Homo sapiens (residues 393–419), Mus musculus (residues 386–412), Xenopus laevis, and Drosophila melanogaster (residues 359–387). The residues that are conserved in all species are in bold. The position of the predicted zinc-coordinating residues are indicated by the asterisks. The arrow indicates the position of Cys417 in human NEMO. The peptide sequence from X. laevis NEMO was derived from an expressed sequence tag sequence from a partial cDNA clone and ends with the predicted terminal residue. GenBank™ accession numbers for the sequences are 6685695 (H. sapiens), 6093481 (M. musculus), 15044130 (X. laevis), and 9937530 (D. melanogaster). B, HA-tagged wild-type and mutant NEMO proteins were coexpressed in 293T cells with FLAG-Ub as indicated. Transfected cells were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) prior to lysis.

https://openalex.org/W1978240770,"The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that is caused through mutations in either one of the two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and TSC2, that encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. Interaction of hamartin with tuberin forms a heterodimer that inhibits signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin to its downstream targets: eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). During mitogenic sufficiency, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway phosphorylates tuberin on Ser-939 and Thr-1462 that inhibits the tumor suppressor function of the TSC complex. Here we show that tuberin-hamartin heterodimers block protein kinase C (PKC)/MAPK- and phosphatidic acid-mediated signaling toward mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent targets. We also show that two TSC2 mutants derived from TSC patients are defective in repressing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. PKC/MAPK signaling leads to phosphorylation of tuberin at sites that overlap with and are distinct from Akt phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of tuberin by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was reduced by treatment of cells with either bisindolylmaleimide I or UO126, inhibitors of PKC and MAPK/MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase), respectively, but not by wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI3K). This work reveals that both PI3K-independent and -dependent mechanisms modulate tuberin phosphorylation in vivo.

The disorder affects about 1 million individuals worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of one in 6,000 newborns. Common symptoms include seizures, mental retardation, behavior problems, and skin abnormalities (for review see Ref. 1Cheadle J.P. Reeve M.P. Kwiakowski D.J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have mapped this disorder to the TSC1 and TSC2 genes that encode the protein products hamartin (∼130 kDa) and tuberin (∼200 kDa), respectively. Hamartin and tuberin negatively regulate cell growth and proliferation as a tuberin-hamartin heterodimer (2Green A.J. Smith M. Yates J.R. Nat.

Drosophila and mouse genetics show that mutations in TSC1 or TSC2/gigas result in increased cell size (an increase in cell mass/cell growth) and cellular proliferation (an increase in cell number) (4Ito N.

Genetic epistasis analysis in Drosophila places dTSC1/dTSC2 downstream of dPI3K and dAkt (also referred to as protein kinase B) but upstream of Drosophila ribosomal protein S6 kinase (dS6K) (6Potter C.J.

The loss of function or overexpression of several Drosophila genes recently linked the dPI3K and dTOR signaling pathways to the regulation of cell proliferation and cell growth (8Zhang H. Stallock J.P. Ng J.C. Reinhard C. Neufeld T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2712-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), important cellular processes that are inappropriately regulated during tumor formation. These include dPI3K, dAkt, dS6K, and d4E-BP (effectors of dPI3K), and dTOR. Collectively, this work suggested that dTOR and dTSC1/dTSC2 were connected via the PI3K signaling pathway. Recently, a surge of research from many labs revealed that TSC1/TSC2 functioned to inhibit nutrient- and PI3K-dependent signaling through mTOR (also called FRAP or RAFT), resulting in the inhibition of its downstream targets S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (9Manning B.D.

A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Although the majority of work supports this notion, the TSC1/TSC2 may also function in some circumstances to inhibit PI3K signaling to S6K1 independently of mTOR (see Ref. 13Jaeschke A. Hartkamp J.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E214-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is clear, however, through the use of different experimental approaches, that PI3K-dependent signaling serves to inhibit the tuberin-hamartin heterodimer through direct Akt-dependent phosphorylation of tuberin at Ser-939 and Thr-1462 (the major Akt phosphorylation sites) (9Manning B.D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the tuberin-hamartin heterodimer inhibits mTOR and that Akt can phosphorylate tuberin, thereby inactivating it. mTOR is regulated by mitogens, nutrients, and energy availability and is a critical upstream regulator of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (for reviews see Ref. 16Martin K.A. Blenis J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 86: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, induces rapid S6K1 and 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation. Regulation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by stimulation of two distinct signaling pathways, PI3K and MAPK, require an mTOR input, as rapamycin can potently inhibit the phosphorylation of these downstream effectors by both PI3K- and MAPK-regulated pathways (16Martin K.A.

Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 binds to the cap-binding protein eIF4E to inhibit cap-dependent translation (for review see Ref. 19Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar), which is reversed when 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated. The dissociation of hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP1 from eIF4E leads to the binding of eIF4G to eIF4E and the initiation of protein synthesis. It has been shown that both S6K1 and eIF4E/4E-BP1 effect mTOR-dependent control of mammalian cell size (20Fingar D.C. Salama S. Tsou C. Harlow E. Blenis J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1472-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The research summarized above, combined with the Drosophila genetic studies (8Zhang H. Stallock J.P. Ng J.C. Reinhard C. Neufeld T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2712-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), strongly imply that aberrantly high mTOR-dependent signaling to both S6K1 and eIF4E/4E-BP1 contributes to the expansion and size of TSC tumors. It has been known for some time that phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 are regulated by PI3K and/or by PKC-dependent (phorbol ester-activated) pathways (21Blenis J. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J.

We use phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a phorbol ester and a tumor promoter, to induce S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation via activation of the conventional and novel PKCs. In this report we show that the TSC1/TSC2 inhibits PKC/MAPK signaling toward 4E-BP1 and S6K1. Because PMA does not activate PI3K-dependent signaling in the HEK293E cells used in this study, these data support the model that TSC1/TSC2 inhibits mTOR rather than PI3K-mediated signaling. We report that tuberin is phosphorylated on the Akt-dependent sites (Ser-939 and Thr-1462) and on distinct phosphorylation sites upon PMA treatment, which occurs in the absence of PI3K signaling and is inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitors toward MEK (U0126) and PKC (bisindolylmaleimide I). This study reveals that the PKC/MAPK signaling input to tuberin is distinct from that mediated by PI3K/Akt. Furthermore, our work addresses an important question as to how S6K1 is activated upon PI3K-independent signaling. Our findings provide evidence that cell signaling through converging PI3K and PKC/MAPK pathways inactivate the tuberin-hamartin heterodimer as a result of tuberin phosphorylation at overlapping sites. Chemicals and Materials—Wortmannin and U0126 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and bisindolylmaleimide I was from Calbiochem. PMA, insulin, and anisomycin were bought from Sigma, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) was from Invitrogen. PA was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Radiolabeled reagents were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and m7GTP-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents (unless stated) were obtained from VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA). Plasmids—N-terminal FLAG-tagged pRK7/TSC1 and pRK7/TSC2 mammalian expression vectors were generated as described previously (12Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The N-terminal FLAG-tagged tuberin double point mutant (Ser-939 and Thr-1462 to Ala) cDNA, which was generously provided by B. D. Manning and L. C. Cantley (Harvard University, Boston), was subcloned into pRK7. pACTAG2 expressing human HA-tagged 4E-BP1 was a kind gift from N. Sonenberg (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). pRK7 expressing N-terminal HA-tagged S6K1 was generated as described previously (25Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7884-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mammalian Tissue Culture, Transfection, and Sample Preparation—Human embryonic kidney 293E (HEK293E) cells were cultured (at 37 °C within 5% CO2) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed by calcium phosphate as described previously (26Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Empty pRK7 was used so that all transfection mixes contained 6 or 10 μg of total DNA per 6- or 10-cm2 plate, respectively. Prior to use, PA was prepared as described previously (27Park I.H. Bachmann R. Shirazi H. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31423-31429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were washed twice with STE (pH 7.2) buffer and then harvested with lysis buffer (10 mm KPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Brij 35, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg of pepstatin, pH 7.2). The cell extracts generated were spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and then stored at –80 °C. Due to subtle variations of cell passage number, acidity of cell medium, and confluency of cells, prepared cell lysates were routinely analyzed for Akt or ERK1/2 activation to confirm that the cells were properly responding to cell stimulation. The results presented in this paper are representative of at least three experiments. Analysis of Protein Phosphorylation—For Western blot analysis, lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with the appropriate antibody followed by horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. To observe a mobility shift of 4E-BP1 and tuberin, the proteins were resolved on 12.5 and 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, respectively. All immunoblots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Anti-FLAG antibodies (M2) were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. (New Haven, CT). Anti-HA antibodies was kindly provided by M. Chou (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia), and anti-4E-BP1, -tuberin (Thr-1462 phospho-specific), -Akt, and -eIF4E antibodies were bought from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The C-20 anti-tuberin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p38MAPK antibodies were purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-MAPK antibodies were generated as described previously (28Richards S.A. Fu J. Romanelli A. Shimamura A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). eIF4E was purified by using affinity chromatography on m7GTP-Sepharose as described (20Fingar D.C. Salama S. Tsou C. Harlow E. Blenis J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1472-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). For analysis of hamartin and tuberin within the insoluble pellet, the cell lysates were prepared as described previously (12Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immune Complex Kinase Assays—For immunoprecipitation studies of HA-tagged S6K1, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Corp., Peapack, NJ) for 3 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed as described previously (25Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7884-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). S6K1 kinase activity was determined in vitro by using recombinant GST-S6 (32 C-terminal amino acids of ribosomal protein S6) as a substrate, as described previously (25Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7884-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Quantification of incorporation of the 32P label was quantified on a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. In vivo 32P radiolabeling of tuberin was carried out in serum-starved HEK293E cells overexpressing hamartin and tuberin. The cells were incubated in phosphate-free medium for 4 h, and the cells were treated and pulsed with 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h. FLAG-tagged hamartin and tuberin were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Corp.) for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed as for the S6K1 kinase assays (see above) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Co-expression of Hamartin and Tuberin Impairs PMA-induced 4E-BP1 Phosphorylation and eIF4E Function Independently of PI3K—Previously, we reported that co-expression of both hamartin and tuberin blocked 4E-BP1 phosphorylation upon insulin stimulation of HEK293E cells (12Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In this cell line, insulin strongly stimulates signaling through the PI3K pathway but not the MAPK pathway (12Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Given that activation of the MAPK pathway by phorbol esters results in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 that is dependent on mTOR but independent of PI3K (23Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Herbert T.P. Tee A.R. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we examined whether hamartin and/or tuberin could affect PMA-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Hamartin and tuberin were co-expressed with 4E-BP1 in HEK293E cells that were serum-starved and then stimulated with PMA. By using insulin as a control to stimulate PI3K-dependent signaling, we show that PMA stimulation of this cell line activates the PKC/MAPK signaling pathway but not the PI3K/Akt pathway, as shown by the ability of PMA to stimulate phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (also known as MAPK) without inducing phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308 (Fig. 1A). The level of hamartin and tuberin within the cell lysates were compared (Fig. 1B) and revealed that the amount of hamartin and tuberin protein was enhanced when each was co-expressed with the other, as reported previously (12Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 29Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ability of hamartin and tuberin to impair PMA-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was analyzed by a gel shift assay in conjunction with phospho-specific antibodies that recognize 4E-BP1 when phosphorylated on Thr-37/Thr-46, Ser-65, and Thr-70. The α-, β-, and γ-species of 4E-BP1 resolve as three separate bands on high acrylamide SDS gels. The lowest α-isoform band and the highest γ-isoform band contain the least and most phosphorylated species of 4E-BP1, respectively. Overexpression of tuberin without its binding partner, hamartin, partially impaired the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which was further enhanced when hamartin was co-expressed with tuberin. Hamartin and tuberin co-expression inhibited the “priming” phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr-37/46 upon PMA stimulation, similar to the effect of rapamycin. Phosphorylation of Thr-37/46 is necessary for the optimal phosphorylation of the latter sites Thr-70 and Ser-65 (for review see Ref. 19Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Ser-65 and Thr-70 phosphorylations are required for the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E (reviewed in Ref. 19Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar), where the occurrence of Ser-65 phosphorylation coincides with its release from eIF4E (30Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Given the low degree of Ser-65 and Thr-70 phosphorylation on 4E-BP1 upon hamartin and tuberin co-expression, 4E-BP1 should remain bound to eIF4E after PMA stimulation. To verify this, endogenous eIF4E was purified on m7GTP-Sepharose, and the level of exogenous 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E was examined (Fig. 1C). As expected, eIF4E·4E-BP1 complexes where not disrupted upon PMA treatment of cells co-expressing hamartin and tuberin. These data reveal that PMA-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and release from eIF4E are potently blocked by tuberin-hamartin heterodimers, in a manner analogous to that of rapamycin (compare lanes 1 and 2 to 9 and 10 in Fig. 1C). Therefore, overexpression of tuberin and hamartin impairs cap-dependent translation by inhibiting mTOR signaling. Tuberin Mutants (K599M and V796E) Derived from TSC Patients Are Unable to Repress PMA-induced 4E-BP1 Phosphorylation—Unlike wild-type tuberin, patient-derived mutants of tuberin are unable to impair PI3K signaling toward downstream components of mTOR (10Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar, 12Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether two patient-derived tuberin mutants (K599M and V769E) were incapable of blocking PMA-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Previously it was shown that the K599M tuberin mutant retained normal chaperone function, i.e. the K599M tuberin mutant still binds to and translocates hamartin from the membrane-bound insoluble fraction to the cytosol. However, the V796E tuberin mutant lacks this chaperone function (29Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work, the K599M tuberin mutant increased the amount of hamartin within the cytosol, whereas the V769E mutant of tuberin did not (Fig. 2). The majority of the V769E tuberin mutant was observed, as reported previously (29Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), to be present in the insoluble Nonidet P-40 membrane fraction after lysis (Fig. 2, 2nd panel from top). The phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1 upon PMA stimulation was unchanged by co-expressing the V798E tuberin mutant with hamartin when compared with the vector only control, as observed by the similar mobility shift of 4E-BP1 on SDS-PAGE and equivalent levels of Thr-37/46, Ser-65, and Thr-70 phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Overexpression of the K599M tuberin mutant with hamartin did not affect Thr-37/46 or Thr-70 phosphorylation and weakly inhibited Ser-65 phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 when compared with the wild-type tuberin upon PMA stimulation. Therefore, the K599M tuberin mutant still retains some properties of the wild-type tuberin to inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Tuberin and Hamartin Overexpression Impair S6K1 Activation upon PMA Stimulation—To explore further the ability of hamartin and tuberin to repress downstream mTOR signaling targets, the activity of exogenous S6K1 was analyzed from cells stimulated with PMA in the presence of protein kinase inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin), mTOR (rapamycin), and PKC (bisindolylmaleimide I) (Fig. 3). PMA potently activated S6K1, which was fully blocked by 5 μm bisindolylmaleimide I, a PKC inhibitor that abolished the PMA-induced PKC activation of ERK1/2 (as observed by bisindolylmaleimide I to prevent ERK1/2 phosphorylation). Under conditions where wortmannin completely inhibited insulin-dependent Akt and S6K1 activation, wortmannin inhibited PMA-stimulated S6K1 activation by 30%. Co-expression of hamartin and tuberin also inhibited PMA-induced S6K1 activation that was enhanced when cells were treated with wortmannin (∼70%). Given that the inhibition of S6K1 by tuberin-hamartin and wortmannin are additive implies that tuberin-hamartin inhibits S6K1 through a PI3K-independent mechanism, as postulated previously (12Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Tuberin and Hamartin Overexpression Inhibit S6K1 Activity Independently of PI3K—To confirm whether hamartin and tuberin co-expression inhibits S6K1 via a PI3K-independent mechanism, it was necessary to activate S6K1 in the complete absence of PI3K signaling. To do this, we stimulated HEK293E cells with either EGF or PMA in the presence of wortmannin (to completely impair basal signaling through PI3K) (Fig. 4). Given that wortmannin blocked insulin-induced Thr-308 phosphorylation of Akt, the EGF- or PMA-induced activation of S6K1 in the presence of wortmannin occurs independently of PI3K. EGF-induced activation of S6K1 was blocked by both rapamycin and U0126 (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6, respectively) and therefore shows a requirement for both mTOR and MEK to activate S6K1 in the absence of PI3K-mediated signaling. Considering that bisindolylmaleimide I did not prevent ERK1/2 phosphorylation or EGF-induced S6K1 activation, whereas the U0126 compound did (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 6, respectively), suggests that the PI3K-independent increased activity of S6K1 by EGF must be largely dependent on activation of MAPK signaling rather than PKC signaling. Furthermore, this experiment confirms that the concentration of bisindolylmaleimide I used does not inhibit MAPK signaling to ERK1/2 or S6K1 non-specifically. Hamartin and tuberin co-expression blocked the PI3K-independent activation of S6K1 upon EGF stimulation by ∼70% (Fig. 4A, lane 8), which was repressed further upon pre-treatment with the U0126 compound (Fig. 4A, lane 9). PMA treatment that activates the PKC/MAPK pathway potently stimulated S6K1 activity 19-fold (Fig. 4A, lane 11), which was fully blocked by rapamycin (Fig. 4A, lane 12) and markedly impaired by either U0126 or bisindolylmaleimide I (Fig. 4A, lanes 13 and 14, respectively), treatments that were sufficient to block ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon PMA treatment. Hamartin and tuberin co-expression repressed the PI3K-independent PMA activation of S6K1 by ∼80% (Fig. 4A, lane 15), which was reduced to levels lower than that of the basal with either U0126 or bisindolylmaleimide I (Fig. 4A, lanes 16 and 17, respectively). We show that hamartin and tuberin co-expression in conjunction with U0126 treatment significantly inhibited EGF- and PMA-induced activation of S6K1 more than either hamartin/tuberin co-expression or U0126 treatment alone (see Fig. 4B), suggesting that tuberin-hamartin inhibits signaling through mTOR. Importantly, wortmannin was used in conjunction with either EGF or PMA treatments revealing that hamartin and tuberin represses S6K1 activity independently of PI3K. Phosphatidic Acid (PA)-mediated mTOR Signaling Is Impaired by Hamartin and Tuberin Co-expression—To further confirm whether tuberin-hamartin inhibits mTOR-dependent signaling, we pre-treated HEK293E cells with wortmannin to inhibit basal PI3K-mediated signaling while promoting mTOR signaling with PA. PA has been shown to activate mTOR signaling through the direct binding of PA to the FKBP12/rapamycin-binding domain of mTOR (31Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Co-expression of hamartin and tuberin impaired the activation of S6K1 upon PA treatment (Fig. 5). As reported previously (31Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), PA did not stimulate either Akt or ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that"
https://openalex.org/W2027310818,"Abstract Alix (ALG-2-interacting protein X) is a 95-kDa protein that interacts with an EF-hand type Ca2+-binding protein, ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2), through its C-terminal proline-rich region. In this study, we searched for proteins that interact with human AlixΔC (a truncated form not containing the C-terminal region) by using a yeast two-hybrid screen, and we identified two similar human proteins, CHMP4a and CHMP4b (chromatin-modifying protein; charged multivesicular body protein), as novel binding partners of Alix. The interaction of Alix with CHMP4b was confirmed by a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay and by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that CHMP4b transiently expressed in HeLa cells mainly exhibited a punctate distribution in the perinuclear area and co-localized with co-expressed Alix. The distribution of CHMP4b partly overlapped the distributions of early and late endosomal marker proteins, EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1) and Lamp-1 (lysosomal membrane protein-1), respectively. Transient overexpression of CHMP4b induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins as punctate patterns that were partly overlapped with the distribution of CHMP4b and inhibited the disappearance of endocytosed epidermal growth factor. In contrast, stably expressed CHMP4b in HEK293 cells was observed diffusely in the cytoplasm. Transient overexpression of AlixΔC in stably CHMP4b-expressing cells, however, induced formation of vesicle-like structures in which CHMP4b and AlixΔC were co-localized. SKD1E235Q, a dominant negative form of the AAA type ATPase SKD1 that plays critical roles in the endocytic pathway, was co-immunoprecipitated with CHMP4b. Furthermore, CHMP4b co-localized with SKD1E235Q as punctate patterns in the perinuclear area, and Alix was induced to exhibit dot-like distributions overlapped with SKD1E235Q in HeLa cells. These results suggest that CHMP4b and Alix participate in formation of multivesicular bodies by cooperating with SKD1."

However, despite the recent advances, the molecular mechanisms whereby bile acids regulate gene transcription and cholesterol homeostasis in mammals still need further investigations. Here, we show that bile acids suppress transcription of the gene (CYP7A1) encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis, also through an unusual mechanism not involving the bile acid nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor. By performing cell-based reporter assays, protein/protein interaction, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that bile acids impair the recruitment of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α and cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein by hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α, a master regulator of CYP7A1. We also show for the first time that bile acids inhibit transcription of the gene (PEPCK) encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, through the same farnesoid X receptor-independent mechanism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that bile acid-induced dissociation of coactivators from hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α decreased the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the core promoter and downstream in the 3′-untranslated regions of these two genes, reflecting the reduction of gene transcription. Finally, we found that Cyp7a1 expression was stimulated in fasted mice in parallel to Pepck, whereas the same genes were repressed by bile acids. Collectively, these results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism that controls gene transcription in response to extracellular stimuli and argue that the transcription regulation by bile acids of genes central to cholesterol and glucose metabolism should be viewed dynamically in the context of the fasted-to-fed cycle.

A fundamental problem in biology is understanding the mechanisms by which extracellular stimuli transduce their signal to the nucleus and affect gene transcription. Genes are expressed in temporal and spatial pattern during development and can be regulated by hormonal and dietary stimuli or by pathogenic factors, thus contributing to disease initiation and progression. The appreciation of such mechanisms can help to unravel disease pathogenesis or even disclose targets for novel therapeutic interventions. A typical example is the mechanism whereby bile acids regulate their own synthesis by acting on transcription of the gene (CYP7A1) encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the so-called “classic” pathway (1Javitt N.B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Chiang J.Y.L. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).

However, recent data from independent laboratories have shown that FXR, the small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2), and FTF are not the only nuclear receptors that are responsible. In this regard, for instance, we have shown that bile acids inhibit the transcription of CYP7A1 by repressing the transactivation potential of HNF-4α, a strong activator of CYP7A1, via a mitogen-activated protein (MAPK)-dependent signaling cascade (16De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using Shp -/- mouse models, Wang et al. (17Wang L. Lee Y. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C. Chua S. Wei P. Heyman R. Karin M. Moore D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and Kerr et al. (18Kerr T. Saeki S. Schneider M. Schaefer K. Berdy S. Redder T. Shan B. Russell D. Schwarz M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 713-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that bile acids can repress CYP7A1 transcription in an SHP-independent fashion, thus corroborating the observations made in in vitro models. These results raise the question of the molecular events underlying the additional regulatory mechanisms of CYP7A1 transcription by bile acids through the nuclear receptor HNF-4α. A possible scenario could lie in the bile acid-induced dissociation of the HNF-4α·coactivator complex. Nuclear receptors and transcription factors recruit coactivators to assemble the preinitiation complex efficiently on the core promoter of specific genes (19Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Among the candidate coactivators possibly affected by bile acid signaling, we considered peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP). PGC-1α and CBP interact tightly with and coactivate HNF-4α. The association of PGC-1α with HNF-4α is also a key event in the regulation of the gene encoding the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in response to the glucagon/cAMP cascade (20Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M.

Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Because HNF-4α is a key sensor of bile acid concentration in liver cells (16De Fabiani E. Mitro N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that bile acids could affect the association of HNF-4α with these transcription coactivators. In what follows, we show for the first time that bile acids suppress the transcription of CYP7A1 by blocking the association of HNF-4α with the coactivators PGC-1α and CBP. Furthermore, we found that PEPCK, a target of the HNF-4α·PGC-1α complex that mediates the response to starvation (21Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), is subject to the same regulation by bile acids in vitro and in vivo. We also provide strong evidence that Cyp7a1 is stimulated in parallel with Pepck in fasted mice. This work reveals bile acids as key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism.

The plasmid pBX-HNF-4-(1-249) carrying the N-terminal portion of HNF-4α fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain has already been described (16De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G.

The plasmid pGL3-PEPCK-luciferase and its mutants in the AF1, AF2, and AF3 sequences were generous gifts from Dr. Daryl K. Granner (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). The expression vector for HA-tagged human PGC-1α in pcDNA3 was donated by Dr. Anastasia Kralli (University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland). The plasmid pFLAG-HNF-4α was prepared by standard PCR methods and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Cell Cultures and Transient Transfection Assays—HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated dextran/charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique as described previously (16De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Typically, coprecipitates contained 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 50 ng of receptor vector, 250 ng of coactivator expression vector or an equivalent amount of empty carrier vector (pcDNA3), and 300 ng of pCMVβ (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in 24-well plates. Transfected cells were incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium in the presence of 25 μm chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or 10 μm FXR ligand GW4064 (kindly provided by Dr. Krister Bamberg) or an equivalent amount of vehicle (0.1% ethanol or Me2SO, respectively). In some experiments, transfected cells were also treated with 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP for 8 h. As a negative control for the specificity of CDCA effects on gene transcription, we also performed experiments in which transfected cells were treated with 25 μm ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (16De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol.

Each experiment was performed at least three times. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—HepG2 cultures were treated with the indicated combinations of 25 μm CDCA and 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP for 8 h in serum-free medium. Triplicate samples were pooled, and total RNA was extracted with the Absolutely RNA reverse transcription-PCR miniprep kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. About 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen s.r.l., Milan, Italy) following the manufacturer's instructions, and aliquots of the cDNAs (corresponding to ∼10 ng of the original RNA) were subjected to real-time quantitative PCR with a SYBR Green kit (QIAGEN S.p.A., Milan) following the manufacturer's instructions to detect CYP7A1, PEPCK, HNF-4α, SHP, and PGC-1α mRNAs. 18 S rRNA was used as the housekeeping gene for sample normalization and was amplified in separate wells within the same plate. Primers for real-time PCRs were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Monza-Milan, Italy) and optimized to work in a two-step protocol (40 cycles of amplifications each consisting of a denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 s and an annealing/extension step at 60 °C for 60 s). The oligonucleotides used for real-time PCR were synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). 2Sequences are available upon request. The specificity of the amplified products was monitored by performing melting curves at the end of each amplification. All of the amplicons generated a single peak, thus reflecting the specificity of the primers. Experiments were repeated at least twice with different cell preparations. Co-immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—HepG2 cultures were transfected with pcDNA3-HNF-4-(1-455), pBX-HNF-4-(1-249), or pBX-HNF-4-(130-455) and either pcDNA3-HA-PGC-1α or pcDNA3-HA-CBP. Transfected cells were treated with 25 μm CDCA or 0.1% ethanol in serum-free medium for 8 h. Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet/10 ml)). Cell lysates containing equivalent amounts of total proteins were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences Europe, Milan) and then incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics S.p.A., Monza-Milan) for 3 h, followed by an overnight incubation with protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, proteins were probed with anti-HNF-4α antibody, anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-HA antibody. Whole cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-HNF-4α antibody to detect the total amount of HNF-4α with an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences Europe) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Similar experiments performed without cotransfecting the HNF-4α expression plasmid and detecting the endogenous receptor gave identical results. To study protein/protein interactions between PGC-1α or CBP and in vitro synthesized HNF-4α, lysates from cells transfected with the HA-tagged coactivators and treated with 25 μm CDCA or 0.1% ethanol were mixed with 20 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled FLAG-HNF-4α for 4 h, immunoprecipitated as described above, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—HepG2 cells transfected with the pcDNA3-HA-PGC-1α plasmid were treated with 25 μm CDCA or vehicle (three plates/group) for 12 h in serum-free medium, and chromatin was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped with 125 mm glycine, and cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and swollen on ice for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics S.p.A.). Cell extracts were prepared in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and protease inhibitors). Extracts were sonicated with a microtip on ice to obtain DNA fragments ranging from 200 to 1000 bp (three pulses for 30 s with the power set to 5 in a Heat Systems sonicator). Soluble chromatin fragments were centrifuged, diluted 10 times with chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 167 mm NaCl), precleared with protein G-Sepharose containing 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies for 14 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured on protein G-Sepharose; washed sequentially with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)); and washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8). Samples were eluted with freshly prepared 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS (pH 8.1) at 65 °C for 10 min, and after adjusting the concentration of NaCl to 200 mm, cross-linking was reverted at 65 °C for 5 h. Following treatment with 10 μg/ml RNase A and 20 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C, genomic DNA fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Specific genomic DNA fragments from immunoprecipitated samples and inputs were quantitated by real-time PCR with SYBR Green as indicated above. As a negative control for the specificity of CDCA effects on recruitment of coactivators to the CYP7A1 and PEPCK genes, we also performed experiments treating HepG2 cells with 25 μm UDCA. The antibodies used were anti-CBP C terminus (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-HA, and anti-RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primer sets were designed to amplify the following human genomic DNA regions: CYP7A1 BARE (from nucleotides -252 to -113 relative to the cap site), CYP7A1 upstream region (from nucleotides -1935 to -1833 relative to the cap site), CYP7A1 TATA box (from nucleotides -90 to +26 relative to the cap site), CYP7A1 3′-untranslated region (from nucleotides 2009 to 2141 of the mRNA), PEPCK hormone response unit (HRU) (from nucleotides -518 to -263 relative to the cap site), PEPCK upstream region (from nucleotides -1318 to -1236 relative to the cap site), PEPCK TATA box (from nucleotides -77 to +72 relative to the cap site), and PEPCK 3′-untranslated region (from nucleotides 2298 to 2408 of the mRNA). 2Sequences are available upon request. Animal Studies—Male mice (C57BL/6J, 8 weeks old, five to nine animals/group) were maintained on a normal light cycle (7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) on a standard chow diet or fed a diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid for 8 days. Both groups had free access to food and water. To test the effect of fasting on gene expression, mice fed the standard chow diet were starved for 15 h and compared with mice fed the same diet. Both groups had free access to water. Livers were collected between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., and total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy midi-kit (QIAGEN S.p.A.) and treated with RNase-free DNase to remove possible contaminating genomic DNA following the manufacturer's instructions. Specific mRNA quantitation was performed by real-time quantitative PCR as described above. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test, setting the significance at p < 0.05. Bile Acids Repress HNF-4α Transcription Activity and CYP7A1 Expression via an FXR-independent Pathway—We have previously shown that bile acids repress the transcription of CYP7A1 by affecting the transactivation potential of the liver-enriched orphan nuclear receptor HNF-4α via an MAPK-dependent pathway (16De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We wanted to verify whether the inhibitory effect of bile acids on HNF-4α activity is secondary to the initiation of the FXR/SHP cascade. To this end, we used a Gal4-based assay in HepG2 cells with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 fused with HNF-4α and observed that CDCA repressed the activity of this nuclear receptor (Fig. 1A, left panel). Surprisingly, the FXR agonist GW4064 (23Maloney P.R. Parks D.J. Haffner C.D. Fivush A.M. Chandra G. Plunket K.D. Creech K.L. Moore L.B. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Jones S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2971-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) did not affect the transactivation potential of HNF-4α (Fig. 1A, left panel). The specificity of this effect was assessed in a similar assay with the Gal4-VP16 construct, which was not affected by CDCA or GW4064 (Fig. 1A, right panel). Control experiments showed that CDCA and GW4064 did activate FXR-dependent transcription (Fig. 1B) and repressed the transcription of CYP7A1 (Fig. 1C). In parallel transfection assays, the more hydrophilic bile acid UDCA did not affect the transcription of CYP7A1 or the activity of Gal4-HNF-4α (data not shown). These results establish that bile acids down-regulate CYP7A1 transcription via both FXR-dependent and -independent pathways, the latter typically involving the nuclear receptor HNF-4α. Bile Acids Repress CYP7A1 Transcription by Targeting the HNF-4α·PGC-1α Complex—To assess how bile acids affect the transcription machinery of CYP7A1, we studied the role of transcription coactivators. We hypothesized that bile acids affect the transcription machinery of CYP7A1 by impairing the formation of the HNF-4α·coactivator complex. As a candidate coactivator involved in this process, we considered PGC-1α, a stress-inducible coactivator strongly interacting with HNF-4α that is implicated in the transcription regulation of genes playing a key role in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue metabolism (21Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M.

Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We asked whether bile acids affect the recruitment of PGC-1α by HNF-4α to the CYP7A1 promoter when they reach a threshold concentration in hepatocytes. To test this hypothesis, we studied protein/protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HepG2 cells were transfected with an expression vector for HA-tagged PGC-1α and treated with CDCA or vehicle; whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Captured complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an antibody against HNF-4α to evaluate the effect of CDCA on the association between PGC-1α and HNF-4α. CDCA strongly hindered the physical association of HNF-4α with PGC-1α (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Control experiments showed that CDCA did not change the protein levels of HA-PGC-1α and HNF-4α (Fig. 2A, middle and lower panels). As expected from previous data (21Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), when immunoprecipitation was performed with the N-terminal portion of HNF-4α, no interaction was detected (Fig. 2B), whereas PGC-1α interacted with the C-terminal part of HNF-4α, and CDCA prevented this interaction. To further assess whether bile acids exert their action at the level of HNF-4α or other cofactors, we modified the co-immunoprecipitation experiment by adding in vitro synthesized HNF-4α to HepG2 cell extracts. In this case, we observed no change in the HNF-4α/PGC-1α interaction with lysates from HepG2 cells treated with CDCA (Fig. 2C), suggesting that bile acids may elicit a structural or post-translational modification of the nuclear receptor that alters its affinity for PGC-1α. We next tested in transient transfection assays the functional relevance of the inhibition of the HNF-4α/PGC-1α interaction by bile acids. HepG2 cells were transfected with the human CYP7A1 promoter-luciferase chimeric gene (22Wang D.-P. Stroup D. Marrapodi M. Crestani M. Galli G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid"
https://openalex.org/W1975689520,"The 14-3-3 proteins play a central role in the regulation of cell growth, cycling, and apoptosis by modulating the functional activities of key signaling proteins. Through binding to a phosphoserine motif, 14-3-3 alters target proteins activities by sequestering them, relocalizing them, conformationally altering their functional activity, or by promoting interaction with other proteins. These functions of 14-3-3 are facilitated by, if not dependent on, its dimeric structure. We now show that the dimeric status of 14-3-3 is regulated by site-specific serine phosphorylation. We found that a sphingosine-dependent kinase phosphorylates 14-3-3 in vitro and in vivo on a serine residue (Ser58) located within the dimer interface. Furthermore, by developing an antibody that specifically recognizes 14-3-3ζ phosphorylated on Ser58 and employing native-PAGE and cross-linking techniques, we found that 14-3-3 phosphorylated on Ser58 is monomeric both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated 14-3-3 was detected solely as a monomer, indicating that phosphorylation of a single monomer within a dimer is sufficient to disrupt the dimeric structure. Significantly, phosphorylation-induced monomerization did not prevent 14-3-3 binding to a phosphopeptide target. We propose that this regulated monomerization of 14-3-3 controls its ability to modulate the activity of target proteins and thus may have significant implications for 14-3-3 function and the regulation of many cellular processes.

The 14-3-3 proteins belong to a highly conserved family of phosphoserine binding proteins that regulate multiple signaling pathways involved in the control of cell division, growth, and apoptosis (1Fu H.

Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins influence the function of bound phosphoserine proteins in a variety of ways: sequestering them from cellular targets, controlling their enzymatic activities, relocating them, or acting as adapter molecules in mediating the association of two distinct client proteins (2Tzivion G.

To date, 14-3-3 proteins have been found to bind to over 100 cellular “client” proteins and have been demonstrated to participate in multiple signaling pathways and biological functions (1Fu H.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Seven isoforms of 14-3-3 have been described in humans, β, ϵ, γ, η, σ, τ, and ζ, which are expressed from separate genes and are relatively abundant in all tissues (with the exception of σ and τ that are predominantly expressed in epithelium and T-cells, respectively). In most cases, the regulated phosphorylation of the client protein controls their binding to 14-3-3 proteins. However, the regulation of the 14-3-3 proteins themselves by phosphorylation and the consequences are virtually unknown. 14-3-3 proteins are dimeric, being composed of two 30-kDa monomers that are each capable of binding a phosphoserine motif. Each monomer is composed of nine α helices arranged in antiparallel fashion to form an amphipathic groove that mediates phosphoserine target binding. The resolved crystal structures of 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3τ demonstrate the structural similarity between isoforms and explain the high degree of conservation across the family, with conserved residues lining the phosphoserine binding groove (6Xiao B.

Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The N-terminal helices of 14-3-3 mediate dimer formation with helix 1 of monomer A interacting with helices 3 and 4 of monomer B. Heteroas well as homodimerization of isoforms occurs (8Aitken A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 993-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether 14-3-3 monomers exist in vivo and if so what control mechanisms may exist to regulate their formation. It has remained a mystery exactly how 14-3-3 can regulate so many client proteins with such diverse functions. A recently proposed model provides a possible explanation (5Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), describing 14-3-3 as a molecular anvil that deforms a bound phosphoserine client protein, thus affecting its conformation, altering enzymatic activity, or masking/revealing phosphorylation sites or nuclear transport sequences. This deforming activity of 14-3-3 is wholly dependent on 14-3-3 protein being dimeric and binding to multiple sites in the client protein, although initially a single 14-3-3 binding motif in the client protein may act as a dominant or “gatekeeper” site for 14-3-3 interaction. In the context of this model, monomeric 14-3-3 would retain binding to a gatekeeper site but would not exhibit any “molecular anvil” activity and would therefore be unable to perform deforming functions. Previous studies demonstrated that a sphingosine-dependent kinase (SDK) 1The abbreviations used are: SDK, sphingosine-dependent kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; DMS, dimethyl sphingosine. isolated from Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts phosphorylated 14-3-3 proteins in vitro on Ser58 in helix 3; however, the effect of this phosphorylation was not known (10Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ this residue is located in the dimer interface just 5.8 Å from a conserved arginine (Arg18) in helix 1 of the opposing monomer. We have now determined the functional consequence of Ser58 phosphorylation on the structure of 14-3-3 and show that phosphorylation of this residue disrupts dimer formation. Moreover, 14-3-3 phosphorylated on Ser58 is detected in vivo in response to sphingolipid and is also found to be a monomer. These results demonstrate for the first time that the dimeric status of 14-3-3 can be regulated in vivo by site-specific phosphorylation at the dimer interface, a finding that may have profound implications for 14-3-3 function and the regulation of many cellular processes. Sphingolipids and Antibodies—Sphingolipids were purchased from Biomol. Anti-14-3-3 antibody was raised in New Zealand White rabbits using glutathione S-transferase-14-3-3ζ (GST-14-3-3ζ) as the immunogen. Polyclonal anti-14-3-3 antibodies were subsequently purified from rabbit serum using a GST-14-3-3ζ affinity column and used for immunoblotting at a dilution of 1:2000. Anti-phospho-Ser58 14-3-3 antibody (anti-pS58) was raised by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the phosphorylated CGARRSpSWRVVS peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The phospho-specific Ser58 antibodies were subsequently affinity purified from rabbit serum using the phospho- and an unphosphorylated form of the immunizing peptide, essentially as described previously (11Bodnar R.J. Xi X. Li Z. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47080-47087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The purified anti-phospho-Ser58 was used for immunoblotting at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Pierce. Cell Culture—Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum. CTLL-2 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml bacterially synthesized mouse interleukin-2. Expression Constructs and Recombinant Protein Production—Recombinant 14-3-3ζ was produced in Escherichia coli from pGEX2T-14-3-3ζ (12Stomski F.C. Dottore M. Winnall W. Guthridge M.A. Woodcock J. Bagley C.J. Thomas D.T. Andrew R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant 14-3-3ζ was cleaved from the immobilized GST-14-3-3ζ by resuspending 1 ml of GST-14-3-3ζ on glutathione resin (Sigma) in 2 ml of thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and incubating overnight with 200 units of Thrombostat (Pfizer). The cleaved protein was then purified on a Mono Q HR5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column after dialysis into Mono Q buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cleaved 14-3-3ζ was eluted with a 0–0.5 M NaCl gradient in Mono Q buffer, and the purity of the 14-3-3ζ was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Mutations were generated in the 14-3-3ζ cDNA by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), and mutant protein was produced and purified as described above. In Vitro SDK Reactions—An S100 cytosolic fraction was prepared from serum-starved, PMA-stimulated Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts as described previously (10Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Aliquots of extract were frozen away at –70 °C and were subsequently used in SDK reactions to phosphorylate 14-3-3ζ. SDK assays were carried out essentially as described previously (10Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with the following changes: assays were carried out in 20-μl volume with 100 ng of recombinant 14-3-3ζ. S100 extract made up half the assay volume, and SDK assay buffer was 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 25 μm ATP, 3 mm dithiothreitol with or without 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Sphingolipid was added to a final concentration of 100 μm in 0.5% w/v n-octyl glucoside. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cross-linking Studies—14-3-3ζ phosphorylated by SDK was subjected to cross-linking with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Pierce). BS3 (50 μg/ml) was added to an SDK reaction after incubation and the mixture incubated for a further 5 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was terminated by addition of ethanolamine to a final concentration on 100 μm. Cross-linked samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western transferred, and immunoblotted as indicated. Peptide Pull-downs—14-3-3ζ phosphorylated by SDK was precipitated after incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) and 2 μg of biotinylated peptide (Chiron) from 0.5 ml volume of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40). The precipitated material was washed four times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer prior to separation by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer, and immunoblotting as indicated. Cell Stimulation and Lysate Preparation—Balb/c 3T3 cells were stimulated at 80% confluence in 10-cm dishes. After stimulation as indicated, cells were put on ice and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were released from the dishes by scraping and pelletted by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were lysed on ice in 100 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and protein concentration determined by BCA assay (Pierce). 50 μg of lysate was subjected to native-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated. CTLL-2 cells (2 × 106 per treatment) were stimulated as indicated and after pelletting by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm β-glycerophosphate and lysed on ice in 50 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 25 μl of lysate was subjected to native-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated. PAGE and Immunoblotting—Native-PAGE was carried out on 12.5% PAGE gels with 5% stacking gels. Gels were prepared using the standard Laemmli recipe but excluding SDS. SDS was also excluded from the sample load buffer. Benchmark prestained protein markers (Invitrogen) were used as an indicator of protein migration. All gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting using standard buffers, and blots were blocked in TNT (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 1% (w/v) blocking reagent 1096 176 (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblotting was carried overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-Ser58 antibody and for 1 h at room temperature with the anti-14-3-3 antibody. All washes were performed in TNT with 0.5% (w/v) blocking reagent added to antibody incubations. Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using proprietary reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The Phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ on Ser58 by an SDK Activity Disrupts 14-3-3 Dimers—A SDK activity that phosphorylates Ser58 of 14-3-3ζ was previously identified in cytosolic extracts of PMA-stimulated Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts (10Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have reproduced the in vitro SDK assay system described in the original report. As shown previously (10Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of recombinant wild type 14-3-3ζ was induced by sphingosine (data not shown) and the sphingosine analogue, dimethyl sphingosine (DMS) (Fig. 1A) but not by sphingosine 1-phosphate (data not shown). Furthermore, recombinant 14-3-3 mutated at Ser58 is not phosphorylated in response to DMS confirming that Ser58 is the sole site of phosphorylation by SDK (Fig. 1A). We have now raised a polyclonal antibody to a phosphopeptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence encompassing phospho-Ser58 14-3-3ζ: CGARRSpSWRVVS, where pS represents phosphoserine. The antibody specifically recognized the phosphorylated, but not the unphosphorylated, form of the Ser58 peptide nor a phosphopeptide corresponding to another known phosphorylation site in 14-3-3ζ, Ser185 (Fig. 1B). Using the in vitro SDK assay, we demonstrated that this anti-phosphopeptide antibody (anti-pS58) strongly recognized 14-3-3ζ after phosphorylation by SDK (Fig. 1C), verifying the specificity of the antibody for Ser58-phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ. Using this unique phospho-specific antibody, we have examined the effect of Ser58 phosphorylation on 14-3-3 dimer formation. 14-3-3 proteins are characteristically acidic proteins with pI values of between 4 and 5. This being so, they resolve well on native-PAGE when run under neutral conditions. Native-PAGE has been employed previously in 14-3-3 studies to distinguish between monomeric and dimeric 14-3-3 forms (13Powell D.W. Rane M.J. Chen Q. Singh S. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21639-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Using native-PAGE in conjunction with immunoblotting with the Ser58 phosphopeptide-specific polyclonal antibody, we have examined the effect of Ser58 phosphorylation on 14-3-3 dimerization. In vitro SDK reactions were carried out either in the presence or absence of added recombinant 14-3-3ζ, subjected to native-PAGE, and immunoblotted after Western transfer with either the phospho-specific Ser58 antibody (Fig. 2A) or with a polyclonal anti-14-3-3 antibody (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of both endogenous and recombinant 14-3-3 was detected with the Ser58 phospho-specific antibody only when DMS was present in the kinase reaction, corresponding to stimulation of the SDK activity (Fig. 2A). Prestained markers were used as an aid to compare the migration of immunoreactive species between blots. The mobility of the phosphorylated 14-3-3 coincides with the mobility of the seventh protein marker, whereas immunoblotting of the same reactions with anti-14-3-3 indicates that both the endogenous and recombinant 14-3-3 migrate with the sixth protein marker (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, this mobility coincides with the mobility of purified recombinant 14-3-3 as demonstrated by Coomassie Blue staining of native gels (Fig. 2C). In addition, the anti-14-3-3 antibody also detected a small amount of protein running with the seventh marker that corresponds to the protein detected by the anti-phospho-specific Ser58 antibody (Fig. 2B), identifying the faster migrating species as 14-3-3. This increase in mobility detected by the phospho-specific antibody is greater than can be accounted for by the addition of a phosphate group alone which adds two extra negative charges and 80 Da molecular mass to the protein. This implies that the difference between the two differentially migrating 14-3-3 species is due to conformational effects and strongly suggests that 14-3-3 phosphorylated on Ser58 by SDK is monomeric, whereas the unphosphorylated 14-3-3 is dimeric. Furthermore, no phosphorylated 14-3-3 is detected migrating at the sixth marker (Fig. 2A), suggesting that phosphorylation of a single monomer within a 14-3-3 dimer is sufficient to disrupt the dimeric structure of 14-3-3. Demonstration That 14-3-3ζ Phosphorylated on Ser58 Is Monomeric by Cross-linking—We employed cross-linking to examine the dimeric status of Ser58-phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ compared with unphosphorylated 14-3-3ζ. 14-3-3ζ was phosphorylated in vitro in an SDK reaction and then subjected to cross-linking with BS3. Cross-linking was terminated using ethanolamine and the cross-linked complexes separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were Western transferred and immunoblotted either with Ser58 phospho-specific or anti-14-3-3 antibody (Fig. 3). As can be seen, the anti-14-3-3 antibody detected protein of molecular mass 28 kDa, corresponding to the size of denatured monomeric 14-3-3 and also a protein of 56 kDa when the SDK reaction was treated with BS3, corresponding in size to covalently cross-linked 14-3-3 dimers (Fig. 3). In contrast, the phospho-specific antibody only detected protein of the size of denatured monomeric 14-3-3 and not covalently cross-linked dimeric 14-3-3 (Fig. 3), indicating that 14-3-3 phosphorylated on Ser58 is monomeric. The absence of cross-linked phosphorylated 14-3-3 dimers re-affirms the previous result (Fig. 2A), showing that phosphorylation of a single monomer within a dimer is sufficient to disrupt the dimeric structure of 14-3-3. Therefore, Ser58 phosphorylation has a dominant effect with respect to dimer disruption, increasing the potency of the event. 14-3-3ζ Phosphorylated on Ser58 Retains the Ability to Bind Phosphoserine Peptide—Serine 58 of 14-3-3ζ is in the middle of helix 3 and from the crystal structure is buried at the dimer interface (7Lui D. Biekowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Other residues in helix 3 are involved in client protein binding in the amphipathic groove; specifically Arg56 and Arg60 that flank Ser58 have been demonstrated to be critical for binding to phosphoserine peptide (14Thorson J.A. Yu L.W.K. Hsu A.L. Shih N.-Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to determine whether phosphorylation of Ser58 disrupts the amphipathic groove and consequently the ability of 14-3-3 to bind to phosphoserine client proteins. Thus, the ability of 14-3-3ζ phosphorylated on Ser58 to bind a peptide corresponding to a 14-3-3 binding motif in the cytoplasmic domain of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor β chain (12Stomski F.C. Dottore M. Winnall W. Guthridge M.A. Woodcock J. Bagley C.J. Thomas D.T. Andrew R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was determined. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides (16Guthridge M.A. Stomski F.C. Barry E.F. Winnall W. Woodcock J.M. McClure B.J. Dottore M. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) were used to pull-down 14-3-3ζ from SDK reactions carried out either in the presence or absence of DMS (Fig. 4). Immunoblotting of the pull-down material with anti-14-3-3 antibody showed that 14-3-3ζ bound to the phosphorylated but not the unphosphorylated peptide, demonstrating that interaction of 14-3-3 with peptide is dependent on phosphorylation of the peptide. Similarly, Ser58-phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ also bound to phosphorylated peptide and, as expected, was detected only in SDK reactions carried out in the presence of DMS (Fig. 4). This indicates that Ser58-phosphorylated monomeric 14-3-3ζ retains the ability to bind to a 14-3-3 binding site and that binding is dependent on phosphorylation of the site, thus demonstrating that the amphipathic binding groove in the phosphorylated 14-3-3 monomer is not structurally perturbed by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation and Monomerization of 14-3-3 Can Be Induced in Vivo by Sphingolipids—Having demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser58 by SDK renders 14-3-3 monomeric in vitro, it is important to show that this process also occurs in vivo. We have examined the phosphorylation and dimerization of 14-3-3 in vivo in Balb/c 3T3 cells after sphingolipid treatment using the phospho-specific Ser58 antibody (Fig. 5A). DMS was employed for these studies being a naturally occurring nonmetabolizable analogue of sphingosine. Whole cell lysates from Balb/c 3T3 cells treated with 25 μm DMS for varying lengths of time were run on native-PAGE and immunoblotted with phospho-specific Ser58 and anti-14-3-3 antibodies (Fig. 5A). The phospho-specific Ser58 antibody detected a protein migrating with the seventh protein marker after 10 min of treatment with DMS corresponding to monomeric 14-3-3. This demonstrates that DMS treatment of Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts does indeed disrupt dimeric 14-3-3 in vivo presumably by inducing phosphorylation of Ser58. We extended these studies to other cell types and investigated the effect of DMS treatment on 14-3-3 phosphorylation and dimeric status in the murine lymphoid cell line, CTLL-2. Cells were stimulated with increasing doses of DMS for 30 min and whole cell lysates prepared and run on native-PAGE. After Western blotting the lysates were immunoblotted with either the phospho-specific Ser58 antibody or anti-14-3-3 antibody (Fig. 5B). As can be seen, when cells were treated with 25 μm DMS, phosphorylated 14-3-3 was detected with the Ser58 phospho-specific antibody migrating exclusively with the seventh protein marker (Fig. 5B). This indicates that sphingolipid-induced phosphorylation of 14-3-3 on Ser58 disrupts the dimeric structure of the endogenous protein in CTLL-2 cells. Furthermore, as seen in vitro, no phosphorylated 14-3-3 is detected as a dimer, indicating that phosphorylation of a single monomer within a 14-3-3 dimer is sufficient to disrupt the dimer. We present data here that the dimeric status of 14-3-3 protein is regulated by site-specific phosphorylation. A sphingolipid-activable cytosolic kinase activity, previously described as SDK, phosphorylates 14-3-3 in vitro on a serine residue (Ser58) that lies in the dimer interface of the protein (10Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have generated a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes 14-3-3ζ phosphorylated on Ser58, and this unique tool has allowed us to probe the effect of SDK-mediated phosphorylation of this site on 14-3-3 dimeric structure. We have employed native-PAGE and cross-linking studies to qualitatively discriminate between monomeric and dimeric forms of 14-3-3 and have found that sphingolipid induced phosphorylation of Ser58 disrupts the dimeric structure of 14-3-3 both in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). Furthermore, phosphorylation of a single monomer unit within a dimer of 14-3-3 is sufficient to disrupt the dimer, increasing the potency of the event. We show that phosphorylated monomeric 14-3-3 is competent at phosphoserine peptide binding, thereby demonstrating that phosphorylation does not have gross conformational effects on the amphipathic phosphoserine binding groove. We propose that this regulated phosphorylation and monomerization of 14-3-3 controls it's deforming activity and may have profound implications for 14-3-3 function and the regulation of many cellular processes. Phosphorylation of Ser58 by SDK is not restricted to the 14-3-3ζ isoform. The original SDK report also demonstrated phosphorylation of the equivalent residues in β and η (10Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and equivalent sites are found in all isoforms with the exception of σ and τ. Moreover, the amino acid sequence surrounding the serine in all phosphorylatable isoforms is highly conserved, suggesting that the ability to regulate monomerization by phosphorylation has been functionally conserved. Interestingly, not only is the sequence in the corresponding region of 14-3-3τ and 14-3-3σ more divergent but the homologous residue to Ser58 is an alanine and therefore not susceptible to phosphorylation. It is intriguing that these more tissue-restricted isoforms are not phosphorylatable at this site and suggests that they may perform specific roles for which regulation of monomerization is not desirable. Our findings are at odds with a recent report in which phosphorylation of Ser58 in 14-3-3ζ by PKB/Akt was said to have no effect on dimer stability (13Powell D.W. Rane M.J. Chen Q. Singh S. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21639-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, as noted by others (8Aitken A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 993-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the recombinant 14-3-3ζ used as kinase substrate in those studies already comprised a significant amount of monomeric 14-3-3, as determined by native-PAGE analysis. The extent of phosphorylation obtained coincided with the amount of monomer present, suggesting that 14-3-3 monomer rather than dimer may have been the substrate for Akt phosphorylation (13Powell D.W. Rane M.J. Chen Q. Singh S. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21639-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, the recombinant 14-3-3ζ used in our in vitro studies is solely dimeric as determined by native-PAGE analysis, with no monomeric component detectable by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B) or Coomassie staining (Fig. 2C). Additionally, we detect monomeric 14-3-3 in vivo using the phospho-specific Ser58 antibody (Fig. 5), indicating that the monomerization observed is physiological. It is not possible from our studies to gauge the exact stoichiometry of 14-3-3 phosphorylation in vivo as the native-PAGE system used to discriminate monomers from dimers resolves only proteins and complexes with relatively acidic isoelectric characteristics. As shown (Fig. 4), phosphorylated 14-3-3 is still able to bind to phosphoserine peptide and so would therefore be expected to interact with phosphoserine client proteins and the resulting complexes may not resolve on native-PAGE. Therefore, the amount of phosphorylated 14-3-3 detected under these conditions may underestimate the level of phosphorylation actually occurring. The proposed functional role for Ser58 in regulating monomerization is consistent with its location in the dimer interface (7Lui D. Biekowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, as previously noted (8Aitken A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 993-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), how a kinase gains access to this buried residue remains unknown. The dimeric form of the protein is inherently stable and not prone to dissociation (9Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and we have found no evidence for free exchange of monomers in mixing experiments using differentially tagged forms of 14-3-3ζ (data not shown). An alternative explanation could be that 14-3-3 protein is flexible, allowing access of SDK activity to the dimer interface, but evidence suggests that this is not the case as the crystal structures of 14-3-3 unbound or bound to a protein are remarkably similar (17Obsil T. Ghirlando R. Klein D.C. Ganguly S. Dyda F. Cell. 2001; 105: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that sphingolipid may have some direct effect on 14-3-3 that allows access of the kinase to Ser58. Such modulation of Src kinase substrates by sphingolipids has been observed previously (18Abdel-Ghany M. Osusky M. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Shalloway D. Racker R. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1992; 1137: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in the original description of SDK activity, it was shown that the enzyme activity co-purified with 14-3-3 and could be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous 14-3-3 (10Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), indicating that the kinase responsible for SDK activity is in intimate contact with 14-3-3, even in the absence of sphingolipid. Therefore, SDK may gain access to Ser58 by conformationally altering 14-3-3 directly. Previous studies with 14-3-3 mutants defective in dimerization indicate that although monomeric forms of 14-3-3 are capable of binding to phosphoserine target proteins, in many cases the monomer is unable to regulate client protein functions (19Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 14-3-3 mutants that are defective in client protein binding owing to substitutions in the phosphoserine binding amphipathic groove exhibit dominant negative effects on several pathways due to their ability to dimerize with endogenous 14-3-3, resulting in functionally monomeric forms (23Xing H. Zhang S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A. Muslin A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In the light of these studies we believe that the regulated monomerization of 14-3-3 demonstrated here has significant implications for the regulation of many 14-3-3 functions in cells. To date, the most clearly defined role of 14-3-3 is to protect cells against apoptosis. A peptide with high affinity for 14-3-3, difopein, induces apoptosis when expressed in cells, due to its ability to compete with cellular proteins for 14-3-3 binding (25Masters S.C. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45193-45200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Strikingly, expression of a functionally monomeric dominant negative form of 14-3-3ζ in mouse fibroblasts enhances the cells apoptotic response to UVC irradiation, serum withdrawal, and tumor necrosis factor-α, highlighting the role of dimeric 14-3-3 in protecting cells against apoptosis (23Xing H. Zhang S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A. Muslin A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulated monomerization may play a role in inducing apoptosis by disrupting the anti-apoptotic function of dimeric 14-3-3. Consistent with this hypothesis, the sphingolipids sphingosine and DMS have both been shown to induce apoptosis in many cell types, including CTLL-2 cells (15Nakamura S. Kozutsumi Y. Sun Y. Miyake Y.

Indeed, under the conditions used here to induce 14-3-3 phosphorylation in CTLL-2 cells (Fig. 5B), significant cell death was observed after 5 h of treatment with DMS (data not shown). Therefore, it is conceivable that phosphorylation and consequent monomerization of 14-3-3 contributes to apoptosis induced by these sphingolipids and may have a more general role in functions where 14-3-3 is involved."

In this study we have asked whether peptides generated from cleavage of SPARC in the extracellular milieu can regulate angiogenesis. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, but not MMP-1 or 9, showed significant activity toward SPARC. Limited digestion of recombinant human (rhu)SPARC with purified catalytic domain of rhuMMP-3 produced three major fragments, which were sequenced after purification by HPLC. Three synthetic peptides (Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3) representing motifs from each fragment were tested in distinct assays of angiogenesis. Peptide Z-1 (3.9 kDa, containing a Cu2+-binding sequence KHGK) exhibited a biphasic effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation by cultured endothelial cells and stimulated vascular growth in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). In contrast, peptides Z-2 (6.1 kDa, containing Ca2+-binding EF hand-1) and Z-3 (2.2 kDa, containing neither Cu2+-binding motifs nor EF hands), inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner and exhibited no effects on vessel growth in the CAM. Reciprocal results were obtained in a migration assay in native collagen gels: peptide Z-1 was ineffective over a range of concentrations, whereas Z-2 or Z-3 stimulated cell migration. Therefore, proteolysis of SPARC by MMP-3 produced peptides that regulate endothelial cell proliferation and/or migration in vitro in a mutually exclusive manner.

Members of this group include SPARC and its homolog hevin/SC1, thrombospondin 1 and 2, tenascin C and X, osteopontin, CYR61, and potentially some of the cell surface-associated proteoglycans (2Sage E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rather than serving primarily structural roles, these proteins act as extracellular modulators of signaling events that occur, for example, between cell-surface receptors and the ECM (1Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In fact, regulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, and/or differentiation has been established for each of the matricellular proteins identified to date. These fundamental effects of the matricellular group have implicated most if not all of them in the morphogenesis of tissues and/or their restructuring as a result of injury or repair. Notably, SPARC, thrombospondin 1, and thrombospondin 2 have been shown to be prominent in angiogenesis (1Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Curr. Opin.

Sage E.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 19: 815-827Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar); (b) SPARC regulates cell proliferation by its block of the cell cycle in mid-G1 and its interactions with platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which abrogate their binding to cognate receptors (7Funk S.E.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5529-5536PubMed Google Scholar), in vitro. The production of SPARC by nascent vessels, its stimulation of MMPs, its interaction with VEGF, and its regulation of proteins associated with cell-ECM interactions, support a role for SPARC in the growth and/or regression of blood vessels.An interesting corollary to the involvement of matricellular proteins in biological processes such as angiogenesis is the release of bioactive peptides from these domain-rich proteins by endogenous tissue proteolysis (15Sage E.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 182-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the case of SPARC, synthetic peptides representing motifs in each of the three domains have been used to map many of the functions described above (16Lane T.F. Sage E.H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 17Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two relatively short sequences that bind Cu2+ with high affinity affected endothelial cell proliferation, and one of them, KGHK, stimulated angiogenesis in vivo (18Iruela-Arispe M.L. Lane T.F. Redmond D. Reilly M. Bolender R. Kavanagh T.J. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, KGHK/Cu2+ was shown to be released from native SPARC by plasmin (17Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and peptide(s) containing this sequence were identified as natural cleavage products in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model of angiogenesis (18Iruela-Arispe M.L. Lane T.F. Redmond D. Reilly M. Bolender R. Kavanagh T.J. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).In the present study we have asked whether certain members of the MMP family with established activities in angiogenesis could cleave SPARC into fragments with sequence motifs that could regulate one or more aspects of endothelial cell function, e.g. in a CAM assay to quantify vessel growth, the radial invasion of matrix by aggregated cells (RIMAC) assay, which measures migration of cells in native collagen gels, and an assay of DNA synthesis in vitro. We have shown that MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) cleaves SPARC into three major fragments, the sequencing of which allowed us to synthesize peptides with motifs previously identified as modulators of angiogenesis, as well as some additional ones, in an extended sequence context. The penultimate Cu2+-binding sequence was found to be an effective stimulator of the endothelial cell cycle and of angiogenesis in vivo. In contrast, a peptide comprising the Ca2+-binding EF hand-1 inhibited endothelial cell proliferation but stimulated migration in collagen gels. A third peptide, lacking both Cu2+- and Ca2+-binding motifs, also stimulated migration but was substantially less effective as a cell-cycle inhibitor. Thus, we have shown that MMP-3 releases peptides from SPARC that contain sequence motifs with mutually exclusive effects, within a given range of concentration, on endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Additionally, a peptide containing the Cu2+-binding sequence KHGK exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on angiogenesis in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Proteins—Recombinant human (rhu) SPARC with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (SPARC-His) was prepared as described (19Bassuk J.A. Baneyx F. Vernon R.B. Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Bassuk J.A. Braun L.P. Motamed K. Baneyx F. Sage E.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. An 8 m urea extract of bacterial paste derived from 25 liters of a fed-batch fermentation (21Hoffman B.J. Broadwater J.A. Johnson P. Harper J. Fox B.G. Kenealy W.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was applied to a 40-cm3 column of nickel-nitriloacetic acid resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Endogenous bacterial proteins were removed by washing with pH 6.0 buffer. rhuSPARC-His that was immobilized onto the Ni-NTA resin was renatured at pH 8.5 by a reverse gradient from 8 to 0 m urea in 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm oxidized glutathione, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5% octylthioglucoside. rhuSPARC-His was eluted at pH 4.5, dialyzed against 0.1 n acetic acid, and lyophilized.The catalytic domain of human proMMP-3, lacking the N-terminal 34 amino acids and the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain (Δ248–460), was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded from inclusion bodies, purified as described previously (22Suzuki K. Kann C.C. Hung W. Gehring M.R. Brew K. Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and provided as a gift from Dr. Hideaki Nagase (Imperial College, London, UK).Cleavage of rhuSPARC-His with Active Form MMP-3 (Δ 248–460)—1–5 mg rhuSPARC-His was digested with active form MMP-3 in 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m CaCl2 for 16 h at 37 °C. Optimal digestion conditions were obtained at a 1:100 (enzyme:substrate) ratio by weight. Digestion was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 0.01 m. Following the addition of 3 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the digestion mixture was injected onto a Vydac C4 reverse-phase HPLC column that had been repeatedly conditioned by the process described below. Development of the column was achieved at 1 ml/min by linear gradients from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A) to n-propanol/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (B), according to the following schedule: 0% B, 10 min; 0–15% B, 15 min; 15–60% B, 100 min; 60–100% B, 10 min; 100–0% B, 20 min. Fractions were dried by vacuum centrifugation and were stored at –80 °C.Amino Acid Sequencing of rhuSPARC-His Fragments—Cleavage products of rhuSPARC-His were fractionated on 16.5% polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels that contained 0.1% SDS and were transferred to a polyvinyldenefluoride membrane in 10 mm morpholinosulfonic acid (pH 11.0) that contained 20% methanol by volume, for 30 min at 0.3 A. Transferred peptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, excised from the membrane, and subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation and sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer.Synthetic Peptides—Peptides were synthesized by Zymogenetics, Inc. (Seattle, WA) and were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Concentration and purity were determined by amino acid analysis. In all cases, peptides exhibited >90% purity, with no contaminating (unexpected) residues present. The sequences, molecular weights, and pIs of these peptides, designated Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3, are shown in Table I.Table ISynthetic peptides representing MMP-3 cleavage products of human SPARCPeptideSequenceaDesignated by amino acid number in the sequence of mature human SPARC (after removal of the signal sequence between Ala17 and Ala18).MWpIZ-150-85 (36)bNumber in parentheses indicates total amino acids in each peptide.39485.5Z-2149-198 (50)60716.5Z-3220-239 (20)22475.4a Designated by amino acid number in the sequence of mature human SPARC (after removal of the signal sequence between Ala17 and Ala18).b Number in parentheses indicates total amino acids in each peptide. Open table in a new tab Proliferation and Migration Assays—BAE cells were isolated and subcultured as previously described (7Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2648-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation was measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine (10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) according to (7Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2648-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were released by incubation in trypsin, and were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal calf serum at 5000 cells/ml. The cells were plated in triplicate (0.5 ml/well, 2 cm2), and peptides were added immediately at concentrations ranging from 0.05–1.0 mm. After 18 h, 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well for an additional 2 h. After removal of the media, the cell layers were rinsed twice with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and were solubilized by shaking in 0.5 ml of 0.4 m NaOH. Incorporated cpm were measured by scintillation counting. Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times.Endothelial migration and cord morphogenesis were assessed by the RIMAC assay (23Vernon R. Sage E.H. Microvasc. Res. 1999; 57: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Aggregates of BAE or porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells (a gift of J. Waltenberger, Uppsala, Sweden) were placed in native type I collagen gels (0.5 mg/ml; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), in the presence or absence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 (20 ng/ml, Scios, Mountain View, CA). DMEM was used as control buffer and as diluent for the peptides. Assays were conducted in quadruplicate, and experiments were performed a minimum of three times.Angiogenesis Assay—Quail CAM assays were performed and quantified as described in Parsons-Wingerter et al. (24Parsons-Wingerter P. Lwai B. Yang M.C. Elliott K.E. Milaninia A. Redlitz A. Clark J.I. Sage E.H. Microvasc. Res. 1998; 55: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Peptides Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3, each at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mm in a total volume of 500 μl of PBS, were applied to CAMs cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates. Control CAMs received an equal volume of PBS alone. After 24 h, images were photographed digitally at 10×, and arterial vessel growth was quantified by calculation of the fractal dimension (Df) of skeletonized binary images (24Parsons-Wingerter P. Lwai B. Yang M.C. Elliott K.E. Milaninia A. Redlitz A. Clark J.I. Sage E.H. Microvasc. Res. 1998; 55: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Digestion with MMPs—Purified rhuSPARC (20 μg) was iodinated with Iodobeads™ (Pierce, Rockford, IL) as previously described (10Motamed K. Funk S.E. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Ross R. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biochem. 2002; 84: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 125I-SPARC (100 μl) was concentrated at 5,000 × g for 5 min in a Centricon-30 tube (Amicon, Beverly, MA). A volume of retentate equivalent to 3–6 × 105 cpm (∼100 ng) was incubated with huMMP-1 (30 ng/μl, 5–10 μl), rhuMMP-3 (0.4 μg/ml, 0.5–5 μl), or huMMP-9 (10 ng/μl, 5–10 μl) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5), in a total volume of 50 μl. All MMPs were a gift from Dr. H. Nagase. Samples were incubated 16–18 h at 37 °C, after which they were diluted 1:1 (by volume) in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and were boiled for 5 min. The resulting digests were resolved on 16.5% polyacrylamide tricine gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA), and proteins/peptides were visualized by autoradiography. rhuTIMP-1 (5 μl, 0.5 μg/μl) (a gift from Dr. H. Nagase) was added to some reaction mixtures prior to incubation (16–18 h) at 37 °C. Some digests of SPARC, after resolution by SDS-PAGE, were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and were subsequently exposed to guinea pig anti-SPARC peptide 2.3 IgG (5 μg/ml). For production of this antibody, 8 copies of murine (m) SPARC peptide 2.3 (Thr113–Glu129) were synthesized on a branched Lys multiple antigen peptide core (Biosynthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX). The resulting macromolecule, which has a high molar ratio of peptide to core molecule, is highly antigenic and requires no carrier protein to elicit an antibody response (26Posnett D.N. McGrath H. Tam J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1719-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antiserum was highly specific for peptide 2.3 and did not react with SPARC by ELISA. After exposure to 125I-protein A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Dupont, Burbank, CA), the blots were exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C.RESULTSPublished studies from several laboratories have identified a number of different functions of SPARC, many of which are related to de-adhesion and anti-proliferation of cultured cells (4Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 5Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 6Brekken R.A. Sage E.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 19: 815-827Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The use of synthetic peptides representing domain-specific sequences of SPARC has confirmed some of the functional properties attributed to SPARC, and has identified smaller regions or subdomains and their sequences to which certain activities of SPARC could be assigned. However, most of the synthetic peptides were chosen arbitrarily, e.g. to isolate a Ca2+ binding region or a sequence with a purportedly stabilized secondary structure, and prior to the crystallographic studies performed on domains II and III (16Lane T.F. Sage E.H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 27Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Having identified peptides of SPARC with specific activities on several types of cells in vitro, we questioned whether one or more of these sequences were present in vivo, and whether natural proteolysis of SPARC could occur as a result of tissue injury. In this study we have therefore asked the following questions: (a) Are there peptides generated from the cleavage of SPARC by certain MMPs that influence the process of angiogenesis, and (b) are the previously identified short sequence motifs of SPARC active in the context of larger peptides?Cleavage of SPARC by MMP-3—In Fig. 1A is shown an incubation of 125I-SPARC individually with three different MMPs (1, 3, and 9) that are relevant to angiogenesis. MMP-3, but not MMP-1 or 9, exhibited reproducible catalytic activity toward SPARC. The cleavage of SPARC by MMP-3 was concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–5) and was inhibited by TIMP-1 (Fig. 1B, lane 6).Electroblotting of an MMP-3 digest of SPARC onto a nitrocellulose filter, followed by exposure to an antibody recognizing hSPARC peptide 2.3 (Thr114–Gly130), revealed a band of approximate M r 14,000 (not shown). Interestingly, peptide 2.3 contains the sequence KKGHK, which has a high affinity for Cu2+ and is angiogenic in vivo and in vitro (17Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Iruela-Arispe M.L. Lane T.F. Redmond D. Reilly M. Bolender R. Kavanagh T.J. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Maquart F.-X. Bellon G. Chaquor B. Wegrowski J. Patt L.M. Trachy R.E. Monboisse J.-C. Chastang F. Birembaut P. Gillery P. Borel J.-P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2368-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Incubation of peptide 2.3 with MMP-3 resulted in multiple and extensive cleavages, predominantly at Lys123, Leu124, and His125–Leu126, as detected by tandem mass spectrometry (not shown). These data indicate that this sequence is protected within the native structure of SPARC, a conclusion borne out by crystallographic data (27Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and cell proliferation assays (29Funk S.E. Sage E.H. J. Cell Physiol. 1993; 154: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In summary, MMP-3, but not MMP-1 or 9, displayed consistent proteolytic activity toward SPARC. One of the fragments released from SPARC was of approximate M r 14,000 and contained a Cu2+-binding sequence with reported angiogenic activity.For the purpose of sequencing major cleavage fragments of SPARC produced by MMP-3, rhuSPARC was subjected to digestion under conditions that we had previously determined as optimal for this study: an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (by weight) for 16 h at 37 °C, in a buffer containing 10 mm Ca2+ for maintenance of native structure. Peptides were fractionated by HPLC on a C4 column, as shown in Fig. 2A, and peaks J1 and J2+J3 were further resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, inset), prior to electroblotting and Edman degradation. The peptide sequences obtained from this procedure are shown in Fig. 2B, and their size distributions are summarized in Table II. Peptide J1 (M r 9,300) covered the N-terminal-third of the protein (Gln2–Pro87), whereas peptide J2 (M r 17,700) extended from Ile88 to Pro237, with the remainder of the protein (49 amino acids) cleaved into smaller fragments. Importantly, EF hand-2 (Asp257–Glu268) is absent from peptide J2, although J2 comprises much of the C-terminal EC domain of SPARC. In addition, it contains the Cu2+-binding sequence KKGHK (Lys119–Lys123) and EF hand-1 (Asp165–Lys176). Sequencing of peptide J3 (M r 10,600, Met150–Pro237) revealed it to be derived from J2 (Fig. 2, A and B), which also contains EF hand-1 but lacks KKGHK. The net result of the limited digestion of rhuSPARC by MMP-3 is: (a) liberation of fragment J1 (Table II and Fig. 2A), (b) production of fragment J2-J3 (Table II and Fig. 2B), and (c) subsequent release of fragment J3 from J2-J3 (Table II and Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Purification and sequences of SPARC peptides produced by limited proteolysis by MMP-3. Purified rhuSPARC-His was digested with active form MMP-3 (Δ248–460) at a 1:100 enzyme to substrate ratio (by weight) for 16 h at 37 °C. A, peptides were fractionated on a C4 column by reverse-phase HPLC by development with a linear gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peaks containing peptides J1 and J2+J3 are identified. Inset, Coomassie Blue-stained polyvinyldenefluoride membrane from 16.5% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels containing 0.1% SDS that show J1 (lane 1, faint band at 9 kDa), J2 (lane 2, 18 kDa; lane 5 from separate HPLC fractionation), and J3 (lane 3, 11 kDa).

The N-terminal domain I (approximately the initial 50 amino acids) is not shown. Peptide J2 (shown in yellow in Fig. 3B) encompasses portions of both domains II and III, whereas peptide J3 (shown in yellow in Fig. 3C) is limited to domain III.

https://openalex.org/W2005411204,"Recently, it has been shown that cyclin B1 was degraded mainly before the onset of anaphase in mammalian cells. When a nondegradable form of cyclin B1 was introduced into cells, the metaphase-anaphase transition was blocked. This blockage was not due to a failure in activating anaphase-promoting complex, nor was it due to a failure of degradation of securin. To resolve the question of whether this blockage by overexpressing the nondegradable form of cyclin B1 is physiologically relevant or not, we developed a novel method to estimate the relative protein level of the overexpressed cyclin B1 mutant within an individual cell. We found that a low level of nondegradable cyclin B1 (less than 30% of the endogenous cyclin B1) was sufficient to block the metaphase-anaphase transition, implying that the blockage of anaphase onset by the nondegradable cyclin B1 was not due to an artifact of excessive M-phase-promoting factor activity. This result suggests that, in mammalian cells, the majority of cyclin B1 must be destroyed before the cell can enter anaphase.

Up until recently, the majority view was that inactivation of MPF is not required for the onset of anaphase (20Farr K.A. Cohen-Fix O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For example, it was demonstrated in an in vitro study using Xenopus egg extracts that the degradation of cyclin B (and thus the inactivation of MPF) was not required for the separation of sister chromatids (9Holloway S.L. Glotzer M. King R.W. Murray A.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was reached in the in vivo study of budding yeast, which reported that the destruction of MPF activity is not required for the M/A transition (10Surana U. Amon A. Dowzer C. McGrew J. Byers B. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Recently, Stemmann et al. (15Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) extended the in vitro study of Holloway et al. (9Holloway S.L. Glotzer M. King R.W. Murray A.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and found that when a high concentration of nondestructable cyclin B was added to the Xenopus extract, sister chromatid separation could be blocked. They attributed this blockage to an inhibitory phosphorylation of separase that might be caused by high kinase activity of MPF. Their findings now raise a very important question: In an in vivo metazoan system, is cyclin B required to be degraded before the onset of anaphase? It is possible that the answer may depend on the cell model. In this study, we try to answer this question in mammalian cells using a living cell imaging technique. To measure the dynamic change of the cyclin B level within a single living cell, we fused the wild type and nondestructible form of cyclin B1 (which is the major form of mitotic cyclin in mammalian cells) with fluorescence proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and DsRed (22Brandeis M. Rosewell I. Carrington M. Crompton T. Jacobs M.A. Kirk J. Gannon J. Hunt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4344-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). The protein stability of cyclin was then correlated with several key cellular events, including sister chromatid separation and the degradation of securin. To ensure the general applicability of our results, we used both transformed cells (HeLa) and nontransformed cells (Ptk2) as model systems. Our experiments were designed to clarify two major points: 1) In a living mammalian cell, will the presence of nondegradable cyclin B prevent the onset of anaphase? 2) What is the protein level of nondegradable cyclin B required for causing the metaphase arrest? If the amount of nondegradable cyclin B required to block the M/A transition is much higher than the endogenous cyclin B, this blockage could be an artifact due to a hyperactivity of MPF. If a low level of nondegradable cyclin B (which is significantly less than the level of endogenous cyclin B at prometaphase) is sufficient to block the M/A transition, it would indicate that cyclin B must be degraded before the anaphase onset. Plasmids and Transfection—The human cyclin B1 gene was cloned between the HindIII and BamHI sites in a pEGFP-N1 vector and a pDsRed1-N1 vector, respectively (Clontech). Cyclin B1-Δ85 was cut out from the full-length cyclin B1 and cloned behind the GFP gene between the KpnI and BamHI sites in a pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech). Human securin gene (hPTTG) was cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The fusion genes were introduced into HeLa or PtK2 cells by electroporation (25Chang D.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were usually cultured for at least 24 h for expressing the introduced genes. When cell synchronization was required, HeLa cells were allowed to express the transfected genes for 12–16 h and then treated with nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 10–12 h. Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence Staining—HeLa cells were cultured as a monolayer at 37 °C in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 international units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde (which helped to retain the soluble proteins) and stained with the following primary antibodies: anti-cyclin B1 monoclonal antibody (GNS-11, Pharmingen); anti-kinetochore antibody (human autoantibody control ANA-C-positive, Sigma). They were then stained with one of the following secondary antibodies: rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem); TRITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma). Autofluorescence of glutaraldehyde was quenched with a freshly prepared solution of 0.1% NaBH4 (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min. Nuclear DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342 (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min. The Western blot experiments were performed using the standard procedures. The anti-GFP antibody was from Molecular Probes. Living Cell Imaging—To study the dynamic changes of cyclin B1-GFP and other GFP-(or DsRed) labeled proteins in living cells, fluorescent images of mitotic cells expressing the fusion gene were recorded continuously for several hours using a digital imaging system. The transfected cells were cultured on a 25-mm-diameter round coverslip, which was placed in a thermally regulated chamber (Medical System Corp.) mounted on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 35 inverted microscope. The excitation light was controlled using a Lambda-10 filter wheel shutter (Sutter Instruments). The fluorescent images were observed using appropriate filter sets. The images were recorded using a cooled CCD camera (Micro-Max by Princeton Instruments) or a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). The imaging system was controlled by a computer using the MetaMorph software (Universal Image). Chromosome Spreads—HeLa cells (with or without expressing the GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 gene) were arrested in M-phase by nocodazole treatment. GFP-positive cells were sorted out using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter machine. At 0.5 and 3.5 h after releasing from nocodazole arrest, cells were treated with a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) for 15 min before collapsing them on a coverslip by cytospin. The cells were fixed using cold methanol for 20 min and then incubated with primary (ANA-C) and secondary (TRITC-conjugated anti-human IgG) antibody. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342. The slides were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope. During mitosis, both cyclin B and securin are known to be degraded by APC through a ubiquitination proteasome system (21Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 26Zachariae W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). APC can be activated by binding to Cdc20 during metaphase or become activated later through the binding of Cdh1/Hct1 (27Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 28Kramer E.R. Gieffers C. Holzl G. Hengstschlager M. Peters J.M. Curr.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is well known that securin is degraded mainly by the Cdc20-activated APC (30Shirayama M. Zachariae W. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1336-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 31Visintin R. Prinz S. Amon A. Science. 1997; 278: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 32Zur A. Brandeis M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Using living cell imaging techniques, we measured both time courses of cyclin B1 degradation and securin degradation in the same HeLa cell. In this study, we labeled human cyclin B1 with DsRed (red fluorescent protein) and securin with YFP (yellow fluorescent protein). At early metaphase, both DsRed-labeled cyclin B1 and YFP-labeled securin were clearly visible in the cell (Fig. 1A). Their protein levels began to decrease at early metaphase and vanished almost completely before the onset of anaphase. Fig. 1C shows the results of a quantitative analysis of the temporal dependence of the degradation of cyclin B1 and securin. Their time courses were very similar. The same experiment was repeated in the PtK2 cells. Again, we found that both cyclin B1 and securin were degraded before the M/A transition (Fig. 1, B and D). We noticed that cells overexpressing both the cyclin B and securin genes spent a longer time period in the metaphase in comparison with the control cells. This is probably due to the fact that these overexpressed gene products can compete with the endogenous substrate proteins and delay their degradation. Indeed, when we transfected the cells with cyclin B1-GFP alone, the time period for metaphase was shortened. The time-dependent degradation of cyclin B1-GFP in different HeLa cells was also very similar (Fig. 1E). Our results are consistent with the findings of Clute and Pines (14Clute P. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), who also used real time measurements to study the temporal and spatial control of cyclin B1 destruction in mitosis (14Clute P. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Based on living cell measurements on 23 HeLa cells, we calculated that 94.2% of cyclin B1 had been destroyed before the onset of anaphase. These results suggest that, in a normal cell cycle, cyclin B1 is largely degraded before the onset of anaphase. The remaining question is whether the cyclin B1 degradation is a necessary condition for the M/A transition. From previous studies reported in the literature, there were hints that cyclin B had to be degraded before anaphase onset (5Gallant P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Clute P. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 15Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, and see also Ref. 44Hunt T. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 707-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For example, Gallant and Nigg (5Gallant P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) reported almost a decade ago that a higher percentage of HeLa cells was found to be arrested in mitosis when a nondegradable form of cyclin B2 was overexpressed. We found similar results also hold for overexpressing cyclin B1. When we transfected HeLa cells with a GFP-labeled nondegradable form of cyclin B1 that had the 85 amino acids removed from its N terminus (cyclin B1-Δ85), a large percentage of cells were found in the M-phase, whereas cells transfected with GFP alone were not significantly different from the control (Fig. 2A). Judging from the chromosome distribution pattern, the cyclin B1-Δ85-expressing cells appeared to be arrested in metaphase (Fig. 2B). This was true for both PtK2 and HeLa cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar findings were also mentioned in a report by Clute and Pines (14Clute P. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), although no data were given there. Like the full-length cyclin, cyclin B1-Δ85 can bind with Cdk1 to form an active MPF complex and maintains its kinase activity (1Murray A.W. Solomon M.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 34Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Our findings that the onset of anaphase is blocked in the presence of nondegradable cyclin B1 would imply that mammalian cells cannot enter anaphase when the MPF activity remains high. One important question arises. That is, is the metaphase arrest caused by the active MPF due to its direct effects on the securin/separase/cohesin system, or is it because a high level of MPF may prevent the activation of APC? To answer this question, we co-transfected cells with GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 and cyclin B1-DsRed. Using the green and red fluorescence channels, we measured the temporal-dependent changes of both the wild-type and truncated cyclin B1 in the same HeLa cell during mitosis. We found that cyclin B1-Δ85 was not degraded and that the cell cycle was blocked at the M/A transition (Fig. 2C). The full-length cyclin B1, on the other hand, was destroyed when the cell entered metaphase (Fig. 2, C and D), similar to what happened in the control cells (Fig. 1, A and E). Furthermore, by co-transfecting the cell with securin-YFP and CFP-cyclin B1-Δ85, we could measure the temporal-dependent changes of both securin and truncated cyclin B1 in the same HeLa cell. We found that like the full-length cyclin B1, securin was also degraded in the presence of nondegradable cyclin B1 (Fig. 2, E and F). Apparently, the presence of the nondegradable cyclin B1 did not prevent the activation of APC. Thus, the blockage of anaphase onset by the nondegradable cyclin B1 must be due to a direct effect of the active MPF on the securin/separase/cohesin system. We have conducted a chromosome-spread experiment to examine the detailed structure of sister chromatids in cells with or without nondegradable cyclin B1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). We observed that in the majority of cells expressing GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85, their paired chromatids remained unseparated at 3.5 h after release from nocodazole treatment, implying that the cohesin proteins holding them together were intact (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the sister chromatids in the control cells (i.e. without GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85) had mostly separated (Fig. 3B). These results confirmed that overexpressing cyclin B1-Δ85 could indeed arrest cells in metaphase. This finding, in combination with the results shown in Fig. 2, C–F, suggests that in mammalian cells, even after APC is activated and securin is degraded, an active MPF could still prevent the removal of cohesin from the chromosomes. The results of our single living cell measurements shown above are consistent with the findings of an in vitro study by Stemmann et al. (15Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), who showed that when a high concentration of nondestructible cyclin B was added to the Xenopus extract, sister chromatid separation could be blocked. They attributed this blockage to an inhibitory phosphorylation of separase, which is probably caused by a high kinase activity of MPF (15Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Recently, Hagting et al. (33Hagting A. Den Elzen N. Vodermaier H.C. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) conducted a preliminary study on living PtK1 cells. They observed that in cells with low levels of nondegradable cyclin B1, separation of sister chromatids was not blocked. However, in a few cells with high levels of nondegradable cyclin B1 (estimated to be 1.5–2-fold of the endogenous cyclin), sister chromatids were observed to remain together for several hours after the disappearance of securin (33Hagting A. Den Elzen N. Vodermaier H.C. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). These observations, together with ours as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, raised a very important question: Is the blockage of M/A transition by overexpressing nondegradable cyclin B1 physiologically meaningful? Such a blockage could have two alternative interpretations: 1) The endogenous MPF must be inactivated before the cell can enter anaphase; or 2) A hyperactive MPF may artificially block the M/A transition. The key question here is whether the amount of nondegradable cyclin B1 required for arresting the cell in metaphase is substantially below the level of endogenous cyclin B1 found in prometaphase or not. If the answer is yes, it would suggest that the majority of the endogenous cyclin B1 must be degraded before the M/A transition can occur. Otherwise, the blockage of anaphase onset is just an artifact due to an unphysiologically high level of MPF activity caused by the overexpression of nondegradable cyclin B1. Thus, we decided to conduct a careful experiment to test this point. Using a combination of GFP imaging and immunofluorescence techniques, we determined the relationship between the probability of metaphase arrest and the relative protein level of GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 within individual cells. The detailed procedures are described in the following. Step 1—We first synchronized HeLa cells (with or without expressing the GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 gene) at early M-phase using a nocodazole treatment (see “Experimental Procedures”). After nocodazole washout, cells were fixed at 0.5 or 3.5 h. They were then immunostained with anti-cyclin B antibody that recognized both the full-length and truncated cyclin B1 (GNS-11, from Pharmingen). The secondary antibody used for immunostaining was colored red so that it could be distinguished from the GFP signal (Fig. 4A). These cells were also DNA-stained to allow their stage of cell cycle to be determined. The conditions of the four samples are summarized in Table I.Table IConditions of the four sample groupsGFP-cyclin B1-Δ85Time of fixation after nocodazole washoutLevel of endogenous cyclin B1Cell cycle stageSample 1-0.5 hHighPro-metaphaseSample 2+0.5 hHighPro-metaphaseSample 3-3.5 hLowG1Sample 4+3.5 hLowMixed (M to G1) Open table in a new tab Step 2—Using a fluorescence imaging system (see “Experimental Procedures”), we measured the intensity of the GFP signal in various individual cells in Sample 4. Their cell cycle stages were also determined at the same time. These cells were grouped into three categories: 1) metaphase, 2) anaphase or telophase, and 3) interphase (G1). We then plotted the distribution of cells as a function of the fluorescence intensity of GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 (Fig. 4B). Our results clearly showed that the stage of cell cycle is closely related to the level of expression of the GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 gene. At 3.5 h after the nocodazole release, most cells with a low level of GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 protein had progressed to the G1-phase. In cells with a high level of GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 protein, however, they were mostly arrested in the metaphase (Fig. 4B). Step 3—To convert the GFP fluorescence into protein level, we used a calibration method based on an immunofluorescence analysis. The relative protein level of GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 (in comparison with the endogenous cyclin B1) was determined based on the following equation. [GFP-cyclinB1-Δ85]cell[endogenouscyclinB1]average=[GFP-cyclinB1-Δ85]cell[GFP-cyclinB1-Δ85]average×[GFP-cyclinB1-Δ85]average[endogenouscyclinB1]average(Eq. 1) Here the subscript “cell” refers to the protein concentration of an individual cell, whereas the subscript “average” refers to the average protein level in an ensemble of cells. The first ratio on the right-hand side of Equation 1 was experimentally determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of GFP in a large number of GFP-positive cells in Sample 4. The second ratio on the right hand side of Equation 2 was determined by measuring the average immunofluorescence intensity of cells in Sample 4 and in Sample 1 (Fig. 4C). (Note: All four samples were processed together and immunostained using identical conditions.) More explicitly, we assumed, [GFP-cyclineB1-Δ85]average[endogenouscyclinB1]average=ImmunofluorescenceofΔ85-positivecellsfixedat3.5hImmunofluorescenceofcontrolcellsfixedat0.5h(Eq. 2) This analysis took advantage of the knowledge that cells in Sample 4 should contain mainly the nondegradable cyclin B1-Δ85 since at 3.5 h after nocodazole release, the endogenous cyclin B1 was destroyed. We had shown previously that the presence of nondegradable cyclin B1 did not prevent the destruction of the full-length cyclin B1 (Fig. 2). Cells in Sample 1, on the other hand, were at prometaphase and thus should contain the full amount of endogenous cyclin B1. (Note: Background of immunofluorescence due to nonspecific staining can be determined from Sample 3.) One key requirement in our immunofluorescence analysis is that the antibody used here (GNS-11, from Pharmingen) must be equally efficient in recognizing the endogenous cyclin B1 and the GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85. This was verified in a Western blot study shown in Fig. 3C. Here, we used the GNS-11 antibody to probe protein blots obtained from two random populations of cells expressing either the GFP-cyclin B1 or the GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 genes. It is evident that this antibody was highly specific and recognized both the endogenous cyclin B1 and the GFP-labeled cyclin B1 (or cyclin B1-Δ85). To compare the sensitivity of this antibody in recognizing the full-length and truncated cyclin B1, we reprobed the same protein blot membrane with an anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, we found that the intensity ratios between the GFP-cyclin B1 and GFP-cyclin B1-Δ85 bands were similar using either the anti-cyclin B1 or the anti-GFP antibody. (The intensity ratio obtained from GNS-11 and anti-GFP was 2.1 and 1.9, respectively.) These results indicated that this anti-cyclin B1 antibody was almost equally sensitive in recognizing the full-length or truncated form of cyclin B1. Under our experimental conditions, we estimated that the average protein level of cyclin B1-Δ85 within the Δ85-positive cells in Sample 4 was about 61 ± 21% (analysis of 1516 cells in three independent experiments) of the endogenous cyclin B1 found at the prometaphase (Fig. 4C). Using the method discussed above, we were able to determine the relationship between the level of nondegradable cyclin B1 contained in an individual cell and its probability of metaphase arrest. The result is shown in Fig. 4D. We found that a low level of nondegradable cyclin B (equivalent to about 20–30% of the endogenous cyclin B1 at prometaphase) was sufficient to block the M/A transition in a majority of HeLa cells. These results imply that the blockage of M/A transition by expressing cyclin B1-Δ85 was not due to an artifact caused by a hyperactivity of MPF. Instead, our findings suggest that the majority of cyclin B1 protein must be degraded before the HeLa cell can enter the anaphase. One may challenge our findings by questioning that, since we used nocodazole to synchronize the cells, the level of endogenous cyclin B1 in our Sample 1 cells (i.e. cells fixed at 0.5 h after release from nocodazole) could be much higher than that in the normal prometaphase cells. It is well known that the average cyclin B1 concentration in nocodazole-arrested cells is much higher than that of a random cell population. This is mainly due to the fact that cells are arrested at the early M-phase by the nocodazole treatment, and thus, a higher percentage of cells will express the endogenous cyclin B1. Yet once a cell is arrested by nocodazole, will it continue to produce a large amount of cyclin B1 so that the endogenous protein will accumulate to a very high level? To answer this question, we did the following experiment. We first synchronized HeLa cells at the G1/S-boundary using a double thymidine block (35Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). After this block was released for 8 h, most cells had entered into the late G2-phase. We treated cells with nocodazole for different lengths of time. Then, using a Western blot analysis, we examined whether the cyclin B1 level increases with time"

Specific recognition of environmental conditions is an important prerequisite for the adaptive regulation of gene expression in response to external stimuli. In bacteria, this response is often mediated by two-component regulatory systems consisting of a sensor kinase and a response regulator. Transmembrane sensor kinases are used for the recognition of external stimuli and typically contain an extracytoplasmic sensor domain, flanked by two transmembrane helices, and a cytoplasmic histidine kinase domain. In many cases, they also contain additional cytoplasmic modulatory and one or more signal transfer domains (1Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Coupling between the sensor and kinase domains enables these proteins to transduce a signal across the membrane to the cytoplasm, initiating a downstream cascade that involves the autophosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue within the kinase domain and the subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group to an aspartate residue in the corresponding response regulator (1Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the past two decades, hundreds of two-component systems have been identified. Based on knock-out experiments, few two-component systems appear to be essential. However, some have been implicated in the control of bacterial virulence and drug resistance. Furthermore, their adaptive importance and complete absence in mammals could provide an attractive set of antimicrobial drug targets (2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, many aspects of their molecular function remain obscure. In particular, for the ligand-binding sensor kinases little is known about such fundamental processes as the stereochemistry of ligand-binding, the nature of the associated conformational changes, and the mechanism of signal transduction to the cytoplasmic kinase domain. To obtain a more detailed understanding of these processes, we have analyzed the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of the sensor kinase CitA from Klebsiella pneumoniae. Together with the response regulator CitB, CitA is required for the induction of citrate fermentation genes by the presence of environmental citrate under anoxic conditions. These genes are organized in a cluster that also includes, for example, subunits of citrate lyase, the citrate carrier CitS and oxaloacetate decarboxylase (3Bott M. Meyer M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Bott M. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Synthesis of these proteins requires careful regulation, because inappropriate expression would interfere with central metabolic pathways. Thus, even though CitA appears to be nonessential (1Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar), targeted dysregulation of its pathway could provide therapeutic approaches. CitA exhibits a domain organization similar to that described above, i.e. a periplasmic citrate-binding domain flanked by two transmembrane helices and followed by linker and kinase domains located in the cytosol (3Bott M. Meyer M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The periplasmic domain of CitA can be expressed as a soluble polyhistidine fusion protein (CitAP) 1The abbreviations used are: CitAP, CitA periplasmic domain; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; SeMet, selenomethionine; PYP, photoactive yellow protein. that exhibits highly specific citrate binding properties (5Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister K. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Biochemical investigations of the interactions between citrate and CitAP wild-type and mutant proteins have been reported previously (5Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister K. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Gerharz T. Reinelt S. Kaspar S. Scapozza L. Bott M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5917-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study we present the structure of CitAP in complex with citrate and molybdate, revealing the ligand-binding stereochemistry of an integral membrane sensor kinase and providing initial insights into possible mechanisms of signal transduction. Crystallization—CitAP was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a 15.3-kDa polyhistidine fusion protein and purified as previously described (5Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister K. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled CitAP was produced in BL21 (DE3) cells grown in M9 medium (0.04% glucose, w/v) as described (7Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Purified CitAP was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH adjusted to 8.0 with HCl at 20 °C. 1 mm Na-citrate was added to protein (16 mg/ml) prior to crystallization. Initial conditions for crystal growth were identified by microbatch trials performed at the High Throughput Crystallization Laboratory at the Hauptmann-Woodward Institute (Buffalo, NY) (8Luft J.R. Wolfley J. Jurisica I. Glasgow J. Fortier S. DeTitta G.T. J. Cryst. Growth. 2001; 232: 591-595Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Following optimization of conditions, crystals were grown in hanging drops by vapor diffusion against buffer containing 100 mm Na2MoO4, 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, and either 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol or 14% PEG-4000 and 15% glycerol for the native and SeMet-labeled protein, respectively. Protein and reservoir buffer were mixed 1:1. The best crystals were obtained at 16 and 27 °C for the native and labeled proteins, respectively. Prior to freezing in liquid N2 the crystals were soaked briefly in a solution of 0.5 mm Na-citrate, 25% (w/v) PEG-4000, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Structure Determination—Oscillation data were collected at ID 14-4 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at 100 K using an ADSC Q4R CCD detector. For phasing, data were collected from crystals of SeMet-labeled protein at the Se K-edge (λ = 0.9793 Å, 1° oscillations, 0.5 s, 180-mm plate distance). Diffraction data for crystals of native protein were collected at λ = 0.9393 Å (1° oscillations, 1 s, 140-mm plate distance). Data were processed in space group P1 using XDS (9Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). A test set was established containing 3% of the reflections chosen in thin resolution shells. The Matthews volume was estimated at 2.8 Å3/Da, assuming the presence of 10 molecules per asymmetric unit. Self-rotation functions also indicated the presence of up to five independent non-crystallographic 2-fold axes. Forty ordered Se sites were identified in the asymmetric unit using single wavelength anomalous techniques as implemented in SHELXD (10Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), corresponding to ten monomers. Initial phases were calculated using SHELXE (10Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) and improved using RESOLVE (11Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar), which automatically identified and applied 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). Ten clusters of very strong positive peaks in the electron density were used to determine initial NCS operators (these were later identified as Mo7O24 clusters). Model Building and Refinement—Using Arp/Warp 6.0 (12Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) and the CCP4 program suite (13Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), 1068 of the 1390 protein residues were placed in a solvent-flattened, 2-fold NCS-averaged initial electron density map. For the most completely traced monomer (132/139) all side chains were autodocked using the program GUISIDE (12Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The other nine copies were generated using the initial NCS operators. The resulting model was then refined against the native data set. Based on values of mean I/σI and R mrgd-F as a function of resolution (Table II), data to 1.6 Å resolution were used. In the first cycle the individual monomers were treated as rigid bodies. Subsequent cycles of simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization, and temperature-factor refinement against maximum-likelihood targets were followed by manual rebuilding, using the programs CNS (14Brunger A.T.

Tight NCS definitions were applied during refinement and were partially released in the final cycles as necessary to account for alternate conformations and crystal contacts.Table IIQuality of native data setResolutionCompleteness〈I/σI〉R symaRsym=Σhj|I^h-Ihj|/ΣhjIhj .R measbRmeas=(Σh(n/(n-1))0.5Σj|I^h-Ihj|)/(ΣhjIhj) with I^h=(ΣjIhj)/nj .R mrgd-FcR mrgd-F as defined in Ref. 57.No. reflectionsdNumber of reflections included in R factor calculations.20.00 Å0.59118.610.0910.1040.07330110.000.97026.610.0660.0730.03553206.000.98124.560.0680.0730.03226,9123.000.97822.570.0790.0840.036251,4202.300.97116.760.1030.1100.051352,8792.000.96412.270.1560.1650.080331,8391.900.9599.360.2310.2450.122160,8851.800.9567.460.3180.3380.166197,6801.700.9535.950.4380.4650.224246,5071.600.9274.240.6460.6870.338296,880total0.95811.880.1030.1100.0791,870,623a Rsym=Σhj|I^h-Ihj|/ΣhjIhj .b Rmeas=(Σh(n/(n-1))0.5Σj|I^h-Ihj|)/(ΣhjIhj) with I^h=(ΣjIhj)/nj .c R mrgd-F as defined in Ref. 57Diederichs K.

Open table in a new tab Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated in 100 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Na-azide, pH 6.0, in the presence or absence of 1 mm Na-citrate, respectively. Experiments were performed at 25 °C, and concentrations were held at 34 mg/ml. 100 μl of sample was loaded onto the column and eluted at 0.6 ml/min. Elution profiles were monitored by UV absorbance at 280 and 218 nm. Overall Structure—The structure of CitAP in complex with citrate was determined at an initial resolution of 1.9 Å using single wavelength anomalous diffraction data from crystals of SeMet-labeled CitAP (Table I and Fig. 1). The asymmetric unit contains 10 monomers (referred to here as monomers A-J). A model containing residues 5-135 of each CitAP monomer, ligand moieties, and 1573 water molecules was refined against native diffraction data to 1.6 Å resolution, yielding an R free of 19.0% with excellent geometry (Table I). Crystals formed only in the presence of molybdate. In the ligand-bound state, CitAP forms a mixed α/β-structure (Fig. 2, A and B) with a central five-stranded β-sheet containing residues 56-61, 66-68, 94-100, 104-110, and 121-128 (residue 2 of CitAP corresponds to residue 45 in the native CitA sequence). This sheet is flanked on one side by the protein N terminus, which forms two long, approximately parallel α-helices (residues 10-24 and 38-51) connected by a third, shorter α-helix nearly perpendicular to the first two (residues 27-34). The other side of the β-sheet is packed against the long peptide that connects strands S2 and S3 of the sheet and that contains a short 310-helix and a short α-helix. The sheet and the interstrand peptide together form a deep concave pocket that contains electron density for a 1:1 complex of the citrate ligand with an additional moiety well fit by the structure of MoO3 (16Zhou Z.H. Wan H.L. Tsai K.R. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 39: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), consistent with the presence of molybdate in the crystallization buffer (Fig. 1). In this complex, the molybdenum is octahedrally coordinated by the three oxo groups and a tridentate interaction with citrate (Figs. 1 and 2B). The discovery of a MoO3-citrate complex in the binding site was unexpected, because CitAP binds citrate in vitro in the absence of metal ions other than sodium (present in the buffer) and because Mg2+ appears to inhibit the interaction (5Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister K. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the role of metal ions in regulating the expression of the citrate fermentation genes has not been systematically investigated, except in the case of sodium, which is required (3Bott M. Meyer M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that CitAP can accommodate MoO3-citrate suggests that other metal-citrate complexes might also be recognized by CitA. Furthermore, in several systems, metal-citrate complexes have been implicated in regulating the transport of metals across the cell membrane. For example, in Bacillus subtilis, the homologous CitS/CitT two-component system regulates the expression of a Mg-citrate transport protein (17Yamamoto H. Murata M. Sekiguchi J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 898-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the outer membrane receptor/transporter FecA up-regulates its own transcription in response to ferric citrate binding (18Harle C. Kim I. Angerer A. Braun V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). By analogy, the ability of K. pneumoniae CitA to bind MoO3-citrate raises the possibility that the associated citrate carrier CitS (3Bott M. Meyer M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Van der Rest M.E. Siewe R.M. Abee T. Schwarz E. Oesterhelt D. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be able to transport not only free citrate but also metal-citrate complexes as well. In addition to the citrate-bound MoO3 group, two other non-protein moieties were identified (Fig. 2A). One forms an octahedral complex involving three water molecules, the main-chain carbonyl group of Pro-111, and the hydroxyl moieties of Ser-110 and Ser-24, and thus links the central β-sheet with the C-terminal end of the H1 α-helix. Its position is marked with a green sphere in Fig. 2A. Based on its coordination geometry (20Brese N.E. Okeeffe M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1991; 47: 192-197Crossref Scopus (7210) Google Scholar) and the composition of the mother liquor, this moiety has been modeled as a sodium ion. A second site with very strong electron density was found near the N and C termini and could be well fit by the structure of an isopolymolybdate cluster (Mo7O24; Fig. 2A, bottom) (21Gili P. Lorenzo-Luis P.A. Mederos A. Arrieta J.M. Germain G. Castineiras A. Carballo R. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1999; 295: 106-114Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, it represents the first example of a Mo7O24 cluster bound to a protein structure. Although unlikely to be physiologically relevant, the cluster mediates crystal packing interactions, consistent with the essential role of molybdenum for crystal formation. CitAP Has a PAS Fold—A structural data base search using DALI (22Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) revealed significant similarity between the CitA periplasmic ligand-binding domain described here and several members of the PAS superfamily. Homologues (Z ≥ 4.0) include the C-terminal domain of the IclR-type transcriptional regulator TM0065 (23Zhang R.G. Kim Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Laskowski R. Arrowsmith C. Edwards A. Joachimiak A.

Based on sequence homology, a PAS domain has been proposed in the cytoplasmic portion of CitA between the second transmembrane and the kinase domains (30Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) indicated the PAS fold of CitAP. Based on the structural similarity of CitAP and PYP (Fig. 3A), we aligned their sequences and that of FixL, because PYP and FixL represent the first structures determined for a PAS domain and for a ligand-binding PAS domain, respectively (24Genick U.K. Borgstahl G.E.O. Ng K. Ren Z. Pradervand C. Burke P.M. Srajer V. Teng T.Y. Schildkamp W. McRee D.E. Moffat K. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1471-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 28Gong W.M. Hao B.

Also included in the alignment are the sequences of the ligand-binding domains of the sensor kinases DcuS and PhoQ, both of which are homologous to CitA and are subjects of parallel structural studies (35Parac T.N. Coligaev B. Zientz E. Unden G. Peti W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 36Regelmann A.G. Lesley J.A. Mott C. Stokes L. Waldburger C.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5468-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The most strongly conserved feature of the PAS domain proteins is the presence of a central β-sheet (30Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superposition of the CitAP β-scaffold composed of the strands S1-S5, with the corresponding strands Aβ, Bβ, Gβ, Hβ, and Iβ of PYP reveals a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å for 39 Cα atoms (nomenclature for PYP PAS elements according to Ref. 28Gong W.M. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15177-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In contrast, the structural elements on either or both sides of the β-scaffold show a much greater variability (Fig. 3A). The two major helices H1 and H3 of CitAP are more elongated than the Aα- and Bα-helices in PYP and are connected by a short helical linker instead of a loop. N-terminal α-helices corresponding to those of CitAP are found in the YGK9 GAF domain, the 30 S ribosomal subunit, and (cyclically permuted) in TM0065 and profilin. They are completely absent in the FixL and HERG PAS domains and are not, in fact, required for PYP function (37Vreede J. Van der Horst M.A. Hellingwerf K.J. Crielaard W. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18434-18439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ligand-binding Site—Additional differences between CitAP and PYP are observed on the opposite side of the β-scaffold (Fig. 3A), where the ligand-binding site is located (Fig. 2). In this region, CitAP lacks the Cα-helix and the short Bβ-strand, and the helical connector H5 is significantly shorter than the corresponding Fα-helix of PYP or FixL (Fig. 3B). Because of the smaller size of the interstrand loops in this part of CitAP compared with PYP, citrate is bound closer to the β-sheet and its pocket is more closed than is the case for the PYP 4-hydroxycinnamoyl moiety. Overall, the PAS binding pockets characterized to date exhibit considerable variability, consistent with the need to accommodate their respective structurally diverse cognate ligands (23Zhang R.G.

Nevertheless, the binding pockets are typically located in the same general area between the β-sheet and the interstrand loops. Putative effector binding pockets similar in size and location to that of CitAP have also been found in the TM0065 signal-binding domain, the YGK9 GAF domain, and the HERG PAS domain, although the cognate ligands have not yet been identified for these domains (23Zhang R.G.

In detail, the CitAP ligand-binding groove is formed by the β-sheet together with helix H4 (residues 72-76) and two flanking random coils (residues 69-71 and 77-84) (Fig. 2). The relevant contacts between the protein and the MoO3-citrate can be divided into several groups. First, the binding of citrate is supported by hydrophobic contacts between citrate and the residues Tyr-56 and Met-79. Main-chain hydrogen bond interactions to citrate are mediated by Thr-58, Ser-101, and Leu-102. However, the majority of citrate-protein interactions are formed by hydrogens bonds originating from the side-chain atoms of Arg-66, His-69, Arg-107, Lys-109, and Ser-124. Except for Lys-109 and Ser-124, these residues are highly conserved among the CitA subfamily of histidine kinases (5Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister K. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2001000225,"Pyridochromanones were identified by high throughput screening as potent inhibitors of NAD+-dependent DNA ligase from Escherichia coli. Further characterization revealed that eubacterial DNA ligases from Gramnegative and Gram-positive sources were inhibited at nanomolar concentrations. In contrast, purified human DNA ligase I was not affected (IC50 > 75 μm), demonstrating remarkable specificity for the prokaryotic target. The binding mode is competitive with the eubacteria-specific cofactor NAD+, and no intercalation into DNA was detected. Accordingly, the compounds were bactericidal for the prominent human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus in the low μg/ml range, whereas eukaryotic cells were not affected up to 60 μg/ml. The hypothesis that inhibition of DNA ligase is the antibacterial principle was proven in studies with a temperature-sensitive ligase-deficient E. coli strain. This mutant was highly susceptible for pyridochromanones at elevated temperatures but was rescued by heterologous expression of human DNA ligase I. A physiological consequence of ligase inhibition in bacteria was massive DNA degradation, as visualized by fluorescence microscopy of labeled DNA. In summary, the pyridochromanones demonstrate that diverse eubacterial DNA ligases can be addressed by a single inhibitor without affecting eukaryotic ligases or other DNA-binding enzymes, which proves the value of DNA ligase as a novel target in antibacterial therapy.

Multiple drug resistance among bacterial pathogens is spreading even in developed countries and has made many currently available antibiotics ineffective (1WHO/CDS/CSR/DRS/2001.2. (2001) World Health Organization, Geneva, who.int/emc/amrpdfs/WHO_Global_Strategy_English.pdf.Google Scholar). As a consequence the number of reports on therapy failures increases and treatment costs rise, causing a growing public health problem. Thus, the search for novel antibacterial classes with innovative mechanisms of action is crucial to keep pace with the innate adaptability of the bacterial population. From the information revealed by sequencing more than 80 bacterial genomes, many novel target ideas have emerged in the last decade. However, even classical target areas such as cell wall, protein, or DNA synthesis contain many vital reactions not exploited in anti-bacterial therapy so far.DNA ligases are promising target candidates because they are indispensable for many fundamental processes in DNA metabolism including the linkage of Okazaki fragments during replication, recombination processes, and repair pathways requiring resynthesis of DNA (2Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 3Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Their crucial function is emphasized by the fact that eukaryotic cells contain several isoenzymes and that viruses encode their own ligases (3Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).The reaction catalyzed by the DNA ligases, the joining of nicked DNA strands, proceeds in three sequential nucleotidyl transfer reactions (2Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The first step is the nucleophilic attack by the active site lysine on the AMP moiety of a cofactor, resulting in a covalent enzyme-AMP intermediate. The AMP is then transferred to the 5′-phosphate end of the nicked duplex DNA and finally released when the ligase catalyzes the attack by the adjacent 3′-hydroxyl group during the formation of a phosphodiester bond.One aspect in considering DNA ligase as a potential antibacterial target is the distribution and homology among major bacterial pathogens. Eubacterial DNA ligases are extensively conserved over the entire length of the polypeptides (5Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast, if eubacterial and eukaryotic representatives are compared, there is little sequence homology apart from a short KXDG motif around the active site lysine. However, recent investigations reveal structural similarities especially in the AMP-binding region (3Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Different cofactor requirements between the distinct ligase families raise the chance to find specific inhibitors directed exclusively against the eubacterial enzymes. Although the cofactor of eukaryotic, archaeal, and viral DNA ligases is ATP, which is degraded to AMP and pyrophosphate in the course of ligation, all eubacteria possess a ligase which uses NAD+ for this purpose, the final products being AMP and NMN (3Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In studies with temperature-sensitive or deletion mutants NAD+-dependent DNA ligases were shown to be essential for survival in several bacterial species (e.g. LigA in Escherichia coli (6Dermody J.J. Robinson G.T. Sternglanz R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 701-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), YerG in Bacillus subtilis (7Petit M.A. Ehrlich S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4642-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and Lig in Staphylococcus aureus (8Kaczmarek F.S. Zaniewski R.P. Gootz T.D. Danley D.E. Mansour M.N. Griffor M.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3016-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)).For human DNA ligase I several natural product inhibitors have been described which mostly intercalate into DNA and which were evaluated for their potential as antitumor agents (9Montecucco A. Fontana M. Focher F. Lestingi M. Spadari S. Ciarrocchi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Montecucco A. Lestingi M. Rossignol J.M. Elder R.H.

J. 1996; 314: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is only one report on compounds targeting a eubacterial DNA ligase with some specificity. Ciarrocchi et al. (12Ciarrocchi G. MacPhee D.G. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2766-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that derivatives of the antimalaria drug chloroquine inhibited the E. coli DNA ligase LigA with IC50 values down to the single digit micromolar range. However, human DNA ligase I and the ligase of T4-bacteriophage were also affected at 10-fold higher concentrations (12Ciarrocchi G. MacPhee D.G. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2766-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we present the pyridochromanones as a novel class of potent DNA ligase inhibitors. The compounds inhibited the purified NAD+-dependent enzymes from both E. coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae in the nanomolar concentration range. This is to our knowledge the first demonstration of an inhibitory activity against a DNA ligase from a Gram-positive bacterium. Although the pyridochromanones interfere broadly with eubacterial DNA ligases, human DNA ligase I is not inhibited up to 75 μm demonstrating that it is possible to discriminate between NAD+- and ATP-dependent representatives with high specificity.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibacterial Compounds—Pyridochromanones were synthesized at Bayer according to a previously described procedure (13Nohara, A., Sugihara, H., and Ukawa, K. (January 16, 1992) German patent DE2809720Google Scholar). Ciprofloxacin was also prepared at Bayer, and novobiocin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.Measurement of E. coli DNA Ligase Activity via Detection of AMP Release—In this assay format we detected the AMP released by E. coli DNA ligase LigA upon ligation of oligonucleotides. Adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase were used to convert the AMP to ATP, which was quantified by the luminescence generated by ATP-dependent firefly luciferase. The nicked duplex template for DNA ligase was obtained by mixing 100 μm of each of the 3 oligonucleotides 5′-CGAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTGGG-3′, 5′-ACGGCCAGTGAATTCG-3′, and 5′-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG-3′ in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. The mixture was boiled for 10 min and chilled to room temperature. The ligase reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in a volume of 30 μl containing 0.05 unit of E. coli ligase (Roche), 0.62 μm ligase template, and 5 μm NAD+ in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.37 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.067% (w/v) BSA. 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CFU, colony-forming units; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; TE, 10 μm Tris/HCI, pH 8.0, 1 μm EDTA. Subsequently, a conversion mixture was added containing 0.3 unit of adenylate kinase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 unit of pyruvate kinase (Sigma-Aldrich), 750 μm CTP, 2.55 mm P-enolpyruvate, and 1 mm luciferin (Promega) in 20 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% (w/v) BSA) and incubation was continued for an additional 7 min. The luminescence reaction was started by adding 71 fmol of luciferase (Promega) in 20 μl of the same buffer and was immediately measured in a luminescence reader.Measurement of E. coli DNA Ligase Activity via Detection of Linked Oligonucleotides—This alternative ligase assay format designated here as “sealed duplex assay” is based on ligation of a fluorescein labeled oligonucleotide to a biotinylated oligonucleotide within a double strand duplex. After denaturation successful ligation was quantified by the amount of fluorescence captured on a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate. 200 μl/well of the following oligonucleotides (Eurogentec) were hybridized on StreptaWell HighBind plates (Roche) in H-buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 90 min at 20 °C: 5′-fluorescein-AAAATGACCCCC-3′ (320 pmol), 5′-CCCAGACAACGTCG-biotin-3′ (32 pmol), and 5′-CGACGTTGTCTGGGGGGGGTCATTTT-3′ (32 pmol). Wells were washed with 300 μl of ligase buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithioerythritol). Ligation was performed in 150 μl of ligase buffer with 0.5 unit of E. coli ligase and 28 μm NAD+ for 45 min at 20 °C followed by denaturation in 0.5% SDS, 0.5 m NaOH for 1 min. After washing the wells twice with 300 μl of washing buffer (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.1% BSA) fluorescence was measured in 100 μl of the same buffer at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm.Measurement of E. coli DNA Ligase Activity via Circularization of Linearized Plasmid DNA—EcoRI-digested and purified pBR322 (500 ng, Roche) was incubated with 0.125 unit of E. coli DNA ligase and 26 μm NAD+ in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.005% (w/v) BSA, and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 in a volume of 20 μl for 15 min at 12 °C. The ligation product was analyzed in a 0.5% agarose gel.Measurement of S. pneumoniae DNA Ligase Activity—The pneumococcal DNA ligase gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16b vector (Novagen). After expression in E. coli BL21DE3 (Stratagene) the N-terminally His-tagged protein was purified according to standard procedures. The AMP release assay was conducted with 0.01 μg of the purified protein.Measurement of the Activity of Human DNA Ligase I—The catalytic domain of human DNA ligase I (comprising amino acids 250–919) was excised by SacI and KpnI from the recombinant plasmid pBluescript SK–::hlig 250–919 (14Kodama K. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6093-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which was provided by D. E. Barnes (Clare Hall Laboratories, Herfordshire, UK). The fragment was cloned into pQE31 (Qiagen) and expressed in E. coli M15 (Qiagen). The N-terminally His-tagged protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and eluted with 0.3 mm imidazole according to standard protocols provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen). For measurement of the ligase activity the sealed duplex assay was used. The procedure was the same as described above for E. coli ligase except that ATP (1 mm) was used as a cofactor instead of NAD+. 2.5 μg of the purified human ligase I were employed per assay.Measurement of the Activity of DNA Topoisomerase II—DNA gyrase activity was determined by supercoiling of relaxed pUC18 DNA. For preparation of the template pUC18 was relaxed by E. coli topoisomerase I expressed as a N-terminally His-tagged protein from pET28a (Novagen) in E. coli BL21DE3pLysS (Stratagene). The relaxation mixture contained 40 μg of pUC18 and 15 μg of topoisomerase I in 300 μl of buffer (0.5× TBE buffer (pH 8) and 1 μm MgCl2) and was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The protein was removed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The relaxed plasmid was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and solubilized in the same buffer. For the supercoiling assay 100 ng of relaxed pUC18 DNA was incubated with 2 unit of Micrococcus luteus DNA gyrase (Invitrogen) in 35 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm ATP, and 0.004% (w/v) BSA for 60 min at 37 °C and analyzed in a 1% agarose gel.Gel Shift Assay—200 ng of plasmid DNA (pBluescript SK+, Stratagene) was incubated with increasing inhibitor concentrations in TE buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the DNA was analyzed in a 1% agarose gel. DAPER dye (Pierce) was used as a positive control.Ethidium Bromide Displacement Assay—This assay measured the DNA intercalating properties of a compound by its ability to compete with ethidium bromide for DNA binding. Detection of ethidium bromide displacement from DNA is based on the strong loss in fluorescence that occurs upon its detachment from the double helix (15Le Pecq J.-B. Paoletti C. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained in a volume of 100 μl, 6.6 μg of salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen), 5 μm ethidium bromide, 35 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Upon addition of the inhibitor in increasing concentrations the fluorescence of ethidium bromide was immediately detected at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 612 nm.Heterogeneous Expression of Human DNA Ligase I and S. aureus DNA Ligase in an E. coli ligA ts Mutant—The recombinant plasmid pBluescript SK–::hlig 250–919 containing the catalytic domain of human DNA ligase I (14Kodama K. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6093-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coli GR501 carrying the chromosomal temperature-sensitive ligA mutation lig251ts (6Dermody J.J. Robinson G.T. Sternglanz R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 701-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) The S. aureus lig gene was amplified from the genome of S. aureus 133 (deposited at the DSM strain collection, Braunschweig, Germany, under the number DSM 11832). Primers were derived from the sequence determined by the Institute for Genomic Research for S. aureus COL (tigr.org). The PCR product was cloned into SacII-and XhoI-digested pBluescript SK– (Stratagene) and transformed into E. coli GR501. As GR501 encoded no lac repressor, expression of the proteins from pBluescript SK– occurred constitutively. In growth experiments the strains expressing the human or S. aureus DNA ligases were compared with a control GR501 strain carrying empty pBluescript SK– without gene insertion. All strains were grown in Isosensitest broth (Oxoid) at 28 or 37 °C. For the control strain GR501 28 °C represents the permissive and 39 °C the restrictive temperature. At 37 °C growth was already strongly delayed. Propagation of the plasmids was ensured by the addition of 50 μg/ml ampicillin to the overnight culture. In the actual growth experiments the antibiotic was omitted.Determination of Antimicrobial Activity—MIC values were determined in broth microdilution assays in microtiter plates in a volume of 200 μl. Serial 2-fold dilutions of antibacterial compounds were seeded with a final inoculum of 104 CFU/ml in the case of S. aureus 133 and B. subtilis 168 trpC2 (16Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of 107 CFU/ml in the case of E. coli GR501, and of 103 CFU/ml in the case of Candida albicans ATCC 200498. Bacteria were grown in Isosensitest broth and C. albicans in yeast nitrogen base broth (Difco), the latter being supplemented with 7.2 g of Na2HPO4, 3.55 g of KH2PO4, and 10 g of glucose/liter of medium. After incubation for 18 h for bacteria or 24 h for C. albicans at 37 °C in ambient air, MICs were read as the lowest concentrations of compounds that prevented visible microbial growth. In the case of E. coli the medium contained 25 μg/ml polymyxin B nonapeptide (Sigma-Aldrich) to facilitate permeation of the inhibitors across the outer membrane.Time-kill Studies—An exponentially growing culture of S. aureus 133 in Isosensitest broth was treated at an A 600 of 0.2 with increasing inhibitor concentrations. The effect on growth and viability was investigated by monitoring the A 600 and the number of CFU for 5 h after addition of the antibacterial compound. For CFU quantification culture aliquots were serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and plated on Isosensitest agar. After incubation for 18 h at 37 °C visible colonies were counted.Determination of the Susceptibility of Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells—In this assay the fluorescent DNA-specific dye DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as viability marker. Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultivated in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 9% fetal calf serum, 1.8 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin (100 IU)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Roche). A number of 5 × 104 cells/ml was incubated with increasing concentrations of test compound in a volume of 1 ml in 24-well cell culture plates (Costar) for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After cultivation for an additional 48 h in fresh medium in the absence of inhibitor the culture medium was removed and the cells were stained for 1 h with 0.2 ml of a DAPI solution (5 μg/ml in distilled water). Finally, cells were transferred into a white microtiter plate (Dynatech Laboratories), and fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm.Microscopy of DAPI-stained B. subtilis—A B. subtilis 168 culture in Isosensitest broth was treated at an A 600 of 0.1 with increasing inhibitor concentrations. At various time points after addition of the inhibitor culture aliquots of 300 μl were removed and mixed with 11 μl of a DAPI solution (150 μg/ml in distilled water). After staining for 15 min on ice the samples were immobilized on an agar-coated microscope slide and analyzed in a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 397 nm. For coating the slides were dipped into a solution of 2% agar in distilled water.RESULTSPotent Inhibition of Isolated Bacterial DNA Ligases in Vitro—Based on purified DNA ligase LigA from E. coli we developed an assay to screen for low molecular weight compounds as selective inhibitors of bacterial DNA ligases. The successful ligation reaction was quantified by the amount of AMP released by the enzyme upon joining of two oligonucleotides. The AMP was subsequently converted to ATP by adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase, and the resulting ATP was finally visualized by luminescence generated by ATP-dependent firefly luciferase. High throughput screening and subsequent chemical variation of a promising screening hit led to the pyridochromanones, which inhibited E. coli DNA ligase with IC50 values in the nanomolar concentration range (Table I).Table IEffect of pyridochromanones on purified DNA ligases from different sources in vitroSimilar inhibitory concentrations were obtained in an alternative assay format relying on a totally different readout procedure (Table I). In this second ligation assay, designated here as sealed duplex assay, E. coli LigA was used to ligate a fluorescent oligonucleotide to a second biotinylated oligonucleotide within a double-strand duplex. After disruption of the duplex, successful ligation was quantified by the amount of fluorescence captured via the biotin anchor at a streptavidincoated microtiter plate. The pyridochromanones were equally potent in both assay systems clearly indicating that they are indeed direct inhibitors of the DNA ligase and that the signal reduction observed in the assays is not based on a potential interference with a component of the readout cascade. In addition to using short oligonucleotides as DNA templates we measured the ligation of nicked plasmid DNA. Compound 3, which is depicted as an example, showed beginning inhibition of this reaction at a concentration of 0.1 μm (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Pyridochromanones inhibit ligation of linearized plasmid DNA. Ligation of pBR322 by E. coli LigA (+Lig) in the absence and presence of rising concentrations of compound 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All experiments presented so far demonstrate inhibition of E. coli LigA which we chose for our initial screening as it is the prototype of an eubacterial DNA ligase, known for decades and characterized in detail (2Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the pyridochromanones interfere also with the activity of a Gram-positive DNA ligase we purified the S. pneumoniae Lig protein after heterologous expression in E. coli and assessed its activity in the “AMP release assay.” Submicromolar IC50 values were observed also for the pneumococcal enzyme (Table I) indicating that the inhibitory activity of the pyridochromanones covers NAD+-dependent DNA ligases from Gram-positive as well as from Gram-negative bacterial genera.High Specificity for NAD + -dependent Versus ATP-dependent DNA Ligases—With respect to a potential novel antibiotic we were interested only in such inhibitors that targeted specifically the bacterial DNA ligases but not the human counterparts. To address this question of specificity we chose the major replicative DNA ligase in humans (DNA ligase I) (17Soderhall S. Lindahl T. J. Biol.

Previous studies had shown that the C-terminal region of this enzyme comprising amino acids 250–919 is sufficient for catalytic activity (14Kodama K. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6093-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As this catalytic domain is far more stable in E. coli than the full-length protein, we overexpressed this region in E. coli and employed the purified enzyme in the sealed duplex assay. In contrast to the nanomolar inhibition of the bacterial DNA ligases the pyridochromanones showed IC50 values for the human enzyme that exceeded the highest concentration tested (75 μm, Table I). This finding demonstrates a remarkable specificity for the bacterial NAD+-dependent representatives with a selectivity index of more than 3 orders of magnitude for the most potent compounds.Pyridochromanones Inhibit DNA Ligase Competitively with Respect to NAD + —To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the pyridochromanones inhibit DNA ligase, we determined their influence on the ligase reaction employing the AMP release assay. In the absence of the inhibitor we determined a Km of 4 μm for NAD+ and of 0.1 μm for the DNA template, which is in good agreement with previously reported data (18Modrich P. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7502-7511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When in our inhibition studies the amount of NAD+ was increased from 0.5 to 64 μm in the presence of varying concentrations of compound 3 (0–400 nm) and saturating DNA amount (0.67 μm) the kinetics indicated competitive inhibition as visualized in a double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 2, A and B). The linear regression using the apparent Km value leads to a Ki of about 0.094 μm (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the binding of the DNA under saturating NAD+ concentration (64 μm) in the presence of the inhibitor seems to follow a non-competitive binding mode because V max remains reduced even at high DNA concentrations. These findings strongly suggest that the binding site of the pyridochromanones overlaps at least partially with that of the cofactor NAD+.Fig. 2Mode of DNA ligase inhibition by the pyridochromanones. Competitive inhibition with respect to NAD+ (A–C) and non-competitive inhibition with respect to DNA (D).

In the strain AL 811 (trpC2, ΔnadD, ΔthrC::xylR-nadD-spec R) the nadD gene coding for nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, which is essential for NAD+ biosynthesis (19Olland A.M. Underwood K.W. Czerwinski R.M. Lo M.C. Aulabaugh A. Bard J. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Sullivan F.X. Chopra R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3698-3707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was deleted at the original locus, and a chromosomal copy was expressed under the control of the xylose promoter. When AL 811 was grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.25% xylose ensuring full expression of NadD, the MIC for compound 3 was 6 μg/ml, whereas under conditions of promoter catabolite repression in the presence of 0.2% glucose the MIC dropped to 1.5 μg/ml. The observation that the lowered cytoplasmic NAD+ level enhances antibacterial activity supports the notion of competition with the cofactor also on the cellular level.Several experiments indicate that there is no general interaction of the pyridochromanones with DNA. In a gel shift assay plasmid DNA was incubated with rising inhibitor concentrations followed by analysis of its electrophoretic mobility. The pyridochromanones did not effect the migration behavior of the DNA up to the highest concentration tested (25 μm), whereas the intercalating DAPER dye (20Liu Z.R. Rill R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) had an IC50 below 5 μm. In addition, the ligase inhibitors were not able to displace ethidium bromide from DNA even at a concentration of 250 μm representing a 50-fold molar excess over ethidium bromide.Consistent with the result that no DNA interaction was observed, the pyridochromanones did not interfere with the activity of DNA gyrase from M. luteus, which we chose as an example of other DNA processing enzymes. The supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase was not affected up to 200 μm, whereas an IC50 of 60 nm was determined for novobiocin, which was employed as reference inhibitor (21Sugino A. Higgins N.P.

We have identified a conserved alternate splice isoform of BAFF, called ΔBAFF, which lacks 57 nt encoding the A–A1 loop and is co-expressed with BAFF in many mouse and human myeloid cells. Mouse ΔBAFF appears on the plasma membrane, but unlike BAFF it is inefficiently released by proteolysis. ΔBAFF can associate with BAFF in heteromultimers and diminish BAFF bioactivity and release. Thus, alternative splicing of the BAFF gene suppresses BAFF B cell stimulatory function in several ways, and ΔBAFF may promote other functions as well.

The monomer-monomer interactions are mediated by conserved hydrophobic residues, forming three grooves on the sides of the trimer that can interact with receptors.TNF family polypeptides are type II transmembrane proteins biologically active when presented in the membrane-bound position or in the soluble phase following release from the membrane by specific proteolysis in the membraneproximal “stalk” region (8Schneider P.

Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). BAFF has been found both on cell surfaces and in solution, but the proteases responsible for its release have not been identified. However, the basic cleavage site in the stalk region of BAFF is consistent with a furin-like convertase (8Schneider P. Mackay F. Steiner V. Hofmann K. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Ambrose C. Lawton P.

All of these receptors are expressed on B cells, although their expression levels change with maturation (17Hsu B.L. Harless S.M. Lindsley R.C. Hilbert D.M. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5993-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition, TACI is also expressed on activated T cells (18von Bulow G.U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Mice functionally deficient in BAFF-R (19Thompson J.S. Schneider P. Kalled S.L. Wang L. Lefevre E.A. Cachero T.G. Mackay F.

Science. 2001; 293: 2111-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), suggesting that the BAFF-R has a nonredundant function in maintaining B cell survival. In contrast, the TACI knockout is defective in responses to T cell-independent antigens but not in B cell survival. On the contrary, B cell numbers are increased 2-fold in mice lacking TACI (24Yan M.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The role of the BAFF/BCMA interaction is less well understood, as mouse BAFF binds mouse BCMA poorly and mice deficient in BCMA have no obvious phenotype (23Schiemann B. Gommerman J.L. Vora K.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4067-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, APRIL, the TNF-family ligand most closely related to BAFF, is able to bind to TACI and BCMA but not to the BAFF-R (26Xu S. Lam K.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4067-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Yu G. Boone T. Delaney J. Hawkins N. Kelley M. Ramakrishnan M. McCabe S. Qiu W.R. Kornuc M. Xia X.Z. Guo J. Stolina M.

It is known that human BAFF can form heteromultimers with APRIL, and this formation seems to be up-regulated in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases (28Roschke V. Sosnovtseva S. Ward C.D.

Because of the appeal of BAFF as a therapeutic target in systemic autoantibody diseases, the BAFF/BAFF-R interaction has been blocked experimentally. Importantly, treatment of lupus-prone mice or a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis with soluble Fc fusion proteins of TACI, which binds to BAFF, can reduce disease incidence and severity (32Gross J.A.

It is important to understand how the balance between BAFF-mediated B cell survival and autoimmunity is controlled.We have identified a splice isoform of BAFF that exists in both mouse and human. This form, which we call ΔBAFF because it lacks a 57-bp exon, can assemble disulfide-linked complexes both with itself and heteromultimerizes with full-length BAFF. The 57-bp deletion affects the compartmentalization of BAFF and receptor binding specificity. This study identifies ΔBAFF as a novel regulator of B cell survival.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Anti-FLAG M2 antibody-coupled agarose, anti-FLAG M2 antibody horseradish peroxidase (HRP), anti-polyhistidine (IgG2a clone HIS-1), and human IgG were purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-IgG2a HRP (Southern Biotechnology Assoc.), goat anti-rabbit Ig HRP (BD-Pharmingen), rabbit IgG anti-BAFF (ProSci Inc.), and anti-Myc HRP (Invitrogen) were also used. Human TACI-Fc fusion protein was a kind gift from Dr. M. Cancro (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia).Cell Culture—The cells lines J774, WEHI-3, and Pu5-1.8 were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cell lines HL-60, THP-1, and U937 were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented as for IMDM. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured essentially as described (33Vairo G. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although IMDM was used instead of RPMI 1640. In some instances, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml) or lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/ml) was added to the cultures for 8 h prior to harvest. 293 EBNA cells were maintained in IMDM as above but supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Stably transfected 293 EBNA cells expressing recombinant soluble BAFF were maintained in IMDM as above and supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma).Cloning Mouse BAFF—Total RNA was harvested from the cells of mouse (WEHI-3, J774, Pu5-1.8, B10.D2 bone marrow-derived macrophages, and B10.D2 splenocytes) or human (HL-60, U937, THP-1) origin using TRIzol (Invitrogen). CDNA was generated from 5 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) and SuperScript first strand synthesis system for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers instructions. 1–2 μl of cDNA reaction was used as template for the amplification of BAFF utilizing PLATINUM Pfx DNA polymerase enzyme from Invitrogen according to manufacturer's instructions. Soluble mouse BAFF was amplified from cDNA using the primers 5′-ACTGTGCTAGCTCAGGGACCAGAGGAAAC-3′ and 5′-TCTCGGATCCTGGATCACGCACTCCAGCAAG-3′. Full-length BAFF cDNA was amplified using 5′-CGGGCGGATCCCATGGATGAGTCTGCAAAGACC-3′ and 5′-TCTCCTCGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTGATA-3′. Human BAFF was amplified using 5′-ACTGTGCTAGCTCAGGGTCCAGAAGAAACA-3′ and 5′-TCTCGGATCCTAATAGCTACAGACATGGTGTAAGTA-3′.The amplification products were electrophoresed on 4% agarose gels and then gel-purified and cloned into pBluescript for DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems). The sequences for mouse and human ΔBAFF cDNA have been deposited in GenBank™ (accession numbers AY290823 and AY302751, respectively). Full-length mouse BAFF cDNA containing an upstream Myc tag on the N terminus was cloned into the bicistronic retroviral vector, pMXI-IRES-EGFP (34Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The full-length mouse ΔBAFF cDNA with an N-terminal FLAG tag was cloned into pMX1-IRES-TAC, where the EGFP cDNA from pMXI-IRES-EGFP was replaced with the cDNA encoding human CD25 as a downstream marker gene.Expression of BAFF Isoforms—S17 cells, a bone marrow stromal cell line, were infected by retroviruses encoding the mouse BAFF isoforms. Briefly, retroviruses were generated by the transfection of the constructs into Phoenix cells by CaPO4 precipitation, and the supernatant was harvested 48 h post-transfection. The supernatants containing the retroviruses and 1% (v/v) dioleoyltrimethylammoniumpropane (DOTAP, Roche Applied Science), were then incubated with monolayers of S17 cells for 2 h while being centrifuged at 2000 × g at 30 °C. The supernatant was replaced with fresh IMDM growth medium, and positively infected cells were sorted by flow cytometry based on their expression of EGFP, human CD25, or both. In some cases, full-length transmembrane BAFF isoforms were expressed transiently in 293T cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions.Recombinant sBAFF—Recombinant mouse soluble BAFF (sBAFF) and soluble delta BAFF (sΔBAFF) with either N-terminal polyhistidine or FLAG epitope tags, were subcloned into pCEP.Pu (pCEP4 containing a puromycin resistance cassette) or pCMV-Script (Stratagene). The pCep.Pu constructs were transfected into 293 EBNA cells (Invitrogen), and stable transfectants were selected for use with Geneticin (0.25 mg/ml) and puromycin (0.5 μg/ml). Recombinant soluble BAFF proteins were purified from culture supernatant using anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma).Biochemical Analysis of BAFF Isoforms—Culture supernatants from stably transfected 293 EBNA cells were used as a source of sBAFF and sΔBAFF. Recombinant BAFF was immunoprecipitated from culture supernatant using either anti-His or anti-FLAG-agarose beads. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, in some cases boiled in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and then incubated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) buffer and 1% Nonidet P-40; to half of the samples, 1000 units of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, samples were incubated with sample buffer (reducing and nonreducing) at 56 °C for 10 mins and then boiled for 5 min. Iodoacetamide was added, and the samples were electrophoresed on 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Nonreducing samples were treated in the same manner but were not initially denatured with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. In some cases, cell lysate and culture supernatant from S17 cells infected with various retroviruses expressing full-length BAFF isoform constructs was used. Western blotting was performed, and the BAFF isoforms were detected using anti-BAFF rabbit polyclonal, anti-His, anti-Myc, and anti-FLAG antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescent detection. In some cases, 1 × 107 S17 cells transduced with retroviruses were surface-iodinated using lactoperoxidase (Sigma) and hydrogen peroxide for 4 min before lysis with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Anti-FLAG-agarose beads were added to the lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation, and then the samples were washed five times with lysis buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and autoradiography.Receptor Binding Assay—50 μg of TACI-Fc fusion protein was iodinated using Iodogen-coated tubes and Na125I according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Endogen). Various concentrations of 125I-TACI-Fc was incubated with S17 cells alone or with retrovirally transduced S17 cells at 5 × 106 cells/ml for 3 h on ice prior to centrifugation through phthalate oils (3:2 (v/v) dibutyl phthalate/dioctyl phthalate; Aldrich) and bound 125I-TACI-Fc (cellular pellet) and free 125I-TACI-Fc (supernatant) were determined. Ratios of bound and free fractions were calculated, and Scatchard analysis was performed. In some cases, TACI-Fc and human IgG were incubated with lysates from the transduced S17 cell lines, and bound material was immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose beads before the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit anti-BAFF polyclonal antibody.BAFF Biological Assay—B cells were purified from spleen and lymph nodes from B10.D2 mice using CD43 or B220 MACS beads and columns (Miltenyi Biotec). CD43-B cells were cultured at 1 × 106 cells/ml with 10 μg/ml goat F(ab)2 anti-mouse IgM (Southern Biotechnology), plated on monolayers of various dilutions of irradiated S17 cells, and incubated for 72–96 h. Cell viability was assessed by forward and side scatter analysis performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). In some cases, B220+ B cells were incubated with titrations of recombinant purified soluble BAFF forms in medium containing 25 μg/ml polymyxin B and 10 μg/ml anti-IgM as described above.RESULTSIdentification of ΔBAFF Transcripts in Mouse and Human Myeloid Cells—In the course of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction cloning of BAFF from cDNA generated from the mouse myeloid cell line WEHI-3, we observed that half of the clones had a slightly smaller than expected size. Sequencing analysis revealed that the smaller transcript, herein known as ΔBAFF, was identical to the published BAFF sequence but lacked 57 bp encoding the predicted A to A1 strands and the intervening loop (Fig. 1A) (9Karpusas M. Cachero T.G. Qian F. Boriack-Sjodin A. Mullen C. Strauch K. Hsu Y.M. Kalled S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ΔBAFF isoform lacks Ile156 to Lys184, and Gly185 is substituted with an arginine. The loss of these residues maintains the reading frame, leading to the generation of a new N-linked glycosylation site at Asn155 in ΔBAFF, as threonine is now the second residue downstream. Fig. 1 illustrates the gene structures for both human (Fig. 1B) and mouse BAFF (Fig. 1C). The exons skipped in the ΔBAFF transcripts of human and mouse, respectively, are exons 3 and 4. The conservation of reading frames and homologies between mouse and human BAFF gene structures indicated a possible function for ΔBAFF.To assess whether ΔBAFF mRNA was expressed in other myeloid cells, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on a range of mouse and human cell lines (Fig. 2). ΔBAFF was identified in all of the myeloid cell lines investigated, although the ratio of BAFF to ΔBAFF varied between 1:1 and 3:1 in mouse cell lines. Primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages also expressed the alternatively spliced isoform (Fig 2A, lane 15). The ΔBAFF isoform was expressed in the human cell lines tested, although it was only a minor species. A larger transcript (BAFF-φ) was identified in the human cell lines, but sequencing revealed this transcript to be nonfunctional because of incomplete splicing of intronic sequences leading to premature stop codons. The smaller transcripts identified in HL-60, J774, Pu5-1.8, and B10.D2 macrophages were gel-purified and sequenced, revealing that they were identical to ΔBAFF, which was identified initially from WEHI-3 cDNA. These results indicate that ΔBAFF is expressed along with BAFF in many mouse and human myeloid cells and cell lines.Fig. 2Expression of ΔBAFF transcripts. A and B, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of BAFF and ΔBAFF transcripts from mouse (A) and human (B) sources. Cells used as sources of RNA are listed; some were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as indicated. The amplifications were performed on either cDNA reaction mixtures (designated +RT) or controls lacking reverse transcriptase (designated–RT). BMMϕ, bone marrow-derived macrophages. Ratios of BAFF:ΔBAFF as determined by densitometry are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ΔBAFF Has an Additional Glycosylation Site and Forms Disulfide-bonded Multimers—The biochemical properties of ΔBAFF were analyzed by generating peptide-tagged and truncated soluble BAFF and ΔBAFF (sBAFF and sΔBAFF, respectively) in 293 EBNA cells (Fig. 3A). Under reducing conditions, the sΔBAFF form (lane 5) had a higher apparent molecular weight than sBAFF (lane 2). Incubation with PNGase F revealed that the slowed mobility of sΔBAFF was the result of additional N-linked glycosylation at the newly generated site. The addition of PNGase F and reducing reagents led to the predicted mobility of sΔBAFF (Fig. 3A, lane 4) relative to sBAFF (lane 1). The electrophoretic mobility difference was more easily observed when both forms were co-expressed by 293 EBNA cells (lanes 7–9). Interestingly, under nonreducing conditions some multimers of sBAFF were observed (lane 3), but sΔBAFF appeared mostly as high molecular weight multimers (lanes 6 and 9), implying a role for disulfide bonds in multimer stabilization. We conclude that ΔBAFF mRNA encodes a protein with similarities to BAFF, including immunoreactivity and the ability to covalently homomultimerize.Fig. 3Biochemical characterization of ΔBAFF. A, recombinant soluble mouse BAFF isoforms were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant from 293 EBNA cells transfected with constructs encoding histidine-tagged sBAFF, FLAG-tagged sΔBAFF, or both. Recombinant soluble forms of BAFF were immunoprecipitated with either anti-His or anti-FLAG-agarose, and the samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE under either reducing or nonreducing conditions. Prior to SDS-PAGE, some samples were incubated with PNGase F. B, full-length BAFF isoforms were expressed by transiently transfecting 293T cells, and either whole cell lysates (left panel) or concentrated culture supernatant (right panel) were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Mock indicates 293T cells transiently transfected with empty expression vector. All of the samples (A and B) were then analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal rabbit anti-BAFF antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Unlike BAFF, ΔBAFF Is Not Efficiently Shed from Expressing Cells—Full-length transmembrane-anchored forms of BAFF and ΔBAFF cDNAs were transiently transfected into 293T cells to compare these isoforms for membrane expression and shedding into the extracellular medium. BAFF and ΔBAFF were detected in cell lysates, although Δ BAFF was expressed to a lesser extent (Fig. 3B, left panel). BAFF that had been cleaved was detected in the culture supernatant (Fig. 3B, right panel), whereas ΔBAFF was not detected. Interestingly, the amount of BAFF cleaved in cells co-expressing both forms of BAFF was less than BAFF alone, implying a role for ΔBAFF in inhibiting BAFF secretion.To further assess the biochemical properties of the transmembrane forms of BAFF and ΔBAFF in a system with stable expression, pMX1 retroviral constructs were generated encoding either full-length BAFF with an N-terminal Myc tag or full-length ΔBAFF with an N-terminal FLAG tag (Fig. 4A). The BAFF constructs were linked to either EGFP or human CD25 via an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence, which allowed detection of the positively infected cells using flow cytometry. A mouse bone marrow stromal cell line, S17, was infected with the various retroviruses, and infected cells were sorted based on expression of EGFP, human CD25, or both (Fig. 4B). Three stably expressing S17 cell lines were generated, S17 BAFF-Myc, S17 ΔBAFF-FLAG, and S17 BAFF-Myc + ΔBAFF-FLAG, which expressed either full-length BAFF or full-length ΔBAFF or co-expressed both, respectively. Similar expression levels of the BAFF isoforms were detected in the cell lysates of the transduced S17 cells (Fig. 4C, lanes 2–4). Analysis of the culture supernatant, however, revealed that although BAFF could be cleaved and released into the supernatant (Fig. 4C, lane 6), nothing was detected in supernatant from cells expressing ΔBAFF alone (lane 7). Culture supernatant from cells expressing both forms showed some cleavage of BAFF (Fig. 4C, lane 8) although this was reduced by 40%. As expected, no BAFF was detected in either lysate or supernatant from S17 cells alone (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 5). These data indicate that unlike BAFF, ΔBAFF is not released efficiently from expressing cells and that ΔBAFF expression might hinder release of BAFF.Fig. 4Expression and localization of protein encoded by full-length ΔBAFF cDNA. A, diagram of pMX retroviral constructs used to generate stable expression of either BAFF with an N-terminal Myc tag or ΔBAFF with an N-terminal FLAG tag. The BAFF or ΔBAFF cDNAs are linked via an IRES to the markers EGFP or human CD25, respectively. B, expression of BAFF constructs by S17 cells. S17 cells were left untreated or transduced with retroviruses encoding BAFF-Myc, ΔBAFF-FLAG, or a mixture of both retroviruses. Infected cells showed either green fluorescence (EGFP) or human (Hum) CD25 staining when analyzed by flow cytometry. C, the level of BAFF and ΔBAFF expression by S17 cells alone or after infection with BAFF-Myc, ΔBAFF-FLAG, or both retroviruses was determined by Western blotting of total cell lysate"

Liver regeneration studies with genetically altered mice that either prematurely expressed FoxM1B in hepatocytes or contained a hepatocyte-specific deletion of the Foxm1b allele demonstrated that FoxM1B is critical for regulating the expression of cell cycle genes required for hepatocyte proliferation. Furthermore, preventing the decline in hepatocyte FoxM1B levels during aging was sufficient to increase regenerating hepatocyte proliferation and expression of cell cycle genes to levels found in young regenerating mouse liver. Although these liver regeneration studies demonstrated that FoxM1B is required for hepatocyte proliferation, whether FoxM1B regulates proliferation of cell types other than hepatocytes remains to be determined. Here, we developed a new TG mouse line in which the –800-base pair Rosa26 promoter was used to drive expression of the FoxM1B transgene in all mouse tissues and found that Rosa26-FoxM1B TG mice were healthy, displaying no developmental defects. We used butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) lung injury to demonstrate that premature expression of the FoxM1B transgene protein accelerated proliferation of different lung cell types, including alveolar type II epithelial cells, bronchial epithelial and smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells of pulmonary capillaries and arteries. This was associated with the earlier expression of the cell cycle promoting cyclin A2, cyclin E, cyclin B1, cyclin F, and cyclin dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1) genes and diminished protein levels of Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1. Taken together, these results suggest that increasing FoxM1B levels is an effective means to stimulate cellular proliferation during aging and in lung diseases such as emphysema.

In regenerating liver, FoxM1B expression is induced prior to hepatocyte DNA replication (S-phase), and its levels remain elevated throughout the period of proliferation, suggesting that it plays a critical role in regulating hepatocyte proliferation (5Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Premature expression of FoxM1B in regenerating transgenic (TG) hepatocytes causes an 8-h acceleration of hepatocyte entry into S-phase and mitosis by stimulating earlier expression of cell cycle genes (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Wang X. Hung N.-J. Costa R.H. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1404-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Liver regeneration studies with 12-month-old (old-aged) TG mice demonstrated that maintaining hepatocyte expression of FoxM1B increased regenerating hepatocyte proliferation and reestablished the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes to levels found in young regenerating mouse liver (7Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y. Ye H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Likewise, deletion of the Foxm1b fl/fl (LoxP targeted) allele using the Alb-Cre transgene resulted in a significant reduction in regenerating hepatocyte DNA replication and mitosis (8Wang X. Kiyokawa H. Dennewitz M.B. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16881-16886Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Reduced hepatocyte DNA replication was associated with increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21Cip1 (p21) protein and diminished expression of Cdc25A phosphatase, leading to decreased Cdk2 activation and progression into S-phase (8Wang X. Kiyokawa H. Dennewitz M.B. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16881-16886Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The decrease in hepatocyte mitosis was associated with diminished expression of the Cdc25B phosphatase and delayed accumulation of cyclin B1, which is required for cyclin B-Cdk1 kinase activation and entry into mitosis (8Wang X. Kiyokawa H. Dennewitz M.B. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16881-16886Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Therefore, diminished hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating Alb-Cre Foxm1b –/– liver was associated with altered expression of proteins that limit the Cdk1 and Cdk2 activity required for normal cell cycle progression into DNA replication and mitosis. These studies indicated that FoxM1B is required for cell cycle progression and that increased expression of FoxM1B in old-aged mice is sufficient to reestablish proliferation of regenerating hepatocytes. Butylated hydroxytoluene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene; BHT) is a phenolic antioxidant, of which a single administration causes extensive damage to peripheral lung epithelial cells with a substantial influx of inflammatory cells and subsequent pulmonary epithelial cell proliferation 2–4 days after injury (18Marino A.A. Mitchell J.T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1972; 140: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Adamson I.Y. Bowden D.H. Cote M.G. Witschi H. Lab. Invest. 1977; 36: 26-32PubMed Google Scholar). The initial alveolar epithelial cell injury and repair is followed by endothelial and smooth muscle cell damage and subsequent proliferation 3–5 days after lung injury (18Marino A.A. Mitchell J.T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1972; 140: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Adamson I.Y. Bowden D.H. Cote M.G. Witschi H. Lab. Invest. 1977; 36: 26-32PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that the cellular repair process following BHT lung injury is associated with a transient induction of pulmonary FoxM1B mRNA levels 2–6 days after treatment (20Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Shin B. Costa R.H. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L695-L704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we developed a new TG mouse line in which the –800-base pair Rosa26 promoter was used to drive ubiquitous expression of the FoxM1B transgene to examine whether premature FoxM1B expression in all pulmonary cell types would accelerate the onset of proliferation following lung injury. We showed that premature expression of FoxM1B transgene protein following BHT lung injury is capable of accelerating proliferation of cells derived from different embryonic cell lineages, including pulmonary epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. This stimulated proliferation was associated with the earlier increased expression of the cell cycle genes required for progression into DNA replication and mitosis. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that premature expression of FoxM1B accelerated proliferation of different cell lineages following lung injury, providing a unique mouse model to examine whether maintaining FoxM1B levels in all cell types will prevent the decline in cellular proliferation during aging. Rosa26-FoxM1B Mice and BHT Lung Injury—The –800-bp Rosa26 promoter region (a gift from Eric P. Sandgren, University of Wisconsin, Madison) has been reported to drive ubiquitous tissue expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in TG mice (21Kisseberth W.C. Brettingen N.T. Lohse J.K. Sandgren E.P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To ubiquitously express the FoxM1B transgene, we fused the –800-bp Rosa26 promoter region to the transthyretin (TTR) minigene construct containing the 2.7-kb human FoxM1B cDNA inserted into the second exon of the TTR minigene that was adjacent to the SV40 virus transcriptional termination sequences (4Ye H.

The initiating methionine ATG codon in the TTR first exon has been mutated, and translation of the FoxM1B protein therefore initiates with the AUG from the FoxM1B cDNA. This human FoxM1B cDNA lacks 800 nucleotides from the mRNA 3′-end, and this deletion stabilizes the FoxM1B transgene mRNA in quiescent cells as described previously (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We generated eight inbred FVB/N Rosa26-FoxM1B TG mouse lines as verified by PCR screening of mouse tail genomic DNA with TTR minigene-specific primers as described previously (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from different TG mouse organs using RNA-STAT-60 reagent following procedures recommended by the manufacturer (Tel-Test “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX). To measure mRNA levels of the FoxM1B transgene in different TG mouse tissues, RNase protection assays (RPAs) were performed with [32P]UTP-labeled antisense RNA synthesized from the TTR minigene as described previously (4Ye H.

BHT (Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil (Mazola) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml, and a single intraperitoneal injection of BHT (200 mg/kg body weight) was given to FoxM1B transgenic mice or their wild type (WT) littermates (20Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Shin B. Costa R.H. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L695-L704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the statistical significance of any observed differences, we used five mice per time point following BHT administration, which included 0, 24, 36, 42, 48, 72, 96, and 144 h after BHT lung injury. To examine DNA replication, mice were injected with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Sigma; 50 mg/g body weight) 2 h prior to harvesting lungs as described (26Kalinichenko V.V. Zhou Y. Shin B.

The mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation, and lung tissue was used to prepare total RNA and protein, or the lungs were inflated with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C, and then embedded in paraffin as described previously (20Kalinichenko V.V.

Antibody-antigen complexes were detected using biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pharmingen), avidin-alkaline phosphatase complex, and BCIP/NBT substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (27Kalinichenko V.V.

We also used rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-histone H3 antibody (PH3; Upstate Biotechnology; catalog number 06-570) and surfactant protein B (SPB) (gift from Dr. Whitsett) and detected the antibody-antigen complex using anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with FITC (Vector Laboratories).

In each lung, we counted the number of BrdUrd-positive nuclei per five 200× viewing fields of lung sections, and S.

RNase Protection Assay and Probes—Total mouse lung RNA was prepared at various time points following BHT lung injury using RNA-STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test “B” Inc.). RPAs were performed with [32P]UTP-labeled antisense RNA synthesized from the mouse Foxm1b exon4 genomic clone (6Wang X. Hung N.-J. Costa R.H.

Quantitation of expression levels was determined from PhosphorImager scans using the ImageQuant program (Amersham Biosciences). The ribosomal protein L32 or cyclophilin hybridization signals were used for normalization control between different RNA samples. Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts were prepared from mouse lung and subjected to Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibody against p21Cip1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500 dilution) or a monoclonal antibody against β-actin (clone AC-15; Sigma; 1:3000 dilution). Detection of the immune complex was accomplished by using secondary antibodies directly conjugated with horseradish peroxidase followed by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). β-actin protein levels were used for normalization control between different protein samples. Quantitation of expression levels was determined with Tiff files from scanned films by using the BioMax 1D program (Kodak). Generation of Rosa26 Promoter-FoxM1B Transgenic Mice— Our previous studies with TTR-FoxM1B TG mice showed that the FoxM1B transgene protein remained cytoplasmic in quiescent hepatocytes and, therefore, was unable to stimulate them to proliferation (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, following either partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) liver injury, the FoxM1B transgene protein translocated to the nucleus earlier and caused an 8-hour acceleration in the onset of hepatocyte DNA replication and mitosis (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Wang X. Hung N.-J. Costa R.H.

The –800-bp Rosa26 promoter region has been reported to drive ubiquitous tissue expression of the green fluorescent protein in TG mice (21Kisseberth W.C. Brettingen N.T. Lohse J.K. Sandgren E.P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To express FoxM1B in all mouse tissues, we fused the –800 bp Rosa26 promoter region (21Kisseberth W.C. Brettingen N.T. Lohse J.K.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) containing the 3′ truncated human 2.7-kb FoxM1B cDNA (Fig. 1A). We generated eight inbred Rosa26-FoxM1B FVB/N TG mouse lines as verified by PCR screening of mouse tail genomic DNA with TTR minigene-specific primers (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Consistent with cytoplasmic retention of the FoxM1B transgene protein in quiescent cells (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), none of the Rosa26-FoxM1B TG mice showed abnormal proliferation rates, nor did ectopic expression of the FoxM1B transgene protein influence development of any of TG organs examined (data not shown). RPAs with total RNA isolated from adult WT mouse tissues demonstrated that Foxm1b is abundantly expressed in thymus and testis, which contain a large population of proliferative cells (Fig. 1B). Lower levels of Foxm1b mRNA were found in spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, and ovaries, which possess lower numbers of dividing cells (Fig. 1B). Our previous studies demonstrated that quiescent adult TG liver exhibited stable expression of the FoxM1B transgene mRNA, which deleted 800 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated terminal sequences, suggesting that they mediated FoxM1B mRNA degradation in non-dividing cells (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because this 3′-end deletion stabilized the FoxM1B transgene mRNA in quiescent cells, this enabled us to determine a transgene mRNA expression pattern in TG mouse tissues by using an RPA with the TTR minigene probe (Fig. 1A). The RPA demonstrated that none of the WT tissue RNAs produced an RNase-resistant hybridization product of 310 nucleotides with the TTR transgene probe, which is indicative of FoxM1B transgene expression (Fig. 1C). Rosa26 FoxM1B TG mouse line number 10 exhibited the widest expression of the FoxM1B transgene in lung, liver, brain, thymus, heart, spleen, kidney, intestine, skeletal muscle, testis, and skin (Fig. 1C). The Rosa26 FoxM1B TG mouse lines 15, 27, 31, and 41 expressed the FoxM1B transgene in almost all of these tissues but exhibited lower transgene levels in the liver (Fig. 1C). Transgenic lines 17 and 21 lacked expression of transgene in all of the tissues examined (Fig. 1C), whereas TG line 28 displayed undetectable expression of the FoxM1B transgene in kidney, skin, intestine, and muscle (Fig. 1C). Premature Nuclear Localization of the FoxM1B Transgene Protein Accelerated Proliferation following BHT Lung Injury— The ubiquitously expressing Rosa26-FoxM1B TG mouse line 10 was selected to examine whether premature FoxM1B levels are sufficient to accelerate proliferation of different pulmonary cell types following BHT lung injury. A single intraperitoneal injection of BHT was given to either Rosa26-FoxM1B TG mice or their WT littermates, and five mice were sacrificed at each of the indicated time points after BHT treatment. Lung tissue was isolated and used for either paraffin embedding or RNA and protein preparation as described under “Materials and Methods.” RPA with BHT-injured lung RNA and the mouse Foxm1b genomic probe allowed us to measure endogenous mouse Foxm1b mRNA levels (6Wang X. Hung N.-J. Costa R.H. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1404-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the TTR minigene probe was used to measure expression of FoxM1B transgene mRNA (4Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Rosa26-FoxM1B TG lungs displayed detectable levels of the FoxM1B transgene mRNA at all time points following BHT lung injury, whereas Foxm1b levels were transiently induced in WT lungs between 36 and 96 h following BHT injury (Fig. 2). A slight decrease in FoxM1B transgene expression was found after 36 h following BHT injury, suggesting that proliferation may diminish activity of the Rosa26 promoter. Earlier nuclear staining of the FoxM1B transgene protein was detected at 24 h following BHT lung injury (Fig. 3A), and its nuclear staining persisted throughout the TG lung repair process (Fig. 3, C and E). In WT lungs, nuclear staining of Foxm1b became detectable at 36 h after BHT injury (Fig. 3D) and reached a maximum by the 42-h time point (Fig. 3F).Fig. 3FoxM1B transgenic lungs display premature nuclear staining of FoxM1B protein. At various intervals following BHT lung injury, lung sections were prepared from either Rosa26-FoxM1B TG mice (A, C, and E) or WT mice (B, D, and F) and used for immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the amino-terminal FoxM1B protein (4Ye H.

Here, we describe robust and quantitative Aβ degradation assays based on the novel substrate, fluorescein-Aβ-(1–40)-Lys-biotin (FAβB). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric analysis shows that FAβB is hydrolyzed at closely similar sites as wild-type Aβ by neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme, the two most widely studied Aβ-degrading proteases. The derivatized peptide is an avid substrate and is suitable for use with biological samples and in high throughput compound screening. The assays we have developed are easily implemented and are particularly useful for the generation of quantitative kinetic data, as we demonstrate by determining the kinetic parameters of FAβB degradation by several Aβ-degrading proteases, including plasmin, which has not previously been characterized.

Nevertheless, the causes of elevated brain Aβ levels in the vast majority of AD patients remain unknown. With the exception of rare familial forms of the disease, there is little evidence that AD is attributable to the overproduction of Aβ. Instead, failed clearance of the peptide, including defects in its proteolytic degradation, could underlie its accumulation with age, a possibility that is gaining increasing experimental support (1Selkoe D. Neuron. 2001; 32: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Significant elevations in cerebral Aβ levels have now been observed in vivo in gene-targeted mice lacking each of several Aβ-degrading proteases: neprilysin (NEP) (2Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y.

Progress in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the production of Aβ from its protein precursor, APP, by the β- and γ-secretases has depended critically on the development of sensitive, reliable, and accessible assays for quantifying Aβ levels in biological samples. More recently, assays for directly measuring the activity of the secretases have been described (9Ermolieff J. Loy J.A. Koelsch G. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16263Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Kimberly W.T. Esler W.P. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Gao J. Diehl T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S.

In contrast, relatively few techniques and assays for studying Aβ degradation have been reported, and the most commonly used general methods (e.g. measurement of radiolabeled peptides by trichloroacetic acid precipitation or HPLC) are cumbersome and ill suited for accurate quantification of kinetic constants or for high throughput assays. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed novel degradation assays based on a derivatized Aβ peptide, fluorescein-Aβ-(1–40)-Lys-biotin (FAβB). This substrate is efficiently degraded by several known Aβ-degrading proteases and shows a similar inhibition profile as wild-type Aβ in biological samples. The assays we describe are sensitive, quantitative, and easily implemented, with one version requiring no specialized equipment other than a fluorometer. In addition, we describe a versatile fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay that is both highly quantitative and suitable for high throughput compound screening. We use these assays to quantify the kinetics of Aβ degradation by IDE, NEP, and plasmin. Aβ Peptides—Fluorescein-Aβ-(1–40)-Lys-biotin and fluorescein-Aβ-(1–28)-biotin were synthesized by New England Peptide, Inc. (Fitchburg, MA). Biotin was attached to the carboxyl-terminal lysine side chain via an aminocaproic linker, and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (Sigma catalog no. C7153) was attached to the amino terminus via a peptide bond. Nonderivatized (wild-type) Aβ peptides were synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 433A) by 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-based methods. In preparation for quantitative kinetic determinations, aggregated species were removed by centrifuging freshly dissolved peptide (∼20 to ∼150 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 100,000 × g for 3 h and carefully removing the top two-thirds of the resulting supernatant, which was immediately aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until further use. Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Amino Acid Analysis—Samples in 50-mm glass tubes were dried in vacuo and then transferred to a hydrolysis vessel (Millipore Corp., Marloborough, MA; part no. 007603). Approximately 300 μl of 6 n HCl was added to the vessel, which was then alternatively purged with nitrogen and evacuated three times before being sealed under vacuum. Vapor phase hydrolysis was performed by heating at 110 °C for 22 h. Separation and quantitation of amino acids was carried out on a Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Absolute peptide concentrations typically ranged from one-half to one-third of the concentration calculated from lyophilized peptide weight. Proteases—The cDNA for human IDE beginning with the translation start site at Met42 was subcloned into the pFastBacHT vector (Invitrogen), which codes for an amino-terminal tag containing a His6 affinity tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. Baculovirus production and protein expression in Sf9 moth cells were performed at the Wistar Institute (University of Pennsylvania). Recombinant IDE protein was then purified from snap-frozen Sf9 cell pellets by cobalt metal affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech), and the affinity tag was removed by treatment with tobacco etch virus protease (1000 units/mg of recombinant protein) for 2 h at 22 °C (Invitrogen). The His6-containing tag and any residual tagged protein were separated from the cleaved IDE by cobalt affinity chromatography, followed by overnight dialysis against two changes of 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3, using a dialysis container with a 35-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Millipore). Finally, to separate full-length ∼113-kDa recombinant IDE from a prominent ∼70-kDa truncated species, the sample was washed and concentrated using a 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off centrifugal filter column (Amicon). Recombinant IDE was stored in aliquots in 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3, plus 20% glycerol at –80 °C until further use. Recombinant rabbit secreted NEP (sNEP) produced in P. Pastoris (12Beaulieu H. Elagoz A. Crine P. Rokeach L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 813-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Drs. Guy Boileau and Philippe Crine (University of Montreal). Human plasmin was purchased from Calbiochem/Novabiochem. Prior to initiation of quantitative studies, optimal conditions for each protease were determined by testing its activity in various buffers (e.g. HEPES, Tris-HCl, Bis-Trispropane, KH2PO4) containing either no salt or 100 mm NaCl and prepared at the pH optimum listed in the BRENDA enzyme data base (pH ∼7.4 in all cases). All proteases performed optimally in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 (Buffer A); thus, these conditions were used for all subsequent degradation assays. Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry—Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography was done on a Vydac diphenyl column (5 μm; 1 × 150 mm; Hesperia, CA), using a linear gradient (20–80%) of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min. All components were monitored by UV and visible light absorbance using a Surveyor PDA (three channel outputs at 214, 259, and 495 nm) with a scan rate of 1 Hz and scan step of 1 nm. A nanospray ion source with a 100-μm inner diameter-fused silica capillary was used to introduce the column effluent into an LCQDeca Mass Spectrometer, analyzed in a positive ion mode with a scan range of 200–2500 atomic mass units, using the following source conditions: capillary temperature, 250 °C; spray voltage, 4.56 kV; capillary voltage, 46.11 V; sheath gas, 86.96 (arbitrary units); auxiliary gas, 2.68 (arbitrary units). FAβB Degradation Assay Using Avidin-Agarose Precipitation (AP)— For progress curves and dose-response experiments, each protease (1–400 nm final concentration) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of Buffer A in 0.65-ml siliconized microcentrifuge tubes (Costar), and the reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of 6 μm FAβB. For kinetic determinations, different concentrations of FAβB (0.25–150 μm final concentration) were dissolved in 0.5 ml of Buffer A, and the reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of diluted protease. At various time points (0, 5, and 10 min), 80 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and quenched in 0.72 ml of Buffer A supplemented with the appropriate protease inhibitor (2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline for IDE and NEP or 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for plasmin). Uncleaved FAβB substrate was precipitated from each quenched reaction by the addition of suitable quantities of Neutravidin™-coated agarose beads (Pierce) followed by gentle rocking for 30 min and centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (containing cleaved fluorescein-Aβ fragments) was carefully transferred in three 200-μl aliquots to black 96-well plates (Nunc), and fluorescence intensity (488 excitation, 515 emission) was measured using a Victor2 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All AP assays were performed at 37 °C. Activity was normalized to control reactions containing either no protease or excess protease. Quantitative kinetic data were derived by hyperbolic regression analysis using the computer program HYPER.EXE created by John S. Easterby (University of Liverpool). FAβB Degradation Assays Using FP—FP degradation assays carried out at 37 °C were performed as above, except that 30-μl aliquots were quenched in 170 μl of Buffer A supplemented with 1 μm egg white avidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) plus appropriate protease inhibitor(s). After incubating at room temperature for 15 min, quenched reactions were loaded in quadruplicate onto “nonbinding surface” 384-well plates (Corning), and fluorescence polarization (excitation, 488; emission, 515) was determined using a Victor2 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Robot-assisted, High Throughput FP FAβB Degradation Assays— High throughput experiments were conducted on a customized apparatus (SAGIAN; Beckman) containing a 3-meter rail ORCA robot that integrates a Biomek FX liquid handling station, a SAGIAN core system, and SAGIAN six-plate shaker. Recombinant IDE (0.3–3 nm final concentration) dissolved in Buffer A (20 μl/well) was loaded onto “nonbinding surface” 384-well plates (Corning). Following a 20-min incubation period at room temperature, FAβB (1 μm) in Buffer A (20 μl/well) was added to initiate the reactions. Reactions were terminated with 10 μl/well Buffer A supplemented with 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline and 5 μm avidin. FP values were determined on an LJL Analyst HT (488-nm excitation, 515-nm emission). Performance of the assay in the high throughput format was evaluated by computing the Z-factor values (13Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5325) Google Scholar) according to the following formula, Z=1-(3*(σHI+σLO))X¯HI-X¯LO(Eq. 1) where σHI and σLO designate the S.D. values and X¯HI and X¯LO represent the means of data from internal controls representing 100 and 0% activity, respectively. Using this formula, an ideal assay would have a Z-factor value approaching 1.0, and assays with values below ∼0.5 would generally be considered unreliable. Inhibitor Profiles Determined in Rat Brain Membrane Fractions Using FAβB FP Versus 125I-Aβ-(1–40)-Trichloroacetic Acid Precipitation Assays—Fresh-frozen rat cerebral hemispheres were homogenized in 8 volumes (w/v) of 0.25 m sucrose in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After pelleting nuclei and unbroken cells, the supernatant was spun again at 100,000 × g for 1 h. This resulting supernatant was saved as the soluble fraction, and the membrane pellet was washed in 100 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11.3) to linearize microsomes and strip adventitiously associated proteins (14Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The membranes were pelleted by another 1-h spin at 100,000 × g, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and sonicated by a 10-s pulse with a model 300 sonic dismembrator (Fisher) set at 60% maximum power. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid-based protein assay (Pierce). For trichloroacetic acid precipitation-based Aβ degradation assays, 100 pm synthetic human 125I-Aβ-(1–40) (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml membrane fractions in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with or without various inhibitors. At various time points (e.g. 3 and 6 h), an aliquot of the sample was added to an equal volume of 15% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate uncleaved peptides. Following centrifugation, radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble pellet (undegraded peptide) and trichloroacetic acid supernatant (degraded peptide fragments) were determined, and the percentage of radiolabeled substrate degraded was calculated. The FP assay was performed as described above using identical quantities of the same brain membranes. Recombinant insulin, purified glucagon, thiorphan, and 1,10-phenanthroline were from Sigma. FAβB and Wild-type Aβ Are Cleaved at Similar Sites by IDE and NEP—To identify the cleavage sites of wild-type and derivatized Aβ peptides, aliquots of each peptide (10–50 μm final concentration) were digested with IDE or NEP for various lengths of time at 37 °C, and the resulting peptide fragments were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Consistent with previous reports (15Mukherjee A. Song E. Kihiko-Ehmann M. Goodman Jr., J.P. Pyrek J.S. Estus S. Hersh L.B. J.

The major peptide fragments detected immediately following IDE hydrolysis were, in order of abundance, Asp1-His14, Asp1-His13, Asp1-Lys28, Asp1-Phe19, and Phe20-Val40. Upon incubation with NEP, both wild-type Aβ-(1–40) and FAβB were cleaved predominantly at identical peptide bonds, including several detected previously (Glu9-Tyr10, Phe19-Phe20, Ala30-Ile31, and Glu33-Leu34) (18Howell S. Nalbantoglu J. Crine P. Peptides. 1995; 16: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) as well as others not previously reported (e.g. Ala2-Glu3, His13-His14) (Fig. 1B and Table II).

Sawyer W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Stationary fluorescent molecules, when excited with plane-polarized light, emit photons polarized in the same plane as (or at a fixed angle to) the light used for excitation. Fluorescent molecules in solution, by contrast, rotate (or tumble) at a rate that is inversely proportional to their mass. Because there is an appreciable time delay between absorption and emission of photons by the fluorescent molecule, tumbling causes emitted light to be depolarized relative to the plane-polarized light used for excitation. The degree of depolarization (reflecting the average mass of all fluoresceinated species) can be quantified accurately using appropriately equipped fluorometers. To effectively measure proteolysis using FP, there must be a substantial mass difference between the intact, fluorescently tagged substrate and the cleaved, fluorescently tagged proteolytic fragments. The addition of a biotin moiety at the opposite end of the molecule to the fluorescent tag allows the molecular weight of the intact substrate to be increased (to ∼70 kDa) by adding excess avidin at the end of the reaction. The molecular weights of the cleaved, fluoresceinated NH2-terminal fragments (<4 kDa), by contrast, remain unaffected by the presence of avidin and tumble rapidly. The relative amounts of cleaved and uncleaved substrate can then be accurately measured using FP. The robust and reproducible nature of our FP-based FAβB degradation assay is illustrated in Fig. 2A, which shows progress curves with very small S.D. values for the degradation of FAβB by IDE or by NEP. Because of concern about the tendency of Aβ peptides to aggregate and/or adsorb nonspecifically to the surfaces of reaction vessels, we also tested a version of the derivatized substrate lacking the hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids (i.e. fluorescein-Aβ-(1–28)-biotin). However, this species proved to be a relatively poor substrate for IDE and other Aβ-degrading proteases (data not shown) and was not pursued further. We were able to overcome adsorption problems associated with full-length FAβB substrate by adding 0.05% bovine serum albumin to the assay buffer and by keeping the substrate concentration above 20 nm (see below). Measurement of FAβB Proteolysis by Avidin-Agarose Precipitation—The FAβB substrate can be incorporated into another fluorescence-based degradation assay we developed that does not require the specialized equipment used to measure FP. In this assay, avidin-conjugated agarose beads are used to centrifugally separate uncleaved FAβB from the fluoresceinated (nonbiotinylated) amino-terminal proteolytic fragments; the amount of fluorescence remaining in the supernatant corresponds directly to the amount of proteolysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, this AP method yielded virtually identical results to the FP-based method in parallel experiments (cf. Fig. 2, A and B; see also Fig. 4, A and B). Whereas the AP assay has the advantage of requiring no specialized equipment, the requirement for a centrifugation step precludes its use in high throughput compound screening; consequently, our further work focused on the validation and miniaturization of the FP assay. Specificity of the FAβB Substrate in Biological Samples—To test the FP FAβB degradation assay with biological material, we determined the inhibition profile of FAβB using bicarbonate-washed rat brain membrane fractions, which contain a wide array of proteases, and compared the result with that determined using a standard 125I-Aβ-(1–40)/trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay (4Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E. Selkoe D.J. Guenette S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we have recently reported elsewhere (4Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E. Selkoe D.J. Guenette S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4162-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), the majority of 125I-Aβ-(1–40) degradation in membrane fractions is competitively inhibited by insulin or glucagon, which are avid IDE substrates, whereas a smaller fraction is inhibited by thiorphan, which is a potent inhibitor of NEP (Fig. 2C). 1,10-Phenanthroline, a broad spectrum inhibitor of zinc-metalloproteases, also strongly inhibited 125I-Aβ-(1–40) degradation, as expected. Hydrolysis of FAβB, determined in the same biological samples using the FP assay, exhibited a highly similar inhibition profile (Fig. 2D). Thus, FAβB is an avid substrate for multiple known Aβ-degrading proteases and is suitable for in vitro degradation assays on biological samples. Validation of the FP Assay—To directly test the linearity of the FP assay, we determined the polarization values produced by aliquots of FAβB (1 μm) containing predetermined percentages of uncleaved substrate and substrate previously digested with IDE or NEP. As shown in Fig. 3A, the change in polarization values, normalized to the maximum obtained with each protease, varied in a nearly linear fashion with percentage of hydrolyzed substrate. Because quantitative assays depend on accurate determinations of the initial velocities of substrate hydrolysis, which are typically determined from the first 10–20% of a progress curve, we quantified the deviation from linearity observed in this range. The FP assay was found to overestimate the initial velocity by ∼10% for hydrolysis by either protease (Fig. 3A). Hence, this figure was used as a correction factor in subsequent quantitative determinations (Fig. 4A). During the development of the FP assay, we initially sought to maintain a low (5–20 nm) substrate concentration before reading the polarization values, since such levels are typically used for FP applications. This constraint precluded attempts to miniaturize the assay for high throughput screening, because proteolysis was inefficient and highly variable at such low substrate concentrations and because protocols involving further dilution of the substrate were undesirable. However, additional testing revealed that the FP assay was actually most linear, in terms of absolute polarization values, in the range of substrate concentrations between 100 and 1000 nm (Fig. 3B). The working range could be extended further, provided the resultant data were normalized to empirically determined maximal and minimal polarization values at each substrate concentration (see below), and in practice, such normalization was routinely used. This range of suitable substrate concentrations in the FP assay had several practical benefits, particularly for kinetic analyses requiring variable concentrations of substrate. High Throughput FP Degradation Assay—To test the performance of the FP assay in a high throughput, robot-assisted format, various concentrations of recombinant IDE (0.3–3 nm final concentration) were transferred robotically to 384-well plates containing 0.2 μl of Me2SO (0.5% final concentration). The reactions were initiated by adding FAβB (0.5 μm final concentration) and terminated at various times by the addition of assay buffer containing 1,10-phenanthroline and avidin. The assay performed superiorly in this format (Fig. 3C), routinely yielding Z-factor values greater than 0.8 (see “Materials and Methods”). Kinetic Analysis of FAβB Degradation by IDE, NEP, and Plasmin—The AP and FP assays were used to obtain quantitative kinetic data for three different Aβ-degrading proteases: IDE, NEP, and plasmin. Data for endothelin-converting enzyme-1 and -2 were not determined due to lack of availability of the purified enzyme. Because even freshly dissolved Aβ peptides consist of unknown fractions of oligomerized species, we were careful to first remove aggregated FAβB peptides by high speed centrifugation and then quantify the absolute concentration of peptide by amino acid analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). Lineweaver-Burk plots of these kinetic determinations are illustrated in Fig. 4, A–C, whereas quantitative data derived by hyperbolic regression analysis of the raw data are provided in Table III. For each protease, very similar quantitative kinetic data were obtained with the AP and the FP assays, and the data were in even closer agreement after correcting for the slight overestimation in initial velocity that occurs with the FP assay (see above and Figs. 3A and 4A).Table IIIKinetic parameters of FAβB degradation by Aβ-degrading proteasesIDENEPPlasminFPaData calculated using correction factor derived from Fig. 3A.APFPaData calculated using correction factor derived from Fig. 3A.APFPaData calculated using correction factor derived from Fig. 3A.APkm (μm)0.82 ± 0.060.87 ± 0.1013.5 ± 1.214.4 ± 1.212.1 ± 1.810.9 ± 1.4v max (μm min-1)0.17 ± 0.010.16 ± 0.011.76 ± 0.121.77 ± 0.115.89 ± 0.534.71 ± 0.36k cat (min-1)256 ± 22221 ± 1188 ± 689 ± 6118 ± 1194 ± 7k cat/km (m-1 min-1)3.1 × 1082.5 × 1086.5 × 1066.2 × 1069.8 × 1068.6 × 106a Data calculated using correction factor derived from Fig. 3A. Open table in a new tab Applications of the FAβB Degradation Assays—To highlight the utility of the FP assay in generating highly reliable quantitative data, we performed several demonstration experiments using medium throughput protocols optimized for 96-well plates. Fig. 5A shows raw progress curves from a typical experiment that determined the IC50 for inhibition of IDE-mediated FAβB degradation by 1,10-phenanthroline. The dose-response relationship, determined from the average of three such experiments, is illustrated in Fig. 5B. Fig. 5C shows Lineweaver-Burk plots for inhibition of FAβB degradation by insulin, an avid substrate of IDE. Note that these results are characteristic of competitive inhibition, as expected. For comparison, Fig. 5D shows comparable data for inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide, an irreversible thiol-alkylating agent, and this experiment yielded the expected profile for a noncompetitive inhibitor. Collectively, these experiments show that the FP FAβB degradation assay is highly quantitative, reproducible, and capable of revealing insights into the detailed kinetics of Aβ-degrading proteases. Evidence emerging from numerous laboratories has highlighted the importance of Aβ-degrading proteases in regulating steady-state cerebral Aβ levels in vivo (2Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y.

Inherited defects in one or more of these proteases could explain Aβ accumulation in some cases of AD, but regardless of whether such genetic connections are found, these enzymes provide potentially attractive drug targets for treating all cases of the disease. However, traditional methods for studying Aβ degradation (e.g. trichloroacetic acid precipitation assays with iodinated Aβ, HPLC analysis of synthetic radiolabeled or unlabeled Aβ, and autoradiography of metabolically labeled Aβ) are ill suited for high throughput compound screening or routine quantitative assays. To meet this important need, we have developed and characterized versatile and quantitative assays that utilize the derivatized Aβ peptide, FAβB. Several lines of evidence indicate that degradation of FAβB is similar to that of wild-type Aβ. First, the derivatized peptide is avidly degraded by several different proteases that have been shown to degrade Aβ: IDE, NEP, and plasmin. Second, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric analysis shows that wild-type and derivatized Aβ are cleaved at nearly identical sites by IDE and NEP, the two most extensively characterized Aβ-degrading proteases. Third, degradation of FAβB and 125I-Aβ-(1–40) show closely similar inhibition profiles when incubated in biological samples containing an array of competing proteases. These findings suggest that the fluorescein and lysine-biotin moieties do not significantly alter the cleavage specificity of the substrates by the Aβ-degrading proteases investigated here. Additional support for the validity of our FAβB substrate comes from analysis of quantitative data from kinetic determinations. Independent analyses using the FP- and AP-based assays yielded quantitatively similar estimates of kinetic parameters for hydrolysis, and this pertained for all three Aβ-degrading proteases. Moreover, kinetic determinations using FAβB (Table I) yielded absolute quantitative data that are in good agreement with published values using wild-type synthetic Aβ. For instance, apparent km values of ∼2 μm have been reported for degradation of wild-type Aβ-(1–40) in independent studies utilizing purified (21Perez A. Morelli L. Cresto J.C. Castano E.M. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) or recombinant (22Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) human IDE. By comparison, the apparent km values obtained using our FP and AP assays were 0.82 and 0.87 μm, respectively. Whereas these values are lower than the published values, this discrepancy disappears after it is noted that about one-half to two-thirds of the lyophilized peptide was pelleted by high speed centrifugation and thus in an aggregated state that is incapable of degradation by IDE (see Ref. 23Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). Indeed, when freshly dissolved substrate was used, we obtained kinetic parameters that closely matched the published values for IDE (km = 2.11 ± 0.20 μm). These results suggest that caution should be exercised in interpreting kinetic data for Aβ degradation when the peptide's aggregation state has not been characterized. Our liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric analysis revealed that NEP-mediated hydrolysis of Aβ (both wild-type and derivatized) occurred at substantially more sites than previously reported by Howell et al. (18Howell S. Nalbantoglu J. Crine P. Peptides. 1995; 16: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), with considerable heterogeneity observed at the carboxyl terminus of the peptide (Fig. 1B). This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the latter study focused only on the initial peptide fragments detectable upon hydrolysis with NEP. However, it is also possible that our analysis was more sensitive, given the fact that the LC and MS analyses were coupled within the same instrument. Relative to IDE, it appears that NEP shows less cleavage specificity within Aβ. In addition, the km for hydrolysis of FAβB by NEP (∼14 μm) is more than 17 times larger than that for IDE (∼0.8 μm; see Table I). We note that comparison with reported km values for Aβ hydrolysis by NEP is complicated by the fact that we used a secreted form of rabbit NEP, whereas published values for wild-type Aβ degradation were determined using membrane-anchored NEP (24Shirotani K. Tsubuki S. Iwata N. Takaki Y. Harigaya W. Maruyama K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. Iwata H. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Saido T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21895-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, the secreted NEP used in this study has been directly compared with membrane-anchored NEP, and found to exhibit similar kinetics parameters using the preferred substrate, [d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (12Beaulieu H. Elagoz A. Crine P. Rokeach L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 813-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the km value for Aβ degradation by plasmin has not been determined previously. In conclusion, we have developed sensitive and quantitative assays for the study of the proteolytic degradation of Aβ. The assays are simple, highly reproducible, inexpensive, and suitable for high throughput screening. Implementation of these assays should yield novel insights into the detailed kinetics of various Aβ-degrading proteases and facilitate the identification of novel small molecule pharmacophores.

Chang for assistance with purification of recombinant IDE, and Dr. Li-An Yeh and Jake Ni for assistance with robotic screening."

The main focus of Raf regulation studies has been on phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and scaffolding proteins; however, Raf also has its own auto-regulatory domain. Removal of the N-terminal regulatory domain, initially discovered in the viral Raf oncogene (v-Raf), results in a kinase domain with high basal activity independent of Ras activation. In this report, we show that activating phosphorylations are still required for activity of the truncated C-terminal kinase domain (called 22W). The interaction between the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain is disrupted by activated Ras. Mutations in the Ras binding domain, cysteine-rich domain, or S259A do not affect the inhibition of 22W by the N-terminal domain. When phosphomimetic residues are substituted at the activating sites (DDED) in 22W, this results in a higher basal activity that is no longer inhibited by expression of the N-terminal domain, although binding to the N-terminal domain still occurs. Although the interaction between 22W/DDED and the N-terminal domain may be in a different conformation, the interaction is still disrupted by activated Ras. These data demonstrate that N-terminal domain binding to the kinase domain inhibits the activity of the kinase domain. However, this inhibition is relieved when the C-terminal kinase domain is activated by phosphorylation. Raf kinase is a key component in regulating the MAPK pathway.

There are three conserved regions (CR) 1The abbreviations used are: CR, conserved region; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; HEK, human embryonal kidney; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PAK, p21-activated kinase; RBD, Ras binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type. in Raf kinases, CR1, CR2, and CR3 (1Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). CR1 contains the Ras binding domain (RBD) and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and both bind the activated small GTPase Ras (2Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). CR2 is serine/threonine-rich, and CR3 is the catalytic kinase domain and contains several activating phosphorylation sites. Activated Ras binds to CR1 and recruits Raf to the plasma membrane, which is necessary for Raf activation. Phosphorylation of activating sites and dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites must be coordinated for full Raf activation. Once Raf is activated, it can phosphorylate and activate MEK, which is then able to phosphorylate and activate MAPK/ERK, which phosphorylates cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Raf was first identified as a retroviral oncogene v-Raf, which has a deletion of the 5′ end of the normal cellular gene encoding CR1 and CR2 (4Rapp U.R. Goldsborough M.D. Mark G.E. Bonner T.I.

This deletion correlates to an increase in transforming activity independent of Ras, which leads to the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain of Raf proteins has a regulatory function (5Bonner T.I.

In defining the minimal region required for cell transformation, deletion of both CR1 and CR2 but an intact kinase domain was required for high transforming activity (6Heidecker G. Huleihel M.

Biol. 1987; 7: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal region renders Raf kinase activity independent of Ras. The N-terminal domain serves the following two functions. 1) It binds to the activated form of the small GTPase Ras required for membrane recruitment. 2) It binds and suppresses the C-terminal kinase. Expression of the N terminus of c-Raf can inhibit Ras activation of the MAPK pathway in germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) in Xenopus oocytes by binding and sequestering activated Ras from endogenous c-Raf (10Cutler Jr., R.E.

The N-terminal half was also shown to co-immunoprecipitate and inhibit the C-terminal half of Raf. The mechanism of Raf activation may be similar to that of p21-activated kinase (PAK) (11Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The Rac and Cdc42, members of the Rho family of small GTPases, directly bind the N terminus of PAK and relieve an auto-inhibited conformation held together by intramolecular interactions. The new conformation allows phosphorylation of activating sites, which are thought to help maintain an open conformation of PAK. Two different mechanisms have given rise to oncogenic forms of Raf kinases. v-Raf has a deletion of the entire 5′ end of the cellular gene that encodes for the N-terminal regulatory domain. v-Raf has high transforming activity because of a loss of the auto-inhibitory domain. Recently, mutations in B-RAF were identified in 60% of human melanomas and identified B-RAF as an oncogene (12Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H.

A common oncogenic mutation of B-RAF has a Val to Glu mutation in the activation loop of the kinase domain and results in high kinase activity. This mutation, V599E, lies between two conserved phosphorylation sites, Thr-598 and Ser-601, in the activation loop of B-Raf, previously identified by our lab (14Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have shown that acidic residue substitutions of the phosphorylation residues in the activation loop elevates B-Raf kinase activity. Our studies on Raf regulation provides a molecular mechanism of how B-Raf is activated by oncogenic mutations associated with human cancers. Hence, relief of auto-inhibition and phosphomimetic mutation are two mechanisms that convert Raf to oncogenes. We sought to investigate the role of the N-terminal domain in Raf regulation and the effects of phosphorylation on the auto-inhibition induced by the N terminus. We observed that the activation loop sites are still necessary for kinase activity even when the auto-inhibitory effects of the N terminus are relieved. Phosphomimetic substitutions of the four activation sites with acid residues renders the kinase domain resistant to inhibition imposed by the N-terminal domain, although the interaction with the N-terminal domain is not disrupted. Furthermore, this interaction is still disrupted by activated Ras. Our results suggest a complex mechanism of Raf regulation by phosphorylation and N terminus-C terminus interactions. Plasmid Constructs—FLAG-tagged full-length c-Raf was generously provided by Dr. Kevin Pumiglia. All c-Raf mutations were described previously and made by PCR mutagenesis. Truncated c-Raf constructs were created by PCR with flanking BamHI/EcoRI sites, cloned into pRK5-myc or pcDNA3 vectors. C-terminal deletions were 5′-tagged with Myc, and N-terminal deletions were 3′-tagged with FLAG. Clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were transfected in serum-free media using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Kinase Assay—For c-Raf kinase assays, HEK293 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 200 ng of the c-Raf constructs mentioned above with or without 10 ng of K-RasV12. 24 h after transfection, some cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of EGF for 3 min. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation, FLAG-tagged kinase was immunoprecipitated with anti-M2 antibody (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were collected by incubation with protein-G-Sepharose beads and washed with RIPA buffer, and a final wash was done in HEPES buffer. Immunoprecipitated c-Raf was then incubated with 0.1 μg of GST-MEK in 20 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. 14 μl of supernatant from the reaction was transferred to a new tube and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 6 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.1 μg of GST-ERK. 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 4 μg of GST-Elk-1 and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) was added to the reaction and incubated for an additional 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped upon the addition of SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Recombinant GST-MEK1, GST-ERK1, and GST-Elk-1 were expressed in bacteria and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. For ERK kinase assays, cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of HA-ERK and 50 ng of wild type, or mutant c-Raf constructs or 10 ng of K-RasV12. HA-tagged ERK kinase was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody (Covance) and protein-G-Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were incubated in kinase buffer containing 4 μg of GST-Elk-1 and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped and resolved as mentioned above. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—HEK293 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 200 ng of empty vector, wild type, or mutant c-Raf 22W constructs with or without 350 ng of c-Raf N-terminal wild type or mutant constructs. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and immunoprecipitated with anti-M2 antibody (Sigma) or anti-Myc antibody (Covance) and protein-G-Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The presence of the N terminus of c-Raf was detected with anti-Myc (9E10) antibody, and the C terminus of c-Raf was detected with anti-FLAG antibody. Anti-HA (Covance), anti-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PY20 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-Raf (Cell Signaling), and anti-phospho-ERK (BioSource) antibodies were also used in this study. Both Relief of Auto-inhibition and Phosphorylation of Activating Sites Contribute to c-Raf Activation—The maintenance of the auto-inhibited state is facilitated by a pair of 14-3-3-binding sites in c-Raf, Ser-259 in the N terminus, and Ser-621 in the C terminus (16Dent P.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and mutation of this site to alanine results in high basal activity. To determine whether the removal of an inhibitory signal was sufficient to activate Raf or whether other phosphorylation events must occur, we made alanine or phenylalanine mutations of the four activating phosphorylation sites, S338A, Y341F, and T491A/S494A (AA), in the background of S259A, and we assessed these mutants for their Raf kinase activity (Fig. 1A). The constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to a Raf in vitro kinase assay. Wild type c-Raf has low basal activity that is increased when Ser-259 is mutated to alanine. Mutation of the activating phosphorylation sites to alanine decreases the high basal activity of S259A. However, phosphomimetic substitution of these activation sites (S259A/DDED) further increases the basal activity of S259A. These data suggest that removal of the inhibitory phosphorylation site in full-length c-Raf is not sufficient for Raf activation, and activating phosphorylation sites are still required. The Ser-259 mutants have an intact RBD, which can still bind activated Ras at the plasma membrane, and CRD, which is thought to mediate the N terminus-C terminus interaction (10Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether the relief of auto-inhibition mediated by the N-terminal domain was sufficient for Raf activation, we deleted the first 304 amino acids of c-Raf, which consisted of CR1 and CR2, and we assessed the kinase activity of the C-terminal domain construct (305–648, called 22W). Consistent with the high transforming activity (24Stanton Jr., V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), 22W has high basal kinase activity (Fig. 1B) compared with full-length c-Raf. When the activating phosphorylation sites are mutated to alanine or phenylalanine, the high basal activity is suppressed (Fig. 1C). When these sites are substituted by phosphomimetic residues, the high basal activity of 22W is slightly increased. Hence, removal of an inhibitory signal or auto-inhibitory domain still requires activating phosphorylation sites to activate Raf kinase. The N Terminus of c-Raf Is Able to Inhibit ERK Activation by the C-terminal Kinase Domain of Raf—Expression of the N-terminal domain of Raf, consisting of two Ras-binding sites, was shown to inhibit GVBD induced by activated Ras or the catalytic domain of c-Raf in Xenopus oocytes (10Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the N-terminal domain of Raf may inhibit the function of the C-terminal kinase domain. To test if Raf-(1–305) was able to inhibit ERK activation, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with ERK with or without the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–305) of c-Raf and stimulated with EGF or RasV12 (Fig. 2A). ERK activity was induced by EGF and RasV12; however, the co-expression of Raf-(1–305) inhibited the activation of ERK. This N-terminally mediated inhibition is presumably through binding of activated Ras (endogenous Ras in the case of EGF stimulation) and sequestering Ras from components of the MAPK pathway such as endogenous Raf. In defining the minimal region required for transformation, a range of deletions was identified that resulted in high transforming activity (6Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Stanton Jr., V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Two c-Raf deletion constructs, 325–648 and 305–648 (22W), were used to stimulate ERK phosphorylation at the TEY motif required for activity in the absence of EGF or RasV12 stimulation (Fig. 2B). The N terminus (1–305) was also able to inhibit ERK activity induced by the C terminus of c-Raf. The mode of inhibition in this case is assumed to be through the N terminus-C terminus interactions because the activity of these truncated c-Raf constructs is independent of Ras stimulation. We observed a doublet of Raf-(305–648) (Fig. 2B) likely because of phosphorylation. Similarly, slower migrating bands were also detected for Raf-(325–648). Interestingly, the slower migrating bands of the kinase domain (both Raf-(305–648) and Raf–(325–648)) were suppressed by N-terminal domain co-expression. These data suggest that the N-terminal domain inhibits the phosphorylation of the kinase domain and provides a possible mechanism of inhibition. The Interaction between the N Terminus and C Terminus Is Not Disrupted by Phosphomimetic Mutations in the C Terminus and Requires the Full N-terminal Domain—The N-terminal regulatory region of c-Raf is able to immunoprecipitate with the C-terminal catalytic region, and this interaction is thought to correlate with the inhibitory effect seen when the N terminus is co-expressed with the C terminus. To investigate the mechanism of inhibition, we tested whether the phosphomimetic substitutions of the four activating sites, Ser-338, Tyr-341, Thr-491, and Ser-494, could block the interaction between the N terminus and C terminus of c-Raf. S338D/Y341D (DD), T491E/S494D (ED), S338D/Y341D/T491E/S494D (DDED), and T491A/S494A (AA) substitutions were made on 22W and co-transfected with Raf-(1–305). The 22W constructs were immunoprecipitated, and the presence of the N terminus in the immunocomplexes was assessed by Western blot (Fig. 3A). The N terminus was able to co-immunoprecipitate with the 22W regardless of the mutation made. Acidic residue substitutions at these activation sites increased the basal activity of 22W (Fig. 1C). Although these substitutions may not fully mimic phosphorylation, these data suggest that the degree of activation of the C terminus does not alter the ability of the C terminus to associate with the N terminus. The inhibition of GVBD by the N terminus was also compromised when the CRD was mutated (10Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this region was the domain that mediated the interaction with the C terminus. By using N-terminal fragments in co-immunoprecipitation assays, we wanted to define the N-terminal region of interaction. The N-terminal fragments used spanned the CRD but deleted either the CR2 (fragment 1–190) or the RBD (fragment 130–305). These N-terminal fragments were co-transfected with 22W and immunoprecipitated, and the presence of 22W was assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). 22W was unable to co-immunoprecipitate with any of the fragments and was found in a complex only when expressed with the entire N terminal Raf-(1–305); however, it is possible these fragments may be unstable or misfolded. To address this, we made a CRD mutation of the conserved cysteines (C165S/C168S) (25Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The interaction with the CRD N-terminal mutant and 22W was still detectable by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Ras Regulates the Interaction between the N Terminus and C Terminus—The first step in Raf activation is Ras binding to Raf through the Ras binding domain (RBD) and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Although Ras binding has been part of the model of Raf activation, the main role of Ras binding has been in facilitating the membrane recruitment of Raf. We tested if activated Ras also aids in the dissociation of the N terminus and C terminus. Cells were transfected with 22W and the N terminus in the presence or absence of RasV12 or Src. When RasV12 was co-expressed, the interaction between Raf-(1–305) and 22W was disrupted, and Raf-(1–305) was no longer able to co-immunoprecipitate with 22W (Fig. 4A). This disruption was not seen when cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of Src. These data suggest that it is Ras that disrupts the interaction between the N and C termini of c-Raf and that activating kinases such as Src are not involved at this step. 14-3-3 binds phosphorylated residues in the N terminus and C terminus of c-Raf to facilitate the maintenance of an inactive c-Raf conformation as well as affecting the subcellular localization of c-Raf to non-activable complexes (16Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Jaumot M. Hancock J.F.

J. 2000; 351: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ras binding to the RBD may displace 14-3-3 from phosphorylated Ser-259 revealing the second Ras-binding site in the CRD (1Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ras binding disrupts the N terminus-22W interaction directly or indirectly by displacing 14-3-3 from the N terminus, we used a N-terminal mutant, Raf-(1–305/S259A) in co-immunoprecipitation assays. The alanine mutation destroys the Ser-259 phosphorylation site and subsequently the 14-3-3-binding site. This S259A mutant was still able to co-immunoprecipitate with 22W, and this interaction was displaced by co-expression of RasV12 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, both the wild type and S259A N-terminal constructs were able to bind 22W-DDED better than the wild type 22W, and these interactions were also disrupted by RasV12 (Fig. 3A and 4B). Although 14-3-3 may facilitate or stabilize the interaction, the N-terminal 14-3-3-binding site, Ser-259, is not required for the N terminus to interact with the C terminus. However, the role of 14-3-3 in the regulation of the N terminus-C terminus conformation may not be ruled out. Endogenous 14-3-3 is still able to co-immunoprecipitate with the N-terminal domain mutant S259A (Fig. 4C), supporting the presence of other 14-3-3-binding sites (26Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W. Rogers-Graham K. Fu H. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20990-20993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The Phosphomimetic Mutation, 22W/DDED, Is Resistant to Inhibition by the N-terminal Domain—Mutations in the C terminus and the N terminus have no detectable negative affect on their interaction with each other. CRD and Ser-259 mutations are still able to interact with 22W. Activating substitutions in 22W that elevate the kinase activity also retain their interaction with the N terminus. We next sought to investigate if this interaction resulted in inhibition of activity. Cells were co-transfected with wild type 22W, N-terminal mutants, and ERK. ERK was immunoprecipitated and assayed for kinase activity (Fig. 5A). 22W was able to activate ERK and was inhibited when the wild type Raf-(1–305) was co-expressed. The RBD, CRD, and S259A N-terminal mutants were also able to inhibit ERK activation by 22W. Inhibition of 22W activity by the CRD mutant is contrary to the GVBD assays; however, this disparity may be due to differences in the assays used. 22W/DDED also showed strong activation of ERK, which could not be inhibited by any N-terminal construct (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the interaction between the N terminus and the C terminus does not necessarily result in inhibition of activity. Furthermore, the phosphomimetic mutations make 22W resistant to inhibition imposed by the N-terminal domain. We have previously reported that all four activating phosphorylation sites are required for full c-Raf kinase activity. Mutating all four sites to phosphomimetic residues also renders the C-terminal domain resistant to inhibition by the N-terminal domain. We then assessed whether this resistance to inhibition was due to the Ser-338/Tyr-341 regulatory sites, which lie just upstream of the kinase domain, or the Thr-491/Ser-494 activation loop sites. 22W/DD and 22W/ED both have high basal kinase activity (Figs. 1C and 5C). When 22W/DD and 22W/ED were co-transfected with Raf-(1–305) and ERK, Raf-(1–305) was able to inhibit 22W/ED-activated ERK phosphorylation on the TEY motif (Fig. 5C). However, 22W/DD activity was mostly resistant to inhibition by Raf-(1–305). These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-338/Tyr-341 may play an important role to relieve the inhibitory effect by the N-terminal domain. The N terminus was able to inhibit 22W but not when the activation sites were substituted by phosphomimetic residues. We then asked if the N terminus would be able to inhibit an activated full-length c-Raf kinase where the activation sites were not mutated. Mutation of Ser-259 to alanine in full-length c-Raf results in an elevated basal activity by eliminating an inhibitory phosphorylation site (Fig. 1A) (22Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). This mutant also eliminates a 14-3-3-binding site that is thought to facilitate an auto-inhibited state. c-Raf/S259A was co-transfected with HA-ERK with or without N-terminal constructs. The wild type N terminus can provide a 14-3-3-binding site through its Ser-259. c-Raf/S259A strongly activates ERK activity, as does 22W and 22W/DDED (Fig. 5D). However, where both wild type (1–305) and S259A (1–305/S259A) constructs of the N terminus can inhibit 22W activity, it cannot inhibit ERK activation by S259A-c-Raf. Our results suggest the full-length c-Raf/S259A mutant is resistant to inhibition by the N-terminal domain, and although 14-3-3 may contribute, the interaction between the N terminus and C terminus of c-Raf is not dependent on 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated Ser-259. The N-terminal Regulatory Domain Blocks Phosphorylation—The interaction between the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain does not necessarily correlate with inhibition of Raf activity. We hypothesized that this interaction may inhibit phosphorylation of activating sites. Wild type c-Raf and 22W were transfected with or without RasV12, immunoprecipitated, and the phosphorylation of Thr-491 was assessed by Western blot using a phospho-specific antibody (14Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Ras increases the phosphorylation of wild type c-Raf at the activation loop phosphorylation sites (Fig. 6A) (14Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of this site is higher in the 22W construct than the wild type full-length Raf and is not further increased by RasV12. When 22W is co-transfected with Raf-(1–305), the phosphorylation of Thr-491 is blocked (Fig. 6B). These data further support a role for the N-terminal domain in inhibiting the phosphorylation of the C-terminal kinase domain. We have demonstrated that activating phosphomimetic substitutions on the C-terminal domain of c-Raf are resistant to inhibition imposed by the auto-inhibitory N-terminal domain. The wild type C-terminal domain has high basal activity, which is suppressed by alanine mutations of the activating phosphorylation sites Ser-338, Tyr-341, Thr-491, and Ser-494. Phosphomimetic substitutions of the activating phosphorylation sites (DDED) in the C-terminal domain result in a slightly higher basal kinase activity in vitro and is able to activate ERK in vivo. Removing the inhibitory signal on Ser-259 is also able to induce high basal activity of the full-length c-Raf kinase. Phosphorylation on Ser-259 creates a 14-3-3-binding site and is thought to maintain c-Raf in an auto-inhibited conformation as well as mediate subcellular localization (27Dhillon A.S. Meikle S. Yazici Z. Eulitz M. Kolch W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser-259 to alanine results in high basal activity that is suppressed by alanine mutations of the activating phosphorylation sites and increased when these sites are substituted by acidic residues. Dephosphorylation of the inhibitory site, Ser-259, and phosphorylation of the activation sites, Ser-338, Tyr-341, Thr-491, and Ser-494, must be coordinated for full c-Raf kinase activity. These data also suggest that relief of auto-inhibition is not sufficient for full kinase activation and that this activation still relies on activating phosphorylation mechanisms. The inhibition of the kinase domain by the N-terminal domain is through direct interaction. From previous studies, it was hypothesized that this interaction was through the CRD of the N-terminal domain, and phosphomimetic substitution on an activation site outside of the activation loop interferes with this interaction (10Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This model of activation is similar to the model of PAK activation (11Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The N terminus of PAK binds the C terminus and blocks the kinase cleft. The small GTPases Rac or Cdc42 bind the N-terminal domain and open the conformation allowing phosphorylation of sites near the kinase domain that maintain this open conformation. The wild type N-terminal domain of c-Raf is able to co-immunoprecipitate with the C-terminal domain and inhibit its activity. The N-terminal domain is also able to co-immunoprecipitate with 22W/DDED; however, this interaction does not result in the inhibition of 22W/DDED activity. These observations suggest that phosphomimetic substitutions do not interfere with the interaction between the N terminus and the C terminus of c-Raf and that these activating mutations are resistant to the inhibitory effect imposed by the N terminus. We also tested if mutation of the CRD or Ser-259 14-3-3-binding site affected the interaction or function of the N-terminal domain in inhibiting the C-terminal domain. Both mutations were able to bind the wild type C-terminal domain. Hence, the CRD and Ser-259 are not critical for the interaction between the N and C termini, although they may contribute to the interaction. These N-terminal mutants were also able to inhibit the kinase activity of the C-terminal domain but not of the DDED mutant. This further supports that the DDED mutation is resistant to inhibition by the N terminus and that N terminus-C terminus interactions do not necessarily result in inhibition. Another role for the N terminus of c-Raf is to bind Ras, which leads to the recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane (28Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 29Mineo C. Anderson R.G. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10345-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This first step is essential to the activation of Raf. We observed that Ras disrupts the interaction between the N terminus and the C terminus. Ras is required not only for the recruitment c-Raf to the membrane but also to relieve the auto-inhibited conformation. Furthermore, although the interaction between the N terminus and 22W/DDED may be in an alternate conformation, this interaction is also disrupted by Ras. Our observations may further explain why the mutated B-RAF gene found in 60% of human melanomas has high transforming activity (12Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A. Mould C. Parker A. Stevens C. Watt S. Hooper S. Wilson R. Jayatilake H. Gusterson B.A. Cooper C. Shipley J. Hargrave D. Pritchard-Jones K. Maitland N. Chenevix-Trench G. Riggins G.J. Bigner D.D. Palmieri G. Cossu A. Flanagan A. Nicholson A. Ho J.W. Leung S.Y. Yuen S.T. Weber B.L. Seigler H.F. Darrow T.L. Paterson H. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Wooster R. Stratton M.R. Futreal P.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8397) Google Scholar) and is not inhibited by the presence of the N-terminal domain in the full-length kinase. The mutation V599E inserts a negative charge between the two conserved activation loop phosphorylation sites, Thr-598 and Ser-601, which are necessary for B-Raf activity (15Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This single Val to Glu mutation is sufficient to mimic phosphorylation of both activation loop sites and induce activity. The B-Raf-V599E activity would be unaffected by interactions between its N terminus and C terminus. Similarly, phosphomimetic substitutions on full-length c-Raf result in high basal activity as they are impervious to inhibition imposed by N-terminal interactions with the C terminus. We have further defined two roles for the N-terminal domain in the regulation of c-Raf activity. One role is to keep c-Raf in an auto-inhibited conformation making phosphorylation sites inaccessible to their kinases when cells are unstimulated. The second role is to bind Ras and mediate the recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane. Data from this report and previous studies suggest the following model for Raf regulation. Raf is maintained in an auto-inhibited state through N-terminal-C-terminal interactions and facilitated by 14-3-3 binding to sites in both domains. Upon Ras activation, GDP is exchanged for GTP and Ras is able to bind and recruit Raf to the membrane. Dephosphorylation on Ser-259 releases 14-3-3; however, N- and C-terminal domains are still able to interact. The loss of Ser-259 phosphorylation and Ras binding may occur concomitantly. The N-terminal and C-terminal domain interactions are disrupted by GTP-bound Ras, and the activating phosphorylation sites are unmasked and available to be phosphorylated by activating kinases. Once the activating sites are phosphorylated, the kinase is active and resistant to inhibition by the N-terminal domain. Therefore, activated Raf maintains high kinase activity even when dissociated from membrane-bound Ras. Consistent with this model is our observation that 22W/DDED binds the N-terminal domain but is not inhibited by the interaction. The main inhibitory function of the N-terminal domain is likely to prevent the phosphorylation and activation of the C-terminal kinase domain. Co-immunoprecipitation of the N-terminal domain with the C-terminal domain shows less phosphorylation on the activation loop site Thr-491. Furthermore, it has been reported that the interaction between PAK, the Ser-338 kinase, and Raf is enhanced by the deletion of the N-terminal regulatory domain of Raf (30Zang M. Hayne C. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4395-4405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The relief of autoinhibition as well as dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites and phosphorylation of activating sites must occur to reach full Raf activation.

https://openalex.org/W1974224154,"Cell death linked to oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in acute pancreatitis. The severe DNA damage, which is beyond the capacity of the DNA repair proteins, triggers apoptosis. It has been hypothesized that oxidative stress may induce a decrease in the Ku70 and Ku80 levels and apoptosis in pancreatic acinar cells. In this study, it was found that oxidative stress caused by glucose oxidase (GO) acting on β-d-glucose, glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO), induced slight changes in cytoplasmic Ku70 and Ku80 but drastically induced a decrease in nuclear Ku70 and Ku80 both time- and concentration-dependently in AR42J cells. G/GO induced apoptosis determined by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, an increase in expression of p53 and Bax, and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression. G/GO-induced apoptosis was in parallel with the loss of nuclear Ku proteins in AR42J cells. Caspase-3 inhibitor prevented G/GO-induced nuclear Ku loss and cell death. G/GO did not induce apoptosis in the cells transfected with either the Ku70 or Ku80 expression gene but increased apoptosis in those transfected with the Ku dominant negative mutant. Pulse and pulse-chase results show that G/GO induced Ku70 and Ku80 syntheses, even though Ku70 and Ku80 were degraded both in cytoplasm and nucleus. G/GO-induced decrease in Ku binding to importin α and importin β reflects possible modification of nuclear import of Ku proteins. The importin β level was not changed by G/GO. These results demonstrate that nuclear decrease in Ku70 and Ku80 may result from the decrease in Ku binding to nuclear transporter importins and the degradation of Ku proteins. The nuclear loss of Ku proteins may underlie the mechanism of apoptosis in pancreatic acinar cells after oxidative stress.

Oxidative stress is regarded as a major pathogenic factor in acute pancreatitis (1Sanfey H. Bulkeley G.B. Cameron J.L. Ann. Surg. 1985; 201: 63-69Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was demonstrated by the high levels of lipid peroxide, which is an index of oxidative membrane damage, in the serum of the patients with acute pancreatitis (2Aho H.J. Nevalainen T.J.

Once produced, ROS can act as a molecular trigger for various inflammatory processes. They can attack the biological membranes directly and trigger the accumulation of neutrophils (10Petrone W.F. English D.K. Wong K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 159-1163Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and their adherence to the capillary wall (11Bjork J. Arfors K.E. Agents Actions. 1984; 11: 63-73Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that ROS play a central role in perpetuating the pancreatic inflammation and the development of extrapancreatic complications (12Guice K.S. Oldham K.T. Caty M.G. Ann. Surgery. 1989; 210: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Inflammation and acinar cell death are the hallmarks of both human and experimental pancreatitis (13Cohen M.C. Cohen S. Am. J.

Although significant progress in understanding the inflammatory response has been achieved over the past decade, the mechanisms of acinar cell death in pancreatitis remain largely unexplored. In pancreatitis, acinar cell death occurs by both necrosis and apoptosis (15Gukovskaya A.S. Perkins P. Zaninovic V. Sandoval D. Rutherford R. Fitzsimmons T. Pandol S.J. Poucell-Hatton S.

Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a programmed form of cell death that is characterized by a series of distinct morphological and biochemical changes including the condensation of nuclear chromatin and DNA fragmentation that occurs in response to a variety of stress-related stimuli (19Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar, 20Carson D.A. Ribeiro J.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1251-1254Abstract PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). One report suggested that severe forms of acute pancreatitis involve primarily necrosis, whereas the mild forms predominantly involve apoptosis and marginal amounts of necrosis of the exocrine pancreatitis (18Kaiser A.M. Saluja A.K. Sengupa A. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that apoptosis is a major mechanism of acinar cell death in various experimental models of acute pancreatitis, suggesting a role for apoptosis in the pathophysiology of the disease (21Kaiser A.M. Saluja A.K. Sengupta A. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sandoval D. Gukovskaya A. Reavey P. Gukovsky S. Sisk A. Braquet P. Pandol S.J. Poucell-Hatton S. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for apoptosis in pancreatic acinar cells remain to be defined.The Ku70 (70 kDa) and Ku80 (80 kDa) proteins are DNA-binding regulatory subunits of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) that are composed of a 470-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and Ku proteins (23Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24Bliss T.M. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5765-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Ku70 and Ku80 proteins act as the regulatory parts of the DNA-PK and initiate the repair process of DNA double-stranded breaks, which produce DNA fragmentation, by activating DNA-PK after binding to the DNA double-stranded breaks (23Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition to the regulatory function of the Ku proteins in DNA-PK, heterodimers of both Ku70 and Ku80 also have independent DNA repair functions. These include single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity and the binding and repair of broken single-stranded DNA, single-stranded nicks, gaps in DNA, and single-stranded to double-stranded transitions in DNA (23Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24Bliss T.M. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5765-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage to nucleic acids can produce adducts of the base residues and sugar residues, which may lead to the generation of single-stranded breaks. Less frequently, oxidation can cause cross-links to other molecules and double-stranded breaks (25Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3095) Google Scholar). Oxidative injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion in the rabbit spinal cord induces reversible neurological deficits with increased Ku-DNA binding activity, which is an indicator of a DNA-PK activation, whereas severe ischemia/reperfusion causes permanent deficits that are accompanied by decease in the Ku-DNA binding activity. This suggests that Ku has a defensive role against oxidative injury (26Shackelford D.A. Tobaru T. Zhang S. Zivin J.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4727-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryo fibroblasts derived from Ku80-null (Ku80–/–) mice were more susceptible to H2O2-triggered DNA damage than those from the wild-type mice (27Arrington E.D. Caldwell M.C. Kumaravel T.S. Lohani A. Joshi A. Evans M.K. Chen H.T. Nussenzweig A. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1166-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is assumed that Ku may play a role in the cell death mechanisms, particularly DNA fragmentation after oxidative stress, and that Ku reduction may involve the mechanism of apoptotic cell death.Several protease families are implicated in apoptosis, the most prominent being caspase (28Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteine-containing, aspartic acid-specific proteases that exist as zymogens in the soluble cytoplasm, the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and the nuclear matrix of virtually all cells (29Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the caspases cleave numerous cellular proteins, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (29Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). In fact, almost 100 cellular proteins have now been identified as potential caspase substrates during apoptosis, and most events in apoptosis appear to require a caspase-mediated proteolytic process (30Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenus S. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The 460-kDa catalytic subunit of DNA-PK is also substrate for caspase-3, which is activated by ischemia/reperfusion (26Shackelford D.A. Tobaru T. Zhang S. Zivin J.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4727-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ROS (31Matsura T. Kai M. Fujii Y. Ito H. Yamada K. Free Rad.

The reduction in the Ku-DNA binding activity (which is critical to DNA PK activation) after prolonged ischemia, which is accompanied by a reduction in the Ku protein and the proteolysis of PARP, suggests that a reduction in Ku might be involved downstream from the caspase-activating apoptotic pathway after ischemia/reperfusion (26Shackelford D.A. Tobaru T. Zhang S. Zivin J.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4727-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, four nucleoporins, Nup153, RanBP2, Nup214, and Tpr are cleaved by caspases during apoptosis (37Ferrando-May E. Cordes V. Biller-Ckovric I. Mirkovic J. Gorlich D. Nicotera P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nuclear transport factors, Ran, importin α, and importin β are not proteolytically processed but redistribute across the nuclear envelope independently and prior to caspase activation (37Ferrando-May E. Cordes V. Biller-Ckovric I. Mirkovic J. Gorlich D. Nicotera P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Macromolecules with a molecular mass greater than 40–60 kDa enter the nucleus via active transport (38Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This transport route requires an adaptor protein, importin α, that links the nuclear cargo to importin β. This classical nuclear protein import requires energy, soluble transport factors, and nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), specialized signals that target proteins into the nucleus. In classical nuclear transport, these signals can be of two types: monopartite or bipartite. Monopartite signals are simple stretches of basic amino acids, whereas bipartite NLSs contain two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer region (39Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). The structure of the Ku70 NLS resembles the consensus of a bipartite-type NLS (40Koike M. Awaji T. Kataoka M. Tsujimoto G. Kartasova T. Koike A. Shiomi T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4031-4039PubMed Google Scholar). Both Ku70 NLS and Ku80 NLS are mediated to target to the nuclear rim by two compartments of the nuclear pore-targeting complex, importin α and importin β (40Koike M. Awaji T. Kataoka M. Tsujimoto G. Kartasova T. Koike A. Shiomi T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4031-4039PubMed Google Scholar, 41Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because the integrity of the nuclear pore may be essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport, caspase-mediated cleavage of nucleoporins may interfere nuclear translocation of Ku70 and Ku80 during apoptosis. Modifications in the machinery responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport, such as redistribution of Ran, importin α, and importin β between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, may inhibit nuclear import of Ku proteins during apoptosis.This study investigates the role of Ku70 and Ku80 on apoptotic cell death, which is induced by oxidative stress in pancreatic acinar AR42J cells. To explore the changes in the Ku proteins in the cell death pathway after oxidative stress, the Ku expression level, cell viability, and apoptosis were determined before and after treatment with H2O2. H2O2 is continuously generated by glucose oxidase (GO) acting on β-d-glucose, which is expressed as glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO). To determine the apoptotic cleavage of Ku, Ku expression, the intracellular distribution, and the cell viability were determined in the cells treated with G/GO in the presence or absence of the caspase-3 inhibitor. In addition, the cell viability and DNA fragmentation were compared among the wild-type cells, and the cells transfected with the pcDNA expression vector (pcN-3), the Ku dominant negative mutant (KuD/N), or either the Ku70 or Ku80 expression gene (Ku70+, Ku80+) treated with G/GO. Transfection was confirmed by an increase in Ku expression in the cells transfected with Ku70+ or Ku80+. Functional efficiency was determined by a loss of Ku-DNA binding activity in the cells transfected with KuD/N. As the apoptotic indices, PARP cleavage and the expression changes in p53, Bcl-2, and Bax were monitored in the wild-type cells treated with G/GO. To determine the effect of G/GO on Ku synthesis and degradation, the wild-type cells were pulsed or pulse-chased with [35S]methionine with or without the G/GO treatment and immunoprecipitated with anti-Ku70 or anti-Ku80 antibodies. To determine whether nuclear import of Ku proteins is inhibited by G/GO, in vitro binding assay using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-importin α fusion protein was performed in the wild-type cells treated with G/GO. The bound protein levels were determined by Western blotting for Ku70, Ku80, and importin β. The importin β level was monitored in the wild-type cells treated with or without G/GO.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture Condition—The rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells (pancreatoma, ATCC CRL 1492) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin).Plasmid Construction—The human cDNA for Ku70 and Ku80 was derived from human Ku70/pET1a and Ku80/pET1a, respectively. The insert was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), which was used for the Ku70 or Ku80 expression plasmid construct (as Ku70+ or Ku80+). A C-terminal human Ku80 (427–732) expression vector was generated by PCR using the Ku80 cDNA vector with a specific set of primers to generate the artificial KpnI and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The sequences of the primers used are as follows: 5′-TGCAGGTACCTATCATGGAAGACTTGCG-3′ and 5′-GGTACCTAGGTGCTGGATATAGTACAGG-3′. A KpnI-BamHI fragment of the product was subcloned into the KpnI and BamHI sites of the pcDNA3 vector, which was used for the C-terminal Ku80 (427–732) expression plasmid construct (as KuD/N). The PCR-derived part was confirmed by sequencing analysis. For in vitro binding assay, cDNA fragment encoding for the full-length rat importin-α was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI-XhoI site of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences).Transfection—Subconfluent AR42J cells, plated in a 10-cm culture dish, were transfected with each 10 μg of the pcDNA-3 vector (as pcDNA), the C-terminal Ku80 (427–732) expression plasmid construct (as KuD/N), the Ku70 or Ku80 expression plasmid construct (as Ku70+ or Ku80+) using N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h. After transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated at 3 × 104 cells/10-cm culture dish. The cells were then cultured overnight and treated with or without G/GO (5 milliunits) for 12 h. The cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from the cells. The Ku70 and Ku80 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis (see Fig. 6). The functional efficiency of the C-terminal Ku80 (427–732) expression gene was examined by determining the Ku-DNA binding activity with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (see Fig. 7). Transfection efficiency of the C-terminal Ku80 (427–732) expression gene using polyclonal antibody for Ku80 could not be determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown) as previously reported (42Marangoni E.

The wild-type, pcN-3, and KuD/N cells were treated with or without G/GO (5 milliunits/ml) for 12 h. The Ku-DNA binding activity was determined using 2 μg of the nuclear protein by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The result is the representative of five separate experiments.

The wild-type cells and the cells transfected with either the control pcDNA3 vector (pcN-3) or the C-terminal Ku80 (427–732) expression gene (KuD/N) or the cells transfected with either the Ku70 or Ku80 expression gene (Ku70+ or Ku80+) were used. The Ku-DNA binding activity and Western blotting for Ku70 and Ku80 were used to determine the functional efficiency and the transfection efficiency, respectively. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h for Western blotting for Ku70 and Ku80 in the whole cell extracts, the cytoplasmic extracts, and the nuclear extracts (see Fig. 6), as well as the Ku-DNA binding activity (see Fig. 7).To determine the extent of cell viability and apoptosis, the cells were treated with β-d-glucose (10 mm) and GO (3 and 5 milliunits/ml) and cultured for 24 h. The cell viability was determined directly by cell counting (trypan blue exclusion test) and indirectly by testing for the 3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT)-positive cells. DNA fragmentation, as assessed by the content of nucleosome-bound DNA, was used as the apoptotic index (see Fig. 8).Fig. 8Effect of G/GO on cell viability and DNA fragmentation in AR42J cells and the transfected cells (pcN-3, KuD/N, Ku70+, and Ku80+ cells). The wild-type cells and the transfected cells (pcN-3, KuD/N, Ku70+, and Ku80+ cells) were treated with or without G/GO (3 and 5 milliunits/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined directly by trypan blue exclusion test (A) and indirectly by MTT assay (B). The MTT-positive cells shown in pcN-3 cells were considered to be 100%. The relative MTT-positive cells were expressed as percentages of the pcN-3 cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess the extent of DNA fragmentation as the content of nucleosome-bound DNA (C).

For the time response of G/GO, the wild-type cells were treated with β-d-glucose (10 mm) and GO (5 milliunits/ml) for 4, 12, and 24 h to measure the cell viability (see Fig. 2A), and Western blotting was used to determine the Ku70 and Ku80 levels in the whole cell extracts, the cytoplasmic extracts, and the nuclear extracts (see Fig. 3, A and C). As apoptotic indices, Western blotting for PARP cleavage, p53, Bcl-2, and Bax was performed in the whole cell extracts after the G/GO treatment for 4, 8, and 12 h (see Fig. 2B). To measure the amount of H2O2 generated by G/GO, the wild-type cells were treated with GO (1, 5, and 10 milliunits/ml) and with β-d-glucose (10 mm) for 12 and 24 h, respectively, and the culture medium was analyzed for H2O2. The H2O2 generated by the G/GO in the medium was determined using the method reported by Thurman et al. (43Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2023743215,"Activation of the Gi protein-coupled A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) has been implicated in the inhibition of melanoma cell growth by deregulating protein kinase A and key components of the Wnt signaling pathway. Receptor activation results in internalization/recycling events that play an important role in turning on/off receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways. Thus, we hereby examined the association between receptor fate, receptor functionality, and tumor growth inhibition upon activation with the agonist 1-deoxy-1-[6-[[(3-iodophenyl)-methyl]amino]-9H-purine-9-yl]-N-methyl-β-d-ribofuranuronamide (IB-MECA). Results showed that melanoma cells highly expressed A3AR on the cell surface, which was rapidly internalized to the cytosol and “sorted”to the endosomes for recycling and to the lysosomes for degradation. Receptor distribution in the lysosomes was consistent with the down-regulation of receptor protein expression and was followed by mRNA and protein resynthesis. At each stage, receptor functionality was evidenced by the modulation in cAMP level and the downstream effectors protein kinase A, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. The A3AR antagonist MRS 1523 counteracted the internalization process as well as the modulation in the expression of the signaling proteins, demonstrating that the responses are A3AR-mediated. Supporting this notion are the in vivo studies showing tumor growth inhibition upon IB-MECA treatment and reverse of this response when IB-MECA was given in combination with MRS 1523. In addition, in melanoma tumor lesions derived from IB-MECA-treated mice, the expression level A3AR and the downstream key signaling proteins were modulated in the same pattern as was seen in vitro. Altogether, our observations tie the fate of A3AR to modulation of downstream molecular mechanisms leading to tumor growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo.

The incidence of melanoma in humans has increased steadily over the past years and is one of the more difficult neoplasias to clinically manage. Due to the limited response of malignant melanoma to conventional chemotherapy and the poor prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma, new therapies for this disease are needed. Our earlier studies demonstrated that IB-MECA, 1The abbreviations used are: IB-MECA, 1-deoxy-1-[6-[[(3-iodophenyl)methyl]amino]-9H-purine-9-yl]-N-methyl-β-d-ribofuranuronamide; AB-MECA, (N-6-(4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)-5′-N-methylcarbamoyladenosine; A3AR, A3 adenosine receptor; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKA, protein kinase A; PKB, protein kinase B; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: IB-MECA, 1-deoxy-1-[6-[[(3-iodophenyl)methyl]amino]-9H-purine-9-yl]-N-methyl-β-d-ribofuranuronamide; AB-MECA, (N-6-(4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)-5′-N-methylcarbamoyladenosine; A3AR, A3 adenosine receptor; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKA, protein kinase A; PKB, protein kinase B; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. a stable agonist to A3AR, inhibits the proliferation of neoplastic cells including metastatic melanoma (1Fishman P.

Physiol. 2001; 186: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A3AR belongs to the family of the Gi protein-associated cell surface receptors. Receptor activation leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, cAMP formation, and PKA expression. PKA contains a catalytic subunit, PKAc, which dissociates from the parent molecule upon activation with cAMP, resulting in the initiation of various signaling pathways (4Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5Poulsen S.A. Quinn R.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 619-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that PKAc phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3β (6Fang X. Yu S.X. Lu Y. Bast R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). We showed that IB-MECA alters the expression of GSK-3β and β-catenin, key components of the Wnt signaling pathway. Consequently it led to inhibition in the expression of the cell cycle progression genes, c-Myc and cyclin D1 (2Fishman P. Madi L. Bar-Yehuda S. Barer F. Del Valle L. Khalili K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4060-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This is an important observation as the Wnt pathway has been linked to the development of malignant melanoma (7Robbins P.F.

Acta. 2000; 1495: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is well established that Gi protein receptors are internalized to early endosomes upon agonist binding. Early endosomes serve as the major site of receptor recycling, whereas the late endosomes are involved in the delivery of the internalized receptor to the lysosomes (10Schmid S.L. Fuchs R. Male P. Mellman I. Cell. 1988; 52: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). One point to consider while targeting chronically a Gi protein receptor is that desensitization may lead to loss of a functional receptor from the cell surface. Interestingly, although A3AR expression level was found to be low in most body tissues, it is highly expressed in tumor cell lines (11Gessi S. Varani K. Merighi S. Morreli A. Ferrari D. Leung E.

Given that IB-MECA inhibits the growth of B16-F10 melanoma cells, it was hypothesized that these cells exhibit high receptor levels, which may serve as a target for tumor growth inhibition. We thus sought to explore the fate of A3AR upon IB-MECA activation and the consequences on the downstream molecular mechanisms leading to tumor growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that melanoma cells highly express A3AR, which upon IB-MECA stimulation rapidly internalizes to the cytosol and sorts to endosomes and lysosomes. Resynthesis and externalization of the receptor to the cell surface then occurs. Receptor functionality was demonstrated by the initiation of signal transduction pathways, which resulted in down-regulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1, leading to tumor growth suppression. Reagents—IB-MECA and MRS 1523 were purchased from RBI/Sigma. For both reagents, a stock solution of 10 mm was prepared in Me2SO, and further dilutions in RPMI medium were performed. RPMI, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics for cell cultures were obtained from Beit Haemek, Haifa, Israel. 125I-AB-MECA was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against murine and human A3AR, PKAc, c-Myc, and GSK-3β were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against murine and human cyclin D1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, and Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Chemicon, Temecula, CA. FITC-dextran, FITC-transferrin, and forskolin were obtained from Sigma, and 8-Bromo-cAMP and MG132 were obtained from Calbiochem. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—B16-F10 murine melanoma cells were grown for 24 h on coverslips coated with poly(l-lysine) (500 μg/ml). Cells were incubated with IB-MECA (10 nm) or with IB-MECA + MRS 1523 (100 nm). To further show the immunostaining specificity, splenocytes derived from wild type C57Bl/6J mice or A3AR-/-mice (14Montesinos M.C. Desai A. Delano D. Chen J.F. Fink J.S. Jacobson M.A. Cronstein B.N. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (kindly supplied by Marlene Jacobson from Merck Research Laboratories) were mounted on poly(l-lysine) slides for 3 h. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The fixed cells were rinsed three times for 1 min with PBS. To block nonspecific interaction of the antibodies, cells were incubated for 30 min in 4% normal goat serum in PBS (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100). For A3AR labeling, cells were then incubated with the primary antibody against A3AR at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS (1% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 24 h at 4 °C. After being washed three times for 3 min with PBS, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG at a dilution of 1:250 in PBS and incubated in the dark for 2 h. Cells were rinsed with PBS three more times and mounted with AM 100 media (Chemicon). For the colocalization experiments, the endosomes were labeled by incubating cells with 200 μg/ml FITC-transferrin in media lacking serum for 60 min before incubating with IB-MECA (10 nm) for different time periods. Lysosomes were labeled by incubating cells with 1 mg/ml FITC-dextran in RPMI with 1% serum at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were washed with media and reincubated for an additional 1.5 h in media lacking serum following incubation with IB-MECA (10 nm) for different time periods. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and the A3AR was labeled as mentioned above. Stained cells were visualized by a confocal microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 100 m, excitation at 553 and emission at 568 nm for Cy3, and at 492 and 520 nm, respectively, for fluorescein). Measurement of cAMP Production—B16-F10 melanoma cells (1 × 106/ml) were serum-starved overnight and then incubated with IBMECA. cAMP levels were determined under basal conditions and in cells challenged for 5, 15, and 30 min with forskolin (50 nm) in the presence or absence of IB-MECA (10 nm). Cells were lysed by the addition of 0.1 m HCl, and cell lysates were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 rpm. Dried samples were stored at -20 °C until used. For determination of cAMP production, a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit based on competitive protein binding method (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used. Four different experiments were performed. 125I-AB-MECA Cell Surface Binding—To evaluate receptor surface density upon IB-MECA treatment, a radioligand binding assay was carried out in intact B16-F10 melanoma cells (see Ref. 20Trincavelli M.L. Tuscano D. Marroni M. Falleni A. Gremigni V. Ceruti S. Abbracchio M.P. Jacobson K.A. Cattabeni F. Martini C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1373-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved overnight, washed with PBS, and then incubated with IB-MECA (10 nm) for different time periods at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, cells were placed on ice and then rapidly washed three times with 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 3.5 (acid T1 buffer) (to remove the agonist). Cells were then incubated with 0.5 nm125I-AB-MECA in T1 buffer at pH 8.12 at 4 °C for 120 min. The assay was performed in the absence or in the presence of 100 nm IB-MECA for nonspecific binding determination. This experiment was repeated three times. Western Blot Analysis—To detect the level of expression of the desired proteins in B16-F10 melanoma cells, Western blot analysis was performed. Cells were serum-starved overnight and then incubated in the presence and absence of IB-MECA (10 nm), MRS 1523 (100 nm), forskolin (50 nm), or MG132 (20 nm) for different time periods at 37 °C with 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then rinsed with ice-cold PBS and transferred to ice-cold lysis buffer (TNN buffer, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, Nonidet P-40 0.5% for 20 min). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 7500 × g. The supernatant was utilized for Western blot analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. Equal amounts of the sample (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, using 12% polyacrylamide gels. The resolved proteins were then electroblotted onto nitro-cellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the desired primary antibody (dilution 1:1000) for 24 h at 4 °C. To evaluate the specific binding, a blocking peptide corresponding to the peptide antigen (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. Blots were then washed and incubated with a secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were recorded using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) color development kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The optical density of the bands was quantified using an image analysis system and corrected by the optical density of the corresponding actin bands. Data presented in the different figures are representative of at least three different experiments. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from B16-F10 melanoma cells treated with IB-MECA (10 nm) or IB-MECA + MRS 1523 (100 nm) for 1 h, utilizing TRI reagent (Sigma). The samples were then subjected twice to phenol:chloroform extraction and washed with chloroform. RNA was precipitated with sodium acetate/ethanol following washing with ethanol, and then denatured, separated (25 μg/lane) in 1.1% formaldehyde agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond-N membrane. The 390-bp EcoRI fragment from A3AR cDNA clone of mouse (TAA3I.S), kindly supplied by Dr Kathia Ravid, was prepared by random-primed synthesis. Probes were used in RNA blot analysis at a hybridization temperature of 42 °C in the presence of 50% formamide. In Vivo Studies—C57BL/6J, male mice (Harlan Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) aged 2 months, weighing an average of 25 g, were used. Mice were maintained on a standardized pelleted diet and supplied with tap water. Experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel. The effect of IB-MECA on the development of subcutaneous tumors in C57Bl/6J mice was studied. B16-F10 (2.5 × 105) melanoma cells were subcutaneously injected to mice flank. Treatments as detailed below were administered orally twice daily, starting 24 h after the inoculation of the tumor cells. Four groups of mice were included in the study and treated as follows: 1) control, vehicle only; 2) IB-MECA, 10 μg/kg; 3) IB-MECA (10 μg/kg) + MRS 1523 (100 μg/kg); 4) MRS 1523, 100 μg/kg. On day 15, the mice were treated with IB-MECA and sacrificed after 1 h. Tumor size (width (W) and length (L)) was measured with a caliper and calculated according to the following formula: tumor Size = (W)2 × L/2. Tumor lesions were then excised and homogenized (Polytron, KINEMATICA), and protein was extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis for the determination of A3AR. Each group contained 15 mice, and the study was repeated three times. Statistical Analysis—The results were evaluated using the Student's t test, with statistical significance at p < 0.05. Comparison between the mean value of different experiments was carried out. Localization of A3AR in B16-F10 Melanoma Cells—To study receptor localization, we utilized confocal laser microscopy. Untreated cells (control) highly exhibited A3AR on the cell surface, as seen from the fluorescence intensity level. A marked decrease in the fluorescence level was noted after 5 min in the IB-MECA-treated cells. Exposure of the melanoma cells to the antagonist MRS 1523 in the presence of IB-MECA resulted in cell surface fluorescence intensity similar to that of the control (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that rapid receptor internalization took place upon IB-MECA treatment. The specificity of receptor immunostaining was evidenced by showing marked fluorescence in splenocytes derived from wild type mice as compared with negative staining in splenocytes from A3AR knockout mice (Fig. 1B). To further explore the time course kinetic of A3AR internalization, B16-F10 melanoma cells were exposed for different time periods to IB-MECA, and confocal microscopy analysis was carried out. Fig. 2 depicts the gradual internalization rate that occurred within a few minutes, resulting in the disappearance of the fluorescence after 6 min. Prolonged exposure (15 min) of the melanoma cells to IB-MECA resulted in receptor recycling to the cell surface. This was followed by internalization/recycling after longer incubation time periods (30 and 60 min). To confirm the observation that the fluorescence level is decreased as a result of internalization, we performed optical sectioning of the cells. In untreated cells (control), the receptor was exhibited on the cell surface (Fig. 3, upper left), and upon exposure to IB-MECA for 5 min, it was presented inside the cell (Fig. 3, upper right), supporting the notion that A3AR translocates from the membrane to the cytosol. After 15 and 60 min, the receptor was accumulated in the cytosol (Fig. 3, lower left and right).Fig. 3Time course of A3AR internalization/externalization in optical sections of B16-F10 melanoma cells (confocal microscopy imaging). B16-F10 melanoma cells were incubated for different time periods at 37 °C with 10 nm IB-MECA. Cells were labeled with the primary antibody against A3AR and with the secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody). Images were acquired as single midcellular optical sections at 20 scans/frame. In untreated cells, green fluorescence labeling, representing A3AR, was confined to the cell surface. After 5 min of incubation, green labeling was distributed in the cytosol. At 15 min, the green labeling was less abundant, and at 60 min, green fluorescence was distributed throughout the cytosol and on the cell surface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess differences in subcellular localization of A3AR following exposure to IB-MECA, we examined the time-dependent colocalization of A3AR with FITC-transferrin and FITC-dextran, known to accumulate in distinct subcellular compartments. Fig. 4A demonstrates that in unstimulated cells, the A3AR distribution (green) displays a membrane localization pattern, whereas transferrin (red) was accumulated in small vesicles. At 5 and 15 min after treatment with IB-MECA, a significant colocalization of A3AR and transferrin in the early endosomes was observed (colocalization shown in yellow/orange). However, when cells were exposed to IB-MECA for 60 min, less colocalization of A3AR and transferrin was evident (Fig. 4A). Time-dependent localization of A3AR with lysosomes (red) was revealed in cells labeled with FITC-dextran. Un-stimulated cells displayed A3AR on the cell surface, and dextran was localized to large vesicles typical of lysosomes, many of which are centrally located in the cells (Fig. 4B, upper left). After 5 min of incubation with IB-MECA, some colocalization with dextran was observed. Following 15 min of exposure, A3AR exhibited significant increase in co-localization but was less evident at 60 min of incubation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that upon internalization, A3AR is transported to the early endosomes and to the lysosomes, suggesting that sequestration occurred mainly within the first 5 min of the exposure to IB-MECA, whereas the distribution to lysosomes occurred later, peaking at 15 min. Radioligand Binding to Surface Receptor of IB-MECA-treated Cells—To evaluate receptor surface density, IB-MECA-treated cells were exposed to 125I-AB-MECA for different time period. Fig. 5 shows that radioligand binding was decreased after 15 (55%) and 60 min (33%), demonstrating that IB-MECA induced accumulated internalization of A3AR. Interestingly, full recovery of the receptor to the cell surface was observed after 24 h. RNA and Protein Expression Level of A3AR in IB-MECA-treated Melanoma Cells—Time-dependent expression of A3AR in the melanoma cells was examined by Western blot analysis. IB-MECA-induced modulation of A3AR expression in a sinusoidal pattern, i.e. down-regulation and up-regulation, occurred at different time points (Fig. 6A). When blocking peptide was utilized, the A3AR band disappeared, confirming that the 32-kDa band is A3AR-specific. To test whether protein expression was modulated due to degradation and resynthesis, we exposed the cells for 1 h to IB-MECA in the presence of MG132, a protein degradation inhibitor. Indeed, MG132 prevented A3AR down-regulation, illustrating that following internalization, receptor degradation took place (Fig. 6B). We next examined mRNA expression level upon exposure of the cells to IB-MECA for 1 h. Expression level was up-regulated, suggesting that resynthesis of A3AR had occurred (Fig. 6C). The specificity of this response was demonstrated by utilizing the selective antagonist MRS 1523, which reversed the increase in mRNA expression. IB-MECA Modulates Key Elements Downstream to A3AR Activation—To show A3AR functionality in the B16-F10 melanoma cells, we tested cAMP production level and the protein expression level of the downstream effectors PKAc and GSK-3β (known from our former study to be up-regulated upon A3AR activation) (2Fishman P. Madi L. Bar-Yehuda S. Barer F. Del Valle L. Khalili K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4060-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). IB-MECA inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation after 5 and 15 min, whereas after 30 min, cAMP level was similar to that of the control value (Fig. 7A). Decreased PKAc and increased GSK-3β levels were observed after 15 min, whereas at 30 min, PKAc level stabilized, and GSK-3β only slightly increased (Fig. 7B). The specificity of this response was demonstrated by introducing forskolin to the culture system, which counteracted the effect of IB-MECA and prevented the modulation in PKAc and GSK-3β level (Fig. 7C). These results corroborated with the cAMP data, indicating that receptor desensitization/resensitization took place upon chronic exposure to the agonist. To further evaluate the association between receptor activation, the subsequent downstream signaling events, and the specificity of these responses, B16-F10 melanoma cells were exposed to IB-MECA in the presence and absence of MRS 1523 for 15 min. PKAc and GSK-3β levels were modulated as was described above, leading to down-regulation in the expression level of cyclin D1 and c-myc, the two cell cycle progression genes. MRS 1523 antagonized the modulation in the expression level of the proteins, indicating that the response was mediated via the A3AR (Fig. 8). IB-MECA Inhibits Melanoma Development in Mice—IBMECA markedly suppressed the development of B16-F10 melanoma tumor growth in the flank model (52% inhibition, p < 0.0001, Fig. 9A). In mice treated with a combination of IBMECA and MRS 1523, no inhibition was noted, demonstrating that the antagonist counteracted the activity of IB-MECA and that the response was A3AR-mediated. In tumor lesions excised from these mice, Western blot analysis revealed down-regulation of A3AR, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 and up-regulation of GSK-3β expression level (Fig. 9B). This modulation in the level of proteins was also neutralized by MRS 1523, further demonstrating the specificity of the response. IB-MECA is a synthetic A3AR agonist exhibiting a potent antiproliferative effect against tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo (1Fishman P. Bar-Yehuda S. Ohana G. Pathak S. Wasserman L. Barer F.

In this study, we show that B16-F10 melanoma cells highly express A3AR. Exposure of the receptor to IB-MECA resulted in receptor internalization/externalization followed by the modulation of key proteins involved in signaling pathways leading to tumor growth inhibition. Four experimental approaches to test A3AR exhibition and expression in B16-F10 melanoma cells were used in this study. In confocal microscopy analysis, the exhibition of A3AR on the cell surface was exemplified by massive fluorescence, which disappeared on IB-MECA treatment, later to reappear, indicating that receptor internalization/recycling had taken place. The specificity of this response was proved by the introduction of the antagonist MRS 1523 to the culture system in the presence of IB-MECA, resulting in cell surface receptor exhibition similar to the control. The antagonist blocked ligand binding, preventing internalization, thereby retaining full receptor exhibition. Supporting the internalization/externalization event are the studies in which confocal microscopy sectioning exemplified the translocation of the receptor from the membrane to the cytosol. Furthermore, the radioligand binding assay showed accumulated decrease in surface receptor density upon IB-MECA treatment and full recovery of the receptor to the cell surface after 24 h. Tagging the cells with transferrin confirmed the assumption that the receptor was internalized. Transferrin primarily internalizes with transferrin receptors and constitutively recycles with the receptors through early endosomes to a recycling compartment and then back to the cell surface (10Schmid S.L. Fuchs R. Male P. Mellman I. Cell. 1988; 52: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 17Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our data showing colocalization of A3AR with transferrin after 5 and 15 min, both in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface, support the notion that internalization followed by recycling took place. Taken together, it seems that based on the radioligand binding and the confocal microscopy data, a partial receptor recycling occurs after short incubation period, whereas full recovery takes place after a long period of time. This conclusion may suggest that part of the internalized receptor is subjected to degradation and that a subsequent receptor resynthesis is needed for full receptor recovery. Indeed, the high level of receptor expression was down-regulated shortly after IB-MECA treatment. Prolonged incubation periods resulted in repeated down-regulation/up-regulation of receptor expression, suggesting that this pattern may be a result of receptor degradation and resynthesis. To confirm this notion, we utilized MG132 that prevented receptor down-regulation due to its protease inhibitory effect. Additional data to support the view that part of the internalized receptor was degraded came from confocal microscopy studies in which the cells were labeled with FITC-dextran, which has been shown to specifically accumulate in lysosomes (18Petrou C. Chen L. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2326-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, the increased expression level of protein and mRNA after 60 min of incubation indicated the involvement of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events in the process of receptor resynthesis. Others also demonstrated A3AR internalization/recycling; however, the time course did not overlap our values, most probably due to the utilization of different cell types and agonist concentration (19Trincavelli M.L. Tuscano D. Cecchetti P. Falleni A. Benzi L. Klotz K.N. Gremigni V. Cattabeni F. Luccachini A. Martini C. J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14748-14761Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Receptor functionality was tested by monitoring the level of cAMP and key proteins modulated upon A3AR activation. A decrease in PKAc and an increase in GSK-3β levels were observed both in vitro and in vivo. The modulation in the level of these proteins was antagonized by forskolin and MRS 1523. Interestingly, after a longer incubation period (30 min), receptor desensitization occurred and was manifested by reversing levels of PKAc and GSK-3β. In a previous study (2Fishman P. Madi L. Bar-Yehuda S. Barer F. Del Valle L. Khalili K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4060-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we showed that IB-MECA inhibited melanoma cell growth via cross-talk between A3AR and the Wnt signaling pathway. A3AR activation was found to inhibit PKAc and PKB, thereby retaining GSK-3β in its active nonphosphorylated form (2Fishman P. Madi L. Bar-Yehuda S. Barer F. Del Valle L. Khalili K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4060-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GSK-3β was shown to phosphorylate and inactivate β-catenin, which consequently induced the down-regulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1 (22Ferkey D.M. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In some tumor cells, including melanoma, GSK-3β fails to phosphorylate β-catenin, which accumulates in the cytosol. It then translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of cyclin D1 and c-myc, leading to cell cycle progression (7Robbins P.F. El-Gamil M. Li Y.F. Kawakami Y. Loftus D. Appella E. Rosenberg S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 8Morin P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 9Bonvini P. Hwang S.G. El-Gamil M. Robbins P. Kim J.S. Trepel J. Neckers L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It thus seems that signal transduction pathways initiated upon receptor sensitization also need to be turned off (desensitized) to ensure that signaling can be achieved, allowing the regulation of cell function. Receptor desensitization led to signal termination despite the continuous presence of the agonist in the culture system. Subsequent resensitization, i.e. the expression of a functional receptor on the cell surface being capable of generating signaling pathways, took place. This chain of events is typical in other G-protein-coupled receptors (23Bunemann M. Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaasdam R. Hosey M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 169-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Remarkably, IB-MECA was also efficacious in suppressing melanoma development in mice. The expression profile of A3AR and GSK-3β, in the tumor lesions derived from IBMECA-treated mice, was similar to that shown in vitro. Moreover, cyclin D1 and c-Myc levels were down-regulated in the melanoma lesions. These two cell cycle progression genes have been reported earlier to be overexpressed in melanoma cells (25D'agnano I. Valentini A. Fornari C. Bucci B. Starace G. Felsani A. Citro G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Parrella P. Caballero O.L. Sidranski D. Merbs S.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1679-1688PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests their down-regulation as part of the mechanism of melanoma growth inhibition by IB-MECA. The specificity of tumor suppressive response to IB-MECA was confirmed in vivo when melanoma-bearing mice were treated with IB-MECA + MRS 1523. The latter blocked most of the inhibitory effect of IB-MECA, demonstrating that the response is A3AR-mediated. Earlier studies demonstrated that A3AR agonists such as IB-MECA or Cl-IB-MECA, at micromolar concentrations, induced apoptosis in different cell types. In some of the studies, the activity was found to be A3AR-mediated, whereas in others, A3AR antagonists did not counteract the effect, demonstrating that the apoptosis was not A3AR-mediated (27Kim S.G. Ravi G. Hoffmann C. Jung Y.J. Kim M. Chen A. Jacobson K.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Appel E. Kazimirsky G. Ashkenazi E. Kim S.G. Jacobson K.A. Brodie C. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In distinction from these studies, in the present work, IB-MECA was used at nanomolar concentrations, and its activity was counteracted by the antagonist MRS 1523, demonstrating that the response was A3AR-dependent. In conclusion, melanoma cells highly express and exhibit A3AR. Upon activation, the receptor is internalized to the cytosol, “sorted”to the early endosomes, and recycled to the cell surface. Alternatively, the receptor may be targeted to lysosomes and then subjected to degradation followed by resynthesis and externalization. Modulation of key proteins leading to tumor growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo was demonstrated."

Although the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is an exoplasmic determinant of raft association, PrP remained raft-associated in human neuronal cells even when the GPI anchor was deleted or substituted for a transmembrane anchor indicating that the ectodomain contains a raft localization signal. The raft association of transmembrane-anchored PrP occurred independently of Cu(II) binding as it failed to be abolished by either deletion of the octapeptide repeat region (residues 51–90) or treatment of cells with a Cu(II) chelator. Raft association of transmembrane-anchored PrP was only abolished by the deletion of the N-terminal region (residues 23–90) of the ectodomain. This region was sufficient to confer raft localization when fused to the N terminus of a non-raft transmembrane-anchored protein and suppressed the clathrin-coated pit localization signal in the cytoplasmic domain of the amyloid precursor protein. These data indicate that the N-terminal region of PrP acts as a cellular raft targeting determinant and that residues 23–90 of PrP represent the first proteinaceous raft targeting signal within the ectodomain of a GPI-anchored protein.

Lipid rafts represent compositionally and functionally distinct membrane microdomains that serve as the platform for a number of membrane-mediated biological processes including signal transduction and the trafficking and sorting of proteins and lipids (1Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5109) Google Scholar, 2Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). These domains are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids in the exoplasmic leaflet and in phospholipids with saturated acyl chains and cholesterol in the inner leaflet and, as a result, form a liquid-ordered phase within the bilayer (3Brown D.A.

Rafts have been defined biochemically by their relative insolubility at low temperature in non-ionic detergents and, hence, are termed detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) 1The abbreviations used are: DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; APP, amyloid precursor protein; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MBS, Mes-buffered saline; MDP, membrane dipeptidase; PrP, prion protein; SCRL, sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich raft-like liposome; TM, transmembrane.1The abbreviations used are: DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; APP, amyloid precursor protein; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MBS, Mes-buffered saline; MDP, membrane dipeptidase; PrP, prion protein; SCRL, sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich raft-like liposome; TM, transmembrane.

Their flotation to low density upon buoyant sucrose density gradient centrifugation allows DRMs to be separated from detergent-soluble membranes and from the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction (5Brown D.A.

Based on this criterion of detergent insolubility and flotation in a density gradient, a subset of proteins has been found to associate with rafts, including the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored prion protein (PrP) (7Vey M.

The association of PrP with rafts has been reported to be critical for the conformational conversion of the normal cellular form of the protein (PrPC) to the pathogenic form (PrPSc) (8Taraboulos A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5087) Google Scholar).Saturated acyl chains covalently linked to the protein appear sufficient for the raft association of both GPI-anchored proteins, where the acyl chains of the anchor interact with lipids in the exoplasmic face of the raft, and doubly acylated proteins, which interact with the cytoplasmic face (1Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5109) Google Scholar). Proteinaceous raft determinants include the transmembrane (TM) domains of influenza hemagglutinin (11Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), neuraminidase (12Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J.

Raft association of hemagglutinin appears to be mediated by interactions between the TM domain and lipids in the exoplasmic face of the bilayer (14Tatulian S.A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Other proteinaceous raft determinants mediate raft association by interacting with constituent raft proteins and include the caveolin-scaffolding domain on a number of cytosolic and TM proteins that promotes the binding of the proteins to the caveolar coat protein caveolin (15Li S.

That soluble secretory proteins such as thyroglobulin and plasmin are also raft-associated (18Ledesma M.D. da Silva J.S. Crassaerts K. Delacourte A. De Strooper B. Dotti C.G.

Evidence supporting such a notion was provided by the recent finding (20Yamabhai M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24843-24846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that an extracellularly disposed juxtamembrane region in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was sufficient for raft association when fused to the TM and cytoplasmic domains of either EGFR or the low density lipoprotein receptor.Although PrP is GPI-anchored and, hence, raft-associated, several independent cell-free studies have clearly demonstrated that the interaction of PrP with model membranes, including sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich raft-like liposomes (SCRLs), can occur in a GPI-independent manner (21Morillas M.

Indeed, the conversion of PrPC-like proteinase K-sensitive PrP (PrP-sen) to PrPSc-like proteinase K-resistant PrP (PrP-res) by exogenous PrP-res required a GPI-independent, rather than a GPI-directed, interaction of PrP-sen with SCRLs (24Baron G.S. Caughey B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14883-14892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have utilized alternatively anchored forms of PrP expressed in human neuroblastoma cells to identify exoplasmic determinants required for the association of PrP with cellular raft membranes. Our results show that a GPI anchor is not obligatory for the raft association of PrP, which occurred irrespective of both the mode and topology of membrane anchorage. Deletion mutagenesis demonstrated that the N-terminal region of the PrP ectodomain (residues 23–90) was necessary for the raft association of TM forms of the protein. Furthermore, this region was sufficient for raft association when fused to the ectodomain of a non-raft protein and, hence, represents the first example of a raft targeting determinant located within the ectodomain of a GPI-anchored protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of the PrP Constructs—The construction of PrP, PrP-CTM, PrP-NTM, and PrPΔ GPI in pIRESneo, ACE, and MDP-CTM in pIREShyg have been described previously (25Pang S. Chubb A.J. Schwager S.L.U. Ehlers M.R.W. Sturrock E.D. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). DNA encoding PrP-CTM2 was constructed by PCR using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-TACGACGGGAGAAGATCCGGTGCAATCATTGGACTC-3′; primer 2, 5′-CGGGATCCCTAGTTCTGCATCTGCTC-3′; and primer 3, 5′-ATAAGAAGGCGGCCGCATGGCGAACCTTGGCTAC-3′. Primers 1 and 2 were used to generate from APP:pBluescript a primary PCR product comprising a 3′ BamHI site followed by a sequence encoding the TM and cytoplasmic domains of APP and the last six residues of the PrP ectodomain. The primary PCR product and primer 3 were used to generate from PrP:pBC12/CMV (a gift from Dr. D. Harris, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) the PrP-CTM2 sequence flanked by NotI and BamHI sites which was inserted into the respective sites of pIRESneo (Clontech). The following constructs were cloned into the NotI and BamHI sites of pIRESneo. PrP-CTMΔ23-90 was generated from PrP-CTM in pIRESneo (26Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using the following primers: primer 4, 5′-ATTATGGGTACCCCCTCCGCAGAGGCCGACATCAGT-3′; primer 5, the antisense of primer 4; and primer 6, 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGGAGTGTCTCAGCTC-3′. Primers 3 and 4 were used to amplify a 5′ fragment encoding residues 1–22 of PrP fused to the first six residues following the octapeptide repeat region. Primers 5 and 6 were used to amplify a 3′ fragment encoding residues 16–22 of PrP fused to residues 91–254. Both DNA fragments were fused by PCR and amplified using the terminal primers 3 and 6. PrP-CTMΔ51–90 was generated by the same protocol using primer 7, 5′-ATTATGGGTACCCCCTCCTGGGTAACGGTTGCCTCC-3′; and primer 8, the antisense of primer 7. Primers 3 and 7 were used to amplify a 5′ fragment encoding residues 1–50 of PrP fused to the first six residues following the octapeptide repeat region. Primers 6 and 8 were used to amplify a 3′ fragment encoding residues 44–50 of PrP fused to residues 91–254. For PrP-MDP-CTM, a 5′ fragment encoding residues 1–90 of PrP fused to the first six residues of the MDP ectodomain was amplified from PrP:pBC12/CMV using primer 3 and primer 9, 5′-CAGGTCCCGGAATTGGTCTTGGCCCCATCCACCGCC-3′. Primers 6 and 10, the antisense of primer 9, were used to amplify from MDP-CTM/pIREShyg a 3′ fragment encoding residues 17–431 of MDP-CTM fused to the last six residues of the octapeptide repeat region of PrP. Both DNA fragments were fused by PCR and amplified using the terminal primers 3 and 6.Cell Culture and Transfection—The human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was cultured and transfected with the various constructs as described previously (26Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To generate cells co-expressing PrP-CTM and MDP-CTM, G418-resistant cells expressing PrP-CTM were transfected with MDP-CTM in pIREShyg and subsequently selected with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin.Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. As described previously (27Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), cells at confluency in a 175-cm2 flask were scraped into Mes-buffered saline (MBS; 25 mm Mes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of MBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and homogenized by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was made 40% (w/v) with respect to sucrose by the addition of 0.5 ml of 80% (w/v) sucrose in MBS and loaded at the bottom of a 5/30% sucrose gradient. Gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h in an SW50.1 rotor and subsequently separated into nine 0.5-ml fractions, with fraction 1 containing the highest density of sucrose.Immunoprecipitation and Cell Surface Biotinylation—Immunoprecipitation with antibody 3F4 (Signe) was carried out as described previously (26Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (26Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells at confluency were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml biotin sulfo-NHS (Sigma), rinsed three times with PBS containing 50 mm glycine, and lysed in lysis buffer.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Samples were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (26Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out using Hybond-P poly(vinylidene) difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The monoclonal antibodies against clathrin (Harlan Sera Laboratories) and flotillin (BD Biosciences) were diluted 1:5000; the anti-PrP antibodies 3F4 (28Kascsak R.J. Rubinstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and P45-66 (29Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) were also diluted 1:5000, whereas the polyclonal antibody against APP (Ab54) (30Parvathy S. Hussain I. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the anti-MDP polyclonal antibody RP209 (31Littlewood G.M. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the anti-ACE polyclonal antibody RP183 (32Williams T.A. Barnes K. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were diluted 1:1000. Bound peroxidase conjugates were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSA GPI Anchor Is Not Essential for the Raft Association of PrP—To investigate determinants required for the raft association of PrP, alternatively anchored forms of the protein were stably expressed in the human neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y, which lacks detectable levels of endogenous PrP (33Perera W.S.S. Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Cells were homogenized in the presence of Triton X-100 and subjected to buoyant sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1B). Clathrin, a marker of detergent-soluble membranes (27Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was detected in fractions 1–2 of the gradient, corresponding to the 40% sucrose layer (Fig. 1B). Conversely, flotillin, a characteristic DRM marker protein (34Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.A. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), was detected in fractions 4–7 of the gradient, corresponding to the 5/30% interface (Fig. 1B). Similarly, wtPrP was predominantly localized in the DRM-enriched fractions 4–7 of the gradient, consistent with the protein having a GPI anchor and, hence, associating with DRMs (Fig. 1B).Surprisingly, the majority of PrP-CTM, in which the GPI anchor had been replaced with the TM and cytoplasmic domains of the type I integral membrane protein ACE (26Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was also detected in the DRM-enriched fractions (Fig. 1B). The DRM association of PrP-CTM cannot be attributed to the TM and cytoplasmic domains of ACE, as ACE itself failed to associate with DRMs and remained in the clathrin-containing fractions when stably expressed in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1B), consistent with earlier observations that this TM protein is excluded from rafts (35Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 36Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, PrP-NTM, which lacks a GPI anchor but has an inverse topology to PrP-CTM due to the provision of an uncleaved N-terminal signal anchor, and PrPΔ GPI, which lacks any type of anchoring domain, (26Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were primarily located in the DRM-enriched fractions (Fig. 1B). Flotation to fractions of low density was not an intrinsic property of the PrP ectodomain as secreted PrPΔGPI failed to float to the gradient interface (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that the GPI anchor of PrP was not an absolute requirement for the cellular raft association of the protein, which occurred irrespective of both the mode and topology of membrane anchorage.Under the conditions used for the isolation of the DRMs, the non-raft proteins clathrin and ACE were excluded from the DRM fractions indicating that association with DRMs is not due to incomplete solubilization of membrane fragments. To confirm that the presence of PrP-CTM in the DRM fractions was due to association with cholesterol-rich rafts and not due to incomplete solubilization of membrane fragments, the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin was used to disrupt the rafts prior to isolation of the DRMs (Fig. 1C). Following methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment, the majority of PrP-CTM was present in fractions 1–3 of the sucrose gradient indicating that the flotation of this construct was due to its interaction with cholesterol-rich rafts and not due to incomplete solubilization of the membranes.The Ectodomain of PrP but Not of Another GPI-anchored Protein Mediates Raft Association—The GPI-independent raft localization of PrP-CTM, PrP-NTM, and PrPΔ GPI, but not ACE (Fig. 1B), strongly implied that the ectodomain of PrP contained determinants sufficient for the raft association of both TM anchored and non-anchored forms of PrP. To determine whether the ectodomain of another GPI-anchored protein could mediate raft localization, the ectodomain of membrane dipeptidase (MDP), a glycosylated, GPI-anchored, raft-associated protein of similar size to PrP (37Hooper N.M. Low M.G. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Brewis I.A. Ferguson M.A.J. Mehlert A. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22946-22956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), was fused to the TM and cytoplasmic domains of ACE to create MDP-CTM (Fig. 2A). SH-SY5Y cells stably co-expressing PrP-CTM and MDP-CTM were subjected to buoyant sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2B). PrP-CTM co-localized with flotillin in the DRM-enriched fractions (Fig. 2B). Co-expressed MDP-CTM, however, even though it had the same TM and cytoplasmic domains as PrP-CTM and was trafficked to the cell surface (data not shown), failed to incorporate into DRMs to any significant extent and remained in the clathrin-containing fractions of the sucrose gradient (Fig. 2B). These results verify that the PrP ectodomain was responsible for the raft association of PrP-CTM and, in addition, demonstrate that not all GPI-anchored proteins contain raft targeting determinants within their ectodomains, although it should be noted that in a recent study (24Baron G.S. Caughey B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14883-14892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) several other phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C-released proteins, in addition to PrP, were found to bind to SCRLs.Fig. 2The ectodomain of another GPI-anchored protein lacks raft targeting determinants. A, schematic of PrP-CTM and MDP-CTM showing their mutual TM (squared box) and cytoplasmic (horizontally striped box) domains derived from ACE. B, SH-SY5Y cells stably co-expressing PrP-CTM and MDP-CTM were subjected to sucrose gradient analysis followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the individual fractions. Fractions 1–2 correspond to the 40% sucrose layer and 7–8 to the 5/30% interface. MDP-CTM was detected with polyclonal antibody RP209.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Raft Targeting Determinants in the Ectodomain of PrP Suppress the Coated Pit Localization Signal in the Cytoplasmic Domain of the Amyloid Precursor Protein—To ascertain the strength of raft targeting determinants in the ectodomain of PrP relative to an antagonistic targeting signal, the TM and cytoplasmic domains of ACE in PrP-CTM were replaced with those of the APP, to generate PrP-CTM2 (Fig. 3A). The cytoplasmic domain of APP contains an endocytosis signal (GYENPTY) that causes the internalization of the protein via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (39Yamazaki T. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Perez R.G. Saurian S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Following buoyant sucrose density gradient centrifugation of SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing PrP-CTM2 (Fig. 3B), the majority of the endogenous APP was detected in the clathrin-containing fractions, although a minor proportion of the protein (∼5%) co-localized with flotillin in the DRM-enriched fractions, consistent with previous observations (27Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, PrP-CTM2 was localized solely in the DRM-containing fractions (Fig. 3B). The DRM localization of PrP-CTM2 demonstrates that the raft targeting determinants in the ectodomain of PrP were dominant to the clathrin-coated pit targeting motif in the cytoplasmic domain of APP.Fig. 3Raft targeting determinants of the PrP ectodomain are dominant to the coated pit localization signal of APP. A, schematic of APP and PrP-CTM2 showing their mutual transmembrane domain (bricked box) and cytoplasmic domain (vertically dashed box) containing the clathrin-coated pit endocytosis motif -GYENPTY-. B, SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing PrP-CTM2 were subjected to sucrose gradient analysis followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the individual fractions. Endogenous APP was detected with antibody Ab54. PrP-CTM2 was detected with the PrP-specific antibody 3F4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Raft Association of PrP-CTM Requires the N-terminal Region of the PrP Ectodomain—To define the region of the PrP ectodomain responsible for the raft association of PrP-CTM, a deletion construct was created, PrP-CTMΔ23-90, that lacked the sequence immediately following the signal peptide up to residue 90 including the highly conserved octapeptide repeat region involved in binding copper (41Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Following cell surface biotinylation, the 3F4-immunoprecipitated construct was effectively recognized by streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, indicating that the deletion construct was trafficked to the cell surface (Fig. 4B). When subjected to buoyant sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of Triton X-100, the majority of PrP-CTMΔ23-90 failed to associate with DRMs and remained within the clathrin-containing fractions (Fig. 4C), indicating that the targeting determinant necessary for the raft association of PrP-CTM was located within residues 23–90. As PrP-CTMΔ23-90 lacked the copper-binding octarepeat region, we investigated if binding of copper may be involved in the raft localization of PrP-CTM. However, deletion of the octapeptide repeat region (residues 51–90) to generate PrP-CTMΔ51-90 or incubation of cells expressing PrP-CTM with the Cu(II) chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (42McMahon H.E. Mange A. Nishida N. Creminon C. Casanova D. Lehmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2286-2291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) both failed to abolish the association of the protein with DRMs (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that neither binding of copper to the octapeptide repeat region nor the octapeptide region itself is responsible for the raft localization of PrP-CTM. Although the expression level of PrP-CTM and PrPΔ23-90 both in the cell lysates and at the cell surface following surface biotinylation were similar (Fig. 4B), only the former construct was associated with DRMs (Fig. 4C), indicating that differences in expression level had not influenced the extent of raft association of the different constructs.Fig. 4A raft targeting determinant is located in the N-terminal region of the PrP ectodomain. A, schematic of the deletion mutant. PrP-CTMΔ23-90 lacks the five octarepeats (residues 51–90; vertical rectangles) and residues 23–50 region (wavy lined box). B, SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrP-CTM or PrP-CTMΔ23-90 were either lysed and equivalent amounts of total lysate protein subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with antibody 3F4 or surface-biotinylated and biotinylated proteins in the 3F4 immunoprecipitate detected with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. C, SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing PrP-CTMΔ23-90 were subjected to sucrose gradient analysis followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the individual fractions. PrP-CTMΔ23-90 was detected with antibody 3F4. D, in PrP-CTMΔ51-90, the octapeptide repeat region (residues 51–90) was deleted. SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrP-CTMΔ51-90 or cells expressing PrP-CTM pre-incubated for 8 h in the absence or presence of 1 mm DTPA in Opti-MEM were subjected to sucrose gradient analysis. The individual fractions from the sucrose gradient were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibody 3F4.

Here we describe the identification of a proteolytically processed isoform of the polypeptide chain-releasing factor GSPT1/eRF3 protein, which functions in translation, as a new IAP-binding protein. In common with other IAP-binding proteins, the processed GSPT1 protein harbors a conserved N-terminal IAP-binding motif (AKPF). Additionally, processed GSPT1 interacts biochemically with IAPs and could promote caspase activation, IAP ubiquitination and apoptosis. The IAP-binding motif of the processed GSPT1 is absolutely required for these activities. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby processing of GSPT1 into the IAP-binding isoform could potentiate apoptosis by liberating caspases from IAP inhibition, or target IAPs and the processed GSPT1 for proteasome-mediated degradation.

Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar).

Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). All IAPs share one or more signature domains, referred to as BIRs, that are essential for the antiapoptotic activity associated with these proteins (6Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The BIR domains are zinc-binding domains that have been shown to bind directly to caspases and inhibit their activity (3Miller L.K.

Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). In addition to the BIR domains, some IAPs, such as human XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2, contain C-terminal RING domains (8Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the RING domain functions in the regulation of ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of IAPs and IAP-associated proteins (9Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A.

The activity of the IAP proteins is regulated by a group of IAP-regulatory proteins that bind to IAPs and inhibit their anti-apoptotic activity (reviewed in Refs. 1Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat.

This group of proteins is characterized by the presence of a conserved 4-residue IAP-binding motif (IBM) at their N termini that allows them to bind to the BIR domain of IAPs. This association prevents IAPs from binding to caspases and in some cases stimulates their auto-ubiquitination and degradation (9Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat.

In Drosophila melanogaster, five IBM-containing proteins known as Reaper, Hid, Grim, Sickle and Jafrac2 have been identified as direct IAP-binding proteins that promote caspase activation by binding to the BIR domains of IAPs (22Abrams J.M.

Interestingly, the two proteins are localized in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria and released into the cytoplasm during apoptosis. Both proteins are synthesized as precursor proteins with N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal peptides that are removed during maturation to expose the N-terminal IBM. In this report we describe the characterization of a third human IBM-containing protein. This protein is a proteolytically processed form of a previously identified protein known as GSPT1 (G1 to S phase transition protein), which functions in translation through interaction with poly(A)-binding protein PABP and as a polypeptide chain release factor 3 (eRF3) (36Hoshino S.

Like Smac and HtrA2, the processed GSPT1 contains a conserved IBM (AKPF) at its N terminus, which is exposed after proteolytic cleavage of a 69-residue leader sequence. Our results suggest that the processed GSPT1 could participate in the apoptotic pathways by binding to IAPs and inhibiting their activity or target them for proteasome-mediated degradation. Affinity Purification of IAP-binding Proteins from 293 Cells—IAP binding proteins in 293 cellular extracts were purified on GST-BIR3-bound beads as described in detail previously (31Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—The full-length human GSPT1 cDNA clone was obtained from the IMAGE Consortium (GenBank™ accession number AL516539). Constructs encoding full-length GSPT1 or truncated mutants were generated by PCR using modified complementary PCR adapter-primers. C-terminal FLAG-epitope tagging was done by cloning the PCR generated GSPT1 cDNAs in-frame into the mammalian expression vector FLAG-C-pcDNA3. C-terminal His6-epitope tagged GSPT1 variants (processed GSPT1, residues 70–634; GSPT1-ΔAKPF, residues 74–634) were generated by cloning the PCR generated GSPT1 cDNAs in the bacterial expression vector pET21A. The N7-GSPT1-GST was constructed by fusing the first 7 residues of processed GSPT1 (AKPFVPN) to the N terminus of GST. This was done by PCR using an oligonucleotide primer encoding the first 7 residues of processed GSPT1 followed by the first 7 residues of GST (5′-primer) and a second GST termination primer (3′-primer). The PCR product was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET21A. The ubiquitin-GSPT1-Δ69-FLAG construct was made by fusing PCR generated human ubiquitin cDNA (encoding residues 1–76) to the 5′-end of pGSPT1 cDNA (encoding residues 70–634) using overlapping PCR. The ubiquitin-pGSPT1 PCR product was then cloned in-frame into the mammalian expression vector FLAG-C-pcDNA3. The plasmid encoding C-terminal GFP-tagged Drosophila Reaper protein was constructed by fusing the Reaper cDNA to the GFP cDNA using pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Full-length XIAP and its BIR3-RING (residues 243–497) domain were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α as N-terminally GST-tagged proteins using a pGEX 4T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The bacterial expression vector GST-c-IAP1 was a kind gift of Jonathan Ashwell. The bacterial expression vector GST-c-IAP1-ΔRING was constructed in pGEX 4T. Full-length XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine in reticulocyte lysates using MYC-pcDNA3 constructs. Mature Smac or HtrA2 and its mutants were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) as C-terminally GST- or His6-tagged proteins using a pET-28-GST or pET-28 vectors, respectively. In Vitro Interaction Assays—All in vitro interactions were performed as described previously (20Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D.

In Vitro Potentiation of Caspase Activity by IAP-binding Proteins— These procedures were performed as described previously (31Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L.

Cell Death and Caspase Activity Assays—The ability of processed GSPT1 (pGSPT1) to potentiate tunicamycin, Brefeldin A, or TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C) was assayed by transfecting human HeLa cells (1 × 105 cells/well) in 6-well plates with 0.3 μg of pEGFP-N1 reporter plasmid (Clontech), 1.2 μg of empty vector or constructs encoding human ubiquitin or a C-terminally FLAG-tagged Ubiquitin-GSPT1-Δ69 (UB-GSPT1-Δ69-FLAG) using the LipofectAMINE™ method. Cells were treated with tunicamycin (2.5 μg/ml), Brefeldin A (5 μg/ml), or TRAIL (1 μg/ml) for 7 h. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and DAPI stains. Normal and apoptotic GFP-expressing cells were counted using fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells in each experiment was expressed as the mean percentage of apoptotic cells as a fraction of the total number of GFP-expressing cells. The ability of processed GSPT1 (pGSPT1) to enhance the caspase activity of transfected cells (Fig. 4B) was assayed after transfecting 293 cells with empty vector or constructs encoding human ubiquitin or a C-terminally FLAG-tagged ubiquitin-GSPT1-Δ69 (UB-GSPT1-Δ69-FLAG) using the LipofectAMINE™ method. 24 h after transfection the cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 250 mm sucrose) and S100 extracts were prepared by centrifuging the lysates at 100,000 × g. The caspase activity in the S100 extracts was assayed after stimulation with cytochrome c (5 μg/ml) and dATP (1 mm) over a 90-min period of time using the caspase substrate DEVD-AMC. The release of AMC from the DEVD-AMC substrate was measured by fluorometry. In Vitro Ubiquitination Reactions—In vitro ubiquitination assays were carried out as described below. Briefly, bacterially expressed GST-c-IAP1, or GST-c-IAP1-ΔRING were incubated with pGSPT1-His6, pG-SPT1-ΔAKPF, N7-GSPT1-GST, or Reaper-GST for 30 min. After the brief incubation, glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the reaction mixtures for 1 h. The protein-bound beads were then washed with ubiquitination reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Approximately 3–5 μg of bound GST fusion proteins was incubated in ubiquitination reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm creatine phosphate, 15 units of creatine phosphokinase) with or without 100 ng of E1, 100 ng of E2 (UbcH5b), 1 μg of Ub, and 40 ng of Ub aldehyde at 30 °C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were then fractionated onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blotted for ubiquitinated protein products using monoclonal antibodies to ubiquitin or c-IAP1. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and then stained with polyclonal anti-GSPT1 raised against human GSPT1 peptide 179–190 and a mouse anti-human hemoxygenase (HO-1) monoclonal antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. In some experiments FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and anti-S3A ribosomal protein polyclonal antibody were used. After staining, the coverslips were mounted on slides and observed using Confocal Microscopy. Subcellular Fractionation–These procedures were performed as described previously (31Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Identification of a Processed Form of GSPT1 as a BIR3-binding Protein—Using a GST-BIR3 fusion protein as an affinity reagent to purify new IAP-binding proteins from extracts of human cells and mouse tissues, we previously isolated 3 proteins of molecular masses 23, 38, and 80 kDa (31Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The 23 and 38 kDa proteins were identified as mitochondrial mature Smac and HtrA2 proteins, respectively. To identify the third 80 kDa protein, a large-scale preparation of GST-BIR3-affinity purified proteins from 293 cells was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stained bands were cut and subjected to microsequencing and mass spectrometric peptide mass fingerprinting as described before (31Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analysis of the 80-kDa band revealed an N-terminal sequence AKPFVPNVHAAEFVP. A PSI-BLAST analysis of the NCBI protein data base revealed that this sequence is found only in human GSPT1 and GSPT2 proteins. Mass spectrometric data of a tryptic peptide digest of the 80-kDa band confirmed that it is a processed form of the human GSPT1 protein, lacking the first 69 residues (Fig. 1) (36Hoshino S. Imai M. Mizutani M. Kikuchi Y. Hanaoka F. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22254-22259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As the N-terminal sequence indicates, the processed BIR3-affinity purified GSPT1 protein starts at residue 70 with an N-terminal AKPF sequence, which represent a conserved IBM (Fig. 1, A and B). A BLAST search of the GenBank™ data base revealed that the AKPF motif is conserved in all vertebrate and invertebrate GSPT1 homologues (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the 80-kDa GST-BIR3-binding protein is a processed form of GSPT1, we bound extracts from 293 cells to wild type GST-BIR3 or the GST-BIR3-(E314S) mutant, which does not bind to the IBM, and then analyzed the bound proteins by Western blotting with a GSPT1-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, the GSPT1-specific antibody detected an 80-kDa band in the GST-BIR3 lane but not in the GST-BIR3-(E314S) lane. The above results were further confirmed by stable expression of a C-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length GSPT1 protein in 293 cells (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis of lysates made by solubilizing the transfected cells in SDS-sample buffer showed two bands corresponding to the full-length (lane 2, upper band) and the processed (lane 2, lower band) GSPT1 proteins. The amount of the processed GSPT1 isoform in the cellular lysate were estimated to be ∼10–20% of the amount of the full-length GSPT1 protein. As expected, only the processed GSPT1 isoform was able to bind to GST-BIR3. Taken together, our data indicate that GSPT1 undergoes limited proteolytic processing in 293 cells to generate an IAP-binding isoform of GSPT1. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned full-length GSPT1 protein, the IBM is located at residue 70, suggesting that the IAP-binding isoform of GSPT1 is generated by proteolytic processing of the full-length GSPT1 at residue 69. To determine whether a recombinant GSPT1 lacking the first 69 residues (processed GSPT1) could interact with the GST-BIR3 fusion protein, we expressed this protein with a C-terminal His6 tag in bacteria and purified it to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1E). Similarly, Smac and HtrA2 proteins were expressed in bacteria and used as positive controls. Like Smac and HtrA2, the processed GSPT1 was able to interact with the wild type GST-BIR3 protein but not with the GST-BIR3-E314S mutant. Processed GSPT1 did not significantly interact with GST-BIR1,2 fusion protein, whereas Smac and HtrA2 interacted, though relatively less compared with their interaction with GST-BIR3. However, deletion of the AKPF motif in GSPT1 completely abolished binding to GST-BIR fusion proteins, indicating that the AKPF motif is necessary for binding of GSPT1 to the BIR domain. Processed GSPT1 Interacts with Full-length IAPs—To determine whether processed GSPT1 could interact with human full-length IAPs, we performed in vitro interaction assays with recombinant processed GSPT1 proteins and in vitro translated human XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2. As shown in Fig. 2A, the recombinant processed GSPT1 was able to interact with XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2. As expected, deletion of the AKPF motif abolished the interaction of GSPT1 with these IAPs. To determine whether the endogenous processed GSPT1 is present in a complex with the endogenous XIAP in 293 cellular extracts, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an antibody specific for GSPT1. These experiments demonstrated that the endogenous processed GSPT1 isoform can indeed associate with endogenous XIAP (Fig. 2B). Combined, these data indicate that processed GSPT1 interacts specifically with cellular IAPs. Processed GSPT1 Can Potentiate Caspase Activation—Previous studies demonstrated that the IAP-binding proteins such as Smac and HtrA2, could potentiate caspase activation by preventing binding of caspases to IAPs or disrupting already formed caspase-IAP complexes. Thus, we performed in vitro caspase activation assays to determine whether the processed GSPT1 protein could promote caspase-9 activity in HEK293 S100 extracts in the presence of inhibitory concentration of XIAP (Fig. 3). To measure the caspase-9 activity in these extracts, we added 35S-labeled procaspase-3 to the S100 extracts and stimulated the extracts with cytochrome c and dATP. Previously we have shown that both Smac and HtrA2 could potentiate caspase cleavage under these conditions (10Hays R. Wickline L. Cagan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the processed GSPT1 protein was able to neutralize the XIAP inhibition of the caspase activity in the S100 extracts, though at a slightly lower potency than Smac or HtrA2. This activity was dependent on an intact IAP-binding motif (AKPF), as deletion of this motif abolished the caspase-promoting activity of GSPT1. Furthermore, the first N-terminal 7 residues of GSPT1 coupled to GST was sufficient to neutralize XIAP inhibition to the same extent, as does the processed GSPT1 at identical concentrations. This indicates that the IBM of GSPT1 is responsible for both its IAP-binding and caspase promoting activities. The potency of the caspase promoting activity of GSPT1 was further confirmed by assaying the DEVD cleaving activity of S100 extracts stimulated with cytochrome c and dATP under similar conditions as above (Fig. 3B). The data shows that the DEVD cleaving activity in the S100 extracts upon incubation with Smac, HtrA2, or the GSPT1 proteins, correlates very well with the extent of caspase-3 cleavage shown in Fig. 3A, under the same conditions. Ectopic Expression of Processed GSPT1 in Human Cells Enhances Caspase Activation and Apoptosis—To express the processed IAP-binding form of GSPT1 we engineered a construct encoding an N-terminal Ub-tagged GSPT1-fusion protein, which lacks the first 69 residues (UB-GSPT1-Δ69)(Fig. 4A). The engineered protein also contains a C-terminal FLAG tag to allow detection by Western blotting. The Ub fusion protein approach is based on the observation that the covalent bond between Ub and other proteins can be cleaved by multiple ATP-dependent proteases, which recognize a Ub moiety and cleave at the Ub-adduct junction (13Ryoo H.D. Bergmann A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Steller H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 14MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36611-36616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). As expected, ectopic expression of the UB-GSPT1-Δ69 fusion protein in 293 cells resulted in generation of the processed GSPT1, which was able to bind GST-BIR3 (Fig. 4B, inset). To determine whether transient expression of the processed GSPT1 in 293 cells enhances caspase activity, we incubated extracts from the transfected 293 cells with DEVD-AMC. As shown in Fig 4B, the DEVD cleaving activity in the extracts derived from the processed GSPT1-transfected cells was significantly higher than the activity in the extracts from the Ub- or vector-transfected cells. These data indicate that binding of the processed GSPT1 to cellular IAPs can augment caspase activity in these cells. The ability of the transiently expressed processed GSPT1 to bind to IAPs and augment caspase activation in human cells suggests that it could also potentiate apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HeLa cells with the expression construct encoding mutant full-length GSPT1-A70G or processed GSPT1 (UB-GSPT1-Δ69), and then tested their sensitivity to apoptotic agents such as tunicamycin, Brefeldin A, and TRAIL. As shown in Fig. 4C, expression of the processed GSPT1 protein, but not the mutant full-length GSPT1-A70G, enhanced the apoptotic effect of tunicamycin, Brefeldin A, and TRAIL. These observations suggest that GSPT1 could potentiate cell death by neutralizing IAPs. Processed GSPT1 Stimulates the Ubiquitination Activity of c-IAP1—Recent studies demonstrated that binding of the Drosophila IAP-binding proteins reaper and Hid to DIAP1 stimulates its ubiquitination activity (9Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I. Yu H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M. Clem R.J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which could lead to degradation of the formed complex by the proteasomal pathway. To determine whether binding of the processed GSPT1 to cellular c-IAP1 in vitro could stimulate its ubiquitination activity, we bound recombinant processed GSPT1 to wild type or RING deleted mutant human GST-c-IAP1 fusion proteins and then incubated the complexes in the presence or absence of E1, E2, and ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 5A, the processed GSPT1 was able to stimulate the ubiquitination activity of wild type cIAP1 but not the RING deletion mutant. Furthermore, the ability of processed GSPT1 to stimulate c-IAP1 ubiquitination activity was dependent on its AKPF, as deletion of this motif inhibited ubiquitination (Fig. 5B). No ubiquitination was observed when the first N-terminal 7 residues of processed GSPT1 coupled to GST (N7-GST) was used, indicating that other regions of GSPT1 are required for stimulation of c-IAP1 ubiquitination activity. Moreover, processed GSPT1 was not able to induce the auto-ubiquitination activity of XIAP or c-IAP2 (data not shown). GSPT1 Is Associated with the ER—To determine the subcellular localization of GSPT1, we stained MCF-7 cells with a GSPT1-specific antibody. Consistent with its function in translation and its association with the ribosomes, immunoflourescence, confocal microscopy of the stained MCF-7 cells revealed that the endogenous GSPT1 protein exhibits clear perinuclear staining characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum localization (Fig. 6A, middle panel). To confirm the ER localization of GSPT1, we stained the same cells with an anti-human heamoxyginase antibody (Fig. 6A, left panel), which is a known ER marker. As shown in Fig. 6A, right panel, complete overlap between the GSPT1 and heamoxygenase staining was observed. To confirm the ER localization of GSPT1, we transfected MCF-7 cells with a construct encoding C-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length GSPT1 protein and then stained the cells with an anti-FLAG antibody and an anti-human S3A ribosomal protein antibody, which is another known ER marker (Fig. 6B). The ectopically transfected full-length GSPT1 protein exhibited ER-specific fluorescence, which completely overlapped with the S3A ribosomal protein (Fig. 6B, right panel). The localization of GSPT1 was further confirmed by subcellular fractionation and Western blotting using anti-GSPT1 antibody (Fig. 6C). This analysis reveled the presence of a GSPT1-specific band in the microsomal and soluble cytosolic protein fractions but not in the mitochondrial or nuclear fractions. The presence of GSPT1 in the cytosolic fraction indicates that GSPT1 is loosely associated with the ER and its association with ER could be disrupted upon lysis of cells in a mild hypotonic buffer. To determine the subcellular localization of the processed GSPT1, we transfected MCF-7 cells with a construct encoding C-terminal FLAG-tagged processed GSPT1 protein, and then stained the cells with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, deletion of the first 69 residues resulted in expression of GSPT1 in the cytoplasm and nuclear compartments (Fig. 6D, right panel), suggesting that its association with the ER is disrupted by deletion of its N terminus. Combined, our data suggest that proteolytic processing of GSPT1 at residue 69 could result in release of the processed GSPT1 from the ER-associated ribosomes into the cytosol. The three main structures of apoptotic signaling in the cell are the plasma membrane, where death and survival receptors reside, the mitochondrion, which is home to several proteins that regulate apoptosis and the third is the endoplasmic reticulum, which has the potential to initiate an independent ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathway (40Ferri K.F.

The first two mammalian IAP inhibitors, Smac and HtrA2, reside in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and are released along with cytochrome c, which activates the Apaf-1-dependent apoptotic pathway (31Hegde R.

In this study we show that the ER associated GSPT1 protein could participate in the death pathways of mammalian cells after it undergoes limited proteolytic processing into an IAP-binding protein. Our data demonstrate that processed GSPT1 sensitizes cells to different apoptotic triggers suggesting that processed GSPT1 could function together with the other IAP-inhibitory proteins, Smac and HtrA2, to regulate apoptosis. The data indicate that processed GSPT1 promotes apoptosis by binding to IAPs and disrupting their interaction with the initiator caspase-9 and possibly the effector caspases 3 and 7, allowing the activation of these caspases. Moreover, the processed GSPT1 protein could promote apoptosis by inducing ubiquitination and degradation of c-IAP1. While the exact physiological function of the mammalian GSPT family of proteins is not clear at present, these proteins (GSPT1 and GSPT2) appear to be structural homologues of the yeast GST1 (also known as SUP35) gene product (36Hoshino S.

The yeast GST1 gene product is a GTP-binding protein structurally related to polypeptide elongation factor 1-α and reportedly functions as a polypeptide releasing factor 3 (eRF3) in yeast. Mutations in the GST1 gene were shown to increase the level of translational ambiguity (41Surguchov A.P. Beretetskaya Y.V. Fominykch E.S. Pospelova E.M.

The human GSPT1 was shown to be capable of complementing the temperature-sensitive growth of the yeast gst1 mutant (44Hoshino S. Miyazawa H. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Kikuchi Y. Kikuchi A. Ui M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3807-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that human GSPT1 is a functional homologue of the yeast GST1 gene product and could also function as an eRF3. Recent results suggest that GSPT proteins could function in translation through association with PABP (37Uchida N. Hoshino S. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50286-50292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing of GSPT1 into an IAP-binding protein appears to occur during cellular growth by an as yet unidentified protease. Processing of GSPT1 might be triggered by ER stress or other cellular stress conditions. Alternatively, the observation that the endogenous or the stably expressed GSPT1 protein was not completely processed to the IAP-binding form suggests the possibility that processing of GSPT1 could be a regulatory step to modulate the protein levels of GSPT1 during the cell cycle by targeting it for proteosomal degradation via the IAP pathway. This idea is consistent with the observations that processed GSPT-1 can trigger the autoubiquitination activity of c-IAP1, and that expression of GSPT1 is cell cycle dependent and is maximally seen at the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (44Hoshino S.

Presumably, developmental and cellular phenotypes resulting from mutations in SIN3 are a consequence of altered transcription of SIN3 target genes. Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SIN3 mutant phenotypes in Drosophila, we used full-genome oligonucleotide microarrays to compare gene expression levels in wild type Drosophila tissue culture cells versus SIN3-deficient cells generated by RNA interference. Of the 13,137 genes tested, 364 were induced and 35 were repressed by loss of SIN3. The ∼10-fold difference between the number of induced and repressed genes suggests that SIN3 plays a direct role in regulating these genes. The identified genes are distributed throughout euchromatic regions but are preferentially excluded from heterochromatic regions of Drosophila chromosomes suggesting that the SIN3 complex can only access particular chromatin structures. A number of cell cycle regulators were repressed by loss of SIN3, and functional studies indicate that repression of string, encoding the Drosophila homologue of the yeast CDC25 phosphatase, contributes to the G2 cell cycle delay of SIN3-deficient cells. Unexpectedly, a substantial fraction of genes induced by loss of SIN3 is involved in cytosolic and mitochondrial energy-generating pathways and other genes encode components of the mitochondrial translation machinery. Increased expression of mitochondrial proteins in SIN3-deficient cells is manifested in an increase in mitochondrial mass. Thus, SIN3 may play an important role in regulating mitochondrial respiratory activity.

SIN3 is a component of a multiprotein complex that functions broadly in eukaryotic organisms as a transcriptional repressor of protein-coding genes (1Ayer D.E.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6450-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that SIN3 possesses intrinsic repression activity, it primarily functions as a scaffold for assembly of the complex and interactions with other transcriptional regulatory proteins (1Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 2Ahringer J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 2Ahringer J.

The combined action of histone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases determines the acetylation status of evolutionarily conserved lysine residues within the N-terminal tails of histones (7Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). In general, histone acetylation levels are correlated with transcription levels; histones are hyperacetylated near active genes and hypoacetylated near inactive genes (8Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Thus, the SIN3 complex is thought to mediate transcriptional repression through the gene-specific deacetylation of histones.Neither SIN3 nor other components of the SIN3 complex can directly bind to DNA, instead targeting of the complex to particular genes occurs through protein-protein interactions with DNA-binding repressors or corepressors that interact with DNA-binding repressors (1Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 2Ahringer J.

Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Within the complex, the SIN3 protein is the main target of these interactions and specifically binds repressors, such as Mad family proteins, and corepressors for nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs 1The abbreviations used are: NHR, nuclear hormone receptor; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; RMA, robust multiarray analysis; GO, Gene Ontology; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TS, thymidylate synthase; CycB, cyclin B; Trx, thioredoxin.1The abbreviations used are: NHR, nuclear hormone receptor; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; RMA, robust multiarray analysis; GO, Gene Ontology; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TS, thymidylate synthase; CycB, cyclin B; Trx, thioredoxin.), such as N-CoR and SMRT.SIN3 functions in numerous biological pathways in yeast and Drosophila. It is not essential for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae but is required to regulate the transcription of a wide variety of genes that play roles in diverse processes such as meiosis, potassium transport, and phospholipid metabolism (9Sternberg P.W.

In contrast, SIN3 is essential in Drosophila. SIN3 null mutants die during larval development, and elimination of SIN3 from Drosophila tissue culture cells results in delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (13Neufeld T.P. Tang A.H. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1998; 148: 277-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pile L.A. Schlag E.M. Wassarman D.A. Mol. Cell.

We have found that SIN3 is a widely acting transcriptional regulator in Drosophila that is minimally required for repression of 364 genes and activation of 35 genes that collectively represent ∼3% of the predicted Drosophila transcriptome. As anticipated, a number of these genes play roles in G2 cell cycle progression and may account for the cell cycle delay of SIN3-deficient cells. However, unexpectedly, many of these genes function in cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways that control energy production, implicating SIN3 as a transcriptional regulator of metabolic homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Interference—To generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for RNA interference (RNAi), individual DNA fragments containing sequences encoding the protein to be targeted by RNAi were amplified by PCR from Drosophila melanogaster genomic DNA and cloned in both orientations into the pCRII-TOPO cloning vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The following primer sets (oriented 5′→3′) were used in a standard PCR reaction: SIN3 (GAATTTGAAGACCACAACCTCG and GATGGCGATATGTCCGGCAC) and STG (AACACCAGCAGTTCGAGTAG and GCATAGGCTTTGCTGAAGTC). Sense and antisense clones were used as templates to generate single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) using a Ribomax kit (Promega). ssRNA was resuspended in annealing buffer (5 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4), and equal quantities of sense and antisense ssRNA were annealed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and slow cooling for 12–18 h to generate dsRNA. dsRNA was stored at –80 °C.RNAi was carried out according to the protocol developed by Clemens et al. (15Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 S2 or Kc Drosophila tissue culture cells were plated into a 60-mm dish and cultured at 25 °C. After 1 h, fetal bovine serum-containing media (Schneider's Drosophila medium, Invitrogen) was removed and replaced with 2 ml of serum-free media. Approximately 40 μg of dsRNA was added and mixed by swirling. After 30 min, 4 ml of media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was added. RNA, to be used for probe synthesis, was extracted 3 days following addition of dsRNA. To evaluate the level of the targeted protein, Western blot analysis was routinely carried out using standard procedures, as described by Pile et al. (14Pile L.A. Schlag E.M. Wassarman D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4965-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To evaluate cell cycle phenotypes resulting from RNAi treatment, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was routinely carried out, as described by Pile et al. (14Pile L.A. Schlag E.M. Wassarman D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4965-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Analysis of mRNA Expression Using Oligonucleotide Arrays—Microarray analysis was performed with GeneChip Drosophila arrays (Affymetrix) using probes derived from total RNA from Drosophila S2 or Kc cells. RNA was prepared and labeled following protocols listed in Section 2 of the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (available at www.affymetrix.com). In brief, total RNA was isolated from 0.5–1 × 107 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 16–24 μg of RNA and was used as a template to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA by in vitro transcription using the BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit (Enzo). Amplified cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to arrays according to the manufacturer's procedures (www.affymetrix.com). Probe hybridization and data collection were performed by the Gene Expression Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. For each condition (wild type S2 cells, wild type Kc cells, SIN3 RNAi S2 cells, and SIN3 RNAi Kc cells) three arrays were hybridized with independently isolated RNA.Statistical Analysis of Microarray Expression Data—Affymetrix CEL files were used as input into log scale robust multiarray analysis (RMA) with an updated indexing of probe sets to genes (available at ftp.fruitfly.org/pub/download/Affymetrix/AffyDrosGenome1Release3_1_nr_genes.cdf.gz) (16Irizarry, R. A., Hobbs, B., Collin, F., Beazer-Barclay, Y. D., Antonellis, K. S., Scherf, U., and Speed, T. P. (2002) Biostatistics, in pressGoogle Scholar). Using an analysis of variance implementation, gene expression changes dependent on RNAi of SIN3 were identified. A set of genes changing at a significance of 1 in 1300 was identified (17Pavlidis, P., and Noble, W. S. (2001) Genome Biol. http://www.genomebiology.com/2001/2/10/Research/0042.Google Scholar). At this significance we expect ∼10 false positives in the list of changing genes. The cell intensity files, output from RMA, and a list of changing genes can be found at www.fruitfly.org/expression/sin3/. The microarray data has also been deposited into ArrayExpress at the European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) with the accession number E-SPMN-1. We identified biological themes in the changing genes using TermFinder software (search.cpan.org/dist/GO-TermFinder/), identifying significant associations after Bonferroni correction.Analysis of Mitochondrial Mass—MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (Molecular Probes), a fluorescent dye that is sequestered in mitochondria, was used to measure mitochondrial mass in untreated and RNAi-treated S2 cells. After the 3-day RNAi treatment, 1 × 106 cells were incubated for 30 min with or without 50 nm MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos in serum-free media. Unstained and stained cells were harvested, washed with serum-free media, resuspended in serum-free media, and analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. Autofluorescence of unstained cells was determined and subtracted from the MitoTracker fluorescence intensity value. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and then averaged. Three experiments were performed for each condition; mock RNAi-treated S2 cells, SIN3 RNAi-treated S2 cells, and STG RNAi-treated S2 cells.MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes), a fluorescent dye that is sequestered in mitochondria, was used to image mitochondria in untreated and RNAi-treated S2 cells. After the 3-day RNAi treatment, unfixed cells were washed with serum-free media and incubated for 30 min with 50 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos in serum-free media. Cells were mounted on glass slides and photographed at the same magnification using an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWith the goal of identifying transcriptional regulatory gene targets of the SIN3 deacetylase complex, we have used microarray expression profiling to determine the set of genes whose transcription is affected by elimination of SIN3. This analysis was performed in both Drosophila S2 and Kc tissue culture cells with the idea that genes whose transcription is altered in both cell lines will represent general, rather than cell type-specific, targets of SIN3. For example, because G2 cell cycle delay is a common phenotype of SIN3-deficient S2 and Kc cells, this analysis should increase the probability of identifying the SIN3 target genes responsible for the cell cycle phenotype (14Pile L.A. Schlag E.M. Wassarman D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4965-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). S2 and Kc cell lines are derived from different Drosophila strains and are molecularly and phenotypically distinct (18Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Adv. Cell Cult. 1981; 1: 91-124Crossref Google Scholar). This fact is reiterated by our observation that ∼1600 genes are differentially expressed between S2 and Kc cells, where ∼800 genes are more highly expressed in each cell line. 2L. A. Pile, P. T. Spellman, and D. A. Wassarman, unpublished observation.SIN3 Is a Transcriptional Repressor—High density oligonucleotide arrays representing 13,137 Drosophila genes were used to monitor gene expression differences between control Drosophila S2 or Kc cells that were mock RNAi-treated and SIN3-deficient Drosophila S2 or Kc cells in which SIN3 protein levels were drastically reduced by addition of dsRNA corresponding to an ∼930-nucleotide region of the SIN3 mRNA (Fig. 1A) (14Pile L.A. Schlag E.M. Wassarman D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4965-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Changes in transcript levels were measured by probing arrays with fluorescently labeled cRNA, generated from total RNA extracted from cells 3 days after RNAi treatment, at which time the maximal reduction in SIN3 protein levels was observed (data not shown).Using analysis of variance to evaluate the expression data, 399 genes, ∼3% of all predicted Drosophila genes, were identified as having altered expression levels in SIN3-deficient S2 and Kc cells compared with wild type S2 and Kc cells. At this confidence level, fewer than 10 of the 399 genes are expected to be false positives. This is likely to be a minimum number of genes regulated by SIN3, because our analysis excluded genes whose expression is altered only in S2 or Kc cells. The number of genes affected by loss of SIN3 is in line with immunofluorescence studies of Drosophila polytene chromosomes, through which it was estimated that 2–13% of Drosophila genes are directly bound by the SIN3 complex (19Pile L.A. Wassarman D.A. EMBO J. 2000; 22: 6131-6140Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The overwhelming majority of the 399 genes had altered expression levels of less than 2-fold, indicating that this group of genes would have been difficult to detect without the analysis of multiple arrays and cell types (see Supplemental data).The 399 identified genes were further analyzed by hierarchical clustering of expression patterns (Supplemental data). The SIN3 dendrogram contains two main branches of 364 induced and 35 repressed genes. It is extremely unusual for microarray data to show such a large difference between the number of induced and repressed genes. The ∼10-fold difference between the number of induced and repressed genes and the concordance between the microarray and polytene results argues that SIN3 plays a direct role in transcriptional repression of the identified induced genes.Of the 399 identified gene products, 254 have been assigned Gene Ontology (GO) terms based on their determined or predicted biochemical activity and/or role as a component of a cellular organelle or biochemical process (20Adams M.D. Celniker S.E.

Venter J.C. Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4770) Google Scholar). Although loss of SIN3 affected genes from a diverse number of biological processes, including signal transduction, transcription, and cell cycle regulation, a comparison of the assigned terms with the complete Drosophila GO data base revealed biases for gene products involved in mitochondrial processes (Supplemental data). Proteins that localize to mitochondria are represented at a rate 4-fold higher than expected (p = 1.43 × 10–12), protein components of the mitochondrial matrix are represented at a rate 7-fold higher than expected (p = 3.58 × 10–11), and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are represented at a rate 8-fold higher than expected (p = 5.11 × 10–12). Thus, SIN3 appears to play a heretofore-unknown role as a transcriptional regulator of nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial proteins.SIN3-regulated Genes Tend to Be Excluded from Heterochromatic Regions of the Drosophila Genome—Analysis of the chromosomal distribution of genes mis-regulated in SIN3-deficient cells indicates that fewer genes than expected map within or adjacent to heterochromatic regions comprised by centromeres and the fourth chromosome. Only 7 of the 399 genes map within or adjacent to heterochromatic cytological positions on the X chromosome (bands 19 and 20), the second chromosome (bands 39–42), the third chromosome (bands 79–82), or the fourth chromosome (bands 101 and 102) (Fig. 2A), whereas based on the fact that 583 predicted genes are contained within these bands, 18 genes are expected to be affected (Fig. 2B). Using a chi-square test, the p value for this result is 5.9 × 10–3. In contrast, within euchromatic regions, genes affected by loss of SIN3 appear to be randomly distributed. The exception is band 55 on chromosome arm 2R, which harbors SIN3-regulated genes, including 4 glutathione transferase genes, at a rate ∼2.5-fold higher than expected.Fig. 2Chromosomal distribution of genes affected in SIN3-deficient cells. A, the histogram displays the number of SIN3-regulated genes that localize to each chromosomal band. Chromosomes and chromosome arms are indicated at the top, and chromosome ends are indicated by vertical dotted lines. Bands encompassing centromeric heterochromatin are indicated by shaded boxes. B, the data presented in panel A was normalized to account for the number of predicted genes contained within each band. The expected number of genes was calculated by multiplying the number of predicted genes within a given band by 0.03, the ratio of the number of genes affected by loss of SIN3 (399) divided by the total number of genes on the microarray (13,137). Values less than zero indicate that fewer genes were observed than expected, and values greater than zero indicate that more genes were observed than expected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overall, these findings are consistent with immunofluorescence staining of Drosophila polytene chromosomes, which revealed that the SIN3 complex binds throughout euchromatic regions but is largely absent from centric heterochromatin and most of the fourth chromosome (19Pile L.A. Wassarman D.A. EMBO J. 2000; 22: 6131-6140Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly, in yeast, RPD3 is excluded from telomeric heterochromatin and sub-telomeric domains (21Kurdistani S.K. Robyr D. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). SIN3 may display a comparable localization pattern, because association of RPD3 with chromatin in yeast is largely dependent on SIN3 (3Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Fazzio T.G. Kooperberg C. Goldmark J.P. Neal C. Basom R. Deldrow J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6450-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the SIN3 complex can only access chromatin with a particular level of compaction, supporting the hypothesis that distinct transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are utilized within different chromosomal domains.SIN3 Regulates Genes Involved in the Oxidative Metabolism of Glucose and Fatty Acids to Acetyl-CoA—Loss of SIN3 results in the up-regulation of numerous genes involved in glycolysis (Fig. 3A). The metabolism of glucose to pyruvate during glycolysis produces energy in the form of ATP (22Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY2002: 425-521Google Scholar). Of the 10 enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, 5 are transcriptionally up-regulated in SIN3-deficient cells, including both of the genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, which catalyzes the final step in the pathway, the irreversible conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. In contrast, the process of gluconeogenesis, in which pyruvate is converted into glucose, may be repressed in SIN3-deficient cells due to down-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. A direct role for SIN3 in repressing multiple glycolytic genes may aid in the coordinate regulation of these genes during development and in response to metabolic stress (23DeRisi J.L. Vishwanathan R.I. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar, 24White K.P. Rifkin S.A. Hurban P. Hogness D.S.

Genes are denoted by their common name followed in parenthesis by the CG number designated by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (www.fruitfly.org). Up-regulated genes are indicated in green typeface, down-regulated genes are indicated in red typeface, and genes that do not change are indicated in black typeface. Acetyl-CoA, a key metabolite in many pathways, is indicated in pink typeface. A, metabolic pathways involving genes affected by loss of SIN3 are organized by cellular location (cytosol, mitochondrial outer membrane, mitochondrial inner membrane, or mitochondrial matrix). Distinct pathways (glycogen metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, inositol synthesis, amino sugar synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, citric acid cycle, and porphyrin synthesis) are denoted by colored boxes. The asterisk indicates enzymes that utilize FAD as a cofactor. B, cytosolic and mitochondrial protein metabolic processes involving genes affected by loss of SIN3 are categorized by process. PEK-Ef2 functions as a negative regulator of translation elongation and cathepsin D, cathepsin F, and cysteine protease inhibitor function as negative regulators of protein turnover.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Up-regulation of genes encoding components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in SIN3-deficient cells may further result in the metabolism of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In the mitochondrial matrix, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex oxidatively decarboxylates pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is composed of three enzymes, two of which are transcriptionally up-regulated in SIN3-deficient cells, the E2 enzyme dihydrolipoyl transacetylase and the E3 enzyme dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (Fig. 3A). Up-regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex may be complemented by increased expression of the gene encoding the arsenite-transporting ATPase (CG1598). Arsenite inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by inactivating the E2 transacetylase and FMN adenylyltransferase, which converts flavin mononucleotide into FAD, a catalytic cofactor for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (22Berg J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2066307140,"Interaction of CD44, an adhesion molecule, with its ligand, hyaluronan (HA), in monocytic cells plays a critical role in cell migration, inflammation, and immune responses. Most cell types express CD44 but do not bind HA. The biological functions of CD44 have been attributed to the generation of the functionally active, HA-adhesive form of this molecule. Although lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines induce HA-adhesive CD44, the molecular mechanism underlying this process remains unknown. In this study, we show that LPS-induced CD44-mediated HA (CD44-HA) binding in monocytes is regulated by endogenously produced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-10. Furthermore, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was required for LPS- and TNF-α-induced, but not IL-10-induced, CD44-HA-binding in normal monocytes. To dissect the signaling pathways regulating CD44-HA binding independently of cross-regulatory IL-10-mediated effects, IL-10-refractory promonocytic THP-1 cells were employed. LPS-induced CD44-HA binding in THP-1 cells was regulated by endogenously produced TNF-α. Our results also suggest that lysosomal sialidase activation may be required for the acquisition of the HA-binding form of CD44 in LPS- and TNF-α-stimulated monocytic cells. Studies conducted to understand the role of MAPKs in the induction of sialidase activity revealed that LPS-induced sialidase activity was dependent on p42/44 MAPK-mediated TNF-α production. Blocking TNF-α production by PD98059, a p42/44 inhibitor, significantly reduced the LPS-induced sialidase activity and CD44-HA binding. Subsequently, TNF-α-mediated p38 MAPK activation induced sialidase activity and CD44-HA binding. Taken together, our results suggest that TNF-α-induced p38 MAPK activation may regulate the induction of functionally active HA-binding form of CD44 by activating sialidase in LPS-stimulated human monocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2080746789,"The p21-activated protein kinases (Paks) are serine/threonine protein kinases activated by binding to Rho family small GTPases, Rac and Cdc42. Recently, Pak family members have been subdivided into two groups, I and II. Group II Paks, including Pak4, Pak5, and Pak6, does not contain the highly conserved autoinhibitory domain that is found in the group I Paks members, i.e. Pak1, Pak2, and Pak3. In the present study, we have purified the glutathione S-transferase fusion form of Pak5 and shown for the first time that Pak5 autophosphorylation can be activated by GTP bound form of Cdc42. Mutation of histidine residues 19 and 22 to leucine on the p21-binding domain of Pak5 completely abolished the binding of Cdc42 and the Cdc42-mediated autophosphorylation. On the other hand, mutation of tyrosine 40 to cysteine of Cdc42 did not knockout the binding of Pak5. Analysis of C-terminal deletion mutants has identified an autoinhibitory fragment of Pak5 that is absent from other group II Pak family members. Taken together, these results suggest that Pak5, like Pak1, contains an autoinhibitory domain and its activity is regulated by Cdc42."

We show that in basal and staurosporine-induced conditions the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive β-synuclein-expressing neurons was drastically lower than in mock-transfected TSM1 cells. This was accompanied by a lower DNA fragmentation as evidenced by the reduction of propidium iodide incorporation measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. β-Synuclein strongly reduces staurosporine-induced caspase 3 activity and immunoreactivity.

Parkinson's disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; LB, Lewy body; 6OHDA, 6-hydroxydopamine; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. is one of the most common and devastating diseases in the elderly (1Fratiglioni L. Launer L.J. Andersen K. Breteler M.M. Copeland J.R.M. Dartigues J.F. Lobo A. Martinez-Lage J. Soininen H. Hofman A. Neurology. 2000; 54: 10-15PubMed Google Scholar, 2Giampaoli S. Aging Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 12: 93-105Crossref Google Scholar). This pathology is characterized by intracellular aggregates, called Lewy bodies (LB) (3Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 4Trojanowski J.Q. Goedert M. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M.-Y. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) that are thought to be responsible for final dementia occurring not only in PD but also in Lewy body diseases. The main component of LB was identified as α-synuclein (5Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar), a 140-amino acid-long synaptic protein (6Uéda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J.

Matsumoto K. Takayama K. Yoshimoto M. Takahashi H. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 239: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8Takeda A. Mallory M. Sundsmo M. Honer W. Hansen L. Masliah E. Am. J.

The central role of α-synuclein in PD pathology has been emphasized by the observation that familial forms of PD were due to two mutations borne by α-synuclein (10Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnston W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C.

Epplen J.T. Schöls L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these mutations trigger alterations of the biophysical properties of α-synuclein, leading to an exacerbation of misfolding and aggregation (12Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Therefore, as with many other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and prion diseases, among others (13Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 14Ferrigno P. Silver P.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Wolozin B. Behl C. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), PD can be documented as a disease associated with protein misfolding. The fact that such aggregates of proteins were recently shown to exhibit an intrinsic toxic potential (16Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar) could lead to a reunifying theory linking misfolding and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, we have shown that α-synuclein displays an antiapoptotic phenotype that was abolished by PD-related mutations (17Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This antiapoptotic function was also prevented when neuronal cells were exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA), a toxin derived from dopamine (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This was associated with an increased expression of α-synuclein, and we postulated that the protein exerted a physiological antiapoptotic phenotype that was abolished in conditions of drastic overexpression and aggregation (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was in line with the observation that overexpression of α-synuclein and its aggregation could lead to a PD-like phenotype in transgenic mice (19Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (20Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). β-Synuclein is another member of the synuclein family (21Nakajo S. Tsukada K. Omata K. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) that lacks the non-amyloidogenic component (NAC) domain that appears to be responsible for the aggregating properties of α-synuclein (23Jensen P.H. Sorensen E.S. Petersen T.E. Gliemann J. Rasmussen L.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). β-Synuclein is therefore considered to be a non-amyloidogenic homolog of α-synuclein. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the ratio of β-synuclein to α-synuclein appeared altered in LB disease (24Rockenstein E. Hansen L.A. Mallory M. Trojanowski J.Q. Galasko D. Masliah E. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because β-synuclein can not seed α-synuclein aggregation (25Biere A.L. Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Anafi D. Jacobsen F.W. Jarosinski M.A. Wu G.M. Louis J.-C. Martin F. Nahri L.O. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34574-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it was postulated that β-synuclein could act as a physiological inhibitor of α-synuclein aggregation (19Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was reported that β-synuclein-derived peptides behave as anti-aggregating agents (26Windisch M. Hutter-Paier B. Rockenstein E. Hashimoto M. Mallory M. Masliah E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). That this β-synuclein property could lead to a therapeutic strategy was validated by the observation that β-synuclein inhibited α-synuclein aggregation in transgenic models of PD pathology (19Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Of the greatest importance was the demonstration that this was accompanied by an amelioration of motor deficits and neurodegenerative alterations (19Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Nothing is known concerning the cellular function of β-synuclein and, more particularly, whether, as is the case for α-synuclein, β-synuclein could control neuronal cell death. We establish here that β-synuclein is antiapoptotic in TSM1 neurons and that this function is linked to a drastic down-regulation of p53 expression and activity. We show that β-synuclein still protects neurons from 6OHDA insult. Finally, we demonstrate that β-synuclein contributes to the α-synuclein function and, more particularly, restores its antiapoptotic phenotype in 6OHDA-treated cells, an experimental condition that normally abolishes α-synuclein antiapoptotic function. Cell Systems and Transfections—TSM1 neurons (27Chun J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (17Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants expressing wild-type β-synuclein were obtained after transfection with 2 μg of β-synuclein cDNA (in pcDNA3) by means of DCA30 (Eurogentec) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Positive transfectants were screened for their β-synuclein-like immunoreactivity as described below. Transient transfections were also performed in TSM1 neurons with DCA30 containing either 2 μg of cDNA encoding α-synuclein and β-synuclein, alone (28Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Uéda K. Checler F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 285: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or in combination. Cells were used 48 h after their transfection. Western Blot Analyses—For the detection of α- and β-synucleins, equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated on Tris-tricine gels and Western blotted with the anti-α- and β-synuclein rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Affiniti Research Products). Active caspase 3, p53, Mdm2 phospho-p38, and β-tubulin immunoreactivities were analyzed by Western blot performed by means of anti-active caspase 3 (rabbit polyclonal; R&D Systems), anti-p53 (mouse monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Mdm2 (mouse monoclonal; provided by Dr. R. Fahraeus), anti-phospho-p38 (rabbit polyclonal; Promega), and anti-β-tubulin (Sigma). Immunological complexes were revealed as described previously (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 Activity Measurements—Stable or transient transfectants were preincubated without or with staurosporine (1 μm) or 6OHDA (0.2 mm) for 2 or 7 h, respectively, and then caspase-3-like activity was fluorometrically measured as detailed extensively (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Caspase 3-like activity is considered as the Ac-DEVD-al sensitive Ac-DEVD-7AMC-hydrolyzing activity. p53 Transcriptional Activity—The PG13-luciferase gene reporter construct (kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein) has been described previously (30El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). One microgram of PG13-luciferase cDNA was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of a β-galactosidase transfection vector (to normalize transfection efficiencies) in mock- or β-synuclein-expressing TSM1 neurons. Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TUNEL Analysis—This procedure has been extensively described (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline), rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, left overnight in 70% ethanol, and then processed for the dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL technique as recommended (Roche Applied Science kit). Staining was assessed with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and DNA label is revealed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as black spots. All cells are stained with erythrosine B to quantify the percentage of total neurons undergoing cell death. Stably transfected TSM1 neurons overexpress a 19-kDa protein, a molecular mass corresponding to that expected for β-synuclein (Fig. 1A). The responsiveness of these cells to staurosporine, an apoptotic effector, has been examined. TSM1 cells display about 20% of TUNEL-positive neurons in basal conditions (Fig. 1B). This number increases drastically upon staurosporine treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, β-synuclein expression significantly reduces the number of TUNEL-positive cells under both basal and staurosporine-stimulated conditions (Fig. 1, B and C). This histological feature was reinforced by the observation that the propidium iodide incorporation measured upon staurosporine stimulation by flow cytometry revealed a lower DNA fragmentation in β-synuclein-expressing cells (data not shown). The β-synuclein-mediated antiapoptotic phenotype was associated with a drastic reduction of staurosporine-induced caspase 3 activation (Fig. 2A). This was accompanied by a lower active caspase 3 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2B). It should be noted that identical data were obtained with various independent β-synuclein-expressing clones (not shown).Fig. 2β-Synuclein decreases caspase 3-like activity. A, caspase 3-like activity was fluorometrically recorded in mock (black bars) and β-synuclein-expressing cells (beta-SYN, white bars) in the absence (Basal) or presence of staurosporine (STS; 1 μm, 2h). Bars represent the Ac-DEVD-al sensitive caspase 3-like activity and are the means ± S.E. of eight determinations carried out in duplicate. Statistical analysis indicates that p < 0.001 by t test analysis for both basal and STS conditions when comparing mock- versus β-synuclein- stably transfected cells. B, active caspase-3-like immunoreactivity (Casp-3 act.) was analyzed in basal (–) and stimulated (+) conditions (STS; 1 μm, 2h) in the indicated cell lines as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein charge was monitored by β-tubulin analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) p53-like immunoreactivity is lower in β-synuclein-expressing neurons than in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, reduced p53 expression is associated with a statistically significant reduction of p53 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4). As p53 expression can be controlled at post-transcriptional levels by several proteins, we examined the influence of β-synuclein on the expression of Mdm2 and phosphorylated p38 (Fig. 5). Thus Mdm2 controls p53 expression mainly by regulating its ubiquitination/degradation rates (31Yin Y. Luciani M.G. Fahraeus R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Conversely, phosphorylated p38 activates p53 by phosphorylation (32Zhu Y. Mao X.O. Sun Y. Xia Z. Greenberg D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22909-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In line with our observed decreased p53 expression, we found higher Mdm2-like immunoreactivity and reduced p38 expression in β-synuclein-expressing cells in both basal and staurosporine-stimulated conditions (Fig. 5). This suggests a possible control of p53 by β-synuclein at a post-transcriptional level. These data, however, do not totally rule out the possibility that β-synuclein could also control p53 expression at a transcriptional level.Fig. 4β-Synuclein overexpression lowers p53 transcriptional activity in TSM1 neurons.

Ct, control; STS, staurosporine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As we showed previously, 6OHDA, a dopaminergic toxin, triggers drastic caspase 3 activation (Fig. 6). β-synuclein fully prevents 6OHDA-induced caspase activation, with the activity remaining close to the control value (Fig. 6). Furthermore, β-synuclein fully prevents the 6OHDA-induced increase in caspase 3 immunoreactivity observed in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 7C). Therefore, β-synuclein retains its antiapoptotic potential with distinct caspase activators, namely staurosporine and 6OHDA. This is not the case for α-synuclein. Thus, although α-synuclein displays a clear protective effect toward staurosporine in neurons (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), our data on caspase activity (Fig. 7A) and immunoreactivity (Fig. 7C) indicate that 6OHDA abolishes the α-synuclein-induced antiapoptotic phenotype in agreement with our previous study (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, of the most interest is our observation that β-synuclein restores the α-synuclein-like antiapoptotic phenotype when both proteins are co-expressed (Fig. 7A). Thus, caspase activity (Fig. 7B) and immunoreactivity (Fig. 7C) returned the values observed with β-synuclein alone. It should be noted that in both basal and 6OHDA-treated neuronal cells the two proteins do not trigger additive protection (Fig. 7B), suggesting that they were likely using the same molecular pathways and that their expression could be redundant, at least for this effect.Fig. 7β-Synuclein restores α-synuclein anti-apoptotic function. TSM1 neurons were transiently transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3) or vector containing the cDNAs of α-synuclein (alpha-syn), β-synuclein (beta-syn), or α-synuclein and β-synuclein (alpha/beta-syn) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 48 h of transfection they were treated for 8 h in the absence or the presence of 0.2 mm 6OHDA and recovered for subsequent analysis of synuclein immunoreactivities (A) and caspase-3 activity (B), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Statistical analysis of the means represented by the bars (four independent experiments carried in duplicate) show p < 0.05 by t test analysis (*). Note that the means concerning cells transfected either with pcDNA3 or α-synuclein when treated with 6OHDA are not significantly different (NS). Caspase 3 immunoreactivity and caspase 3 activity (Caspase-3 act.) in the transiently transfected cells of a representative experiment after treatment with 0.2 mm 6OHDA are shown (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The synucleins constitute a family of small proteins, including α-, β-, and γ-synucleins (for review, see Ref. 33Alves da Costa C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2003; 3: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, α-synuclein draw particular attention because of the demonstration that this presynaptic protein (34Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. Rohan de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) coexisted with the amyloid β-peptide as the main non-amyloidogenic component of the senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (6Uéda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). More puzzling was the observation that α-synuclein was also the main component of Lewy bodies (5Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar) (37Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.-H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M.-Y.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). That this protein played a central role in PD was suggested by the observation that a subset of familial PD was indeed due to autosomal dominant mutations borne by α-synuclein (10Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnston W.G. Lazzarini A.M.

Indeed, these mutations abolish various physiological functions elicited by the protein (for review, see Ref. 33Alves da Costa C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2003; 3: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and this was thought to be due to an exacerbation of its aggregation properties (39Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Masliah E. Saitoh T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10139-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 40Han H. Weinreb P.H. Lansbury J.P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) triggered by the mutation (41Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F.

Interestingly, this aggregated profile was also observed in transgenic mice overexpressing α-synuclein, leading to motor activity impairment mimicking some of that observed in PD pathology (19Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We recently showed that, under physiological conditions, α-synuclein reduces neuronal responsiveness to various apoptotic stimuli, leading to a decreased caspase 3 activation (17Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This phenotype appeared to be p53-dependent (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here again, it was of the greatest interest that this anti-apoptotic phenotype was abolished by a pathogenic mutation and 6OH-DOPA (17Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), two distinct “effectors” triggering PD or used for mimicking this pathology (42Beal M.F. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Unlike, α-synuclein, nothing was known about the putative function of β-synuclein. It was, however, suggested that this protein could act as a regulator of the α-synuclein aggregation process and thereby control putative sliding toward a PD-like pathogenesis. Thus, β-synuclein shares some common structural properties with α-synuclein but lacks the non-amyloidogenic component domain thought to make α-synuclein prone to aggregation (23Jensen P.H. Sorensen E.S. Petersen T.E. Gliemann J. Rasmussen L.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, β-synuclein is considered to be a non-amyloidogenic member of the α-synuclein family (43El-Agnaf O. Irvine G.B. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). β-Synuclein not only can resist aggregation but can also interfere with the aggregating process of α-synuclein. Thus, it was reported that β-synuclein-derived peptides could display anti-aggregating properties (26Windisch M. Hutter-Paier B. Rockenstein E. Hashimoto M. Mallory M. Masliah E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). That these in vitro properties could have implications for an anti-Parkinsonian therapeutic strategy was suggested by the ability of β-synuclein to lower the density of Lewy bodies (19Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and prevent the behavioral PD-like phenotypic alterations triggered by the overexpression of α-synuclein in doubly transgenic mice (19Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Although the macroscopic and behavioral examination of the above transgenic mice indicate a cross-talk between α- and β-synuclein, the molecular mechanisms by which β-synuclein could control α-synuclein function remained poorly understood. As we demonstrated that α-synuclein could display a physiological anti-apoptotic phenotype abolished in the pathology, we first questioned whether β-synuclein could be involved in the control of cell death. Second, we examined whether this protein could influence the α-synuclein-mediated anti-apoptotic function and behave as a neuroprotective effector for its parent protein. We clearly establish, for the first time, that β-synuclein drastically reduces the neuronal responsiveness to staurosporine. β-Synuclein lowers the number of TUNEL-positive cells and DNA fragmentation and diminishes both caspase 3 activity and immunoreactivity. It was very interesting to note that the down-regulation of staurosporine-induced caspase activation was accompanied by a reduction of p53 expression and transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that the expression of Mdm2, a protein responsible for p53 ubiquitination and, thereby, degradation by the proteasome (31Yin Y. Luciani M.G. Fahraeus R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), was enhanced. This indicated that β-synuclein likely controls p53 levels at a post-transcriptional level. In agreement with this hypothesis, phosphorylated p38 immunoreactivity, a clue to p53 activation (32Zhu Y. Mao X.O. Sun Y. Xia Z. Greenberg D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22909-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was lowered in β-synuclein-expressing neurons. That α-and β-synuclein act as physiological anti-apoptotic proteins via the identical lowering of p53-dependent caspase 3 activation is likely not anecdotal and suggests that β-synuclein could eventually counterbalance α-synuclein deficiency, likely explaining at a molecular level the selectivity of dopaminergic cell death taking place in PD (for review, see Ref. 44Barzilai A. Melamed E. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This could be the case particularly when the α-synuclein phenotype is abolished by 6OHDA, one of the dopaminergic, toxic, derived products (45Curtius H.C. Wolhensberger M. Steinmann B. Redweik S. J. Chromatogr. 1974; 99: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 46Irwin I. Langston J.W. Ellenberg J.H Koller W.C. Langston J.W. Etiology of Parkinson's Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 153-201Google Scholar, 47Jellinger K. Linert L. Kienzl E. Herlinger E. Youdim M.B.H. J. Neural. Transm. 1995; 46: 297-314Google Scholar). In this context, we demonstrate that unlike α-synuclein, interestingly, β-synuclein fully retains its anti-apoptotic function in 6OHDA-treated neurons. Therefore, one can envision that β-synuclein could complement α-synuclein deficiency at least in the first stages of PD neuropathology. Furthermore, α-synuclein remains anti-apoptotic in the presence of β-synuclein in 6OHDA-treated neurons. Therefore, one could consider that β-synuclein could also act as a neuroprotective factor via the preservation of α-synuclein antiapoptotic properties. In this context, it is noteworthy that the ratio of β-synuclein over α-synuclein is altered in Lewy bodies (24Rockenstein E. Hansen L.A. Mallory M. Trojanowski J.Q. Galasko D. Masliah E. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As α- and β-synucleins have been shown to physically interact (19Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that lowered levels of β-synuclein in PD could result first in an alteration of intrinsic β-synuclein-mediated control of cell death and, second, in a defective α-synuclein anti-apoptotic phenotype normally controlled by β-synuclein. The above data have clear implications for PD and strengthen the track of searching for β-synuclein derivatives able to protect α-synuclein from aggregation, thereby preserving its beneficial antiapoptotic properties. This strategy could perhaps be extrapolated to other neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we previously established that presenilin 2, its mutated counterpart (48Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and its C-terminal fragment (49Alves da Costa C. Mattson M.P. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12064-12069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) trigger a pro-apoptotic phenotype that could, to some extent, account for some of the neuropathological stigmata observed in Alzheimer's disease (50Cotman C.W. Anderson A.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 19-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 51Cotman C.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: S29-S32Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Amazingly, in prion-related diseases we also recently showed that overexpression of PrPc led to a drastic Mdm2-regulated, p53-dependent caspase 3 activation (29Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, p53 can be seen as a key factor acting as a common denominator involved in various neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting p53 can be seen as a therapeutic strategy. Thus, p53 inhibitors were recently shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and improve motor deficits observed in an experimental animal model of Parkinsonism (52Duan W. Zhu X. Ladenheim B. Yu Q.-S. Guo Z. Oyler J. Cutler R.G. Cadet J.-L. Greig N.H. Mattson M.P. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 deletion protects mice from methamphetamine-induced toxicity of dopaminergic terminals and cell bodies (53Hirata H. Cadet J.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 780-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the means of specific cell-permeant inhibitors of p53 such as pifithrin-α (54Komarov P.G. Komarova E.A. Kondratov R.V. Christov-Tselkov K. Coon J.S. Chernov M.V. Gudkov A.V. Science. 1999; 285: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) should be considered cautiously with respect to putative side effects due to widespread and nonspecific accessibility to neuronal cells. Alternatively, a strategy aimed at delivering β-synuclein to a specifically targeted and disease-affected neuronal population could be envisioned as a less dramatic mean to down-regulate p53 in PD but also in other p53-related pathologies such as Alzheimer's and prion diseases.

VEGF acts via a family of receptors (VEGFRs) to mediate endothelial cell proliferation, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis. The VEGF genes from independent parapoxvirus isolates show an extraordinary degree of inter-strain sequence variation. We conducted functional comparisons of five representatives of the divergent viral VEGFs. These revealed that despite the sequence divergence, all were equally active mitogens, stimulating proliferation of human endothelial cells in vitro and vascularization of sheep skin in vivo with potencies equivalent to VEGF. This was achieved even though the viral VEGFs bound VEGFR-2 less avidly than did VEGF. Surprisingly the viral VEGFs varied in their ability to cross-link VEGFR-2, induce vascular permeability and bind neuropilin-1. Correlations between these three activities were detected. In addition it was possible to correlate these functional variations with certain sequence and structural motifs specific to the viral VEGFs. In contrast to the conserved ability to bind human VEGFR-2, the viral growth factors did not bind either VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-3. We propose that the extensive sequence divergence seen in the viral VEGFs was generated primarily by selection against VEGFR-1 binding.

These proteins have significant homology to VEGF-A and are encoded by Orf virus and Pseudocowpox virus. Orf virus and Pseudocowpox virus are distinct species within the genus Parapoxvirus, and infect sheep and goats and cattle, respectively, but both readily infect humans (28Haig D.M. Mercer A.A. Vet. Res. 1998; 29: 311-326PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mercer A. Fleming S. Robinson A. Nettleton P. Reid H. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1997; 13: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting lesions in the skin demonstrate extensive vascular dilation, dermal edema, and proliferation of endothelial cells (28Haig D.M. Mercer A.A. Vet. Res. 1998; 29: 311-326PubMed Google Scholar, 30Groves R.W. Wilson-Jones E. MacDonald D.M. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1991; 25: 706-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have shown that the disruption of the VEGF-like gene in Orf virus strain NZ2 markedly reduces these characteristics of infection (31Savory L.J. Stacker S.A. Fleming S.B. Niven B.E. Mercer A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10699-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the VEGF-like genes from 24 isolates of Orf virus have revealed a surprising degree of sequence variation between isolates (26Mercer A.A. Wise L.M. Scagliarini A. McInnes C.J. Buettner M. Rhiza H.J. McCaughan C.A. Fleming S.B. Ueda N. Nettleton P.F. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The majority of VEGF-like genes were similar to that of Orf virus strain NZ2. Although these could be grouped as NZ2-like VEGFs, they showed levels of amino acid identity (average between isolates of 86.1%) more reminiscent of that seen between species of poxviruses than inter-strain variation. A few isolates carried genes identical or very nearly identical to the VEGF-like gene from Orf virus strain NZ7, which shares only 43.6% amino acid identity with the VEGF encoded by strain NZ2 (ORFVNZ2VEGF). The VEGF from another species of parapoxvirus, Pseudocowpox virus, strain VR634, shares only 41.4 and 60.8% amino acid identity with ORFVNZ2VEGF and ORFVNZ7VEGF, respectively (27Ueda N. Wise L.M. Stacker S.A. Fleming S.B. Mercer A.A. Virology. 2003; 305: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The extent of sequence variation seen between members of the viral subfamily raises the possibility that these sequence differences might give rise to functional variations. We and others reported previously that the VEGFs from Orf virus strains NZ2, NZ7, and D1701 and that from Pseudocowpox virus strain VR634 share some of the properties of mammalian VEGF (21Wise L.M. Veikkola T. Mercer A.A. Savory L.J. Fleming S.B. Caesar C. Vitali A. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the viral VEGFs differ from the cellular family members in their distinct receptor binding profile recognizing VEGFR-2 but not VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-3. In addition, the VEGF from Orf virus strain NZ2 has been shown to bind NP-1 (21Wise L.M. Veikkola T. Mercer A.A. Savory L.J. Fleming S.B. Caesar C. Vitali A. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3071-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The functional studies to date have each examined only a single viral VEGF and differences in the protein expression and assay systems used in the different studies make direct comparisons difficult. In this study we quantitatively compared five of the more divergent variants of the viral VEGFs to determine whether this variation in sequence translates to quantitative differences in receptor-binding specificity and biological activity. Cloning—DNA fragments containing nucleotides 4–398, 4–398, and 4–406 of the VEGF-like genes of Orf virus strains NZ10, D1701, and NZ7, respectively, were prepared by PCR using viral DNA as the templates (23Lyttle D.J.

MacFarlane, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne) (32Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) immediately upstream from the DNA sequence encoding the FLAG octapeptide (Scientific Imaging Systems). The proteins derived from Orf virus strains NZ2, NZ10, D1701, and NZ7 were designated ORFVNZ2VEGF, ORFVNZ10VEGF, ORFVD1701VEGF, and ORFVNZ7VEGF, respectively. Also available were equivalent vectors, containing nucleotides 4–401 from Orf virus strain NZ2 (21Wise L.M. Veikkola T. Mercer A.A. Savory L.J. Fleming S.B. Caesar C. Vitali A. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3071-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), nucleotides 4–458 from Pseudocowpox virus strain VR634 (27Ueda N. Wise L.M. Stacker S.A. Fleming S.B. Mercer A.A. Virology. 2003; 305: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and nucleotides 4–576 of mouse VEGF164 (33Stacker S.A. Vitali A. Caesar C. Domagala T. Groenen L.C.

XbaI fragments from the vectors described above, containing the VEGF coding regions and FLAG octapeptide, were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pAPEX-3 (34Evans M.J. Hartman S.L. Wolff D.W. Rollins S.A. Squinto S.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis from these vectors would therefore give rise to secreted polypeptides that were tagged with the FLAG octapeptide at their C termini. The proteins derived from Pseudocowpox virus and mouse VEGF, were designated PCPVVR634VEGF and mVEGF164, respectively. An equivalent vector, pVDAPEXΔNΔC, containing amino acids 93–201 from human VEGF-D (10Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Makinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar) expresses a truncated secreted VEGF-D polypeptide with the FLAG octapeptide at its N terminus. This protein was designated hVEGF-DΔNΔC. Expression and Purification—FLAG-tagged proteins were expressed by transfection of 293EBNA cells, with pAPEX-3 vectors with or without VEGF inserts, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics), and the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with M2 (anti-FLAG, Sigma) monoclonal antibody as previously described (21Wise L.M. Veikkola T. Mercer A.A. Savory L.J. Fleming S.B. Caesar C. Vitali A. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3071-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A mock elution sample was obtained from conditioned medium from pAPEX-3 transfected 293EBNA cells that underwent an identical purification process to the FLAG-tagged proteins. Analysis and Quantification—Purified proteins were combined with SDS-PAGE sample buffer either with or without 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. When required proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and visualized by detection with an M2 (anti-FLAG) antibody as described elsewhere (21Wise L.M. Veikkola T. Mercer A.A. Savory L.J.

Serial dilutions of control proteins of known concentration (carbonic anhydrase, BSA, and VEGF-DΔNΔC), and the purified VEGF proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then stained with Coomassie blue, and the bands were quantitated using a densitometer and the Quantity One program (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A standard curve obtained for the control protein was used to determine the amount of purified VEGF protein present in each sample. Construction of VEGFR-2-Ig Fusion Proteins—DNA fragments containing the coding region for the first four Ig-like domains of human and mouse VEGFR-2 were amplified by PCR from the templates Signal pIgplus-KDR (Y. Gunji, Haartman Institute, Helsinki, Finland) (10Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Makinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34884-34892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), respectively. The DNA fragments were then cloned into the expression vector pAPEX-Fc-FLAG (M. Halford, Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research, Melbourne, Australia) immediately upstream from DNA sequences encoding the Fc portion of human IgG1 and the FLAG octapeptide. Protein synthesis would, therefore, give rise to secreted FLAG-tagged VEGFR-2-Ig fusion proteins. Mitogenic Assay with Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells—Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were seeded at 104 cells per well into a 24-well plate and were allowed to adhere. Samples of purified growth factors were serially diluted in medium with reduced serum and without growth supplements. Cells were then incubated in the media for 72 h at 37 °C, and proliferation was measured by direct counting. Miles Assay for Vascular Permeability—The Miles vascular permeability assay was performed using anesthetized guinea pigs as previously described (35Miles A.A. Miles E.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1952; 118: 228-257Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Animals were given an intracardiac injection of 500 μl of 0.5% Evans blue dye in PBS to introduce the dye into the blood stream. Samples of purified growth factors were diluted in PBS and 100 μl was injected intradermally into a shaved area on the back of each animal. After 30 min, animals were sacrificed and an area of skin excised. The dye was then eluted from the skin sample in formamide and quantitated by measuring the OD at 620 nm. Controls of 20 ng/ml VEGF and PBS alone were also administered to each animal to allow normalization across animals. In Vivo Assay in Sheep Skin—Each of the purified proteins were diluted to 20 ng/μl in PBS, 100 μl of which was injected intradermally at duplicate sites within the wool-free regions of the inside hind legs of two sheep. Animals were divided into three groups of two and each group was given duplicate injections of either ORFVNZ2VEGF, ORFVNZ10VEGF, and ORFVD1701VEGF, or ORFVNZ7VEGF, PCPVVR634VEGF, and hVEGF-DΔNΔC, or the control samples, FLAG-tagged ovine IL-10, Orf virus IL-10, and a mock purification sample. PBS and mVEGF164 were also administered to each hind leg of individual animals to allow comparison between groups. Boost injections of identical samples were administered to each site after 72 h. 4 mm biopsies were taken from each site and adjacent areas of untreated skin after 9 days. Biopsies were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed into paraffin wax. Two 4 μm, serial sections were taken ∼100 μm into the biopsy within the fixed block, followed by two more serial sections, each 100 μm apart. Paired sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin or used for immunohistochemical analysis of vascularization. Vascular endothelial cells were identified using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor antiserum (Dako). To quantitate the extent of dermal vascularization, four grids covering a combined area of 0.2 mm2 were overlaid on areas of dermis, avoiding glands and hair follicles. The side of each grid measured 0.224 mm and was divided by 10 equidistant lines. The points at which stained endothelial cells crossed the intersecting points of the grids were counted, and the areal fraction of vascularized dermis was expressed as the fraction of the intersecting points on which stained cells fell. The average areal fraction of vascularization was determined from three semi-serial sections per inoculation site and from four equivalent samples from different animals. Binding Assays with Soluble VEGFR Extracellular Domains— VEGFR-3-Ig (K. Pajusola, Haartman Institute, Helsinki, Finland) and FLAG-tagged VEGFR-2-Ig fusion proteins were expressed in 293EBNA cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h after transfection then serum-starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% BSA. The fusion proteins were precipitated from the clarified conditioned medium using protein A-Sepharose beads. Purified VEGFR-1-Ig fusion protein (R&D Systems) was also precipitated using protein A-Sepharose beads. 900 μl of conditioned medium from 293EBNA cells that had been transfected with expression plasmids encoding one of the growth factors or a vector control and then biosynthetically labeled with [35S]Cys for 6 h were combined with 100 μl of 10 X Binding Buffer (5% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20, and 10 μg/ml heparin (VEGFR-2 only)) and either anti-FLAG (M2) or VEGFR-Ig fusion protein-bound beads. After 3 h at room temperature, the Sepharose beads were washed three times with binding buffer at 4 °C. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Radiolabelled proteins were detected by a phosphorimaging analyzer (Molecular Dynamics) and were quantitated using the program Quantity One (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Levels of binding to the Ig fusion proteins were quantitated and expressed as a relative binding index, a ratio of the amount of labeled protein precipitated by each receptor, compared with that precipitated by anti-FLAG beads alone. Bioassays for the Binding and Cross-linking of the Extracellular Domains of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3—Bioassays for monitoring the binding and cross-linking of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 involved the use of cell lines expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular, ligand-binding domains of mouse VEGFR-2 or human VEGFR-3 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the erythropoietin receptor (33Stacker S.A.

The chimeric receptors are expressed by a Ba/F3-derived cell line that survives and proliferates in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) but which dies after IL-3 deprivation. It has previously been shown that signaling from the cytoplasmic erythropoietin receptor domain of the chimeric receptors upon ligand binding is capable of rescuing these cells in the absence of IL-3, thereby allowing detection of specific ligand binding and cross-linking of the extracellular domains of these receptors (10Achen M.G.

However, the precise mechanisms of CpG ODN activation of immune cells have not been fully elucidated. The small GTP-binding protein Ras mediates MAPK activation in response to a variety of stimuli. Up to now, it is not clear whether Ras plays a role in CpG ODN signaling. In the present study, we found that the dominant-negative version of Ras (RasN17) and specific Ras inhibitor, FTI-277, inhibited CpG ODN-induced nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production by murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. While overexpression of wild-type Ras enhanced CpG ODN-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and NF-κB activation, overexpression of RasN17 inhibited CpG ODN-induced ERK, JNK, and NF-κB activation. RasN17 overexpression also inhibited CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation. Further studies revealed that CpG ODN activated Ras in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and Ras associated with TLR9 in a CpG ODN-dependent manner. Most interestingly, activation of Ras preceded the association of Ras with TLR9, giving rise to a possibility that Ras activation might not be dependent on the interaction between Ras and TLR9. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Ras can be activated by CpG ODN in macrophages, and Ras is involved in CpG ODN signaling as an early event by associating with TLR9 and promoting IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation, and MAPK and NF-κB activation.

Innate immune cells recognize pathogen-associated molecule patterns (PAMPs) conserved in microbe by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to initiate host immune responses against infectious pathogens (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). CpG motif is abundant in bacterial DNA and is methylated and suppressed in mammalian DNA.

The small GTP-binding protein, Ras, is an important signal mediator in response to stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and hormones (29Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J. Schlessinger J.

Although both CpG ODN and Ras can activate ERK, there is no report about the relevance of Ras in TLR9-mediated CpG ODN signal transduction. In this study, we investigated the role of Ras in CpG ODN signaling in murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Using FTI-277, a Ras inhibitor, and constructs encoding wild-type Ras or dominant-negative RasN17, we demonstrated that Ras activation, as an early event, participates in CpG ODN signaling and plays an important role in CpG ODN-induced activation of macrophages. Reagent—Phosphorothioate-modified CpG ODN and control non-CpG ODN were synthesized by Sybersyn Co. (Sybersyn, Beijing, China). Their sequences are: CpG ODN, 5′-TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT-3′; non-CpG ODN, 5′-TCC ATG AGC TTC CTG ATG CT-3′. Endotoxin levels in these ODNs were <0.015 endotoxin units/mg ODN, measured by Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate assay. LPS and FTI-277 were purchased from Sigma. Anti-ERK, anti-JNK, anti-p38, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-p38, and their respective horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmid Constructs—The expression vector dominant-negative RasN17 and control vector pEF-neo were kind gifts from Gottfried Baier (35Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Langlet C. Baier G. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Burn P. Wittinghofer A. Katzav S. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Wild-type Ras expression construct was generated from RasN17 by converting Asn17 to Ser17 using Mutanbest Kit (TaKaRa). Mutagenic primer: sense 5′-GCT GAC CAT CCA GCT GAT C-3′; antisense 5′-GCA CTC TTG CCC ACA CC-3′. The clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGL3.5XκB-luciferase plasmid was kindly provided by Seamus J. Martin (36Bouchier-Hayes L. Conroy H. Egan H. Adrain C. Creagh E.M. MacFarlane M. Martin S.J.

Culture and Transfection of RAW264.7 Cells—The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2. Plasmids encoding wild-type Ras or dominant-negative RasN17 were introduced into RAW264.7 cells with LipofectAMINE™ PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were transfected with 400 ng of DNA in each well of a 24-well plate for NO and TNF-α detection, 3–300 ng of DNA in a 24-well plate for NF-κB activity assay, 1 μg of DNA in a 6-well plate for MAPK phosphorylation or 6 μg of DNA in a 60-mm dish for IRAK1-TRAF6 complex detection, then transfected cells were further cultured for 40 h before CpG ODN or non-CpG ODN stimulation. Empty pEF-neo plasmid DNA was used to equalize total plasmid introduced. For NF-κB activity assay, 100 ng of pGL3.5XκB-luciferase plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK-Renilla-luciferase plasmid were co-introduced into the cells. Ras Activation Assay—Ras activation was detected using Ras Activation Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to manufacturer's recommendation. In brief, RAW264.7 cells (5 × 106) were plated in 60 mm dishes in serum-free medium overnight, and were stimulated with CpG ODN or non-CpG ODN as indicated. The cells were lysed with Mg2+ lysis buffer (MLB buffer), and protein concentration was measured using BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Then the lysates were incubated with GST-Raf-RBD (GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain of Raf) for 1 h at 4 °C. Ras-GTP binding beads were pelleted by centrifugating at 14.000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. After washed with MLB three times, the beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. Ras-GTP was detected by anti-Ras antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized by SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). Detection of NO and TNF-α—2 × 105 RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The cells were treated with the indicated amounts of FTI-277 for 24 h, or transfected with indicated doses of RasN17 or wild-type Ras and cultured for 40 h. After stimulated with 0.3 μm CpG ODN or non-CpG ODN for 24 h, the supernatants were harvested. The concentrations of NO in supernatants were measured using the Griess reagent. In brief, Griess reagent (Sigma) was prepared by mixing equal volume of 1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% naphtylethylenediamide in 2.5% phosphoric acid just before use. 100 μl of Griess reagent was mixed with equal amounts of cell supernatants. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, OD value was measured using a Bio-Rad (Model 550) microplate reader at 570 nm. Concentration of nitrite was assessed by reference to sodium nitrites standard curve. The concentrations of TNF-α in the supernatants were measured using mTNF-α ELISA kits (R&D System) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. Western Blotting—2 × 105 RAW264.7 cells were transfected with wild-type Ras, RasN17, or control pEF-neo vector 40 h before CpG ODN stimulation. After washing twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed with M-PER™ Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Activated p-ERK1/2, p-p38, and p-JNK1/2 were detected as described previously (37An H. Xu H. Yu Y. Zhang M. Qi R. Yan X. Liu S. Wang W. Guo Z. Qin Z. Cao X. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 81: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unactivated total ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 in each sample were also detected to show equal protein loading. Assay of NF-κB Activity—2 × 105 RAW264.7 cells were co-transfected with the mixture of pGL3.5XκB-luciferase, pRL-TK-Renilla-luciferase, and indicated amounts of pEF-neo, RasN17 or wild-type Ras construct. 40 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with 0.3 μm CpG ODN or non-CpG ODN. NF-κB luciferase activities were measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data are normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing firefly luciferase activity with that of Renilla luciferase. Immunoprecipitation—RAW264.7 (5 × 106) cells were stimulated with CpG ODN in 60-mm dishes for the time indicated. In some cases, cells were transiently transfected with wild-type Ras or RasN17 constructs before stimulated with CpG ODN. After washing with cold PBS, cells were lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Equal amounts of proteins of each sample were precleared using protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and incubated with relevant antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Immune complex beads were washed thoroughly with lysis buffer. 50 μl of sample buffer was added to the pellets, and the proteins were released from the beads by boiling for 5 min. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting. Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as means ± S.E. of the mean for separate experiments. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test with a value of p < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. Ras Is Required for CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α Production—CpG ODN activate macrophages to produce antimicrobial materials and cytokines (4Stacey K.J. Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2116-2122PubMed Google Scholar, 38Yi A.K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar, 39Utaisincharoen P. Anuntagool N. Chaisuriya P. Pichyangkul S. Sirisinha S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 128: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Ras protein in CpG ODN-induced macrophage activation, we observed the effects of FTI-277, a specific Ras inhibitor (40Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), on CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production in murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. CpG ODN treatment induced NO and TNF-α production in RAW264.7 cells. Pretreatment with FTI-277 inhibited CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production in a dose-dependent manner. FTI-277 inhibited NO and TNF-α production by maximally about 50 and 40%, respectively (Fig. 1A). A dominant-negative version of Ras, RasN17 (Ser17 is replaced with Asn) was also used to investigate the role of Ras in CpG ODN-induced activation of macrophages. Consistent with the results obtained with FTT-277, overexpression of RasN17 inhibited CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production (Fig. 1B), suggesting Ras played a role in CpG ODN-induced activation of macrophages. To confirm this conclusion, we further investigated the effects of wild-type Ras overexpression on CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production in RAW264.7 cells. In the absence of CpG ODN, wild-type Ras overexpression alone induced NO production with TNF-α production unaltered. In the presence of CpG ODN, Ras overexpression significantly increased both NO and TNF-α production by macrophages. However, neither Ras nor RasN17 overexpression affected NO and TNF-α production in non-CpG ODN-stimulated RAW264.7 cells compared with that in the unstimulated cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Ras activity is required for CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production in macrophages. Ras Mediates CpG-induced ERK and JNK Activation—It is well known that activation of MAPK is necessary for CpG ODN-induced cytokines production (8Sparwasser T. Koch E.S. Vabulas R.M. Heeg K. Lipford G.B. Ellwart J.W. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 38Yi A.K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of wild-type Ras and RasN17 overexpression on CpG ODN-induced MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Stimulation with 0.3 μm CpG ODN resulted in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 kinase in RAW264.7 cells. Compared with mock transfection, wild-type Ras transfection enhanced CpG ODN-induced ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation. On the contrary, RasN17 transfection inhibited CpG ODN-induced ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation. However, neither overexpression of wild-type Ras nor that of dominant-negative RasN17 remarkably affected CpG ODN-induced p38 kinase phosphorylation. These results demonstrated that Ras controls CpG ODN-induced ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activation in macrophages. Ras Mediates CpG ODN-induced NF-κB Activation—NF-κB activation plays a central role in CpG ODN-induced cytokines production (4Stacey K.J. Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2116-2122PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yi A.K. Yoon J.G. Hong S.C. Redford T.W. Krieg A.M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We assessed CpG ODN-induced NF-κB activity in wild-type Ras and dominant-negative RasN17 overexpressing RAW264.7 cells. Wild-type Ras or dominant-negative RasN17 were co-introduced into RAW264.7 cells with NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-TK-Renilla-luciferase construct. The cells were left untreated or treated with CpG ODN or non-CpG ODN, and then the activity of luciferase reporter gene was measured (Fig. 3). Although dominant-negative RasN17 overexpression did not remarkably affect the basic level of NF-κB activity in untreated cells, wild-type Ras overexpression significantly increased NF-κB transcription activity in untreated cells, suggesting that Ras activation mediated NF-κB activation in RAW264.7 cells. In CpG ODN-treated RAW264.7 cells, wild-type Ras enhanced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas dominant-negative RasN17 inhibited NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner, showing that Ras is required for CpG ODN-induced NF-κB activation in macrophages. Ras Affects IRAK1/TRAF6 Complex Formation—In TLR signal transduction, TRAF6 is activated upon IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation, and subsequently activates downstream effectors, including MAPK and NF-κB (25Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 42Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Next, we further tested whether Ras participates in CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation. As shown in Fig. 4A, almost no IRAK1/TRAF6 complex could be detected in unstimulated RAW264.7 cells. However, IRAK1/TRAF6 complex constitutively increased within 30 min following CpG ODN treatment. Transfection with constructs encoding wild-type Ras alone could increase IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation (Fig. 4B). However, there were more IRAK1/TRAF6 complexes formed in Ras-overexpressing cells treated with CpG ODN. On the contrary, transfection with dominant-negative RasN17 significantly inhibited CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation in RAW264.7 cells. The contrary effects of wild-type Ras and dominant-negative RasN17 on CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation suggest that Ras plays an important role in CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation in macrophages. Ras Is Time and Dose-dependently Activated by CpG ODN in Macrophages—Because overexpression of wild-type Ras could enhance CpG ODN-induced MAPK and NF-κB activation, we investigated whether CpG ODN stimulation could up-regulate the expression of endogenous Ras protein in RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, CpG ODN treatment could not induce remarkable alteration in Ras expression level within 2 h. Thus we investigated whether CpG ODN could induce activation of endogenous Ras in RAW264.7 cells. GST-Raf-RBD fusion protein, which binds only active form of Ras-GTP, was used to detect activation of Ras. As shown in Fig. 5B, little Ras-GTP could be detected in unstimulated RAW264.7 cells. Treatment with 0.3 μm CpG ODN transiently but significantly increased the amount of active Ras-GTP. CpG ODN-induced Ras activation occurred within 2 min, peaked at 5 min, and declined 10 min after CpG ODN treatment. Furthermore, CpG ODN-induced Ras activation was dose-dependent. Minimally 0.1 μm CpG ODN could activate Ras, and 0.3 μm CpG ODN activated Ras more efficiently (Fig. 5C). However, non-CpG ODN treatment could not increase the amount of Ras-GTP. Our observations suggest that Ras activation might be necessary for its participation in CpG ODN signal transduction. Ras Is Associated with TLR9 in Macrophages upon CpG ODN Stimulation—The rapid activation of Ras following CpG ODN treatment suggested that Ras activation might be an early event in CpG ODN signal pathway and might take place in close proximity to the CpG ODN receptor complex. Therefore, we analyzed whether Ras interacted with TLR9 upon CpG ODN stimulation. RAW264.7 cells stimulated with CpG ODN or non-CpG ODN were lysed, equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ras antibody, and then immunoblot was performed to detect co-precipitated TLR9. As shown in Fig. 6A, TLR9 was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Ras in CpG ODN-treated RAW264.7 cells. The interaction between endogenous TLR9 and Ras occurred within 5 min following CpG ODN stimulation, peaked at 45 min, and declined at 60 min. The interaction between endogenous TLR9 and Ras was further verified by converse experiments in which TLR9/Ras complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-TLR9 antibody and detected with antibody against Ras (Fig. 6B). In the same condition, non-CpG ODN did not induce the formation of TLR9/Ras complex. An irrelevant isotype antibody was used to confirm the immunoprecipitation of TLR9/Ras complex was specific (Fig. 6C). These results suggested that Ras participates in CpG ODN signaling in macrophages by interacting with TLR9. Ras is a small GDP-binding protein. The members of the small GDP-binding protein family play important roles in the activation of immune cells induced by cytokines and mitogens (30Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 32Wittinghofer F. Nature. 1998; 394: 319-320Google Scholar, 43Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this family, Rac1 mediates TLR2-induced NF-κB activation by directly interacting with TLR2 and PI3-K (44Arbibe L. Mira J.P. Teusch N. Kline L. Guha M. Mackman N. Godowski P.J. Ulevitch R.J. Knaus U.G. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Although these results suggest that the members of small GDP-binding proteins might play important roles in TLR signal transduction, there is no evidence that Ras is involved in TLR9-mediated CpG ODN signaling. To investigate the involvement of Ras in CpG ODN signal transduction, constructs encoding wild-type Ras and a dominant-negative version of Ras, RasN17, as well as a Ras specific pharmacological inhibitor, FTI-277, were used. All of these approaches are widely used to demonstrate the role of Ras in various signal transduction pathways (40Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J.

While Ras overexpression increased CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production, dominant-negative RasN17 decreased CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production in macrophages, respectively. Consistent with these results, FTI-277 dose-dependently inhibited CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production. Since cytokines are main effectors released from activated macrophages, these results demonstrate that Ras is required for the full activation of macrophages induced by CpG ODN. In addition to the common MyD88-dependent pathway, TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 can activate downstream signal components through Rac1, TICAM, and TIRAP respectively (26Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 28Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat.

Immunol. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). All these pathways involve downstream activation of MAPK and/or NF-κB, and full activation of them is required for cytokines production. However, CpG ODN has only been demonstrated to induce MyD88-dependent signal transduction in macrophages, in which the MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 cascade is utilized. In this signal transduction, upon recognition of CpG ODN motif, TLR9 recruits MyD88 and subsequently IRAKs. Then the activated IRAK1 is released from receptor complex and forms complex with TRAF6, which mediates activation of MAPK and NF-κB (47Hacker H. Vabulas R.M. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that wild-type Ras overexpression enhances CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 formation, and ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-κB activation, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative Ras inhibits CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 formation, ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-κB activation, thus confirming that Ras plays an important role in CpG ODN signaling and functions upstream of TRAF6, MAPK, and NF-κB activation in macrophages. Ras has been reported to induce Raf-mediated MEKK activation in certain cytokine-induced signal transductions and subsequently activate NF-κB through induction of IκB phosphorylation (34Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 48Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Ras might also control MAPK and NF-κB activation through an alternative mechanism in CpG ODN signaling by affecting IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation, which then controls MAPK and NF-κB activation in TLR9 signal transduction. However, neither wild-type Ras nor dominant-negative Ras overexpression remarkably affects the activation of p38 kinase upon CpG ODN stimulation, suggesting p38 might be activated through a mechanism different from that of ERK and JNK. Recently, Ras has been shown to be activated by IL-1 in a matrix-dependent manner and regulated NF-κB activation through TRAF6 (49Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 50Caunt C.J. Kiss-Toth E. Carlotti F. Chapman R. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6280-6288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this scenario, dominant-negative RasN17 blocks TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation, and dominant-negative TRAF6 does not affect NF-κB activation induced through transfection with constitutively active RasVAL-12; at the same time, RasN17 has no effect on MyD88-mediated activation of NF-κB (50Caunt C.J. Kiss-Toth E. Carlotti F. Chapman R. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6280-6288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Ras activity feeds into NF-κB pathway downstream of TRAF6 or NF-κB is activated through second messengers totally separated from that regulated by TRAF6 (50Caunt C.J. Kiss-Toth E. Carlotti F. Chapman R. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6280-6288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ras also participates in IL-1-induced activation of p38 MAPK in EL4.NOB-1 cells (45McDermott E.P. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7808-7815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, while dominant-negative TRAF6 does not affect p38 activation induced by active RasVHa, RasN17 blocks both TRAF6 and MyD88-induced p38 activation, suggesting that Ras affects IL-1-induced NF-κB and p38 activation through different mechanisms. Whether dominant-negative TRAF6 blocks IL-1-induced Ras activation is worthy of further investigation. In our experiment, the fact that overexpression of wild-type Ras and dominant-negative RasN17 reversely affected CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation indicates that Ras activity feeds into CpG ODN signaling upstream of TRAF6. Taken together, these results suggest that TLR and IL-1R induce different signal transduction events even though they share homologous cytoplasmic regions (17O'Neill L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the difference might be attributed to the synergy between IL-1 and matrix-dependent signaling and the different cell lines used. Although overexpression of Ras enhances CpG ODN-induced MAPK and NF-κB activation in macrophages, CpG ODN treatment cannot up-regulate the expression level of endogenous Ras within 2 h. Instead, CpG ODN treatment induces rapid activation of endogenous Ras, demonstrating that Ras positively participates in CpG ODN signaling by activation rather than up-regulation upon CpG ODN treatment. Ras activation occurs at 2 min, peaks at 5 min and then declines following CpG ODN treatment. Comparing the time courses of Ras activation and that of IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation reveals that Ras activation precedes the formation of IRAK1/TRAF6 signal complex, supporting our conclusion that Ras functions upstream of TRAF6 activation in macrophages. To illustrate the mechanism by which endogenous Ras is activated in macrophages by CpG ODN stimulation, we investigated whether Ras interacted with TLR9 upon CpG ODN treatment. As anticipated, when anti-TLR9 antibody is used to immunoprecipitate TLR9, Ras can be easily detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes with anti-Ras antibody. Conversely, when anti-Ras antibody is used in immunoprecipitation and anti-TLR9 antibody is used in blotting, TLR9 is also easily detected in the complexes following CpG ODN treatment. However, to our surprise, the activation of Ras seems to precede the interaction between TLR9 and Ras. We found that Ras activation was detectable at 2 min and peaks at 5 min following CpG ODN treatment, while TLR9/Ras complex formation was detectable at 5 min and was most obvious at 45 min following CpG ODN treatment. The uncoupled time courses give rise to a possibility that CpG ODN-induced Ras activation might be independent of the interaction between TLR9 and Ras. CpG ODN endocytosis and the following endosome maturation are required for CpG ODN signaling (51Hacker H. Mischak H. Miethke T. Liptay S. Schmid R. Sparwasser T. Heeg K. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6230-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In resting cells, TLR9 is dispersedly and intracellularily expressed. Upon CpG ODN treatment, TLR9 is recruited to endosome and initiates signal transduction in endosome (52Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). However, the details about CpG ODN endocytosis and TLR9 recruitment remain un-elucidated. Activation and endocytosis of Ras are well known in EGF signal transduction (29Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J. Schlessinger J. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1993; 363: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study also demonstrated that EGF-induced Ras activation regulates the internalization of membrane-located protein (53Shaye D.D. Greenwald I. Nature. 2002; 420: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Given these results, we propose that it could not be ruled out that Ras is activated by an unclear mechanism involving CpG ODN endocytosis, and activated Ras might facilitate the recruitment of TLR9 into endosome by interacting with TLR9. The relationship between Ras activation and TLR9 involvement in CpG ODN signaling is now under investigation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Ras activity is required for CpG ODN-induced NO and TNF-α production in macrophages. Ras not only mediates CpG ODN-induced ERK, JNK, and NF-κB activation, but also promotes CpG ODN-induced IRAK1/TRAF6 complex formation in macrophages. CpG ODN treatment induces rapid Ras activation and association of Ras with TLR9. We identify Ras activation as an important early event in CpG ODN signaling in macrophages."

The proteolytic activity of MT6-MMP has been studied using recombinant catalytic fragments and shown to degrade several components of the extracellular matrix. However, the activity is possibly modulated further by the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain, because some MMPs are known to interact with other proteins through this domain. To explore the possible function of this domain, we purified a recombinant MT6-MMP with the hemopexin-like domain as a soluble form using a Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line as a producer. Mature and soluble MT6-MMP processed at the furin motif was purified as a 45-kDa protein together with a 46-kDa protein having a single cleavage in the hemopexin-like domain. Interestingly, 73- and 70-kDa proteins were co-purified with the soluble MT6-MMP by forming stable complexes. They were identified as clusterin, a major component of serum, by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. MT1-MMP that also has a hemopexin-like domain did not form a complex with clusterin. MT6-MMP forming a complex with clusterin was detected in human neutrophils as well. The enzyme activity of the soluble MT6-MMP was inactive in the clusterin complex. Purified clusterin was inhibitory against the activity of soluble MT6-MMP. On the other hand, it had no effect on the activities of MMP-2 and soluble MT1-MMP. Because clusterin is an abundant protein in the body fluid in tissues, it may act as a negative regulator of MT6-MMP in vivo.

Cells are continuously communicating with the extracellular environment through the cell surface where molecules mediating signals exist. Proteolysis is an important part of the regulation of these transmembrane signals by activation, inactivation, or functional conversion of the molecules (1Lopez-Otin C. Overall C.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

However, our knowledge about the proteases involved in such processes remains limited compared with that of the intracellular signaling events and responsive molecules. Recently, a number of cell-associated proteases have been identified by cDNA cloning techniques and from the whole genome sequencing projects, and this has gradually opened the way to addressing the proteolytic events in the pericellular space.One such example is MT6-MMP, the latest member of the MT-MMP 1The abbreviations used are: MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; Mca, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; FN, fraction; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; mAb, monoclonal antibody.1The abbreviations used are: MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; Mca, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; FN, fraction; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; mAb, monoclonal antibody. subgroup in the MMP family (matrixins) (4Pei D.

Among the six members, MT6-MMP tethers to the cells through a covalent link to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) in the plasma membrane (6Kojima S. Itoh Y. Matsumoto S. Masuho Y. Seiki M.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 9Seiki M. APMIS. 1999; 107: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). MT6-MMP is expressed almost specifically in neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMN) (4Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Kang T. Yi J. Guo A.

Alvarez S. Nakano A. Arribas J. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils express other MMPs such as MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) as well (10Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), but these are also expressed in other tissues and cell types (2Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Given this specificity in its expression, MT6-MMP seems to play a pivotal role in the neutrophil function. It is also interesting that stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate or interleukin-8 caused MT6-MMP to be released as a soluble enzyme from the cell surface or secretory vesicles (7Kang T.

Because MMPs are responsible for the degradation of most of the components of the extracellular matrix, the MMPs produced by neutrophils are presumably important for invasion and migration of the cells to inflammatory sites and/or destruction of the host tissue. On the other hand, the substrates of MMPs are not restricted to the matrix components (11McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Recent studies in the field have revealed their targets also include non-matrix type molecules, such as cell adhesion molecules, cytokines, growth factors, and receptors (2Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar).The proteolytic activity of MT6-MMP has been studied using recombinant catalytic fragments and was found to degrade type IV collagen, gelatin, fibrin, fibronectin, chondroitin sulfide proteoglycan, and dermatin sulfide proteoglycan but not types I–III collagens (7Kang T.

Although the substrate specificity of MMP is basically attributable to the structure of the catalytic cleft, the hemopexin-like domain is also known to modulate the activity by binding the substrates, interacting with other proteins that may function as an adaptor for possible substrates, or affecting the enzyme structure (13Murphy G.

Thus, it is important to examine MT6-MMP with a hemopexin-like domain.In this study, we established a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line that stably expresses a soluble form of MT6-MMP with a hemopexin-like domain to study the properties of the intact MT6-MMP focusing on the function of the C-terminal domain. Mature MT6-MMP processed at the furin motif was purified as a 45-kDa protein and a 46-kDa protein having a single cleavage in the hemopexin-like domain. During the purification, 73- and 70-kDa proteins were found to associate with MT6-MMP by forming stable complexes. These proteins were identified as clusterin, a major component in serum, by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. This study examined the specificity and roles of the complex formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), RPMI 1640 medium, FLAG peptide, monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and anti-FLAG M2-agarose were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal mouse anti-human clusterin antibody was from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ). G418 (geneticin) and hygromycin B were from Invitrogen. Protease inhibitor mixture and FuGENE™ 6 were from Roche Applied Science. A quenched fluorescent peptide substrate, Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2, was obtained from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Soluble form of MT1-MMP was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Okada at Keio University (Tokyo, Japan). MMP-2 was purified as described previously (16Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 and -2 were a kind gift from Dr. K. Iwata (Dai-ichi Pure Chemical, Takaoka, Japan).Cell Culture and Transfection—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDCK cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mg/ml of kanamycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mg/ml kanamycin. For transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well, and transfection was performed after 16 h. Expression plasmids for proteins were transfected using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Construction of Expression Plasmids—cDNA of MT6-MMP was used as a template to generate DNA fragments for sMT6-F (Met1–Gly514) by PCR employing two primers: a forward primer (5′-AGT GGA TCC CCA CCA TGC GGC TGC GGC TCC G-3′) and a reverse FLAG insertion primer (5′-ACT CTC GAG TCA TCA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC ACC AGA GCT CGG GGC GG-3′). The fragment was sub-cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Invitrogen).FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK)-tagged MT1-MMP (MT1F) and MT6-MMP (MT6F) were constructed as described previously (6Kojima S. Itoh Y. Matsumoto S. Masuho Y. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and sub-cloned into the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen). The MT6F plasmid was used as a template to generate DNA fragments for MT6FdCAT and MT6FdPEX. MT6FdCAT and MT6FdPEX were catalytic domain (Tyr108–Gly280)-deleted and hemopexin-like domain (Cys317–Cys518)-deleted mutants of MT6F, respectively. All the mutant constructs were generated by PCR using the overlap extension method as described previously. All PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Establishment of Stable Cell Lines of sMT6-F—The expression vector for sMT6-F was transfected into MDCK cells using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science). At 2 days after transfection, the cells were selected in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml kanamycin (Invitrogen), and 800 μg/ml G418. After culture for 10 days, each single clone was selected by limiting dilution. Positive clones were then used for protein purification.Purification of sMT6-F—The stable sMT6-F transfectant was cultured in a cell factory (Nunc, Rochester, NY) until confluent. The cells were washed three times with PBS and replenished with serum-free DMEM. After incubation for 72 h, the conditioned medium (CM) was collected, clarified by centrifugation, and then concentrated using ammonium sulfate to a final saturation of 80%. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and then dissolved in and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Brij 35. This fraction was then applied to an anti-FLAG M2-agarose column, and the column was washed with the same buffer. Specific elution was carried out using FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml).Western Blot Analysis—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions (16Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, MA). After blocking with 10% fat-free dry milk in PBS for 1 h, the membrane was probed with primary antibody specific to each antigen. The membrane was further probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and detected using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences).Gelatin Zymography—Gelatin zymography was performed as described previously (19Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer without a reducing agent and separated on 7.5% acrylamide gels containing gelatin (0.8 mg/ml). The gelatin-containing gel was renatured by washing with 2.5% Triton X-100-containing buffer for 1 h and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. The gelatin remaining in the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and gelatinolytic activity was detected as clear bands against a blue background.N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing of Purified sMT6-F and Its Binding Proteins—The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). After the staining of the membrane with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the stained bands were excised, and the Beckman Coulter LF3000 amino acid sequencer was used.Gel Permeation Chromatography—The sMT6-F-clusterin complex was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TBS buffer containing 0.05% Brij 35 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and a 1-ml fraction was collected. The calibration was performed using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), adolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) as protein standards.Dissociation of sMT6-F from sMT6-F-Clusterin Complex—The sMT6-F-clusterin complex was separated by gel permeation chromatography. The complex-containing fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. After 12 h dialysis, the pooled fraction was denatured using 6 m urea. The denatured complex was applied to a Q-anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). The dissociated clusterin was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, whereas clusterin-free sMT6-F was eluted with buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. Subsequently, the separated sMT6-F and clusterin were individually dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, and 0.01% Brij 35 at 4 °C for 2 and 12 h, respectively. The final preparation was frozen at –80 °C before use.Assay of Enzyme Activities—Purified enzyme was assayed using a fluorescence-quenched peptide substrate (Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2) (20Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme (0.7 nm) was incubated with substrate (2 μm)in50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Brij 35 at 37 °C for 1 h. The concentration of enzyme was determined by active site titration with TIMP-2.Reaction mixtures of enzyme and inhibitors were preincubated at 25 °C for 15 min with TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and clusterin. The apparent inhibition constant K i(app) was calculated by using Equation 1, Ki(app)=I/(Vo/Vi-1)(Eq. 1) where I is the final inhibitor concentration, Vo the rate of substrate hydrolysis without inhibitor, and Vi the rate of hydrolysis with inhibitor.Immunoprecipitation—Expression plasmids were transfected into MCF-7 cells using FuGENE™ 6. Stable transfectants were selected using hygromycin B (300 μg/ml) and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 6 h. The agarose was washed three times with RIPA buffer and precipitated. The bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody or anti-human clusterin antibody. Other experimental conditions were described in our previous report (18Mori H. Tomari T. Koshikawa N. Kajita M. Itoh Y. Sato H. Tojo H. Yana I. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).Preparation of Anti-MT6-MMP Polyclonal Antibody—A polyclonal antibody against MT6-MMP was raised in rabbits immunized with a purified sMT6-F. Because the sMT6-F preparation may contain residual clusterin, the antibody was extensively absorbed using the clusterin preparation from the MDCK cells. The antibody was confirmed to be specific to MT6-MMP without showing cross-reactivity against other MT-MMPs (Fig. 10A) and not to react with clusterin using MDCK and MCF-7 cells (data not shown).Isolation of PMNs—Human PMNs with >98% purity were isolated from fresh heparinized blood of healthy volunteers by dextran sedimentation followed by separation on a density gradient (21Liu Z. Zhou X. Shapiro S.D. Shipley J.M. Twining S.S. Diaz L.A. Senior R.M. Werb Z. Cell. 2000; 102: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The viability was confirmed by the trypan blue exclusion assay.RESULTSPurification of MT6-MMP—The translated pro-MT6-MMP has a hydrophobic amino acid stretch at the C terminus that acts as a signal for GPI anchoring. To prepare a soluble form of MT6-MMP, the hydrophobic stretch was deleted and substituted with the FLAG tag sequence (sMT6-F) (Fig. 1A). MDCK cells that stably express sMT6-F were prepared, and the conditioned medium containing the secreted sMT6-F was collected. The sMT6-F in the culture medium was detected as a band with an expected molecular size of 47 kDa under reducing conditions as demonstrated by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (anti-FLAG mAb). sMT6-F was accumulated in the medium according to the time in culture without significant degradation (Fig. 1B). A weak band of 21 kDa presumably representing a degradation product was also detected depending on the culture conditions.Fig. 1Stable expression of soluble MT6-MMP. A, schematic representation of wild-type (MT6-MMP) and soluble MT6-MMP (sMT6-F). sMT6-F was a C-terminal membrane-spanning domain deletion mutant and tagged with a FLAG epitope for detection and purification. SP, signal peptide; Pro, propeptide; Furin Motif, furin cleavage site; Cat, catalytic domain; PEX, hemopexin-like domain; GPI signal, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor signal; FLAG, FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). B, a plasmid for sMT6-F and an empty vector (mock) were stably transfected into MDCK cells. Confluent cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured further in serum-free DMEM. After 24, 48, and 72 h, each conditioned medium was collected and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)After concentration of the culture medium with ammonium sulfate, sMT6-F was purified using an agarose beads column conjugated with the anti-FLAG mAb. Most of the proteins did not bind to the column as shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1 and 2). The proteins bound to the column were eluted with FLAG peptide and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Five major bands corresponding to 47, 45, 35, 27, and 21 kDa were detected in the elution fraction (lane 3). Among them, the 47- and 21-kDa bands had the FLAG sequence from the reactivity to the antibody, but the others did not (lane 5). SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions revealed four major bands of 73-, 70-, 46-, and 45-kDa proteins (lane 4). Both the 46- and 45-kDa proteins were detected by anti-FLAG mAb (lane 6) and showed gelatinolytic activity, whereas the 73- and 70-kDa proteins did not (lane 7, and also refer to Fig. 5 for better resolution). As the 73- and 70-kDa proteins were eluted from the column by FLAG peptide and were not detected in the preparations from the non-transfected MDCK cells (data not shown), they are presumably associating with sMT6-F.Fig. 2Purification of soluble MT6-MMP by affinity chromatography. Purified proteins on an anti-FLAG monoclonal affinity column were subjected to SDS-PAGE (left panel, lanes 3 and 4) and Western blotting (center panel, lanes 5 and 6) using anti-FLAG M2 antibody under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Purified fraction (lane 4) was also analyzed by gelatin zymography (lane 7). Lane 1, conditioned medium; lane 2, flow-through.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Separation of sMT6-F-clusterin complex by gel permeation chromatography. A, separation of clusterin-bound and -free sMT6-F by gel permeation chromatography. Purified proteins (clusterin-bound and -free sMT6-F) were subjected to chromatography on a gel permeation column of Superdex 200 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. Protein standards (MW Markers indicated by arrowheads) were used to calibrate the column: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), adolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). B, starting material (starting) and purified samples (FN. 47, 50, 53, 57, 60, 64, 70, 75, 78, 80, 83, and 87) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Each protein was detected by silver staining. Bands corresponding to clusterin and sMT6-F are indicated by arrows. Asterisks indicate the fractions used for the following assay. C, comparison of proteolytic activity between clusterin-bound sMT6-F (FN 57 and 60) and -free sMT6-F (FN 80 and 83). Each fraction was assayed using fluorescence-quenched peptide substrate. D, the same fractions were analyzed by gelatin zymography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of Canine Clusterin as the Protein Binding to sMT6-F—To analyze the polypeptide components of the bands detected under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3A), they were extracted from the gel and examined further under reducing conditions (Fig. 3B). The 73-kDa protein in Fig. 3A was composed of two polypeptide chains of 45 and 35 kDa possibly linked with disulfide bonds (Fig. 3B, 2nd lane), and the 70-kDa protein also contained two polypeptides of 45 and 27 kDa (Fig. 3B, 3rd lane). The 46-kDa protein in Fig. 3A was separated into 27- and 21-kDa polypeptides (Fig. 3B, 4th lane). The smaller polypeptide has the FLAG tag from the reactivity to the antibody (Fig. 2, lane 5) and is thought to contain the C-terminal fragment of sMT6-F. The 27-kDa polypeptide presumably corresponds to the fragment containing the catalytic domain of sMT6-F, because the 46-kDa protein, from which this fragment is derived, retained the gelatinolytic activity (Fig. 2, lane 7, and also refer to Fig. 5 for better resolution). The 45-kDa protein in Fig. 3A was composed of a single polypeptide of sMT6-F (Fig. 3B, 5th lane). A shift of molecular mass from 45 kDa under non-reducing conditions to 47 kDa under reducing conditions was observed, and this reflects the disruption of the intramolecular disulfide bond in the hemopexin-like domain.Fig. 3Identification of purified proteins that shifted their molecular weight on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. A, purified sMT6-F and associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. B, the 73-, 70-, 46-, and 45-kDa proteins (1st 4 bands) were excised from the gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Each protein was detected by silver staining. Total, purified sMT6-F and associated proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Then each polypeptide was extracted from the gel and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Fig. 4). The N terminus of the 47-kDa polypeptide (108 amino acids from the translation start site) exactly matched the downstream sequence of the site of processing by furin-like enzymes that generate the mature form of MT6-MMP (4Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 5Velasco G. Cal S. Merlos-Suarez A. Ferrando A.A. Alvarez S. Nakano A. Arribas J. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar), thus indicating that this is the intact sMT6-F. The 27-kDa polypeptide had the same sequence indicating that this is the N-terminal fragment of sMT6-F containing the catalytic domain. On the other hand, the N-terminal sequence of the 21-kDa polypeptide coincided with the sequence in the hemopexin-like domain that starts from the 348-amino acid position. Thus, the 46-kDa sMT6-F has a cleavage within the hemopexin-like domain, and the two polypeptide chains are connected to each other by a disulfide bond within the hemopexin-like domain (“nicked” sMT6-F).Fig. 4N-terminal sequence analysis of sMT6-F and its associated proteins. Purified sMT6-F and associated proteins (47, 45, 35, 27, and 21 kDa) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane. After the proteins were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, each protein band was excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing analysis. Other experimental conditions were described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 45-kDa polypeptide derived from the 73- and 70-kDa proteins exactly coincided with the β subunit of the canine clusterin, whereas the sequences of the 35- and 27-kDa polypeptides corresponded to the α subunit of clusterin. Clusterin is known to be composed of α and β subunits connected by five disulfide bonds (22Jones S.E. Jomary C. Int. J. Biochem.

Although in Escherichia coli four Tat proteins with calculated membrane spanning domains have been demonstrated to mediate Tat-dependent transport, a specific transport system for twin-arginine signal peptide containing phosphodiesterase PhoD of Bacillus subtilis consists of one TatA/TatC (TatAd/TatCd) pair of proteins. Here, we show that TatAd was found beside its membrane-integrated localization in the cytosol were it interacted with prePhoD. prePhoD was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated by TatAd. Inefficient co-immunoprecipitation of mature PhoD and missing interaction to Sec-dependent and cytosolic peptides by TatAd demonstrated a particular role of the twin-arginine signal peptide for this interaction. Affinity of prePhoD to TatAd was interfered by peptides containing the twin-arginine motif but remained active when the arginine residues were substituted. The selective binding of TatAd to peptides derived from the signal peptide of PhoD elucidated the function of the twin-arginine motif as a target site for pre-protein TatAd interaction. Substitution of the binding motif demonstrated the pivotal role of basic amino acid residues for TatA binding. These features suggest that TatA interacts prior to membrane integration with its pre-protein substrate and could therefore assist targeting of twin-arginine pre-proteins.

Bacteria have two distinct pathways for the export of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. The majority of the periplasmic proteins are exported in an unfolded conformation via the Sec pathway, which is promoted by ATP hydrolysis (1Driessen A.J. Manting E.H. van der Does C. Nat. Struct.

Translocation of the B. subtilis protein PhoD containing a twin-arginine signal peptide was shown to be dependent on the expression of a tatA tatC pair (33Pop O. Martin U. Abel C. Muller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3268-3273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These genes (designated tatAd and tatCd) are co-localized with phoD in one operon resulting in co-regulated expression of phoD and tatAd /Cd. A second copy of tatC (tatCy) was not required for PhoD export (31Jongbloed J.D. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Muller J. J. Biol.

Although PhoD or a fusion consisting of the signal peptide of PhoD and LacZ was not recognized by the E. coli Tat components, co-expression of B. subtilis tatAd /tatCd resulted in translocation of SPPhoD-LacZ. This transport was shown to be Δ pH-dependent. These studies revealed that the minimal requirement of a Tat transport system consists of a TatA/TatC pair, a twin-arginine signal peptide, and the pH gradient at the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (33Pop O.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that PhoD is a member of the so-called Pho regulon of B. subtilis (38Eder S. Shi L. Jensen K. Yamane K. Hulett F.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2041-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The Pho regulon comprises a group of genes that are induced in response to the depletion of inorganic phosphate in the growth medium and is regulated by the two component signal transduction system PhoR/PhoP (39Hulett F.M. Bookstein C. Jensen K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 735-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A phoR12 mutation in B. subtilis strain GCH871 was shown to be functionally active under phosphate replete conditions resulting in the induction of Pho regulon genes (40Müller J.P. An Z. Merad T. Hancock I.C. Harwood C.R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).To investigate the selectivity and specificity of the PhoD transport system further, we analyzed the localization and affinity of TatAd by combining genetic and in vitro approaches in B. subtilis and E. coli. Unexpectedly, we found TatAd in the cytoplasmic membrane, as well as in the cytosol. By using purified TatAd and prePhoD we demonstrated the interaction of both peptides. Inefficient binding of TatAd to mature PhoD or Sec-dependent or cytosolic proteins demonstrated the particular role of the twin-arginine-containing signal peptide of PhoD in the recognition process. The selective affinity of TatAd to peptides derived from the signal peptide of PhoD showed that the twin-arginine motif acts as a binding site of TatAd. Substitution of amino acid residues of the binding motif elucidated the role of particular amino acids of this motif for TatAd recognition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Bacterial Strains, and Media— Table I lists the plasmids and bacterial strains used. TY medium (tryptone/yeast extract) contained Bacto tryptone (1%), Bacto yeast extract (0.5%), and NaCl (1%). For pulse labeling of proteins M9 minimal medium was used (41Muller J.

(42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were from MBI Fermentas. PCR was carried out with the VENT DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis 168 as template.To construct pQE9phoDm , the phoD gene lagging the 5′-terminal region encoding the signal sequence was amplified from the chromosome of B. subtilis strain 168 by PCR using the primers P1 (5′-GTA GGA TCC GCG CCT AAC TTC TCA AGC-3′) containing a BamHI site and P2 (5′-CGA TCC TGC AGG ACC TCA TCG GAT TGC-3′) containing a PstI site. The amplified fragment was cleaved with BamHI and PstI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pQE9. The resulting plasmid pQE9phoD allowed the IPTG-inducible synthesis of N-terminally His6-tagged mature PhoD in E. coli.To overexpress tatAd and tatCd genes in E. coli, genes were amplified using primers Ad1 (5′-GTG GGA TCC ATG TTT TCA AAC ATT GG-3′) containing a BamHI site and primer Ad2 (5′-CCT CTG CAG CAT TCA GCC CGC G-3′) containing a PstI site and Cd1 (5′-TTT CCA TGG ATA AAA AAG AAA CCC-3′) containing a NcoI restriction site and Cd2 (5′-GCG GGA TCC GGC CGC CGC TGT TTC TTC-3′) containing a BamHI restriction site, respectively. The tatAd fragment was cleaved with BamHI and PstI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pQE9. The resulting plasmid pQE9tatAd allowed the IPTG-inducible synthesis of His6-TatAd. The tatCd fragment was cleaved with NcoI and BamHI and subsequently cloned into pQE60, cleaved with NcoI and BglII. The resulting plasmid pQE60tatCd allowed the synthesis of TatC-His6.To amplify the DNA region encoding preYvaY primer Y1 (5′-ATG GAT CCA TGA AAA GTA AAT TAC TTA GGC T-3′), incorporating a BamHI restriction site, and primer Y2 (5′-TAA AAG CTT ATT GAT GAA TCA ATT TT-3′), incorporating a HindIII restriction site, were used. For amplification of the DNA fragment encoding the mature part of YvaY primer Y3 (5′-CAG GAT CCA AAG AAA ACC ATA CAT TT-3′), incorporating a BamHI restriction site, and primer Y2 were used. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted 3′-terminal of the His coding region of pQE9 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids pQE9yvaYp and pQE9yvaYm were transformed into E. coli TG1(pREP4).To synthesize epitope-tagged TatAd the DNA region encoding phoD and tatAd was amplified from the chromosome of B. subtilis 168 by using primer P1 (33Pop O.

A HindIII-EcoRI DNA fragment encoding the 359 3′-terminal amino acids of phoD and tatAd was fused to the DNA region encoding the TAP (calmodulin-binding-protein and protein A) epitopes (43Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) resulting in an in-frame fusion of tatAd and TAP. The ′phoD-tatAd-TAP DNA fragment was placed on the B. subtilis nonreplicative vector pORI22 (44Leenhouts K. Bolhuis A. Venema G. Kok J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 49: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and was transformed into the B. subtilis 168. Campbell-like integration into the chromosome resulted in B. subtilis strain 168::pORI22-tatAd-TAP (Fig. 1). As a control a DNA fragment encoding phoD and the start codon of tatAd was amplified using primer P1 and A2 (5′-CG GAA TTC GCC CGC GTT TTT GTC CTG CTT TAC CGC-3′) containing an EcoRI site and fused to the TAP region resulting in the fusion of the start codon of tatAd and TAP. After subcloning of the DNA fragment into pORI22 and transformation into B. subtilis, strain 168::pORI22-tatAd ′-TAP was obtained (Fig. 1). Appropriate mode of integration of pORI22-derived plasmids into the chromosome of B. subtilis 168 was validated by PCR amplification of junction fragments. For inducible expression of tatAd /tatCd genes in B. subtilis a 1046-bp BamHI-PstI DNA fragment from pQE9tatAd /Cd (33Pop O. Martin U. Abel C. Muller J.P. J. Biol.

Aliquots were enclosed between two 0.1-mm copper profiles as used for the sandwich double-replica technique. The sandwiches were rapidly frozen by plunging them into liquid propane, cooled by liquid nitrogen. Freeze-fracturing was performed in a BAF400T (BAL-TEC, Liechtenstein) freeze-fracture unit at –150 °C using a double-replica stage. The fractured samples were shadowed without etching with 2.0–2.5 nm platinum/carbon at an angle of 35°. The evaporation of platinum/carbon with electron guns was controlled by a thin-layer quartz crystal monitor.Freeze-fracture Labeling—For freeze-fracture immunogold labeling and subsequent electron microscopy the freeze-fracture replica were transferred to a digesting solution (2.5% SDS in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3, and 30 mm sucrose) and incubated overnight (46Fujimoto K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The replica were washed four times in PBS buffer and treated with PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Next they were placed in PBS containing bovine serum albumin (0.5%) and monospecific antibodies against TatAd, SecY, or DnaK (dilution 1:20) for 1 h. Subsequently the replica were washed four times with PBS and placed on a 1:50 diluted solution of the second gold-conjugated antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG with 10 nm of gold; British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK) in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After immunogold labeling, the replica were immediately rinsed several times in PBS, fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed four times in distilled water, and finally picked onto Formvar-coated grids for viewing in an EM 902 electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Freeze-fracture micrographs were mounted with direction of shadowing from bottom to top at a magnification as indicated in the figures.Post-embedding Labeling of B. subtilis—Phosphate-starved B. subtilis cells were embedded in Lowicryl K4M as described (37Müller J.P. Wagner M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections of Lowicryl-embedded cells were mounted on nickel grids with carbon-coated Formvar films and subsequently labeled with specific rabbit antibodies and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10 nm of gold (British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK) as a secondary antibody (37Müller J.P.

https://openalex.org/W1993702697,"To study the role of IGF-I receptor signaling on cell cycle events we utilized MCF-7 breast cancer cells. IGF-I at physiological concentrations increased the level of p21<sup>CIP/WAF</sup> mRNA after4has well as protein after8hby 10- and 6-fold, respectively, in MCF-7 cells. This IGF-1 effect was reduced by 50% in MCF-7-derived cells (SX13), which exhibit a 50% reduction in IGF-1R expression, demonstrating that IGF-1 receptor activation was involved in this process. Preincubation with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced the IGF-1 effect on the amount of p21<sup>CIP/WAF</sup> protein in MCF-7 cells. These results were confirmed by the expression of a dominant negative construct for MEK-1 suggesting that the increase of the abundance of p21<sup>CIP/WAF</sup> in response to IGF-1 occurs via the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Using an antisense strategy, we demonstrated that abolition of p21<sup>CIP/WAF</sup> expression decreased by 2-fold the IGF-1 effect on cell proliferation in MCF-7. This latter result is explained by a delay in G<sub>1</sub> to S cell cycle progression due partly to a reduction in the activation of some components of cell cycle including the induction of cyclin D1 expression in response to IGF-1. MCF-7 cells transiently overexpressing p21 showed increased basal and IGF-I-induced thymidine incorporation. Taken together, these results define p21<sup>CIP/WAF</sup> as a positive regulator in the cell proliferation induced by IGF-1 in MCF-7 cells."

Indeed, alternative splicing of the follistatin gene yields the Fs-315 and Fs-288 isoforms, featuring 315 and 288 residues, respectively.

Despite its relatively limited size, follistatin contains a total of 36 cysteine residues, believed to be arranged into nonoverlapping sets of disulfide bridges corresponding to four autonomous folding units (Fig. 1). The first of these units, which we call Fs0, comprises the 63 N-terminal residues of the mature polypeptide and bears no sequence similarity with any other protein of known structure. In contrast, the rest of the follistatin chain appears to fold into a series of three consecutive 70–74-residue-long structural repeats, referred to as Fs1, Fs2, and Fs3, which display homology to the follistatin-like domain of the extracellular matrix protein BM-40 (12Hohenester E.

In both Fs-315 and Fs-303, the last follistatin repeat is flanked on its C-terminal side by a short, glutamate-rich tail. A closer look at the primary structures for the three follistatin repeats reveals striking differences in the values of their theoretical isoelectric point (pI), which ranges from basic for Fs1 (pI 8.9) to neutral for Fs2 (pI 6.7) and acidic for Fs3 (pI 4.8). Coupled to the observation that follistatin interacts with the heparan sulfate chains of cell surface proteoglycans (16Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H. Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 17Yamane Y. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Furuya S. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Sugino H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7375-7381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these pI values support a model in which a heparin-binding site is located within the most basic of the follistatin repeats, Fs1. Interestingly, Fs-288 has a greater affinity for heparan sulfate than Fs-315, suggesting that the acidic C terminus of the latter can mask the heparin-binding site of follistatin by mimicking the structure and electrostatic properties of sulfated glycans (18Hashimoto O. Nakamura T. Shoji H. Shimasaki S. Hayashi Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13835-13842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although the significance of a follistatin-heparin interaction remains relatively obscure, the affinity of Fs-288 for activin appears to be affected by heparin (19Sumitomo S. Inouye S. Liu X.J. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, Fs-288 has been shown to stimulate the endocytotic degradation of activin in a time- and dose-dependent manner by virtue of its association with sulfated proteoglycans present on the cell surface (18Hashimoto O. Nakamura T. Shoji H. Shimasaki S. Hayashi Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13835-13842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of follistatin action, we have used multiple anomalous dispersion to solve the three-dimensional structure of the Fs1 domain, both alone and in complex with the small heparan sulfate analogs sucrose octasulfate (SOS) and d-myo-inositol hexasulfate (Ins6S). Moreover, we have investigated the binding of these two molecules to Fs1 through the use of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), thus revealing the tight nature of both interactions. Overall, these experiments reveal the location of a potential heparin-binding site on Fs1 and highlight the importance of specific polar groups in its association with sulfated compounds. The results presented in this paper provide us with a more detailed view of follistatin-heparin interactions and give clues about the nature of the interaction with heparan sulfate. All of the chemicals used were of research grade or higher and were purchased from BDH, Difco, Fluka, Melford Laboratories, or Sigma, unless specified otherwise. Ins6S and SOS, both as potassium salts, were purchased from Sigma and Toronto Research Chemicals, respectively. The rat follistatin clone (20Shimasaki S. Koga M. Buscaglia M.L. Simmons D.M. Bicsak T.A. Ling N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Prof. John Gurdon (Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK institute, Cambridge, UK), and PCR primers were synthesized by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility (Cambridge Centre for Molecular Recognition, Cambridge, UK). Preparation of Recombinant Protein—The coding sequence for Fs1, comprising residues 64–136 of the mature follistatin gene product fused to a 5′-AUG codon, was amplified using a standard PCR protocol and inserted into the multiple cloning sequence of the T7-based expression vector pBAT4 (21Peranen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvönen M. Kaariainen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Expression of soluble recombinant protein was subsequently carried out in an Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host and was induced at 37 °C with 400 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Soluble Fs1 was then purified as follows: (i) cation exchange chromatography on an SP-Sepharose matrix (Amersham Biosciences), using a 0.0–1.0 m NaCl gradient; (ii) separation in a Superdex 75 (HiLoad 16/60) size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences); (iii) reversed phase HPLC in a Hichrom C8 column, using a 10–100% acetonitrile gradient; (iv) lyophilization and subsequent resolubilization in water. Selenomethionyl-Fs1 was prepared according to the metabolic inhibition protocol described by Doublié (22Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and purified in a fashion similar to native Fs1. Protein Crystallization—Crystals of Fs1, Fs1/Ins6S, and Fs1/SOS were obtained by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. In all cases, equal volumes of the mother liquor and of a solution containing 1.8 mm (15 mg/ml) protein and 2 mm ligand were mixed and left to equilibrate for a day or 2 at 18 °C. The final, optimized crystallization conditions were: 30–35% PEG 4000, 0.4 m magnesium chloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) for Fs1 crystals; 15–25% PEG 8000, 0.2–0.6 m magnesium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) for Fs1/Ins6S crystals; and 30–35% 2-propanol, 0.6–0.7 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) for Fs1/SOS crystals. Cryoprotection of all three crystal types was achieved through the gradual addition of 20% glycerol to the mother liquor. Phasing and Refinement—The structure of Fs1/SOS was determined by multiple anomalous dispersion, using a single crystal of selenomethionyl-Fs1 in complex with SOS. A three-wavelength multiple anomalous dispersion experiment was performed at beamline BM14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Diffraction images were integrated, and reflection intensities were merged using the HKL2000 package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38431) Google Scholar). The position of one of the two selenium atoms present in the selenomethionyl-Fs1/SOS asymmetric unit was determined using SnB (24Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Phases were calculated with Sharp (25de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) and improved by solvent flattening with Solomon (26Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), using a solvent content of 35%. The resulting 2.5-Å electron density map was clearly interpretable, and an initial model could be built into the density using the program O (27Jones T.A. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Bugg C.E. Crystallographic and Modelling Methods in Molecular Design. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 189-195Google Scholar). Phases were then extended to 1.5-Å with ARP/wARP (28Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using data collected from a single native Fs1/SOS crystal at the ESRF beamline ID-14-4. The structure was subsequently optimized through several rounds of restrained refinement against native amplitudes, treating isotropic B factors individually for all atoms and applying a standard bulk solvent model. Refinement was carried out both in CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13809) Google Scholar), with manual rebuilding and adjustments in O. Water addition was performed using the program ARP (28Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by visual inspection and editing in O. Once a suitable model of Fs1 was obtained, its atomic coordinates were used to compute initial phases for the Fs1/Ins6S and Fs1 structures. Molecular replacement and rigid body refinement were performed in CNS, using the native data sets collected for Fs1/Ins6S and Fs1 at the ESRF beamlines ID29 and ID-14-4, respectively. Refinement was then carried out as described for Fs1/SOS. In all cases, the quality of the final models was assessed using the programs Procheck (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and Whatcheck (32Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E.

Superimposition of the final Fs1 models with their homologs and root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) calculations were carried out using the program Lsqman (34Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, Cheshire, UK1994: 59-66Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry of Protein-Ligand Interactions— Purified Fs1 was dialyzed extensively against a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and diluted down to a final working concentration of 0.025 mm, as determined by absorbance measurements using the Gill and von Hippel (35Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar) theoretical extinction coefficient of Fs1 at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 8,850 m–1 cm–1). SOS and Ins6S in powder form were weighed out accurately and solubilized in the dialysis buffer to the final concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 mm, respectively. Calorimetric titrations were performed using these solutions in a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. The sample cell of the calorimeter was filled completely with the Fs1 solution up to a volume of 1.4 ml, and the system was allowed to equilibrate thermally at 25 °C. 10-μl pulses of the ligand solution were injected into the sample at 3-min intervals. Raw ITC data were integrated using the Microcal Origin software, background heats from ligand to buffer titrations were subtracted, and the corrected heats from the binding reaction were used to derive values for the stoichiometry of the binding (n), the association constant (Ka), the apparent enthalpy of binding (ΔH) and the change in Gibbs free energy occurring upon binding (ΔG). As controls, the ligands were titrated into the dialysis buffer without protein, and buffer alone was injected into the protein solution. Possible interaction of potassium (the counter ion for both Ins6S and SOS) with FS1 domain was also studied but found to have no additional effect compared with the buffer alone control. Fs1 Structure—A brief overview of the three Fs1 crystallographic models described here is given in Table I. All structures display normal bond angle and length variability as defined by Engh and Huber (36Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar), and the majority of ϕ/φ dihedral angle combinations occupy the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (37Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Moreover, given that the Cα atoms for the whole three Fs1 structures can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 0.2 Å for Fs1/SOS and Fs1/Ins6S, and 0.9 Å for Fs1/SOS and Fs1, we shall use the 1.5-Å resolution model of Fs1 in complex with SOS to describe the overall architecture of the Fs1 domain (Fig. 2). Relevant differences among the three structures will be highlighted where appropriate.Table ICrystallographic statistics for the Fs1, Fs1/SOS, and Fs1/Ins6S structuresFs1 NativeFs1/Ins6S NativeFs1/SOSNativeaData from high (1.5 Å) and low (3.0 Å) resolution data sets were merged to collect as many high resolution reflections as possible without causing pixel saturation for the low resolution reactions.SeMet (peak)SeMet (remote)SeMet (edge)Diffraction dataCell dimensions (space group: P212121 1 molecule/asymmetric unit)a (Å)21.5521.5021.5921.6621.6721.66b (Å)43.7338.2138.1538.4838.5238.50c (Å)77.3877.9578.5078.5278.5478.51BeamlineESRFESRFESRFESRFESRFESRFID-14-4ID29ID-14-4BM14BM14BM14Wavelength (Å)0.97950.92020.97950.97870.86600.9790Resolution (outer shell) (Å)38.6-2.5038.9-2.1039.2-1.5039.2-2.5039.2-2.2839.2-2.50(2.59-2.50)(2.18-2.10)(1.53-1.50)(2.59-2.50)(2.38-2.28)(2.59-2.50)Unique reflections2,7874,02610,4564,4615,8224,394Redundancy7.83.55.86.12.52.4Completeness (outer shell) (%)98.2 (90.4)98.6 (99.7)95.0 (71.8)100 (100)99.8 (100.0)99.5 (98.6)Reflections with I/σ(I) greater than 3 (outer shell) (%)87.9 (77.0)82.8 (63.5)84.3 (72.7)85.2 (68.2)64.1 (30.7)77.9 (52.3)R merge (outer shell)0.10 (0.17)0.08 (0.26)0.07 (0.20)0.05 (0.11)0.05 (0.15)0.04 (0.09)MAD phasingFigure of merit, as defined by Sharp (25de la Fortelle E.

Open table in a new tab The Fs1 fold consists of two distinct subdomains, as expected from sequence comparisons with the follistatin-like domain of BM-40, with whom Fs1 shares 31.5% sequence identity. The N-terminal moiety of Fs1 (residues 64–89) is reminiscent of EGF-like modules, as indicated by an identical disulfide connectivity. This subdomain comprises a stretch of residues in an extended conformation (64–74) held in place by two disulfide linkages to strands β1 (75–79) and β2 (85–89). Refined temperature factors for all three structures are highest for this N-terminal domain and for the extended coil in particular, a phenomenon also observed in the BM-40 structure and most probably caused by the poor packing of loop 64–71 against the small β-hairpin formed by strands β1 and β2. Indeed, no main chain hydrogen bonds and only minimal van der Waals interactions are seen between these contiguous polypeptide segments, implying that the conformation of the Fs1 N terminus relies almost exclusively on the presence of the Cys66-Cys77 and Cys71-Cys87 disulfide bridges (labeled 1 and 2 in Fig. 1). As one might expect, this is apparent in the electron density for this region in all three structures, which is at its weakest for the type II β-turn (72–75) preceding strand β1. In addition, conformational differences between the polypeptide backbones of the refined models are clearly visible for loop 64–74. The C-terminal moiety of Fs1 (89–136) has a fold similar to that of Kazal protease inhibitor domains, consisting of a small three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet packed against an α-helix. Strand β3 (102–104) is connected to β4 (108–110) by a type I β-turn, immediately followed by helix α1 (113–122) and strand β5 (129–132). The lowest temperature factors for the Fs1 structure are seen in this small β3-β4-α1 core, which is centered on a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr110). A long stretch of loosely packed amino acids (89–101) is attached to helix α1 via two disulfide bridges (Cys89-Cys121 (bond 3) and Cys93-Cys114 (bond 4)). The greatest backbone differences between the liganded and unliganded forms of Fs1 are seen within this region and can mainly be attributed to an alternative conformation of disulfide bond 4. This places the sulfur atom of Cys93 for the superimposed liganded and unliganded structures ∼3 Å apart and, as we shall see, is likely to be induced by ligand binding. In the case of Fs1/SOS and Fs1/Ins6S, a short 310-helix is also visible between residues 93 and 95. This element of secondary structure is absent from the unliganded structure because of the more extended conformation of the protein backbone for this loop. Finally, a disulfide bond between Cys103 and Cys135 (bond 5) connects strand β3 to the C terminus of the Fs1 domain, thus completing the follistatin fold. Structural Homologs of Fs1—The search for structural homologs of Fs1 using the DALI server (38Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar) failed to yield more than three significant hits, none of which was the follistatin-like domain of BM-40. Instead, Kazal domains from the double-domain protease inhibitor rhodniin (39van de Locht A. Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Friedrich T. Kroger B. Hoffken W. Bode W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5149-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (PDB code: 1tbr, residues from chain R corresponding to the first Kazal domain), the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (40Bolognesi M. Gatti G. Menagatti E. Guarneri M. Marquart M. Papamokos E. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 839-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (PDB code: 1tgs, chain I), and silver pheasant ovomucoid (41Bode W. Epp O. Huber R. Laskowski Jr., M. Ardelt W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (PDB code: 2ovo, chain A) were the only identifiable homologs using this method (Fig. 1). In all cases, only part of the Kazal-like subdomain of Fs1 could be superimposed onto the above Kazal domains and the C-terminal fragment of the BM-40 follistatin-like domain (PDB code: 1bmo) (Fig. 3). Indeed, the greater part of the coil joining residues 90 and 101 in Fs1 follows a different trajectory in its homologs, despite being invariably attached to the rest of the Kazal-like domain through a pair of conserved disulfide bridges (disulfides 3 and 4 in Fs1). Interestingly, the fifth cysteine of the Kazal inhibitor domains does not align in the primary structure with its structural counterparts in Fs1 and BM-40 (Fig. 1). Thus, it appears that the degree of sequence and structural conservation between the Kazal inhibitors and “follistatin-like” molecules does not extend beyond the disulfide bond connectivity for this coil region. This is emphasized further by the apparent lack of tight packing between the coil region and the core of the Kazal-like subdomain and through differences in the spacing of the two cysteines. If we omit the poorly conserved coil region from our comparison, the percentage sequence identity between Fs1 and its various homologs is of the order of 42–47% with 35–36 residues from the three Kazal domains, compared with only 32.4% with the corresponding 35 residues from the C-terminal half of the BM-40 follistatin-like domain. Moreover, the distribution of these values is matched by the Cα r.m.s.d. calculated for these same fragments relative to Fs1, which lies in the range of 0.45–1.2 Å for the Kazal inhibitors and is greater than 1.2 Å for BM-40. On the whole, these figures argue against the rather arbitrary distinction that is currently made between Kazal and follistatin-like domains such as that seen in BM-40. On the other hand, the presence of the N-terminal EGF-like hairpin subdomain in both Fs1 and BM-40 indicates that these two molecules might share a common ancestor, which may have arisen from ancestral Kazal-type and EGF-like molecules through a domain fusion event. As can be seen in the structure-based alignment in Fig. 1, the four N-terminal cysteines of the follistatin domains and of BM-40 align perfectly with their counterparts in the blood coagulation factor VIIa EGF-like module (42Banner D.W.

Interestingly, the SMART data base (43Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P.

https://openalex.org/W2166988131,"The resumption of the meiotic cycle (maturation) induced by 1-methyladenine in prophase-arrested starfish oocytes is indicated by the breakdown of the germinal vesicle and is characterized by the increased sensitivity of the Ca2+ stores to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) to InsP3 starting at the animal hemisphere (where the germinal vesicle was originally located) and propagating along the animal/vegetal axis of the oocyte. This initiates Ca2+ signals around the germinal vesicle before nuclear envelope breakdown. Previous studies have suggested that the final activation of the maturation-promoting factor (MPF), a cyclin-dependent kinase, which is the major element controlling the entry of eukaryotic cells into the M phase, occurs in the nucleus. MPF is then exported to the cytoplasm where its activity is autocatalytically amplified following a similar animal/vegetal spatial pattern. We have investigated whether activated MPF was involved in the increased sensitivity of the Ca2+ response to InsP3. We have found that the development of increased sensitivity of the Ca2+ stores to InsP3 receptors together with the Ca2+ signals in the perinuclear region was blocked in oocytes treated with the specific MPF inhibitor roscovitine. That the nuclear MPF activation is indeed required for changes of the InsP3 receptors sensitivity was shown by enucleating or by dissecting oocytes into vegetal and animal hemispheres prior to the addition of 1-MA. MPF activity 50 min after 1-methyladenine addition was much lower in the enucleated oocytes and in the vegetal hemisphere, which did not contain the germinal vesicle, as compared with the animal hemisphere, which did contain it. The Ca2+ increase induced by InsP3 under these experimental conditions correlated with the changes in actin cytoskeleton induced by MPF."
https://openalex.org/W1979324306,"Secretory proteins are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane through a channel formed by three proteins, namely Sec61p, Sbh1p, and Sss1p (Johnson, A. E., and van Waes, M. A. (1999) Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 15, 799–842). Sec61p and Sss1p are essential for translocation (Esnault, Y., Blondel, M. O., Deshaies, R. J., Schekman, R., and Kepes, F.

During import into the ER through the Sec61p channel, many proteins are N-glycosylated before translocation is completed. In addition, both the Sec61 channel and oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) copurify with ribosomes from rough ER, suggesting that OST is located in close proximity to the Sec61 channel (Gorlich, D., Prehn, S., Hartmann, E., Kalies, K.-U., and Rapoport, T. A. (1992) Cell 71, 489–503 and Wang, L., and Dobberstein, B. (1999) FEBS Lett. 457, 316–322). Here, we demonstrate a direct interaction between Sss1p and a subunit of OST, Wbp1p, using the split-ubiquitin system and co-immunoprecipitation. We generated mutants in the cytoplasmic domain of Sss1p that disturb the interaction with OST and are viable but display a translocation defect specific for proteins with glycosylation acceptor sites. Our data suggest that Sss1p coordinates translocation across the ER membrane and N-linked glycosylation of secretory proteins.

Our data suggest that Sss1p coordinates translocation across the ER membrane and N-linked glycosylation of secretory proteins.

Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Translocation is mediated by a channel formed most likely by three copies of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex (Sec61p, Sbh1p, and Sss1p in yeast; Sec61α, Sec61β, and Sec61γ in mammals) (1Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu.

During cotranslational protein import through the Sec61 channel, the large ribosomal subunit binds to the channel, and channel proteins copurify with ribosomes upon solubilization of rough ER-derived microsomes (3Gorlich D.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The signal peptide is cleaved off from secretory proteins as soon as the cleavage site is sufficiently exposed on the lumenal side (1Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The enzyme complex responsible for cleavage, signal peptidase, is anchored to the Sec61 channel by Sec61β (6Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This interaction is most likely transient, as signal cleavage is required only once early in translocation (6Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The OST complex in yeast consists of eight or possibly nine subunits (Ost1p, Wbp1p, Stt3p, Swp1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost5p, Ost6p, and Ost4p); the first five of the subunits listed are essential. All subunits except Ost4p, against which no antibodies are available, were shown to be assembled in a 240-kDa complex in the ER membrane (7Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). OST can N-glycosylate secretory proteins early during translocation into the ER and close to the lumenal exit of the Sec61 channel (7Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). N-glycan acceptor sites can occur throughout a protein and may need to be modified cotranslationally before they are buried by protein folding. Close proximity of OST to the Sec61 channel is therefore required until termination of translocation. Proximity of the two complexes has also been suggested by binding of the mammalian homologues of OST subunits, Ost1p (ribophorin I) and Swp1p (ribophorin II), to ribosomes that are associated with the Sec61 channel in the ER membrane (10Kreibich G. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 464-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Kalies K.-U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A direct interaction between OST and the Sec61 channel, however, has not been demonstrated to date, nor has a role for glycosylation in translocation been found. To analyze the interaction of OST with other proteins in the ER membrane, we used the split-ubiquitin-based yeast two-hybrid system, which can be used to monitor interaction between membrane proteins in situ (12Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 13Thaminy S. Stagljar I. Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interactions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 395-405Google Scholar). The N-terminal and C-terminal halves of ubiquitin (Nub and Cub), when fused to heterologous proteins, can interact and refold into a quasinative ubiquitin structure (13Thaminy S. Stagljar I. Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interactions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 395-405Google Scholar). A mutant form of Nub, NubG, can reconstitute ubiquitin with Cub only if both NubG and Cub are fused to proteins that are in close spatial proximity (Fig. 1A) (13Thaminy S. Stagljar I. Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interactions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 395-405Google Scholar). If a transcriptional activator is fused to the C terminus of Cub, formation of quasi-native ubiquitin results in cleavage by cytosolic ubiquitin-specific proteases (Fig. 1A, UBP) carboxyl-terminally of Cub, diffusion of the transcriptional activator to the nucleus, and expression of reporter genes. Using this system we found an interaction between the OST subunit Wbp1p and the protein translocation channel subunit Sss1p. We generated mutants in Sss1p in which the interaction with Wbp1p is perturbed to investigate the functional significance of this interaction in vivo and in vitro. Yeast Methods and Strains—We used standard yeast medium and methods (14Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Split-ubiquitin constructs were expressed in strain YG0673 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ wbp1::pRS305(Δwbp1-Cub-PLV)) (12Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). One copy of the SSS1 gene was disrupted in YPH501 (MATa/α ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys 2–801 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52) using HIS3, KRY494 (MATa/α ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys 2–801 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52 sss1::HIS3). pRS304 containing wild type or mutant sss1 was integrated into TRP1, the strains sporulated, and the haploid progeny carrying the TRP1-integrated genes as sole copies of SSS1 analyzed; the strains and genotypes are KRY507 (MATα ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys 2–801 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52 sss1::HIS3 trp1::pRS304(sss1-1)), KRY509 (MATα ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys 2–801 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52 sss1::HIS3 trp1::pRS304(sss1-4)), KRY516 (MATα ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys 2–801 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52 sss1::HIS3 trp1::pRS304(SSS1)), and ISWHA (MATα his7–1 leu2-Δ1 lys 1-1 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52 WBP1-HA::kanMX). Plasmids—pNub-ALG5 and pOST1-Nub are described (12Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). All other Nub fusions were cloned in-frame with the respective genes using PCR. Mutants in SSS1 were generated by error-prone PCR using a limiting concentration of dATP and the Nub-SSS1 plasmid as template. Inserts from plasmids that no longer supported growth of YG0673 on selective media without histidine were sequenced. Co-immunoprecipitations—Microsomes were prepared from YPH501, the HA-tagged WBP1 strain, and isogenic SSS1 wild type and mutant strains (15Lyman S.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitations, 200 μg of microsomes were solubilized in 1 ml of GLB-T (250 mm sorbitol, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and immunoprecipitated with Sss1p antiserum or Wbp1p antiserum crosslinked to protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 18% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride; Wbp1p was detected with high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase (3F10, Roche Applied Science), and Sss1p, Swp1p, Sec61p, and Sbh1p were detected with polyclonal antibodies and peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibodies. For protein N-glycanase digestions, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) and incubated with 2 units of protein N-glycanase for 2 h at 37 °C. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Radiolabelling, immunoprecipitations, and concanavalin A precipitations were performed as described (16Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 17Harty C. Strahl S. Römisch K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In Vitro Translocation—Microsomes were prepared from SSS1 wild type and mutant strains (15Lyman S.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Excess in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled, wild type ppαF or a mutant form in which the glycosylation sites had been removed by site-directed mutagenesis (pΔgpαF) (106 cpm) was translocated into 0.5-μl microsomes (A 280 = 25) at 10 or 20 °C for the indicated periods of time in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (17Harty C. Strahl S. Römisch K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The amount of membranes was limiting in the reactions. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples were resolved on 18%, 4 m urea acrylamide gels, and a translocated, glycosylated, wild type 3gpαF or a translocated, signal-cleaved, mutant ΔgpαF was quantified using a phosphorous imager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were taken in duplicate. Translocated proteins were at least 90% protease-protected. Microsomes were washed with buffer containing 25 mm EDTA for 15 min and 500 mm potassium acetate for 1 h for the experiment shown in Fig. 5D as described (18Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Sss1p and Wbp1p Form a Complex in the ER Membrane—To identify ER membrane proteins that interact with OST, we used a chimeric protein consisting of the OST subunit Wbp1p and Cub, Protein A, and the transcriptional activator LexA-VP16 (Wbp1p-Cub-PLV) as bait (Fig. 1A) (12Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 13Thaminy S. Stagljar I. Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interactions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 395-405Google Scholar). This bait has been well characterized and used successfully in the past to demonstrate the fidelity of the split-ubiquitin system to measure protein-protein interactions (12Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 13Thaminy S. Stagljar I. Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interactions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 395-405Google Scholar). Interaction of this protein with a NubG fusion protein results in cleavage of the PLV moiety by cytosolic ubiquitin-specific proteases (Fig. 1A, UBP), diffusion of PLV to the nucleus, and transcription of Lex A-VP16-controlled reporter genes in our strain HIS3 and LacZ. As shown in Fig. 1B, co-expression of Wbp1p-Cub-PLV with a NubG-tagged OST subunit, Ost1p, resulted in growth of blue colonies on selective plates without histidine (see also Ref. 12Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between the ER lumenal domains of the mammalian homologs of Ost1p and Wbp1p (ribophorin I and OST48, respectively) has been shown previously (19Fu J. Ren M. Kreibich G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29687-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This result confirms that the split-ubiquitin system can serve to monitor interaction of ER membrane proteins. Alg5p, which generates lipid-linked glucose in the ER membrane but is not a subunit of OST, did not interact with Wbp1p in the split-ubiquitin assay (Fig. 1B) (12Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We generated a variety of NubG-fusions to the cytoplasmic N or C termini of other reasonably abundant ER-resident proteins and a subunit of the protein translocation channel whose function has been poorly defined to date (Sss1p). Wbp1p-Cub-PLV did not interact with any other NubG-tagged ER membrane or ER-associated protein tested, with the exception of Sss1p (Fig. 1B). Cleavage of Wbp1p-Cub-PLV in the presence of Ost1p-NubG or NubG-Sss1p was confirmed directly by blotting with peroxidase-IgG (Fig. 1C). Sec61p and Ost1p did not interact in the split-ubiquitin assay, suggesting that the binding of Wbp1p to Sss1p was specific. To ascertain that the interaction between Wbp1p and Sss1p was independent of the ubiquitin moieties in the fusion proteins, we co-immunoprecipitated Wbp1p tagged with an influenza hemagglutinin epitope (Wbp1p-HA) with a polyclonal anti Sss1p antiserum (Fig. 2A). In addition, we co-immunoprecipitated Sss1p with polyclonal anti-Wbp1p antiserum from a strain in which neither protein was tagged (Fig. 2B). Under the lysis conditions used, Sss1p antibodies also precipitated the OST subunit Swp1p (Fig. 2C), and Wbp1p antibodies precipitated Sbh1p (Fig. 2D) and Sec61p (not shown), suggesting that both the OST complex and the Sec61 complex were stable and associated with each other. Our data demonstrate a close physical interaction between the Sec61 channel and the OST complex in the ER membrane. Mutations in Sss1p Disrupt Interaction with Wbp1p in the Split-ubiquitin System—To investigate the functional significance of the interaction of Wpb1p and Sss1p, we used error-prone PCR to generate Sss1p mutants that no longer interact with Wbp1p in the split-ubiquitin system (Fig. 3A). We isolated two mutants, sss1-1 and sss1-4, that expressed mutant Sss1p at wild type levels (not shown). In both sss1-1 and sss1-4, a charged residue replaces a conserved hydrophobic or uncharged residue within the amino-terminal cytoplasmic α-helical domain of Sss1p (sss1-1: Q17 to R; sss1-4: V18 to D; Fig. 3, B and C); in addition, the mutations in the double mutant sss1-4 are predicted to disrupt the α-helix (Fig. 3C). Despite the complete lack of interaction of both mutant Sss1 proteins with Wbp1p in the split-ubiquitin system, both proteins still coimmunoprecipitated Wbp1p (not shown). This suggests that the sss1 mutations affect the orientation of OST and the translocon toward each other rather than completely disrupting their interaction. Haploid strains in which wild type SSS1 had been replaced with either of the mutant genes were viable, and the mutant strains showed no growth phenotype over a temperature range from 16–37 °C (not shown), suggesting that the essential function of Sss1p in protein translocation was not affected. Mutations in Sss1p Affect N-Glycosylation and Protein Secretion—We predicted that a disturbed interaction between the translocon and OST should result in less efficient glycosylation and, hence, a reduced amount of intracellular glycoproteins after a short pulse. We labeled wild type and sss1 mutant yeast for 5 min with [35S]methionine and lysed the cells either immediately or after a 5-min chase. Intracellular glycoproteins were isolated from the lysates using the mannose-specific lectin Concanavalin A. As shown in Fig. 4A, both sss1 mutants displayed a profound reduction in glycoprotein biosynthesis compared with wild type (58% of wild type after 5 min chase). [35S]methionine incorporation was comparable in wild type and sss1 mutant strains. Most secretory proteins in yeast are N-glycosylated and, for many proteins, glycosylation is important for folding. As only fully folded proteins are packaged into ER-to-Golgi transport vesicles and secreted (20Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), hypoglycosylation should result in reduced protein secretion. Protein secretion in the sss1 mutants, however, was delayed rather than diminished (Fig. 4B). We observed a similar delayed secretion for individual glycoproteins (not shown). Consistent with the transient nature of the glycoprotein biosynthesis defect in the sss1 mutants, these strains displayed no increased sensitivity to tunicamycin compared with wild type yeast. Our data suggest that N-linked glycosylation and protein folding were inefficient when the interaction of OST with the Sec61 channel was suboptimal but that most proteins were eventually glycosylated and secreted. We next examined the glycosylation status of specific proteins in the ER of SSS1 wild type and mutant cells. We found that neither carboxypeptidase Y (CPY; four N-linked glycans) nor protein disulfide isomerase (PDI; five N-linked glycans) nor the translocated ER-form of the α-factor precursor (3gpαF, three N-linked glycans) were under-glycosylated in the mutants (Fig. 4C, and not shown) (21Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 22LaMantia M. Miura T. Tachikawa H. Kaplan H.A. Lennarz W.J. Mizunaga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4453-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Kurjan J. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1982; 30: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Translocation of the cytosolic α-factor precursor ppαF into the ER lumen of sss1 mutants, however, was delayed (Fig. 4C). Note that in wild type and sss1 mutant cells, the translocated, glycosylated α-factor precursor 3gpαF is transported to the Golgi with equal rapidity and proteolytically processed during the 5-min chase, suggesting that there is no defect in transport of secretory proteins in these cells (Fig. 4C, compare 0- and 5-min chase). No translocation defect was detected for the precursors of PDI, CPY, or a protein without N-glycan acceptor sites, BiP, even when the pulse time was reduced to 1 min (Fig. 4C, and not shown). Mutations in Sss1p Cause a Translocation Defect Specific for Glycoproteins—The N-linked glycans of α-factor precursor (ppαF) are required for protein folding (24Caplan S. Green R. Rocco J. Kurjan J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 627-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three glycosylation acceptor sites of ppαF are in the N-terminal half of the protein, and, in contrast to PDI and CPY, the first is within four amino acids of the signal cleavage site (60 amino acids, PDI; 106 amino acids, CPY) (21Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 22LaMantia M. Miura T. Tachikawa H. Kaplan H.A. Lennarz W.J. Mizunaga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4453-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Kurjan J. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1982; 30: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Our data suggested that glycosylation of one or more of these sites was essential for efficient ppαF translocation into the ER lumen. We examined this possibility in a cell-free system based on in vitro translated, radiolabeled ppαF and microsomes prepared from SSS1 wild type and mutant cells (25Hansen W. Garcia P.D. Walter P. Cell. 1986; 45: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Rothblatt J.A. Meyer D.I. Cell. 1986; 44: 619-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, posttranslational ppαF translocation into wild type microsomes was extremely efficient with a t ½ of less than 2 min. Translocation of ppαF into sss1 mutant microsomes was significantly slower (t ½, 5 min), and maximal import was reduced by ∼20% compared with wild type. To investigate the effect of the sss1 mutants on cotranslational import, we performed experiments with a modified version of ppαF in which the signal peptide had been replaced with a transmembrane domain (DHCαF) (18Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Maximal import of this protein was similarly reduced in the mutants (not shown). Decreasing the assay temperature to 10 °C exacerbated the translocation defect in sss1 mutant microsomes (Fig. 5B). To examine whether this difference in import kinetics was indeed related to glycosylation of the translocation substrate, we repeated the experiment with a mutant form of ppαF in which the N-glycan acceptor sites had been removed by site-directed mutagenesis (pΔgpαF) (27Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Translocation of pΔgpαF into wild type microsomes was slower than that of ppαF (t ½ of 5 min versus < 2 min; Fig. 5, C versus A, black squares) but proceeded with identical kinetics in wild type and sss1 mutant microsomes at 20 °C (Fig. 5C). Our data suggest that the translocation defect for ppαF in sss1 microsomes was indeed due to reduced glycosylation efficiency caused by the perturbed translocon-OST association in these membranes. A recent paper by Nikonov et al. (28Nikonov A.V. Snapp E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggests that OST may stay associated with Sec61 channels after termination of translocation. To disrupt existing translocon-OST complexes, we treated SSS1 wild type and mutant microsomes with EDTA and high salt (18Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This treatment removes ribosomes from the cytoplasmic face of the microsomes, which may stabilize the interaction of OST with the Sec61 channel. The high salt/EDTA wash also disrupts electrostatic protein-protein interactions mediated by cytoplasmic domains of ER proteins. Translocation of ppαF into salt-washed microsomes was slower than into untreated membranes (Fig. 5, D versus A, black squares) suggesting that the interaction of OST with the translocon had been affected by the EDTA/high salt treatment. Membranes from both sss1 mutants were severely deficient in the reformation of a functional OST/Sec61 channel complex in vitro and, hence, in the import of ppαF (Fig. 5D, open symbols). We have shown here that an essential subunit of the protein translocation channel in the ER membrane, Sss1p, mediates binding of the OST complex to the channel via the OST subunit Wbp1p. The role of Sss1p in OST recruitment to the protein translocation channel is independent of its essential function in stabilizing the translocation channel, as mutants in the cytoplasmic domain of Sss1p are viable and display no general defects in protein import into the ER (29Esnault Y. Feldheim D. Blondel M.-O. Schekman R. Kepes F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wilkinson B.M. Esnault Y. Craven R.A. Skiba F. Fieschi J. K'Epes F. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (not shown; Figs. 4 and 5). Appropriate anchoring of OST to the protein translocation channel promotes the immediate glycosylation of translocating proteins and this, in turn, accelerates protein translocation into the ER of a high proportion of proteins with N-glycan acceptor sites and, hence, results in efficient biosynthesis of glycoproteins (Fig. 4A). Using a posttranslationally imported secretory glycoprotein and a mutant version without glycan acceptor sites as a model proteins, we have demonstrated that at physiological temperature, membranes containing mutant Sss1p, which do not interact appropriately with Wbp1p, are fully competent for import into the ER of nonglycoproteins (pΔgpαF, Fig. 5C). Thus, the structure of the protein translocation channel itself in the sss1-1 and sss1-4 mutants is not significantly compromised. The half-time for import of a secretory glycoprotein into the ER, however, was significantly increased in these sss1 mutants (2.5×; Fig. 5A), suggesting that glycosylation contributes to efficient translocation into the ER. Ours is the first demonstration of an effect of glycosylation on protein translocation into the ER. The acceleration of protein import by glycosylation may be due to improved folding of the lumenal part of the translocation intermediate. The N-glycans of ppαF are indeed required for its folding (24Caplan S. Green R. Rocco J. Kurjan J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 627-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the unglycosylated mutant form pΔgpαF is not transported efficiently from the ER to the Golgi complex but rather is retained in the ER and subsequently targeted for ER-associated degradation (24Caplan S.

Matlack et al. have shown that ppαF is prone to backsliding in the translocation channel and that its import into proteoliposomes, which do not contain active OST, requires binding of bulky molecules such as BiP or ppαF antibodies in the ER lumen (32Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In intact cells, glycosylation of the N-terminal proregion of ppαF early during translocation into the ER may fulfill a similar function. Although N-glycans themselves cannot prevent backsliding in the translocation channel (33Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Cell. 1992; 71: 87-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), glycosylation-induced folding of the ppαF proregion may interfere with movement of the translocating chain toward the cytoplasm and thus promote vectorial transport of ppαF into the ER lumen. The propensity for backsliding in the translocon may be a function of the signal sequence that is recognized by the protein translocation channel itself (34Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We found indeed that if the ppαF signal peptide was substituted with the transmembrane region of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAPB) and the protein was cotranslationally imported into microsomes, glycosylation no longer increased the speed of import into the ER, although maximal import into sss1 mutant membranes was still lower than into wild type microsomes (not shown). Most studies on protein import into the ER are done with cotranslationally imported substrates, which may explain why an effect of glycosylation on import has not been observed so far. Our observation that mutations in SSS1 that disturb the OST-translocon interaction lead to a delay in biosynthesis of ∼40% of glycoproteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that glycosylation contributes to the efficient import into the ER of a large number of proteins. In a preliminary analysis of secretory glycoproteins in the S. cerevisiae genome, we found that the majority of these contain multiple N-glycan acceptor sites, which makes it likely that their modification contributes to protein folding. In addition, a significant fraction of glycoproteins contain acceptor sites close to the N terminus, where glycosylation is more likely to have an immediate effect on vectorial transport through the protein translocation channel. At present, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional interactions between subunits of the protein translocation channel and OST subunits contribute to the association between the two complexes. Given that mutations in SSS1 alone resulted in a glycosylation-related translocation defect, however, we propose that the binding of Wbp1p to Sss1p is essential for OST-translocon interaction. Further experiments should allow us to address the mechanisms that allow the close cooperation between the Sec61 channel and OST during protein translocation into the ER. We thank J.

https://openalex.org/W2008270082,"Acetylation of histones H4 and H3 targeted to promoters/enhancers is linked to the activation of transcription, whereas widespread, long range acetylation of the same histones has been linked to the requirement for open chromatin at transcriptionally active loci and regions of V(D)J recombination. Using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to tetra/tri-acetylated histone H2B in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with mononucleosomes from 15-day chicken embryo erythrocytes, a high resolution distribution of H2B acetylation has been determined and compared with that of H4 and H3 at the same genes/loci. At the β-globin locus, the H2B acetylation is high throughout and in general mirrors that of H3 and H4, consistent with the observation of co-precipitation of hyperacetylated H4 together with the hyperacetylated H2B. In contrast, at the weakly expressed genes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Gas41 (housekeeping) and carbonic anhydrase (tissue specific), very little or no hyperacetylated H2B was found despite the presence of acetylated H4 and H3 at their promoters and proximal transcribed sequences. At the inactive lysozyme and ovalbumin genes essentially no acetylation of H2B, H3, or H4 was observed. Acetylation of H2B appears to be principally a feature of only the most actively transcribed genes/loci."

https://openalex.org/W1978323929,"Abstract Within each hemidesmosome, α6β4 integrin plays a crucial role in hemidesmosome assembly by binding to laminin-5 in the basement membrane zone of epithelial tissue. Recent analyses have implicated “specificity-determining loops” (SDLs) in the I-like domain of β integrin in regulating ligand binding. Here, we investigated the function of an SDL-like motif within the extracellular I-like domain of β4 integrin. We generated point mutations within the SDL of β4 integrin tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP-β4K150A and GFP-β4Q155L). We also generated a mutation within the I-like domain of the β4 integrin, lying outside the SDL region (GFP-β4V284E). We transfected constructs encoding the mutated β4 integrins and a GFP-conjugated wild type β4 integrin (GFP-β4WT) into 804G cells, which assemble hemidesmosomes, and human endothelial cells, which express little endogenous β4 integrin. In transfected 804G cells, GFP-β4WT and GFP-β4V284E colocalize with hemidesmosome proteins, whereas hemidesmosomal components in cells expressing GFP-β4K150A and GFP-β4Q155L are aberrantly localized. In endothelial cells, GFP-β4WT and mutant proteins are co-expressed at the cell surface with α6 integrin. When transfected endothelial cells are plated onto laminin-5 matrix, GFP-β4WT and GFP-β4V284E localize with laminin-5, whereas GFP-β4K150A and GFP-β4Q155L do not. GFP-β4WT and GFP-β4V284E expressed in endothelial cells associate with the adaptor protein Shc when the cells are stimulated with laminin-5. However, GFP-β4K150A and GFP-β4Q155L fail to associate with Shc even when laminin-5 is present, thus impacting downstream signaling. These results provide evidence that the SDL segment of the β4 integrin subunit is required for ligand binding and is involved in outside-in signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2130094793,"We compared the expression of dihydrofolate reductase minigenes with and without an intron. The levels of protein were significantly higher in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase intron 1. However, mRNA levels in both constructs were comparable. In addition, the RNA transcribed from either construct was correctly polyadenylated and exported to the cytoplasm. The intron-mediated increase in dihydrofolate reductase protein levels was position-independent and was also observed when dihydrofolate reductase intron 1 was replaced by heterologous introns. The translational rate of dihydrofolate reductase protein was increased in transfectants from the intron-containing minigene. In addition, the protein encoded by the intronless construct was unstable and subject to lysosomal degradation, thus showing a shorter half-life than the protein encoded by the intron-containing minigene. We conclude that an intron is required for the translation and stability of dihydrofolate reductase protein.

This requirement can be met by the inclusion of a single intron in mouse or hamster dhfr minigenes. The 300-bp intron 1 suffices and is the intron usually included in dhfr minigenes. This is also the intron that is removed last (21Kessler O. Jiang Y. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6211-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have used this intron-dependent expression of DHFR as a model system to determine the mechanisms linking intron removal to other aspects of gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that intron removal can influence a cytoplasmic event that is further downstream than translation: the degradation of newly synthesized protein. The starting construct, pDCH1P11, containing the six exons of the hamster dhfr gene, intron 1, about 400 bp of the 5′-flank, and the first of the three polyadenylation sites in exon 6, was constructed by cloning the SmaI-HindIII fragment from hamster minigene pDCH2 (19Venolia L. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Somat. Cell. Genet. 1987; 13: 491-504Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) into the SmaI-HindIII sites of the cloning vector pSP72 (Promega). The construct pDCHIP10 corresponding to the intronless version of pDCH1P11 was constructed by cloning the SmaI-HindIII fragment from hamster minigene pDCH0 (19Venolia L. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Somat. Cell. Genet. 1987; 13: 491-504Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) into the SmaI-HindIII sites of pSP72. All other minigenes were derived from pDCH1P11 and pDCH1P10, as described below and illustrated in Fig. 1. pDSV11 was constructed by digesting pDCH1P11 with BamHI and HindIII to remove the 3′-UTR sequence containing dhfr polyadenyl-ation site 1. The linearized plasmid was then ligated with a BamHI-HindIII fragment of 461 bp from vector pUDH10-3 (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) containing the SV40 late polyadenylation sequence. pDSV10 was constructed from pDCH1P10 using the same strategy described above for pDSV11. pDAPRT—Hamster adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (aprt) intron 3 was PCR-amplified from the aprt gene template plasmid, pWTaprt (23Kessler O. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4426-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), using primers modified to contain an MscI site just upstream and an EcoRI site just downstream of the intron sequence. After digestion of the PCR fragment with MscI and EcoRI, the 155-bp product was cloned into the MscI-EcoRI sites bordering intron 1 in pDCH1P11. pDGlobin was constructed using the same strategy described above for pDAPRT. Human β-globin intron 3 was PCR-amplified from a globin plasmid using modified primers to produce an MscI site and an EcoRI site flanking the intron sequence. After digestion of the PCR fragment with MscI and EcoRI, the 130-bp product was cloned in the MscI-EcoRI sites of pDCH1P11. pDCH1P10–5′UTR—A 322-bp fragment from dhfr minigene pDCH1P11 was PCR-amplified using primers of a modified sequence to produce an AvrII site just upstream and downstream of dhfr intron 1 sequence. After digestion of the PCR fragment with AvrII, the 312-bp product was cloned in the AvrII site in the dhfr 5′-UTR in pDCH1P10. Monolayer cultures of CHO DG44 cells (24Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Kas E.

Genet. 1986; 12: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were grown in Ham's F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum; Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. Transfections of the dhfr minigenes were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (25Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel A. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). A mixture consisting of 2 μg of the dhfr construct, 0.4 μg of pBPV-neo (26Luskey M. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 391-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and 17.6 μg of carrier calf thymus DNA (Invitrogen) per 10-cm-diameter tissue culture dish was used. After 5 h of exposure to DNA and 24 h of expression in non-selective medium, transfectants that had received the neo gene were selected in 400 μg of active G418 (Invitrogen) per ml. Colonies were pooled, expanded, and then used for preparation of RNA and cytoplasmic extracts. Transfection experiments were carried out in dhfr-deficient cells (CHO-DG44) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). DG44 cells (225,000) were plated in 35-mm dishes; after 18–20 h they were transfected with 2 μg of dhfr minigenes, pDCHIP11 or pDCHIP10, mixed with 3 μl of FuGENE 6. After 24 h the medium was replaced with selective–GHT medium, lacking glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine, the final products of DHFR activity. The resulting DHFR activity was determined by the net incorporation of radioactive deoxyuridine (6-[3H]deoxyuridine; NEN Dupont) into cellular DNA as described in Ref. 27Noé V. Alemany C. Chasin L.A. Ciudad C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. Cell pellets (2 × 107) were resuspended in 5 ml of hypotonic buffer (HB, 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8) and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min. Cells were pelleted for 5 min at 800 × g and lysed by the addition of 100 μl of HB buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Nuclei were pelleted for 10 min at 1000 × g and separated from the supernatant corresponding to the cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclei were washed once in HB buffer without detergent and pelleted as before to obtain the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic extracts (100 μg) from cells permanently transfected with the different dhfr minigenes were subjected to electrophoresis in an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore) using a semidry electroblotter. The membrane was probed with a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against purified recombinant Chinese hamster DHFR (1:500 dilution). Signals were detected by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:5000 dilution) and enhanced chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The antibody detected a band of the expected molecular mass (21,000 kDa) in extracts of DHFR-positive cells, and no band was detected in cells carrying a double deletion of the dhfr gene (data not shown). The stability of DHFR protein was assessed by calculating its half-life from the amount of remnant protein at various times after addition of cycloheximide to the cell culture. Cytoplasmic extracts from cells permanently transfected with pDCH1P11 or pDCH1P10 were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. The blot corresponding to pDCH1p10 was probed with the antibody against Chinese hamster DHFR at 1:250 dilution and with the secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody at 1:2000 dilution to increase the resulting DHFR signal. The following inhibitors of proteolysis were added to the cell cultures to determine their effect on DHFR protein levels, leupeptin, E64, MG132 (all from Calbiochem) and a protease mixture inhibitor (Sigma). The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C. Transfectants from pDCHIP11 and pDCHIP10 (5 × 105 cells) were plated in 35-mm dishes, and after 18 h the medium was replaced with methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were starved in this medium for 90 min, and at the end of this time they were pulse-labeled for 90 min with 150 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine (Promix l-[35S] in vitro cell-labeling mix from Amersham Biosciences). After the pulse, the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with Ham's F-12 medium, and then chased for different periods of time in F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine. After the chase, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (HB, 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8). Cells were pelleted for 5 min at 800 × g and lysed by the addition of 100 μl of HB buffer supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 nm benzamidine. Nuclei were pelleted for 10 min at 1000 × g and separated from the radiolabeled supernatant corresponding to the cytoplasmic fraction. DHFR protein was immunoprecipitated from the cytoplasmic fraction by the addition of a specific antibody against hamster DHFR for 3 h at 4 °C. The resulting immunocomplex was recovered by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science), followed by an additional incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. DHFR protein was eluted by boiling for 5 min in protein loading buffer and analyzed in an SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and the radiolabeled protein was quantitated by phosphorimaging. To determine the translational rate of DHFR protein in transfectants from pDCH1P11 and pDCH1P10, the cells were labeled for different periods of time with 150 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine. After the labeling, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described above. DHFR protein was immunoprecipitated, and after electrophoresis the radiolabeled protein was quantitated by phosphorimaging. Total, cytoplasmic, and nuclear RNA were extracted from the transfectant populations using the Ultraspec™ RNA reagent (Biotecx) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μg of RNA, 125 ng of random hexamers (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs (Applichem), 4 μl of 5× RT buffer, 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (above two from Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Five μl of the cDNA mixture was used directly for PCR amplification. PCR reactions were typically carried out as follows. A standard 50-μl mixture contained 5 μl of the cDNA mixture, 4 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Mg2+-free), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 μCi of α-[32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Ecogen), and 500 ng of each of four primers. The primers used were: 5′-AAGAACGGAGACCTTCCCTG-3′ in exon 1 and 5′-GAACTGCCTCCAACTATC-3′ in exon 4 for DHFR mRNA and 5′-ATCCGCAGTTTCCCCCGACTT-3′ in exon 1 and 5′-TCACACACTCCACCACCTCA-3′ in exon 5 for APRT mRNA as an internal control. The reaction mixture was separated in two phases by a solid paraffin wax layer (melting T = 58–60 °C; Fluka) that prevents complete mixing of PCR reactants until the reaction has reached the temperature at which nonspecific annealing of primers to non-target DNA is minimal. The lower solution contained the MgCl2, the dNTPs, the four primers, the α-[32P]dATP. and half of the buffer, and the upper solution contained the cDNA, the Taq enzyme, and the remaining buffer. PCR was performed for 23 cycles, after 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C; each cycle consisted of denaturation at 92 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 59 °C for 75 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 110 s. Five μl of each PCR sample was electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. Uniformly 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes for the mapping of DHFR transcripts were synthesized from pDCH1P11 and pDSV11 linearized with BamHI using Sp6 RNA polymerase and the RiboScribe™ Sp6 RNA probe synthesis kit (Epicenter Technologies) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro transcription was performed in 20 μl using 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA, 50 μCi of α-[32P]GTP (NEN Dupont), 10 μm GTP, 500 μm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, and 40 units of Sp6 RNA polymerase. RNase protection assays were performed with 10 or 20 μg of total RNA using the RPAIII kit (Ambion) as specified by the manufacturer. Briefly, total RNA was hybridized to DHFR pA1 or SV40 pA in vitro synthesized antisense RNAs (8 × 104 cpm) in 20 μl overnight at 42 °C and subsequently treated with RNase A (25 units/ml) and RNase T1 (100 units/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Protected fragments were precipitated, electrophoresed in 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by phosphorimaging after the gel was dried. Poly(A) length analysis of the different mRNA species was performed by RT-PCR following the method of Sallés et al. (29Sallés F.J. Richards W.G. Strickland S.

Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA from each transfectant was used in the RT reaction with 1 μg of primer consisting of a specific arbitrary sequence followed by oligo(dT)12. The RNA and the primer were heated to 80 °C for 5 min, cooled to room temperature (0.5 °C/min), and then placed at 4 °C. The remaining components of the RT reaction were then added. The RT reaction was performed for 5 min at 4 °C, 5 min at room temperature, 5 min at 37 °C, and 45 min at 42 °C. Five μl of the RT reaction was then used in the PCR, which was performed with a 5′-primer upstream of either the dhfr polyadenylation site 1 or the SV40 polyadenylation site and an oligomer corresponding to the arbitrary sequence of the RT primer as the 3′-primer. PCR was carried out as described above for 30 cycles. The PCR products were electrophoresed and visualized by autoradiography. The length of the poly(A) tails was determined from the length of the smear of the PCR products. The primer used in the RT reaction was 5′-GCGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCG(T)12-3′, and the primers used in the PCR reaction were 5′-TAGAGAGGGATAGTTAGGAAGATG-3′ upstream of the polyadenylation sites and 5′-GCGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCG-3′ as the reverse primer. Efficient Expression of DHFR Protein from a Minigene Requires an Intron—To study the relationship between intron removal and dhfr gene expression, we used several dhfr minigenes that either lacked all 5 dhfr introns or contained a single intron. All minigenes were driven by the dhfr promoter and contained either the first dhfr polyadenylation site or the SV40 late polyadenylation site. The minigenes that were used in these analyses are summarized in Fig. 1. DHFR-deficient cells do not grow in a medium lacking the end products of one-carbon metabolism glycine, purines, and thymidine (–GHT medium). The ability of a transfected dhfr minigene to confer a DHFR-positive growth phenotype (ability to grow in–GHT medium) to DHFR-deficient CHO cells depends on the presence of one or more introns (18Gasser C.S. Simonsen C.C. Schilling J.W. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Venolia L. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Somat. Cell. Genet. 1987; 13: 491-504Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31Lee F. Mulligan R. Berg P. Ringold G. Nature. 1981; 294: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Whereas an intron-containing plasmid produced the expected frequency of colonies (∼10–4 colony/recipient cell), an intronless counterpart yielded 3 to 6% of this number. For a more direct estimate of DHFR enzyme activity, we measured the incorporation of radioactive deoxyuridine into cellular DNA, a process that requires DHFR. DG44 cells were transfected with pDCHIP11 or pDCHIP10 (Fig. 1), and after 24 h of expression the incorporation of radioactive deoxyuridine was measured. The intron-containing pDCHIP11 produced measurable DHFR activity, whereas the incorporation in the case of the intronless pDCHIP10 was at the level of background (Fig. 2A). The low level of DHFR activity in cells transfected with the intronless minigene could be due either to a lower level of DHFR protein in these cells or to a defective enzyme. To distinguish between these two possibilities we determined the levels of DHFR protein in cytoplasmic extracts from transfectants by Western blotting using an anti-hamster DHFR antibody. For these experiments, in addition to pDCHIP11 and pDCHIP10, we used plasmids in which the SV40 late polyadenylation site was substituted for the dhfr polyadenylation site. The dhfr polyadenylation site 1 is relatively weak; the stronger SV40 polyadenylation site affords a higher level of gene expression (Ref. 30Noé V. Ciudad C.J. Chasin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27807-27814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and see below). Cells transfected with the intronless versions of the minigenes produced barely detectable levels of DHFR, compared with the strong signals yielded by the intron-containing minigenes (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that the lack of DHFR activity was because of the absence of DHFR protein in these transfectants. Replacement of the dhfr polyadenylation site by the SV40 site in the minigenes increased the levels of protein, although the effect on the intron-containing gene was stronger. DHFR mRNA Levels Do Not Depend on the Presence of an Intron—We next analyzed the levels of DHFR mRNA in pooled permanent transfectants to determine whether the absence of protein in transfectants from the intronless minigenes was because of a decreased level of DHFR mRNA in these cells. Total RNA was extracted from cells transfected with pDCH1P11, pDCH1P10, pDSV11, or pDSV10, and DHFR mRNA was detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Surprisingly enough, DHFR mRNA levels yielded by the intronless minigene pDCH1P10 were comparable with those given by the intron-containing minigene pDCH1P11 (Fig. 3A). The replacement of dhfr pA1 by the late polyadenylation sequence from SV40 increased the total levels of DHFR mRNA 2-fold for the intron-containing pDSV11 minigene, and to a lesser extent for the intronless minigene. Although there was some decrease in the level of total DHFR mRNA in the case of the intronless pDSV10 minigene compared with the pDSV11 construct (Fig. 3A), the effect was small compared with the difference in DHFR protein level (compare Fig. 2B) Export of DHFR mRNA Does Not Require Splicing in the Nucleus—Many mRNAs transcribed from cDNA derived from intron-containing genes fail to be exported to the cytoplasm in the absence of splicing (4Huang M.T.-F. Gorman C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Ryu W.-S. Mertz J.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4386-4394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Meric F.

The resulting lack of cytoplasmic mRNA could explain the low level of DHFR protein in transfectants of the intronless minigene. We therefore analyzed the cellular distribution of DHFR mRNA encoded by either the intron-containing or the intronless minigenes. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, the level of nuclear DHFR mRNA was increased 3-fold in cells transfected with pDCH1P10 compared with the other transfectants; the replacement of the dhfr polyadenylation site by the SV40 site in pDSV10 abolished this effect. It may be that in the absence of a strong polyadenylation site, the presence of an intron can facilitate the nuclear export of DHFR mRNA, as was found in the several cases cited above. However, DHFR mRNA levels in the cytoplasm were similar in all transfectants either in the presence or in the absence of an intron in the corresponding minigene. These results suggested that the low levels of DHFR protein produced by the intronless minigenes were not because of defective export of DHFR mRNA. To rule out the possibility that the cytoplasmic DHFR mRNA signal from the intronless minigenes was because of a nuclear contamination, we examined the distribution of U6 small nuclear RNA in the different subcellular fractions to test for nuclear integrity (32Rousseau D. Kaspar R. Rosenwald I Gehrke L. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). U6 snRNA participates in pre-mRNA splicing and is not known to have a cytoplasmic phase (33Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Almost all of the U6 snRNA was confined to the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3C), indicating that the signal for DHFR mRNA in the cytoplasm of transfectants of the intronless minigene was not because of nuclear leakage. DHFR mRNA Is Correctly Polyadenylated in the Absence of an Intron—We next considered the possibility that the absence of an intron leads to poor or no polyadenylation (9Cooke C. Hans H. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which could lead to deficiencies in translation initiation (34Muckenthaler M. Gunkel N. Stripecke R. Hentze M.W. RNA. 1997; 3: 983-995PubMed Google Scholar, 35Preiss T. Muckenthaler M. Hentze M.W. RNA. 1998; 4: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 203: 567-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyadenylation of DHFR mRNA transcripts was analyzed by two methods. First, to determine whether the transcripts were correctly cleaved, the 3′-ends of DHFR transcripts that derived from the different dhfr constructs were mapped by RNase protection using probes that spanned either the dhfr or the SV40 polyadenylation sites. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, RNA from pDCH1P11 and pDCH1P10 transfectants both protected a fragment of the dhfr probe that migrated at 138 nt, as expected from the position of dhfr polyadenylation site 1 (19Venolia L. Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Somat. Cell. Genet. 1987; 13: 491-504Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RNA from pDSV11 and pDSV10 transfectants both protected a fragment of the SV40 pA probe that migrated at 136 nt, the size expected for polyadenylation at the late SV40 polyadenylation site. Thus, both the intron-containing and the intronless transcripts were cleaved at the expected sites during 3′-end processing. Second, to determine the poly(A) length in DHFR mRNA, a method based on RT-PCR was used (30Noé V. Ciudad C.J. Chasin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27807-27814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The RT reaction was performed with a primer containing an oligo(dT) sequence that can initiate polymerization along the length of the poly(A) tail. The PCR was carried out with a 5′-primer specific for DHFR and with a 3′-primer corresponding to an arbitrary sequence included at the start of the RT primer. Under these conditions, the length of the smear of the amplified products indicates the length of the poly(A) tail in each case. We analyzed the poly(A) length for polyadenylation sites in RNA samples from the different transfectants. For construct pDCH1P11, the poly(A) tail at dhfr polyadenylation site 1 was 65 nt, in accordance with previous results (30Noé V. Ciudad C.J. Chasin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27807-27814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using the pDCH1P10 construct we found that the poly(A) tail was 53 nt. In the case of constructs pDSV11 and pDSV10, the poly(A) tails at the late SV40 polyadenylation site were 78 and 65 nt, respectively (Fig. 4C). We concluded that poly(A) tails are added to DHFR mRNA molecules derived from both intron-containing and intronless transcripts, but that the length of the poly(A) tail may be somewhat longer when an intron was initially present. Intron Requirements for the Accumulation of DHFR—The requirement of dhfr intron 1 for DHFR protein accumulation could depend on the presence of a specific RNA sequence in this intron or on the passage of the transcript through the splicing process. We distinguished between these two possibilities by replacing"
https://openalex.org/W2007929122,"Vitamin C synthesis in rat liver is enhanced by several xenobiotics, including aminopyrine and chloretone. The effect of these agents has been linked to induction of enzymes potentially involved in the formation of glucuronate, a precursor of vitamin C. Using isolated rat hepatocytes as a model, we show that a series of agents (aminopyrine, antipyrine, chloretone, clotrimazole, metyrapone, proadifen, and barbital) induced in a few minutes an up to 15-fold increase in the formation of glucuronate, which was best observed in the presence of sorbinil, an inhibitor of glucuronate reductase. They also caused an ∼2-fold decrease in the concentration of UDP-glucuronate but little if any change in the concentration of UDP-glucose. Depletion of UDP-glucuronate with resorcinol or d-galactosamine markedly decreased the formation of glucuronate both in the presence and in the absence of aminopyrine, confirming the precursor-product relationship between UDP-glucuronate and free glucuronate. Most of the agents did not induce the formation of detectable amounts of glucuronides, indicating that the formation of glucuronate is not due to a glucuronidation-deglucuronidation cycle. With the exception of barbital (which inhibits glucuronate reductase), all of the above mentioned agents also caused an increase in the concentration of ascorbic acid. They had little effect on glutathione concentration, and their effect on glucuronate and vitamin C formation was not mimicked by glutathione-depleting agents such as diamide and buthionine sulfoximine. It is concluded that the stimulation of vitamin C synthesis exerted by some xenobiotics is mediated through a rapid increase in the conversion of UDP-glucuronate to glucuronate, which does not apparently involve a glucuronidation-deglucuronidation cycle.

It is concluded that the stimulation of vitamin C synthesis exerted by some xenobiotics is mediated through a rapid increase in the conversion of UDP-glucuronate to glucuronate, which does not apparently involve a glucuronidation-deglucuronidation cycle. Vitamin C synthesis, which takes place in the liver of most mammalian species, starts with the formation of free glucuronate from UDP-glucuronate, possibly via glucuronate 1-phosphate as an intermediate (Fig. 1). Reduction and lactonization, probably in this order, lead to the formation of l-gulono-1,4-lactone, which is oxidized to ascorbic acid by l-gulonolactone oxidase, an enzyme associated to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (reviewed in Ref. 1Smirnoff N. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 241-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is absent in several species including humans and guinea pig, for which ascorbic acid is therefore a vitamin. l-gulonate can also be converted in the liver to l-xylulose, through the successive action of l-gulonate 3-dehydrogenase and 3-dehydro-l-gulonate decarboxylase. l-xylulose is then channeled to gluconeogenesis by being converted to xylitol by NADPH-dependent l-xylulose reductase and then to d-xylulose by d-xylulose reductase, a NAD-dependent enzyme. Deficiency in the first of these two enzymes results in a benign condition known as essential pentosuria (reviewed in Ref. 2Hiatt H.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. Vol. I. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 1589-1599Google Scholar). It has been known for several decades that the administration to rats of various drugs such as barbiturates, chloretone, and aminopyrine markedly stimulates the formation and the urinary excretion of vitamin C (3Burns J.J. Evans C. Trousof N. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 227: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aminopyrine was also shown to stimulate the excretion of l-xylulose in pentosuric patients (4Margolis J.I. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1929; 177: 348-371Crossref Google Scholar). Tracer studies in rats have shown that the formation of radiolabeled ascorbic acid is increased by chloretone when glucose but not when d-glucuronolactone or l-gulonolactone is used as a precursor (5Burns J.J. Evans C. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 897-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that stimulation of ascorbate production involves a step upstream of d-glucuronolactone. The mechanism of this effect is, however, still obscure. One potential explanation, involving the formation of glucuronides and their subsequent hydrolysis to free glucuronate, appears unlikely in the case of barbital since this compound is not significantly metabolized (3Burns J.J. Evans C. Trousof N. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 227: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but due to the diversity of stimulating compounds, it is not clear whether this conclusion applies to all of them. Induction of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and β-glucuronidase has been proposed to participate in the action of some agents (6Hollmann S. Touster O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 62: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Horio F. Kimura M. Yoshida A. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1983; 29: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Horio F.

Biochem. 1997; 61: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Vitamin C synthesis has also been shown to be rapidly stimulated in isolated mouse hepatocytes by agents that cause glutathione depletion (menadione, diamide, buthionine sulfoximine), possibly via enhanced glycogenolysis (10Braun L. Csala M. Poussu A. Garzó T. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present work was to test whether aminopyrine and other compounds known to stimulate vitamin C and l-xylulose production had a short term effect on the formation of glucuronate in isolated rat hepatocytes, and if such an effect was found, to determine at which step it took place and whether it was related to glutathione depletion. Materials—Clostridium histolyticum collagenase A and Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase were purchased from Roche Applied Science; baker's yeast glutathione reductase, aminopyrine, l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, clotrimazole, diamide, d-galactosamine, menadione, and proadifen were from Sigma; chloretone and 2-vinylpyridine were purchased from Acros; sodium barbital, dimethyl sulfoxide, and resorcinol were from Merck; antipyrine was from Janssen Chimica; metyrapone was from Aldrich. Sorbinil was a kind gift of Pfizer. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Preparation and Handling of Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated from fed Wistar rats by a modification (11Bartrons R. Hue L. Van Schaftingen E. Hers H.-G. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) of the method of Seglen (12Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer at a final concentration of 7–14 mg of protein/ml. Two-ml portions of this suspension were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm glucose in 20-ml vials equilibrated with a 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas phase. Aminopyrine or other compounds to be tested were added after a 20-min incubation in the presence of Me2SO or sorbinil. Sorbinil, clotrimazole, chloretone, and menadione were dissolved in Me2SO and added as 100-fold concentrated solutions; other compounds were dissolved in water. For the measurement of glucuronate, β-glucuronides, UDP-glucuronate, UDP-glucose, and ascorbic acid, the incubations were arrested by mixing a portion of the cell suspension with 0.5 volume of cold 10% (w/v) perchloric acid. For the measurement of intracellular glutathione, the cells were centrifuged through a silicone layer and quenched in 10% (w/v) perchloric acid as described previously (13Van Schaftingen E. Opperdoes F. Hers H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For the measurement of glucuronate, β-glucuronides, UDP-glucuronate, and UDP-glucose, the cell extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatants were neutralized and stored at –20 °C until assay. For the measurement of ascorbic acid and glutathione, the acidic supernatants of the cell extracts were stored at –80 °C until assay. Protein was assayed (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurement of Metabolites—Glucuronate was assayed spectrophotometrically using overexpressed and purified 1C. L. Linster and E. Van Schaftingen, unpublished results. E. coli glucuronate isomerase and mannonate dehydrogenase, which convert glucuronate successively to fructuronate and mannonate, with concomitant oxidation of NADH to NAD+ (15Ashwell G. Wahba A.J.

The two enzymes were added successively to a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 0.075 or 0.15 mm NADH, 0.01 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm MnCl2, and up to 200 μl of neutralized perchloric acid extract. The decrease in A 340 was measured and used to calculate the concentration of glucuronate in the sample. β-Glucuronides were estimated through the difference between the concentration of glucuronate before and after incubation with E. coli β-glucuronidase. For this, 200 μl of neutralized perchloric acid extract were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Mes, 2The abbreviations used are: Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. pH 6.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.4 units/ml β-glucuronidase in a final volume of 225 μl. HPLC assays were used to determine the concentrations of nucleotide sugars and ascorbic acid. UDP-glucuronate and UDP-glucose were separated from each other and from other nucleotides by chromatography of neutralized perchloric acid extracts (100 μl) on a Partisphere Sax column (4.6 × 125 mm; from Whatman) using a gradient of 0.01–0.5 m NH4H2PO4 (pH 3.7) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. A 254 was measured, the reference wavelength being 350 nm. Concentrations were calculated by comparing the integrated peak surfaces with that of a titrated solution of UMP. Ascorbic acid was determined by chromatographing non-neutralized perchloric acid extracts (100 μl) on an Alltima C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; from Alltech), which was then washed with 50 mm KH2PO4 (pH 5.0) for 10 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A 240 was measured to detect ascorbic acid, the reference wavelength being 350 nm. Ascorbic acid was eluted after ∼5 min, and the concentration was calculated by comparing the integrated peak surface with the one of standard ascorbic acid dissolved in 3.3% (w/v) perchloric acid. The column was regenerated by washing for 4 min with a mixture containing 25 mm KH2PO4 (pH 5.0), 11% acetonitrile, and 22% methanol and by washing for 4 min with the 50 mm KH2PO4 buffer. Results obtained with this method were in excellent agreement with those obtained with the dipyridyl reaction (17Omaye S.T. Turnbull J.D. Sauberlich H.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), except for samples containing aminopyrine. The latter drug was indeed found to interfere in the colorimetric assay. Total and oxidized glutathione were assayed by the glutathione reductase assay (18Griffith O.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Vol. VIII. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1990: 521-529Google Scholar). ATP was assayed as in Ref. 19Trautschold I. Lamprecht W. Schweitzer G. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Vol. VII. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1989: 346-357Google Scholar. Analysis of the Effect of Aminopyrine—The first question we addressed was whether aminopyrine, one of the agents known to stimulate vitamin C synthesis and pentose formation, would provoke a detectable increase in the concentration of glucuronate in isolated rat hepatocytes. As glucuronate is metabolized to l-gulonate by glucuronate reductase, the incubations were also carried out in the presence of sorbinil, an inhibitor of this enzyme (20Srivastava S.K. Petrash J.M. Sadana I.J. Ansari N.H. Partridge C.A. Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, aminopyrine increased the concentration of glucuronate in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was much larger in the presence of sorbinil, which, by itself, also caused an increase in the concentration of glucuronate. Similar experiments, in which perchloric acid extracts were prepared after separation of the cells from the medium by centrifugation, indicated that ≥90% of the glucuronate that had accumulated in the combined presence of aminopyrine and sorbinil was intracellular (results not shown). Since sorbinil had an almost maximal effect at 100 μm, this concentration was chosen in the following experiments. The time course of the effect of 2 mm aminopyrine is shown in Fig. 3. Following the addition of this agent, the glucuronate concentration increased ∼4-fold in 5 min in the absence of sorbinil and remained at this higher steady state value during the rest of the experimental period (Fig. 3A). In the presence of the glucuronate reductase inhibitor, the concentration of glucuronate increased to a larger extent and almost steadily during the whole experimental period, although a little faster during the first 5 min (0.40 ± 0.03 μmol/min/g of protein) than at later times (0.24 ± 0.02 μmol/min/g of protein between 5 and 40 min). As glucuronate is most likely formed from UDP-glucuronate, we also measured the concentration of this nucleotide (Fig. 3B) and of its precursor, UDP-glucose (Fig. 3C). Aminopyrine caused a fall in the concentration of UDP-glucuronate, which was unaffected by the presence of sorbinil, whereas it caused a modest and transient increase in the concentration of UDP-glucose, which was again not significantly affected by the presence of sorbinil. To confirm that UDP-glucuronate was the precursor for the formation of glucuronate, we checked whether resorcinol, a readily glucuronidated phenol derivative (21Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and d-galactosamine, which traps uridine nucleotides as UDP-galactosamine and derivatives of it (22Keppler D.O.R. Rudigier J.F.M. Bischoff E. Decker K.F.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 17: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), would inhibit the formation of glucuronate induced by aminopyrine in the presence of sorbinil. As shown in Table I, both agents depleted UDP-glucuronate, and in the case of galactosamine, also UDP-glucose. Both of them decreased the basal concentration of glucuronate by a factor of ∼3 (resorcinol) and 4.5 (galactosamine) and almost abolished the increase in glucuronate concentration induced by aminopyrine. Resorcinol caused the accumulation of a β-glucuronide, most likely resorcinylglucuronide, to a level that was ∼3-fold higher than that of free glucuronate observed in the presence of aminopyrine, consistent with the larger effect of resorcinol rather than the effect of aminopyrine on the UDP-glucuronate pool.Table IPrevention of the stimulatory effect of aminopyrine on glucuronate formation by resorcinol and d-galactosamine, two agents causing UDP-glucuronate depletionCondition[Glucuronate][β-Glucuronides][UDP-glucuronate][UDP-glucose]nmol/mg of proteinnmol/mg of proteinnmol/mg of proteinnmol/mg of proteinControl1.81 ± 0.500.07 ± 0.072.32 ± 0.211.49 ± 0.112 mm aminopyrine15.38 ± 1.85aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).0.19 ± 0.161.06 ± 0.15aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).1.49 ± 0.111 mm resorcinol0.65 ± 0.1143.34 ± 4.12aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).0.08 ± 0.08aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).0.99 ± 0.15aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).2 mm aminopyrine + 1 mm resorcinol1.20 ± 0.24bSignificantly different from 2 mm aminopyrine.44.38 ± 3.20aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).,bSignificantly different from 2 mm aminopyrine.0.04 ± 0.04aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).,bSignificantly different from 2 mm aminopyrine.1.04 ± 0.10aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).,bSignificantly different from 2 mm aminopyrine.5 mm d-galactosamine0.40 ± 0.12aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).0.20 ± 0.030.07 ± 0.04aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).0.04 ± 0.02aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).2 mm aminopyrine + 5 mm d-galactosamine1.01 ± 0.43bSignificantly different from 2 mm aminopyrine.0.10 ± 0.060.03 ± 0.03aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).,bSignificantly different from 2 mm aminopyrine.0.03 ± 0.02aSignificantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).,bSignificantly different from 2 mm aminopyrine.a Significantly different from control by Student's t test (p < 0.05).b Significantly different from 2 mm aminopyrine. Open table in a new tab Effect of Other Compounds on the Formation of Free Glucuronate—We also tested the effect of other compounds known to stimulate the formation of ascorbic acid in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4A, the formation of glucuronate was stimulated by chloretone, antipyrine, and barbital in decreasing order of potency. Stimulation was also observed with pentobarbital and phenylbutazone (both at 1 mm; not shown), a pyrazole derivative similar to aminopyrine. No effect was observed with unsubstituted pyrazole (at 1 mm; not shown). As aminopyrine is known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 (23Tanaka E. Breimer D.D. J. Clin. Pharm. Ther. 1997; 22: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we checked whether inhibitors of cytochrome P450 could prevent the effect of the pyrazole derivative on glucuronate formation. Quite surprisingly, the three inhibitors that were tested, clotrimazole (24Rodrigues A.D. Gibson G.G. Ioannides C. Parke D.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 4277-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), proadifen, and metyrapone (25Lewis D.F. Guide to Cytochromes P450: Structure and Function. Taylor and Francis Inc., New York2001: 118-139Crossref Google Scholar), stimulated by themselves the formation of free glucuronate (Fig. 4B), and their effect was not additive with that of aminopyrine (not shown). In the case of clotrimazole and proadifen, the highest concentration used (0.5 mm) had a lesser effect than lower concentrations, presumably because of toxic effects. This is consistent with the finding that, at a concentration of 0.5 mm, both agents caused a marked decrease in the ATP concentration (down to <10% of the control level; not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the effect on glucuronate formation is shared by compounds with quite varied but rather hydrophobic structures. It should also be noted that all agents that were investigated in Fig. 4 exerted a rapid effect. This was indicated by the observation that the glucuronate concentration, reached 10 min after the addition of a maximally active concentration of the drugs, corresponded to 32–37% of the concentration reached after 40 min (results not shown). This value is similar to the one obtained with aminopyrine (37%, Fig. 3A). The effects of some of the agents mentioned above were further investigated in the experiment reported in Fig. 5. As for aminopyrine, the effects of antipyrine, metyrapone, proadifen, clotrimazole, and chloretone on free glucuronate were greatly reinforced by sorbinil (Fig. 5A). This was, however, not the case for barbital, presumably because the latter also inhibits glucuronate reductase (26Sato K. Inazu A. Yamaguchi S. Nakayama T. Deyashiki Y. Sawada H. Hara A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly to aminopyrine, all agents stimulating the formation of glucuronate caused a decrease in the UDP-glucuronate pool (Fig. 5C). With the exception of barbital, all of the agents also caused an increase in the formation of vitamin C, which was markedly (∼80%) inhibited by sorbinil (Fig. 5D). As glutathione depletion has been postulated to play a role in the regulation of vitamin C synthesis (10Braun L. Csala M. Poussu A. Garzó T. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we also investigated the effect of glutathione-depleting agents on the same parameters. Menadione, buthionine sulfoximine, and diamide caused a significant decrease of intracellular glutathione (Fig. 5E) and a significant increase in extracellular GSSG in the case of menadione and diamide (not shown). Despite this, these agents had little or no effect on the formation of free glucuronate or ascorbic acid. By contrast, the agents that most stimulated glucuronate and vitamin C formation had a much lesser or insignificant effect on glutathione levels. β-Glucuronides were also measured in the experiment shown in Fig. 5 as the difference between the concentration of glucuronate before and after treatment with β-glucuronidase (Fig. 5B). As this is a difference assay, it is expected to be more reliable for the conditions in which the free glucuronate concentration is low, i.e. where sorbinil has been omitted from the incubation medium. However, there was a fair agreement between the values observed with and without the inhibitor of glucuronate reductase, indicating the reliability of the assay procedure. Among the agents that increased glucuronate formation, only three (antipyrine, proadifen, and menadione) induced the formation of β-glucuronides, which reached concentrations (0.9–1.9 nmol/mg of protein) that were less than 120 of the concentration observed in the presence of resorcinol (Table I). The Conversion of UDP-glucuronate to Glucuronate as a Regulated Step in Vitamin C Synthesis—Previous studies using radiolabeled galactose and glucose as precursors have indicated that vitamin C is formed from a UDP-linked sugar, presumably UDP-glucuronate (27Evans C. Conney A.H. Trousof N. Burns J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 41: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which free glucuronate is formed, by way of glucuronate 1-phosphate (28Ginsburg V. Weissbach A. Maxwell E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 28: 649-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Puhakainen E. Hänninen O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 61: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or a glucuronidated intermediate (8Horio F. Shibata T. Makino S. Machino S. Hayashi Y. Hattori T. Yoshida A. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 2075-2084PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pogell B.M. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 293-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or even through a direct conversion of UDP-glucuronate to UDP and glucuronate (Fig. 1), is presently unknown. Our study provides two new pieces of evidence indicating the precursor-product relationship between UDP-glucuronate and glucuronate since (a) two agents (resorcinol and d-galactosamine) that deplete UDP-glucuronate through quite distinct mechanisms markedly reduce the formation of free glucuronate whether in the absence or in the presence of aminopyrine; (b) all agents that stimulate the formation of glucuronate cause an ∼50% decrease in the concentration of UDP-glucuronate. In addition, our results indicate that aminopyrine and other xenobiotics stimulate the formation of vitamin C and l-xylulose by accelerating the conversion of UDP-glucuronate to glucuronate. With the exception of barbital, which inhibits glucuronate reductase (26Sato K. Inazu A. Yamaguchi S. Nakayama T. Deyashiki Y. Sawada H. Hara A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), all agents stimulated the formation of vitamin C (in the absence of sorbinil) in proportion with their ability to stimulate the formation of glucuronate (in the presence of sorbinil). This is consistent with the concept that what limits the formation of vitamin C is the availability of free glucuronate. Vitamin C formation in the absence of sorbinil amounted to ∼30% of the glucuronate that accumulated in the presence of sorbinil, indicating that most of the glucuronate formed from UDP-glucuronate is converted to l-xylulose. The finding that sorbinil, which blocks the downstream conversion of glucuronate to l-gulonate, did not modify the decrease in UDP-glucuronate induced by aminopyrine and other xenobiotics indicates that free glucuronate, as well as downstream metabolites, exerts no or little effect on glucuronate formation. The finding that glucuronate remains essentially intracellular, together with the fact that glucuronate added to the extracellular medium is not taken up by hepatocytes, 3C. L. Linster, unpublished results. indicates that the hepatocyte plasma membrane does not contain a transporter for glucuronate. This sugar derivative behaves therefore essentially as an intracellular metabolite, in a similar manner as intermediates of other intracellular pathways such as glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Absence of glucuronate transport in the hepatocyte plasma membrane may explain previous results showing that intraperitoneally administered glucuronate, at variance with 3,6-glucuronolactone, is not converted to vitamin C in vivo (5Burns J.J. Evans C. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 897-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, except for the recent study on the effect of glutathione-depleting agents (10Braun L. Csala M. Poussu A. Garzó T. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), all previous studies had been performed in vivo, and it was therefore not clear whether other organs, hormones, or circulating factors were involved in the effect of aminopyrine and other drugs. The finding that the stimulation of glucuronate and vitamin C formation can take place in isolated hepatocytes indicates that it does not require short term hormonal influences or organ-to-organ transfer of metabolites or modified xenobiotics (also, see below). Involvement of a Short Term Effect—Most of the studies previously investigating the effect of aminopyrine and other xenobiotics on glucuronate and vitamin C formation put the emphasis on the ability of these compounds to induce the synthesis of enzymes such as UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and β-glucuronidase that participate, or may participate, in the formation of glucuronate (6Hollmann S. Touster O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 62: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Horio F. Kimura M. Yoshida A. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1983; 29: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Horio F. Shibata T. Makino S. Machino S. Hayashi Y. Hattori T. Yoshida A. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 2075-2084PubMed Google Scholar, 9Horio F. Horie T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The present study shows that the stimulation caused by these agents is already maximal at the shortest investigated times (5 or 10 min). In the presence of sorbinil, which blocks further conversion of glucuronate, stimulation of the formation of this metabolite reaches up to 15-fold. The amplitude of this effect indicates that regulation of free glucuronate and vitamin C formation may largely be a short term effect. A previous study has shown that glutathione-depleting agents stimulate the formation of vitamin C in isolated mouse hepatocytes (10Braun L. Csala M. Poussu A. Garzó T. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Of the glutathione-depleting agents that we tested (menadione, buthionine sulfoximine, and diamide), the only one that stimulated glucuronate formation was menadione, and it had a much lesser effect than agents such as aminopyrine, metyrapone, and proadifen that did not significantly affect GSH concentration. In contrast to Braun et al. (10Braun L. Csala M. Poussu A. Garzó T. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we did not find a stimulatory effect of the glutathione-depleting agents on vitamin C formation. We have no clear explanation for this discrepancy. The use of different vitamin C assays (by HPLC in our case and by a colorimetric assay in the case of Braun et al. (10Braun L. Csala M. Poussu A. Garzó T. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)) provides no explanation since we found identical results with the colorimetric assay as with the HPLC assay, except for an interference of aminopyrine in the colorimetric assay (not shown). Other potential explanations might be linked to a species difference (rat versus mouse) or to dietary influences. The effect of glutathione depletion has been linked to glycogen degradation (10Braun L. Csala M. Poussu A. Garzó T. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this case, the increase in glucuronate formation would be mediated through a push effect, i.e. through an increase in the concentrations of glucose 1-phosphate, UDP-glucose, and UDP-glucuronate. However, all agents that stimulated the formation of free glucuronate caused a decrease rather than an increase in the concentration of UDP-glucuronate (Figs. 3B and 5C) and barely affected the UDP-glucose concentration (Fig. 3C and data not shown). Furthermore, glucagon and dibutyrylcyclic AMP failed to affect glucuronate formation in isolated rat hepatocytes.3 We have therefore no reason to believe that the effect of agents that stimulated glucuronate formation in the present study was linked to enhanced glycogen degradation or to glutathione depletion. As mentioned in the Introduction, it has been proposed that free glucuronate is formed by hydrolysis of glucuronidated metabolites arising from the stimulating drugs. In vivo, this hydrolysis could potentially take place in the intestine following secretion of glucuronidated metabolites in the bile. This possibility can be excluded in the isolated hepatocyte model used in the present study. Furthermore, two pieces of evidence argue against intracellular hydrolysis of glucuronides taking place inside hepatocytes. The first one is that little if any glucuronidated metabolite was formed with the agents that stimulated the formation of free glucuronate, whereas an agent such as resorcinol, which leads to the accumulation of an elevated concentration of its glucuronidated metabolite, did not cause any formation of free glucuronate. The second is that, if a glucuronidated precursor had to accumulate before glucuronate would form, free glucuronate would appear with a lag kinetic, whereas the opposite was observed. Actually, the formation of glucuronate slowed down after an initial rapid period, most likely because of the decrease in the UDP-glucuronate concentration. Nonetheless, a good argument in favor of a role of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases is the finding of Horio et al. (8Horio F. Shibata T. Makino S. Machino S. Hayashi Y. Hattori T. Yoshida A. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 2075-2084PubMed Google Scholar) that the 3-methylcholanthrene-induced increase in the urinary excretion of ascorbic acid observed in vivo is reduced in heterozygous Gunn rats and abolished in homozygous Gunn rats. These rats have a mutation in the gene encoding the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase that is induced by 3-methylcholanthrene (31Iyanagi T. Watanabe T. Uchiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21302-21307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), explaining the lack of effect of this chemical on the transferase activity. Combined with our own results, which point to a short term effect and to the absence of a glucuronidated intermediate, these data raise the possibility that non-glucuronidable xenobiotics may combine with UDP-glucuronosyltransferase(s) and induce a UDP-glucuronate hydrolase activity, either by acting as pseudosubstrates or through an allosteric effect. Evidence for a UDP-glucuronidase activity of a purified UDP-glucuronosyltransferase has been reported previously (32Hochman Y. Zakim D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5521-5525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has indeed been shown that the addition of compounds (phenylethyl ether, phenylphenyl ether, p-nitrophenylphenyl ether) that bind to the aglycone site of GT2P, a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase purified from pig liver, but are not substrates of this enzyme, led to the formation of free glucuronate at a rate representing up to ∼0.03% of the rate of glucuronidation of p-nitrophenol. This formation of free glucuronate is stimulated by lysophosphatidylcholine, as is the glucuronidation reaction catalyzed by the same enzyme. Because of the multiplicity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, such a mechanism could account for the wide diversity of the compounds that stimulate free glucuronate formation, as well as for their hydrophobicity, a characteristic of the substrates, and presumably also of the pseudosubstrates, of this group of enzymes (33Radominska-Pandya A. Czernik P.J. Little J.M. Battaglia E. Mackenzie P.I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 817-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Although the rate of UDP-glucuronate hydrolysis observed with GT2P may appear quite low, it is likely that other agents acting on other UDP-glucuronosyltransferases induce higher rates of α-glucuronidase activity. Preliminary data obtained on rat liver extracts or microsomes indicate, however, that aminopyrine, chloretone, and metyrapone barely (by less than 20%) affect the formation of glucuronate from UDP-glucuronate, which suggests that the regulation of glucuronate formation from UDP-glucuronate may be quite complex and may involve factors that are lost after cell homogenization. Further work is obviously needed to determine the identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of glucuronate. Its (their) ability to respond rapidly to xenobiotics is a property that will certainly be helpful for its (their) identification as well as for the unraveling of the factors that control its (their) activity under physiological conditions."

Human phenol sulfotransferase (SULT1A1) is the major human ST that catalyzes the sulfation of simple phenols. Because of its broad substrate specificity and lack of endogenous substrates, the biological function of SULT1A1 is believed to be an important detoxification enzyme. In this report, amino acid modification, computer structure modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis were used for studies of Arg residues in the active site of SULT1A1. The Arg-specific modification reagent, 2,3-butanedione, inactivated SULT1A1 in an efficient, time- and concentration-dependent manner, suggesting Arg residues play an important role in the catalytic activity of SULT1A1. According to the computer model, Arg78, Arg130, and Arg257 may be important for SULT1A1 catalytic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis results demonstrated that the positive charge on Arg78 is not critical for SULT1A1 because R78A is still active. In contrast, a negative charge at this position, R78E, completely inactivated SULT1A1. Arg78 is in close proximity to the site of sulfuryl group transfer. Arg257 is located very close to the 3′-phosphate in adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Arg257 is critical for SULT1A1: both R257A and R257E are inactive.

The substrate specificities of STs are very broad. Most hydroxyl groups in phenols, alcohols, and N-substituted hydroxylamines are substrates for one of the ST isoforms. The co-substrate for sulfation of all STs is adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). Sulfation (sulfuryl transfer) is widely observed in various biological processes. Various biological signaling molecules, including hormones, neurotransmitters, peptides, and proteins, can be sulfated to alter biological activity. STs also catalyze the sulfation of a broad range of xenobiotics. Sulfation of drugs and xenobiotics is mainly associated with detoxification: biotransformation of a relatively hydrophobic xenobiotic into a more water-soluble sulfuric ester that is readily excreted. However, there are numerous important exceptions wherein the formation of chemically reactive sulfuric esters is an essential step in the metabolic pathways leading to toxic or carcinogenic responses. Detoxification or bioactivation is highly dependent on the electrophilic reactivity of the individual sulfuric ester products formed. Most sulfation products are stable enough for excretion, while other sulfuric ester products can be reactive toward nucleophilic sites on DNA, RNA, and protein, and so become involved in the initiation of carcinogenesis and other toxic responses. Structure-activity relationship studies of STs started in the 1980s. Protein sequence alignments of the different STs have revealed two highly conserved regions, one (PKSGTTW) in the N-terminal region and one (RKGXXGDWK) in the C-terminal region (1Weinshilboum R. Aksoy I. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since all STs use the same sulfuryl donor, it was speculated that these two regions were involved in PAPS binding (2Varin L. Marsolais F. Richard M. Rouleau M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu C. J. Biol.

Affinity labeling of rat liver aryl ST-IV identified a peptide sequence in the PAPS-binding site, which is in close proximity to the highly conserved sequence in the N-terminal region (4Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis and [35S]PAPS affinity labeling studies of flavonol 3-ST have supported that the two regions mentioned above are involved in PAPS binding (5Marsolais F. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30458-30463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography and 31P NMR studies of flavonol 3-ST demonstrated the involvement of Lys59, Arg11, and Arg277 in PAPS binding (6Marsolais F. Laviolette M. Kakuta Y. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Auger M. Varin L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4066-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Point mutations and [35S]PAPS affinity labeling studies of guinea pig EST have also strongly supported the C-terminal conserved region mentioned above as being part of the PAPS-binding site (7Komatsu K. Driscoll W.J. Koh Y.C. Strott C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of mouse EST supports the idea that these two regions, residues 259–265 and 45–51 for mouse estrogen ST, are directly involved in PAPS binding (8Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition to these two regions, Thr227, Trp53, and Phe229 of mouse EST have also been demonstrated to be involved in PAPS binding. Limited information is available on the structural determinants of the ST substrate-binding site. Of the four regions proposed by Varin's group for flavonol STs, regions I and IV are the same two regions mentioned above for the PAPS-binding site, while domain II, spanning amino acids 92–194 of the flavonol 3-ST sequence, is believed to contain all the determinants for substrate binding (2Varin L.

Subsequent mutational analysis of domain II of flavonol 3-ST did not identify amino acids critical for substrate binding; however, Leu95 may be in direct contact with the flavonol B ring (10Marsolais F.

By comparing the kinetic parameters of a series of expressed chimeric PSTs, where the M-form and P-form coding regions were exchanged, it was concluded that amino acid residues 84–148 contain the structural determinants for substrate specificity in both forms. They also demonstrated the differential roles of the two highly variable regions (amino acid residues 84–89 and 143–148) in substrate binding, catalysis, and sensitivity to inhibition by 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol. Similar studies on human aryl-STs (HAST1, HAST3, and HAST4) suggested that the two highly divergent regions, region A (amino acids 44–107) and region B (amino acids 132–164), determine the substrate specificity of human aryl STs (12Brix L.A. Barnett A.C. Duggleby R.G. Leggett B. McManus M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10474-10479Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Brix L.A. Duggleby R.G. Gaedigk A. McManus M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A single amino acid change in HAST1 (A146E) altered its activity for p-nitrophenol (PNP) to that of HAST3. Studies on guinea pig 3-hydroxysteroid ST isoforms revealed that the amino acid residue at position 51 plays a fundamental role in determining the stereospecificity exhibited by the α- and β-isoforms. Mutational studies on mouse EST demonstrated that Tyr81 determines the substrate specificity of this enzyme (14Petrotchenko E.V. Doerflein M.E. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30019-30022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of mouse EST showed that residues Phe142, Ile146, Tyr149 contribute to binding of steroid 17β-estradiol. Asn86 is believed to be in a position to form a hydrogen bond with the 17β-hydroxyl group, while Lys106 and His108 are within hydrogen bonding distance of the 3α-phenol group of the steroid (8Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Studies of structure-function relationships on human STs are relatively limited. The work on human phenol STs has revealed two regions and one specific amino acid (position 146) as important for the determination of substrate specificity, as mentioned above (3Sakakibara Y.

To our knowledge, studies on the identification of specific residues in the active site of STs by amino acid modification reagents are limited. Borchardt et al. (16Borchardt R.T. Schasteen C.S.

N-Ethylmaleimide has also been used for the identification of essential sulfhydryl residues in rat PST (17Borchardt R.T. Schasteen C.S. Wu S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 708: 280-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ribonucleotide dialdehydes (ATPDA, ADPDA, AMPDA, and APSDA) have been characterized as affinity labeling reagents for rat liver PST, and it was speculated that the dialdehydes inactivated the ST by possible formation of a Schiff's base adduct with an active site lysine residue (17Borchardt R.T. Schasteen C.S. Wu S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 708: 280-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Borchardt R.T. Wu S.E. Schasteen C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). ATPDA has been used as an affinity labeling reagent for the identification of a peptide sequence in the PAPS-binding site of rat liver AST-IV (4Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have studied the carboxyl amino acid residues in the active site of SULT1A1 (19Chen G. Rabjohn P.A. York J.L. Wooldridge C. Zhang D. Falany C.N. Radominska-Pandya A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16000-16007Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that the conserved residues Asp134 and Asp263 are critical for the binding of PAPS. Glu83 and Glu246 may be important for the binding of substrate, and Glu83 may be involved in the catalysis reaction. Since the crystallization of the mouse estrogen ST (8Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), a few human STs have also been crystallized and their crystal structures partially solved. They include human monoamine ST (M-PST, SULT1A3) (20Bidwell L.M. McManus M.E. Gaedigk A. Kakuta Y. Negishi M. Pedersen L. J. Mol.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and hydroxysteroid ST (DHEA-ST, SULT2B1) (23Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E.V. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the human simple phenol ST (P-PST, SULT1A1) has not been shown. We built the computer model of SULT1A1 based on the other known ST crystal structures (19Chen G. Rabjohn P.A. York J.L. Wooldridge C. Zhang D. Falany C.N. Radominska-Pandya A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16000-16007Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Even with the known crystal structure, the roles of amino acid residues in the active site still need to be studied using experimental methods. In this report, we studied Arg residues in the active site of human phenol sulfotransferase (SULT1A1) using amino acid modification, computer modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis. Arginine is one of the two amino acids that carry a positive charge. It may be very important for the catalytic activity of STs. Arg-specific modification reagents have been used to study the importance of Arg for the catalytic activity of SULT1A1. Our results demonstrate that the positive charge of Arg78 does not contribute to the catalytic activity of SULT1A1. A negative charge at this position inactivated SULT1A1. Although both Arg257 and Arg130 are in close proximity to the 3′-phosphate on PAPS, only Arg257 appears to be critical for the catalytic activity of SULT1A1. 2,3-Butanedione (BD), 4-phenylphenol (4PP), 2-naphthol (2NP), 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate (PAP), PAPS, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, ampicillin, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. Amylose affinity resin and maltose were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other chemicals and solvents were of the highest grade available. Methylene Blue Assay—This method is used for determining activity of SULT1A1 and its mutants and for SULT1A1 mutant protein kinetic parameter determinations. This assay method was developed by Nose and Lipmann (24Nose Y. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1348-1351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SULT1A1 activity was determined in the assay mixture containing 0.125 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 8 μm PAPS, 2–10 μg mutant protein, and different concentrations of substrate in a total volume of 400 μl. After incubating at 37.0 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of methylene blue solution (250 mg of methylene blue, 10 ml of H2SO4, 50 g of Na2SO4 in 1 liter of water) and 1 ml of chloroform. After vortexing, the tubes were centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge for 1 min. The chloroform phase was then transferred to tubes containing 20–50 mg of dehydrated Na2SO4 and read at 651 nm. Kinetic constants were calculated according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. p-Nitrophenyl Sulfate (PNPS) Assay—This method utilizes PNPS to regenerate PAPS from product PAP. At the same time, the color reagent PNP is generated for colorimetric measurement (25Frame L.T. Ozawa S. Nowell S.A. Chou H.C. DeLongchamp R.R. Doerge D.R. Lang N.P. Kadlubar F.F. Drug Metab.

Yin S. Maiti S. Shao X. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This method was used for the determination of time- and concentration-dependent inactivation, kinetic parameter determination for partially inactivated SULT1A1, and PAP and substrate protection for BD inactivation of SULT1A1. Purification of SULT1A1—Human SULT1A1 cDNA (and its mutants) was expressed using the pMAL-c2 expression system as described previously (26Chen G. Battaglia E. Senay C. Falany C.N. Radominska-Pandya A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Falany C.N. Comer K.A. Dooley T.P. Glatt H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 774: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, the maltose-binding fusion protein (MBSULT1A1 and its mutants) was expressed in XL1-Blue cells containing the pMAL-SULT1A1 vector. The cytosol of fusion protein was loaded onto an amylose affinity column (New England Biolabs) prewashed with 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After washing out other proteins, the fusion protein (mutants or wild type) was eluted using a 0–1 mm maltose gradient in the same buffer. The final purified SULT1A1 was apparent homogenous according to SDS-PAGE analysis. SULT1A1 (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated in 0.05 m borate, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl at room temperature. Different concentrations of 2,3-butanedione (in ethanol) were added to start the inactivation reaction. Aliquots (10 μl) were taken at different times for standard assay of SULT1A1 activity. Arginine (0.5 m) was included in the enzyme assay reaction mixture (for time- and concentration-dependent inactivation) or used to stop the reaction (for partially inactivation of SULT1A1). For substrate or PAP protection experiments, phenol substrates (2-naphthol or 4-phenylphenol) or PAP were added to the SULT1A1 solution before the addition of 2,3-butanedione. The molecular coordinates of mSULT1E1 were obtained from the Protein Data Bank file 1AQU. A Silicon Graphics Iris work station was used for modeling. Since the primary sequence of SULT1A1 and mSULT1E1 could be aligned with no gaps, a significant amino acid similarity (93%) existed between the two proteins, and each had the same number of amino acids. Biosym's Homology program was used to build the backbone of SULT1A1 based on the coordinates of mSULT1E1. Side chain bumps of 0.1% overlap of the Van der Walls radii were relieved manually. The structure was then minimized using steepest descents (2000 steps) followed by conjugate gradients (1000 steps) using Biosym's Discover program, version 2.9. No constraints were used. The program RasMol, version 2.6, was used for display of the SULT1A1 structure. The cDNA encoding SULT1A1 in the pKK233-3 vector was from Dr. Charles Falany, and this construct has been described previously (29Wilborn T.W. Comer K.A. Dooley T.P. Reardon I.M. Heinrikson R.L. Falany C.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 70-77PubMed Google Scholar, 30Falany C.N. Zhuang W. Falany J.L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All mutant cDNAs were created with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and all primers for mutagenesis were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). The primers used for the mutations are list in Table I. The primers were designed using the Gene Fisher primer designing and Multialignment software. Mutant cDNA was generated and selected through a series of three steps consisting of primer extension/thermocycling, digestion of parental DNA, and transformation as outlined in the manufacturer's protocol. Colonies resulting from the transformation were grown in sterile medium by standard protocols and plasmid was isolated from cells with the QIAprep spin mini-prep kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing which was performed by The Oklahoma State University, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Recombinant DNA/Protein Resource Facility.Table IPrimer pairs for SULT1A1 mutantsMutantsaNote: two different mutants in the same position used the same reverse primer (r).PrimersR78A5′-GCTCCCATCTTCATGGCCGTGCCCTTCC-3′R78E5′-GCTCCCATCTTCATGGAGGTGCCCTTCC-3′R78r5′-GGAAACTGCCACATCCTTTGCGTTGCGG-3′R130A5′-GGTCTATGTTGCCGCCAACGCAAAGGATGTGC-3′R130E5′-GGTCTATGTTGCCGAGAACGCAAAGGATGTGC-3′R130r5′-GGTAGAGAACAGGGTGGGTCCGGCTCAGCTCC-3′R257A5′-GCATCTCCCCCTTCATGGCCAAAGGCATGGCT-3′R257E5′-GCATCTCCCCCTTCATGGAGAAAGGCATGGCT-3′R257r5′-CGCTTGGTCAGGTTTGATTCGCACACTCCCTC-3′R213E5′-CCTGGAGTTTGTGGGGCAATCCCTGCCAGAC-3′R213r5′-GGACCTCAAACACCCCGTTAGGGACGGTCTC-3′a Note: two different mutants in the same position used the same reverse primer (r). Open table in a new tab Chemical Inactivation of SULT1A1 by Arginine Residue-specific Modification Reagent 2,3-Butadione—BD is a reagent specifically reactive toward the Arg residues of a protein (Fig. 1). BD has been used for the characterization of Arg residues in various enzymes (31Yankeelov Jr., J.A. Mitchell C.D. Crawford T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3915-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 33Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Alkema W.B. Prins A.K. de Vries E. Janssen D.B. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because borate is necessary to form a stable adduct (Fig. 1), the inactivation reactions were done in 50 mm borate buffer, pH 7.5. BD inactivated SULT1A1 in an efficient, time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In the concentration range from 0.0625 to 2 mm, BD effectively inactivated SULT1A1. At 2 mm, BD inactivated 95% of SULT1A1 activity within 30 s. At all BD concentrations, log(percent activity) is linear versus time. These facts indicate that the inactivation is specific through active site Arg residues. According to the equation d[E]/dt = K app[E] or log[E] = 2.3K app t (where E represents active SULT1A1, t is time, K app is apparent first order rate constant), K app can be calculated from the slopes of Fig. 2A. According to equation K app = K[BD] n or logK app = logK + nlog[BD] (where K is the rate constant and n is the reaction order for BD), when logK app is plotted against the log[BD], a straight line results (Fig. 2B). From the data in Fig. 2B, n = 1.07 and K = 450 min–1M–1. This further demonstrates that BD is a specific reagent for the inactivation of critical Arg residues in the active site of SULT1A1. The BD reaction order, n, is ∼1. This suggests that there may be only one Arg residue in the active site whose modification could lead to complete inactivation of SULT1A1. SULT1A1 was partially inactivated using 0.25 mm BD in 50 mm borate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl for 1 min at room temperature. The inactivation was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 1 m arginine solution at pH 7.5. The partially inactivated SULT1A1 was used to determine kinetic parameter changes by varying either PAPS or substrate 4PP concentrations. Ethanol (BD stock solution was prepared in ethanol) was used for the control. Fig. 3, A and B, demonstrate that the partially inactivated SULT1A1 did not change Km for either PAPS or substrate 4PP. This suggests that the SULT1A1 completely lost its catalytic activity when BD modified the active site Arg residues. If any of the BD modifications to SULT1A1 had lead to partial loss of catalytic activity, the above partially inactivated SULT1A1 would have changed in Km for either PAPS or 4PP. Fig. 4 demonstrates that both PAP and phenol substrates (4-phenylphenol and 2-naphthol) protected the BD inactivation of SULT1A1. This further suggests that the inactivation is due to the modification of Arg residues in the active site. Because the inactivation is irreversible and substrate or PAP binding is reversible, the protection cannot be 100%. Computer Modeling Structure of SULT1A1—The computer model of human SULT1A1 was generated (19Chen G. Rabjohn P.A. York J.L. Wooldridge C. Zhang D. Falany C.N. Radominska-Pandya A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16000-16007Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) based on the published crystal structure of mouse estrogen ST (mSULT1E1) (Protein Data Bank file 1AQU) (15Hsiao Y.S. Yang Y.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12959-12966Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). According to the computer SULT1A1 model, Arg78, Arg130, and Arg257 may be important for the catalytic activity of SULT1A1 (Fig. 5). Arg257 and Arg130 are in close proximity to the 3′-phosphate group on PAPS. Arg78 is in close proximity to both the 5′-phosphosulfate on PAPS and the hydroxyl group on substrate, 2-naphthol. Arg78 may affect the catalytic activity of SULT1A1. All other Arg residues are located on the surface of the protein structure. Table II lists the shortest calculated distances of these Arg residues to different functional groups.Table IICalculated shortest distance between the related residues to the functional groupsArg78Arg78Arg130Arg213Arg213Arg257Lys106Lys106Functional groupPAPS (5′-sulfate)2NP (OH)PAPS (3′-phosphate)PAPS (5′-sulfate)2NP (OH)PAPS (3′-phosphate)PAPS (5′-sulfate)2NP (OH)Distance (Å)11.311.12.823.823.32.03.72.0 Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis of Important Arg Residues—According to the BD inactivation results and computer modeling structure, Arg78, Arg130, and Arg257 were selected for site-directed mutagenesis studies. Arg213 (located on the surface of SULT1A1) was selected for control mutation. Arg78, Arg130, and Arg257 were mutated to either the neutral amino acid alanine or the negatively charged amino acid glutamic, acid. Arg213 was only mutated to glutamic acid. All the mutated SULT1A1s were purified. Pure proteins of the mutants were used for kinetic enzyme activity measurements. Fig. 6 shows the SDS-PAGE for the purified mutant proteins. All mutant proteins were pure based on the SDS-PAGE. Fig. 7 shows the enzymatic specific activities of different mutants at 100 μm 2-naphthol, 8 μm PAPS, pH 6.2. Fig. 7 demonstrates that R213E (control mutant) did not change SULT1A1 catalytic activity. R257A and R257E almost completely inactivated SULT1A1. This suggests that a positive charge at the Arg257 position is critical for the catalytic activity (or PAPS binding) of SULT1A1. Although R130 is also in close proximity to the 3′-phosphate of PAPS, neither R130A nor R130E significantly changed the catalytic activity of SULT1A1. Arg130 may not play a critical role for the binding of PAPS or the catalytic activity of SULT1A1.Fig. 72-Naphthol sulfation activity of SULT1A1 mutant proteins. The methylene blue assay method was used for enzyme activity determinations. 0.1 m 2-naphthol was used as substrate for the assay at 8 μm PAPS, pH 6.2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) R78A retained activity (Fig. 7 and Table III). This suggests that the positive charge on Arg78 is not critical for the catalytic activity of SULT1A1. R78E was inactive, suggesting that a negative charge at position 78 will inactivate SULT1A1. Based on the computer model of SULT1A1 (Fig. 8), Lys106 (the other amino acid carrying a positive charge on its side chain) is in closer proximity than Arg78 to the location of sulfuryl group transfer (Table II). The positive charge on Arg78 is neutralized by Asp59 (negatively charged residue). Therefore the positive charge at position 78 is not critical for catalytic activity of SULT1A1. If position 78 is mutated to a negatively charge amino acid, Lys106 may be affected, thus inactivating SULT1A1. We are currently investigating the role of Lys residues on the catalytic activity of SULT1A1.Table III2-Naphthol sulfation kinetic parameters for SULT1A1 mutantswtR213ER78AR130AR130EV max (nmol/min/mg)13.214.413.214.016.4Km (mm)16.020.918.218.418.4Vmax/Km0.840.680.720.760.88 Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters for the active mutants were determined (Table III). The results in Table III indicate that R213E, R78A, R130A, and R130E have catalytic characteristics similar to wild type SULT1A1. Km and V max for these mutants did not change significantly compared with the wild type. The effect of specific Arg residues on SULT1A1 activity has not been previously studied. To the best of our knowledge, the only report on the study of Arg residues in STs was published by Borchardt and Schasteen in 1977 (16Borchardt R.T. Schasteen C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 1067-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). They studied 2,3-butandione inactivation of a rat liver phenol ST. Their results indicated that BD inactivated this rat enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. They suggested a possible role for arginyl residues as anionic recognition sites for sulfate transfer reactions. In this work, we focused on the study of Arg residues in the active site of human SULT1A1 using the combination of amino acid modification, computer modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis methods. Our results consistently suggest that among the Arg residues, only Arg257 is critical for the catalytic activity of SULT1A1. The inactivation reaction order for BD (n) is ∼1. This suggests that there is only one Arg modification that can completely inactivate SULT1A1. Because R78A is active, the BD modification of R78 should not inactivate SULT1A1. Because both R130A and R130E are active, the BD modification of Arg130 also should not inactivate SULT1A1. BD partially inactivated SULT1A1 did not change the Km values for either substrate or PAPS (Fig. 3), suggesting that when BD modified Arg257, SULT1A1 would completely lose its activity. When other Arg residues were modified, SULT1A1 was still active. These findings agree with the site-directed mutagenesis results."

These same models respond to both active and passive immunization against Aβ as evidenced by the reduction in levels of Aβ, the prevention and/or clearance of amyloid plaques, and the improvement in cognitive behavior (4Schenk D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, an effective preparation free of significant side effects in humans is still awaited. Indeed, clinical trials involving Aβ vaccination have been discontinued following the development of inflammation in patients brains (5Haass C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1195-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cerebral microhemmorhaging has also been observed in similarly immunized mice (6Pfeifer M. Boncristiano S. Bondolfi L. Stalder A. Deller T. Staufenbiel M. Mathews P.M. Jucker M. Science. 2002; 298: 1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that antibodies capable of recognizing other Aβ epitopes or conformations should be screened (6Pfeifer M. Boncristiano S. Bondolfi L. Stalder A. Deller T. Staufenbiel M. Mathews P.M. Jucker M. Science. 2002; 298: 1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), perhaps a closer examination of modulators of Aβ fibrillogenesis may reveal a target better suited for immunotherapy. Among the modulators proposed to date, which include apolipoprotein E, cholesterol, and α2-macroglobulin, we were particularly interested in the cytokine transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). The TGF-β1 isoform was recently implicated as a co-factor for amyloid deposition with the observation that cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, which are strikingly similar to those seen in patients with AD and CAA, and the ensuing neuropathological development are accelerated in bigenic mice overexpressing both TGF-β1 and human APP (hAPP), relative to hAPP transgenic mice controls (7Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K. Lin C. Mucke L. Nature. 1997; 389: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that cerebrovascular amyloid deposition might reflect TGF-β receptor-mediated induction of extracellular matrix deposition. Aβ binding proteins within these extracellular matrix components could enhance the formation and/or stability of Aβ fibrils (8Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C. Brunden K.R. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2452-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A link between TGF-β and Aβ deposition was already being considered following the localization of TGF-β immunoreactivity to senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons in AD patient brain (7Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K. Lin C. Mucke L. Nature. 1997; 389: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 10Flanders K.C. Ren R.F. Lippa C.F. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). TGF-βs had also been shown to enhance the formation of amyloid deposits in rats when co-injected intracerebroventricularly with Aβ-(1–40) (11Frautschy S.A. Yang F. Calderon L. Cole G.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and to increase the number of Aβ plaque-like deposits in hippocampal slice culture in a subfield-selective manner (12Harris-White M.E. Chu T. Balverde Z. Sigel J.J. Flanders K.C. Frautschy S.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10366-10374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, APP production and Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42) processing were promoted by TGF-β1 in transgenic mice (13Lesne S. Docagne F. Gabriel C. Liot G. Lahiri D.K. Buee L. Plawinski L. Delacourte A. MacKenzie E.T. Buisson A. Vivien D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18408-18418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast to its role as a risk factor, TGF-β1 facilitates Aβ clearance and plaque burden reduction following activation of parenchymal glial cells in TGF-β1/hAPP bigenic mouse brain (14Wyss-Coray T.

TGF-βs have also been shown to protect neuronal cell cultures against Aβ-mediated insult (15Prehn J.H. Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Galindo M.F. Ghadge G.D. Roos R.P. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Krajewski S.

Flanders K.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These apparently opposing actions of TGF-β in the brain illustrate the multifunctionality of this cytokine and the dependence of its effects on the specific cellular context in which it is expressed. Additional investigation is needed to characterize the cellular and molecular processes that underlie the effects of TGF-β during Aβ-mediated pathology. To date, the actions of TGF-β have centered on receptor-mediated events. In this report, we demonstrate a direct interaction between TGF-β and Aβ that promotes Aβ fibrillogenesis and neurotoxicity. Our data support a role for a unique, receptor-independent mode of action for TGF-β and define a new molecular point of intervention for inhibiting Aβ fibrillogenesis. TGF-β Receptor Competition Assays—Mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells (ATCC: CCL-64) were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 h at 37 °C (5% CO2). Cell surface receptors were cross-link-labeled with 200 pm125I-TGF-β1 (Perkin Elmer Life Science Products) in the presence of increasing concentrations (1–50 μm) of Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(25–35), and Aβ-(12–28) (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) was used as the cross-linking reagent, and the receptors were analyzed by 4–11% gradient SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Signal intensities were quantitated using the ImageQuaNT system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy (CD)—Aβ-(1–40) was prepared by dissolution into 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to yield a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Samples were incubated at ambient temperature (22 °C) without stirring and CD measurements (at 22 °C) were performed periodically using a 0.1 cm pathlength quartz cell (Hellma, Forest Hills, NY) and an Aviv Model 62A DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). The scan rate was 1 nm/sec at a bandwidth of 1 nm. Three independent sets of experiments, each comprised of triplicate scans performed from 250–198 nm, were done. The buffer spectrum was subtracted from the scans and the resulting functions were smoothed. Data could not be acquired at wavelengths lower than 198 nm due to saturation of the photomultiplier. However, this range is sufficient to accurately evaluate the secondary structure state of the samples (18Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined a posteriori by quantitative amino acid analysis, thus enabling accurate calculation of molar ellipticities (Θ). Neurotoxicity Assay—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (ATCC: CRL-1721) were cultured on rat tail collagen-coated plates. Both PC12 cells and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC: CRL-2266) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum (PC12) and 5% fetal bovine serum (PC12 & SH-SY5Y) at 37 °C (5% CO2). Cells (5 × 103/well) were differentiated to a neuronal phenotype using 100 ng/ml of NGF. The toxicity of Aβ-(1–40) was determined by treatment with 50 μm Aβ-(1–40) either alone or in combination with 1 nm TGF-βs (R&D Systems) for 72 h. The reverse peptide, Aβ-(40–1), was used as a peptide control. Mitochondrial function, as an index of cell viability, was monitored using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) dye conversion assay. MTT (20 μl of a 5 mg/ml solution in sterile phosphate-buffered saline) was added to the cells and allowed to incubate for 3 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 20% SDS in water/N,N-dimethylformamide (1:1), pH 4.7. Optical density was measured at 590 nm. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Between 1200 and 1600 resonance units of Aβ peptides [e.g. Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(25–35), and Aβ-(12–28)] were immobilized using the standard amine-coupling procedure onto CM5 sensor chips which were docked in a Surface Plasmon Resonance-based biosensor (BIAcore™; Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, an injection of 50 μl of NHS/EDC was followed by manual injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/min of freshly prepared Aβ peptide diluted to 25 μg/ml in 10 mm acetic acid (pH 4.0). The remaining active sites on the surface were blocked by injection of 50 μl ethanolamine (pH 8.0). Binding curves were obtained by injecting fresh solutions of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 (12.5–150 nm) in Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.4) over the test surfaces. The binding curves from mock surfaces (no Aβ peptide immobilized) were subtracted from the corresponding experimental curves. Morphological Characterization of Aβ-(1–40) Fibrils—Aβ-(1–40) was incubated at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (∼235 μm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) either alone or in combination with 5 μg/ml (∼200 nm) of either TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 for 48 h at room temperature without agitation. A small amount of specimen was placed onto 200-mesh Formvar-coated grids, blotted, and then air-dried. The specimen was negatively stained with 1% (w/v) potassium phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) prior to examination with a JEM-2000FX electron microscope (JEOL, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Immunolocalization of TGF-β Receptors in Mouse Hippocampus— Mice (C3H/C57Bl; Charles River Laboratories) were terminated by cervical dislocation, and the brains were quickly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C until use. Animal maintenance and manipulation was performed according to the recommendations of our ethical committees (Biotechnology Research Institute-NRC). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used for localization of TGF-β RI (V-22, 2 μg/ml), RII (C-16, 1 μg/ml), and RIII (C-20, 2 μg/ml) receptors. Antibody specificity was confirmed using biosensor and Western blot analyses. Serial sagittal sections (8-μm thick) were incubated with the primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin in a moist chamber overnight at 4 °C. The specificity of the immunoreactions was tested by exclusion of the primary antibody as well as by competition, i.e. preblocking the primary antibody with the immunizing peptide (2–5 μm). Following several rinses in phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antigen expression was visualized (0.3% diaminobenzidine, 0.025% H2O2, 2–10 min) by light microscopy. Cell soma were counterstained with methyl green. This series of experiments was repeated 4–6 times using tissue obtained from both male and female mice ranging in age from 7 to 10 months. Statistics—Data were analyzed by one- or two-way analysis of variance using p < 0.05 as the criterion for significance. Post-hoc analysis relied on Dunnet's Multiple Comparisons Test. Aβ-(1–40) Diminishes 125I-TGF-β1 Labeling of Cell Surface Receptors—Three high affinity cell surface receptors for TGF-β have been identified, i.e. the type I, II, and III receptors (RI, RII, and RIII, respectively; Ref. 19Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). One approach to investigating the mechanism of action of TGF-β on Aβ-mediated effects is to determine the effect of freshly dissolved Aβ on TGF-β binding to these three receptors. We analyzed this using 125I-TGF-β1 binding on Mv1Lu cells which express relatively high levels of these receptors. Analysis of variance of all treatment groups revealed significant reductions in binding of 125I-TGF-β1 to all three types of receptors, i.e. RI (F(10,69) = 3.853, p = 0.0004), RII (F(10,56) = 2.653, p = 0.0101) and RIII (F(10,69)= 2.824, p = 0.0054). Post-hoc analysis indicated that this effect occurred, in a dose-dependent manner, with the physiologically relevant peptide Aβ-(1–40), but not with the Aβ-(12–28) and Aβ-(25–35) fragments (Fig. 1). Aβ-(1–40)-mediated Neurotoxicity Is Potentiated by TGF-β Isoforms in a Receptor-independent Manner—To examine the receptor-dependence of TGF-β on Aβ-(1–40)-mediated neurotoxicity, we chose to use cells that do not express TGF-β receptors (i.e. PC12 cells) and comparing these to cells that express all three TGF-β receptor types (i.e. SH-SY5Y) (Ref. 20Massagué J. Cheifetz S. Boyd F.T. Andres J.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 593: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar and confirmed in our laboratory). Using PC12 cells eliminates the possibility of any event being obscured by TGF-β RII receptor-mediated neuroprotection (10Flanders K.C. Ren R.F. Lippa C.F. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 17Ren R.F. Hawver D.B. Kim R.S. Flanders K.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We first confirmed the conformation state of freshly dissolved Aβ-(1–40) using circular dichroism. Aβ underwent a well-defined random coil → β-sheet transition (Fig. 2), as expected of a species undergoing a conformational transition associated with fibril formation (18Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 21Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). We used neurite retraction and mitochondrial conversion of the tetrazolium redox dye, MTT, as early indicators of cytotoxicity. TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 alone had no observable effect on either neurite retraction or MTT dye conversion in PC12 cells (F(2,29)= 0.3632, p = 0.6985, Fig. 3A), as expected of cells that do not express TGF-β receptors. Also as expected, Aβ-(1–40) treatment caused neurite retraction (Fig. 3A) and inhibition of MTT dye conversion (reduced by 25% relative to untreated PC12 cells, t 0.05,23 = 3.426, p = 0.0023, Fig. 3B). Both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 potentiated the cytotoxic effect of Aβ-(1–40) as evidenced by further neurite retraction (Fig. 3A) and a further reduction of MTT dye conversion (to 50% of control, F(2,19) = 4.968, p = 0.0184, Fig. 3B). Aβ-(1–40) also induced a reduction in MTT dye conversion in SH-SY5Y cells (F(5,22)= 24.78, p = 0.0001, Fig. 3B), however, this effect was not exacerbated by TGF-βs which is expected of a cell model expressing all three TGF-β receptor types. In fact, a marginal reversal of the effect of Aβ-(1–40) was observed during treatment with TGF-βs. These combined data demonstrate that TGF-β receptor-mediated events supersede the receptor-independent events. The reverse peptide, Aβ-(40–1), did not exert any effect on MTT reduction either alone or in combination with TGF-βs (data not shown). The extremely low ratio of TGF-βs to Aβ-(1–40) used during these experiments, i.e. a 1 to 50,000 molar ratio, supports the idea that TGF-β may have a seeding effect and emphasizes the potential physiological relevance of these observations.Fig. 3TGF-βs enhance Aβ-(1–40)-mediated toxicity in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. A, the extensive neuritic arborization present in control NGF-differentiated PC12 cell cultures is unaffected by treatment with either TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 (top) (original magnification: ×150). Neurite retraction (arrows) is readily apparent following treatment with Aβ-(1–40) (bottom) and is even more evident following co-treatment with the individual TGF-β isoforms. B, the viability of similarly treated PC12 cells was quantitated using MTT dye conversion. Absorbance values (n = 6–8 experiments done in triplicate) are expressed as mean ± S.E. percent control. Aβ-(1–40) reduced MTT dye conversion to ∼75% of control levels. TGF-βs alone had no effect on TGF-β receptor-null PC12 cell viability, but they were able to potentiate the toxic effect of Aβ-(1–40) (top). In contrast, TGF-βs did not promote the Aβ-(1–40)-mediated toxicity in TGF-β receptor-expressing SH-SY5Y cell culture (bottom). The reverse peptide, Aβ-(40–1), did not affect MTT reduction, either alone or in combination with TGF-βs (as these data do not add anything to the figure, they are not shown). **, p < 0.01 compared with control and *, p < 0.05 compared with Aβ-(1–40) alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TGF-β Isoforms Bind Directly to Aβ-(1–40) with Low Nano-molar Affinities—We used a Surface Plasmon Resonance-based biosensor to test for a direct physical interaction between TGF-β isoforms and Aβ peptides. The biosensor would detect mass accumulation resulting from binding of the individual TGF-β isoforms to the covalently immobilized Aβ peptides as a change in the refractive index of the surface matrix and would generate a curve recorded in arbitrary resonance units (RUs). Both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were observed to bind significantly to freshly dissolved Aβ-(1–40), with the binding of TGF-β2 being greater than that of TGF-β1 (Fig. 4, A and B). The extent of binding of the TGF-β isoforms to Aβ-(12–28) was significantly lower than that observed with Aβ-(1–40), while no detectable binding was observed on surfaces to which Aβ-(25–35) was immobilized. Subsequent biosensor experiments were focused on the physiologically relevant Aβ-(1–40) peptide given the overall lack of interaction of the pharmacological fragments Aβ-(25–35) and Aβ-(12–28) with TGF-β isoforms in the present biosensor study. The specificity of the interaction between injected TGF-β2 and the immobilized Aβ-(1–40) was confirmed by co-injection of the TGF-β ligand specific antibody 3C7 (Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) (Fig. 5), thus excluding the possibility that the binding to Aβ-(1–40) that we observed might be due to a protein contaminant in the commercial TGF-β preparation.Fig. 5Confirmation of the TGF-β-Aβ-(1–40) complex. Injection of TGF-β2 (100 nm) over the Aβ-(1–40) surface gave the characteristic binding curve. Co-injection of TGF-β2 with the TGF-β ligand specific antibody, 3C7, confirmed the presence of TGF-β2 within the binding complex. Injection of 3C7 alone did not recognize the immobilized Aβ-(1–40).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding of TGF-β isoforms to freshly dissolved Aβ-(1–40) was characterized in more detail using the biosensor by varying the concentration of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. The curves (Fig. 6, A and D) clearly indicated that both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 bound to Aβ-(1–40) in a concentration-dependent manner. Fitting of these binding data using nonlinear least squares analysis and numerical integration of the differential rate equations (22De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Lortie R. Debanne M.T. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the binding of TGF-β1 to Aβ-(1–40) could not be described well by a simple binding model (A+B → AB), as judged by the variance in the residuals between the calculated and experimental data (Fig. 6B). However, the data was well represented by a rearrangement model (A+B → AB → AB*) (Fig. 5, A and C) with an apparent K D of 60.5 ± 5.2 nm. The fitting of the rearrangement model suggests that the initial TGF-β1-Aβ-(1–40) complex undergoes a kinetically detectable rearrangement, perhaps a structural transition. This observation may point to a direct effect of TGF-β1 on Aβ-(1–40) fibril formation since Aβ-(1–40) is known to undergo a conformational transition from a predominantly random coil → β-sheet-rich form during fibrillogenesis. In the case of TGF-β2 (Fig. 6B), when the curves derived from all of the TGF-β2 concentrations were taken into account, neither the simple model (Fig. 6E) nor rearrangement model (data not shown) represented the data well. However, the lower concentration curves for TGF-β2 could be fit using a simple model, resulting in an apparent K D of 96.1 ± 17.9 nm (Fig. 6, D and F). When the 100 and 150 nm TGF-β2 curves were predicted using the constants derived from the fitting of the lower concentration curves, the experimental curves were found to have significantly higher plateau values than the predicted curves (Fig. 6D), illustrating the complexity of the TGF-β2-Aβ-(1–40) interaction. The greater than predicted RU values at higher TGF-β2 concentrations may result from a change in density of the biosensor matrix due to the formation of aggregates or fibrils on the surface. The interaction between TGF-βs and Aβ-(1–40) is not generalized to growth factors. Indeed, this was confirmed by the absence of binding between Aβ-(1–40) and 150 nm nerve growth factor (NGF; data not shown), which, along with TGF-βs, is a member of the cystine-knot-containing superfamily of growth factors (23Wiesmann C. de Vos A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Subsequent binding of TGF-β2 to the same surface confirmed the presence of covalently immobilized Aβ-(1–40) (data not shown). TGF-β Isoforms Promote Aβ-(1–40) Fibril Formation in Vitro—Our biosensor studies confirmed that TGF-βs interact directly with Aβ-(1–40) and suggested a structural transition possibly affecting fibril growth. We used electron microscopy to examine the characteristics of Aβ-(1–40) fibrils formed in the absence and presence of TGF-βs. Lower magnification electron microscopy of Aβ-(1–40) alone showed occasional short strands having a gross morphology characteristic of protofibrils (21Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7a). In contrast, protofibrils were more abundant and formed network-like assemblies in the Aβ-(1–40) + TGF-β1 (Fig. 7b) and Aβ-(1–40) + TGF-β2 (Fig. 7c) samples. No detectable structures were discerned with TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 alone (data not shown). The low ratio of TGF-βs to Aβ-(1–40) used during this experiment, i.e. a1–1000 molar ratio, together with our biosensor data indicating a structural transition in the TGF-β-Aβ-(1–40) complex, suggest that TGF-β may enhance fibrillogenesis by generating a conformationally altered form of Aβ-(1–40) with seeding ability. Higher magnification revealed that the Aβ-(1–40) protofibrils were 3–4 nm in width and were composed of a tight helical structure with a periodicity of 2–3 nm based on the coiling of 1 nm wide filaments (Fig. 7, d–f). At this magnification, the tight helical nature of the protofibrils was more evident for Aβ-(1–40) + TGF-β2 than for Aβ-(1–40) + TGF-β1, although further magnification of the Aβ-(1–40) + TGF-β1 sample (Fig. 7e, inset) confirmed the presence of loose helical structures in this sample. This magnification also revealed numerous flexible filaments 1 nm in width in the “interstrand” spaces (data not shown). Interestingly, the morphology of the 3-nm wide helical Aβ-(1–40) protofibrils that predominate in the presence of TGF-β1 and, particularly, TGF-β2 resembles that of in situ amyloid protofibrils obtained using advanced sample preparation methods such as cryofixation and freeze substitution (24Inoue S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 210: 121-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mouse Hippocampal Field CA1 and Dentate Gyrus Lack TGF-β RI Receptors—The hippocampus is a structure particularly vulnerable during amyloid pathology. The increases in amyloid plaque burden that occur following co-treatment of hippocampal slices with Aβ and TGF-βs (12Harris-White M.E. Chu T. Balverde Z. Sigel J.J. Flanders K.C. Frautschy S.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10366-10374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in TGF-β1/hAPP bigenic mice (7Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K. Lin C. Mucke L.

Med. 2001; 7: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) were found to be subfield-specific, indicating the context-dependent nature of TGF-β action. Our observations indicate that TGF-β enhances Aβ-(1–40)-mediated neurotoxicity in a receptor-independent manner. We therefore examined the expression of all three TGF-β receptors within the hippocampal formation to determine if the vulnerability of particular subfields correlates with the pattern of TGF-β receptor expression. Although no TGF-β RI receptor expression was detected in field CA1 and dentate gyrus (Fig. 8A), expression was detectable, albeit weak, in the stratum pyramidale of fields CA2-CA3, while much stronger staining was found in the stratum lucidum of fields CA2-CA3 (Fig. 8C) through to the hilus of the dentate gyrus. TGF-β RII receptors were expressed throughout the hippocampal formation particularly in the stratum pyramidale of fields CA1-CA3 and the strata moleculare and granulosum of the dentate gyrus, with sparse staining also observed in t"
https://openalex.org/W1998091862,"Protein phosphatases regulated by calmodulin (CaM) mediate the action of intracellular Ca2+ and modulate functions of various target proteins by dephosphorylation. In plants, however, the role of Ca2+ in the regulation of protein dephosphorylation is not well understood due to a lack of information on characteristics of CaM-regulated protein phosphatases. Screening of a cDNA library of the moss Physcomitrella patens by using 35S-labeled calmodulin as a ligand resulted in identification of a gene, PCaMPP, that encodes a protein serine/threonine phosphatase with 373 amino acids. PCaMPP had a catalytic domain with sequence similarity to type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) with six conserved metal-associating amino acid residues and also had an extra C-terminal domain. Recombinant GST fusion proteins of PCaMPP exhibited Mn2+-dependent phosphatase activity, and the activity was inhibited by pyrophosphate and 1 mm Ca2+ but not by okadaic acid, orthovanadate, or β-glycerophosphate. Furthermore, the PCaMPP activity was increased 1.7-fold by addition of CaM at nanomolar concentrations. CaM binding assays using deletion proteins and a synthetic peptide revealed that the CaM-binding region resides within the basic amphiphilic amino acid region 324–346 in the C-terminal domain. The CaM-binding region had sequence similarity to amino acids in one of three α-helices in the C-terminal domain of human PP2Cα, suggesting a novel role of the C-terminal domains for the phosphatase activity. These results provide the first evidence showing possible regulation of PP2C-related phosphatases by Ca2+/CaM in plants. Genes similar to PCaMPP were found in genomes of various higher plant species, suggesting that PCaMPP-type protein phosphatases are conserved in land plants. Protein phosphatases regulated by calmodulin (CaM) mediate the action of intracellular Ca2+ and modulate functions of various target proteins by dephosphorylation. In plants, however, the role of Ca2+ in the regulation of protein dephosphorylation is not well understood due to a lack of information on characteristics of CaM-regulated protein phosphatases.

Plants can sense changes in environmental conditions such as light, temperature, and water status as signals and show specific responses. Cytosolic free Ca2+, the level of which is increased by the extracellular signals, has been demonstrated to be an intracellular messenger that regulates cellular processes necessary for the plant responses. Physiological processes such as responses to light, wounding, low temperature, and pathogen attacks have been suggested to be regulated by Ca2+ in plants (1Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M.

Crouch T.H. Richman P.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 489-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, CaM binds to a number of intracellular target proteins and modulates their functions. These target CaM-binding proteins are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions, including metabolism, ion transport, transcription, and signal transduction (6Snedden W.A. Fromm H. New Phytol. 2001; 151: 35-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 7Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Among the CaM-binding proteins, CaM-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases play major roles in diversifying the signals triggered by Ca2+, because these enzymes modify functions of multiple cellular proteins by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. CaM-regulated protein phosphorylation plays pivotal roles in the regulation of signal perception and gene activation, as has been well documented in mammalian neuronal cells (8Klee C.B. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In animals, several classes of CaM-dependent protein kinases, such as phosphorylase kinase, myosin light chain kinase, CaM kinases I, II, and VI, and CaM kinase kinase, are known to exist, whereas only one class of CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, has been reported. Calcineurin, which was identified as a major CaM-binding protein in the brain, is known as type 2B protein Ser/Thr phosphatase (PP2B) and belongs to the PPP family of phosphatases, having a moderate degree of sequence similarity to PP1 and PP2A (9Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 10Kincaid R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 1-23PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In plant systems, protein phosphatases that bind CaM or those regulated by CaM have not been characterized. However, physiological evidence has suggested that some of the Ca2+-dependent cellular processes are regulated by PP2B-like phosphatases. Bovine calcineurin has been shown to modulate the current of the slowly activating vacuolar channel of the stomata guard cell, positively at low concentrations and negatively at higher concentrations (12Allen G.J. Sanders D. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PP2B inhibitor cyclosporin A has been shown to inhibit Ca2+-stimulated phosphatase activity (13Kinoshita T. Shimazaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and enhance phosphorylation of proteins in guard cells (14Li J. Lee Y.R.J. Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Possible involvement of PP2B in the regulation of salt stress in plants has also been suggested. Overexpression of catalytic and regulatory subunits of yeast PP2B in transgenic tobacco resulted in an enhancement of salt tolerance (15Pardo J.M. Reddy M.P. Yang S. Maggio A. Huh G.H. Matsumoto T. Coca M.A. Paino-D'Urzo M. Koiwa H. Yun D.J. Watad A.A. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9681-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Despite this physiological evidence, no PP2B-like genes in plants have been characterized. Complete genome sequencing of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that there are no genes encoding Ser/Thr phosphatase with sequence similarity to the catalytic subunit of PP2B. These facts raise the possibility that plants might possess CaM-regulated protein phosphatases that belong to a different class from that of PP2B. Screening of cDNA expression libraries with labeled CaM as a ligand has been successfully used for isolation of plant genes encoding CaM-binding proteins (6Snedden W.A. Fromm H. New Phytol. 2001; 151: 35-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 16Fromm H. Chua N.-H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Reddy A.S.N. Takezawa D. Fromm H. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Sci. 1993; 94: 109-117Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, genes of protein phosphatases that bind CaM have not been isolated from plants by this method. This could possibly be due to low abundance of mRNA expressed in specific cell types in complex tissue organization. In this study, screening with 35S-labeled CaM was carried out using a library made from protonema tissues of the moss Physcomitrella patens, which has relatively uniform cells with simple structures. One of the isolated clones, designated PCaMPP, encoded a protein with similarity to the type 2C protein Ser/Thr phosphatases (PP2Cs). PP2Cs belong to the PPM family of Ser/Thr phosphatases, which are distinct from PP1, PP2A, or PP2B and are present in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including animals, yeast, and plants (9Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). PP2Cs are postulated to be monomeric enzymes, and their regulation by other protein molecules is not well understood. Thus, characterization of PCaMPP may lead to understanding of unidentified regulatory mechanisms for PP2C-related protein phosphatases by CaM. In this study, recombinant proteins of PCaMPP were produced, and interaction with CaM and regulation of the phosphatase activity were examined. Plant Material—Protonema tissues of the moss P. patens were grown at 25 °C under continuous light (60 μmol m-2 s-1) on agar plates as described by Minami et al. (18Minami A. Nagao M. Arakawa K. Fujikawa S. Takezawa D. J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 160: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CaMs—Bovine CaM was purchased from Sigma. Potato CaMs PCM1 and -6 (19Takezawa D. Liu Z.H. An G. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were expressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography as described by Poovaiah et al. (20Poovaiah B.W. Takezawa D. An G. Han T.-J. J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 149: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The MsCaM gene was isolated from 8-day-old seedlings of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) by reverse transcriptase-PCR using 5′-ATGGCNGAYATHCTNTC-3′ and 5′-CGAACTGTCATCATCATCTTGAC-3′. The MsCaM protein was expressed in E. coli by using a TOPO101 expression system (catalog number 45-1072, Invitrogen) and purified by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. Screening with Labeled CaMs—Potato calmodulins PCM1 and PCM6 were labeled with [35S]methionine as described by Fromm and Chua (16Fromm H. Chua N.-H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The λZAP cDNA library of P. patens protonemata was used for screening by using 35S-labeled PCM1 and PCM6 as ligands. Positive clones detected by autoradiography were selected and subjected to a second or third round of screening. Plasmids were prepared from phage clones by an in vivo excision protocol, and nucleotide sequences were determined. The genomic DNA corresponding to the PCaMPP cDNA was obtained by PCR using oligonucleotides, 5′-GTTGCAACGCAAGTGAGCCGTCAG-3′ and 5′-CGTATTCACTGACGGAAATTTAAC-3′, comprising 5′- and 3′-end sequences of the PCaMPP cDNA, respectively. The nucleotide sequence was determined by direct sequencing using the amplified DNA as a template. Constructs for Recombinant Proteins—GST fusion proteins of PCaMPP were prepared by using pGEX-2TK vectors (Amersham Biosciences). Constructs for making deletion proteins were made by PCR using oligonucleotide primers with a BglII (AGATCT) or BamHI (GGATCC) site for N-terminal deletions and an EcoRI (GAATTC) site for C-terminal deletions. The amplified fragments were fused in-frame to the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2TK plasmid. The oligonucleotide pairs used for making deletion constructs were 5′-GAGGGATCCGCAAAGAACATCGTCAAG-3′/5′-GCAAGGAATTCATCACCATCATTTGCTTTC-3′ for GST-PCaMPP-(291–336), 5′-GAGGGATCCGCAAAGAACATCGTCAAG-3′/5′-CCAGAACGAATTCCTTTTTTGGACCGTGTG-3′ for GST-PCaMPP-(291–348), 5′-GTCGAGATCTTTCGCACCAGCAGTC-3′/5′-GATCCAGAATTCGTTGTCCATC-3′ for GST-PCaMPP-(324–373), and 5′-GTCGGATCCCAAATGATGGTGATGAGATTC-3′/5′-GATCCAGAATTCGTTGTCCATC-3′ for GST-PCaMPP-(332–373). A histidine tag (His tag) was added to the fusion constructs by ligation of phosphorylated oligonucleotides, 5′-GTCAGCCATCATCACCATCACCATTG-3′ and 5′-AATTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGGCTAGC-3′, to the C-terminal end of the PCaMPP coding region to make the construct for GST-PCaMPPh. Site-directed mutagenesis of the PCaMPP active site was carried out by PCR mutagenesis using 5′-CTGCGGATCCATTATGACTGGCCAAAACCG-3′ for PCaMPP(G92A/D-93S)h and 5′-CTGCGGATCCATCATGACCGTC-3′ for PCaMPP(N95D)h. Expression of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli—E. coli cells harboring the plasmids of various constructs of PCaMPP were grown at 37 °C in the LB medium until the A 600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to the culture, and the proteins were expressed by further incubation at 16 °C for 10–16 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in TE (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm EDTA), and stored at -80 °C. Column Chromatography—Ni2+ affinity chromatography was carried out using a His-bind purification kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. CaM-agarose chromatography was carried out essentially as described previously (21Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The proteins in a column-loading buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 1 mm CaCl2 were loaded onto a column of CaM-agarose (P4385, Sigma). After washing with the same buffer twice, the column was further washed twice with the same buffer as that described above but containing 500 mm NaCl. The column was again equilibrated with the loading buffer and then developed with elution buffer containing 2.5 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. The purified proteins were collected and concentrated by using Ultrafree microfiltration units (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Glycerol was added to 25% (w/v), and the proteins were stored at -80 °C. Biotinylated CaM Binding Assays—Proteins produced by plaques on agar plates were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action. The bacterially expressed recombinant proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated for 1 h in a binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then incubated with biotinylated CaM (catalog number 208697, Calbiochem) in the same solution for 2.5 h. The membranes were washed in the binding buffer three times for 5 min each time and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. After washing three times using the binding buffer, the bound biotinylated calmodulin was detected by nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate reagents in alkaline phosphate buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), 10 mm MgCl2 and NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2). Peptide Binding Assay on Non-denaturing Polyacrylamide Gel—CaM (50 pmol) and various amounts of a synthetic peptide were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2. The mixture was loaded on a 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The lower gel contained 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and the upper gel contained 0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) as buffers, and both of the gels were supplemented with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Electrophoresis was carried out at 120 V for 2.5 h in a buffer containing 0.02 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, and either 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. CaMs and CaM-peptide complexes were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein Phosphatase Assays—Protein phosphatase activity was determined by using myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or Abl tyrosine kinase and casein-phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII). To prepare Ser/Thr-phosphorylated MBP, 500 μg of MBP (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was phosphorylated using 25 units of PKA (P2645, Sigma) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm unlabeled ATP, and 1.85 MBq [α-32P]ATP. To prepare Tyr-phosphorylated MBP, a protein phosphatase assay system (catalog number P0785S, New England Biolabs) was used. Casein (C8032, Sigma) was phosphorylated using 2500 units of CKII (catalog number P6010S, New England Biolabs) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm unlabeled ATP, and 1.85 MBq [γ-32P]ATP. All the phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 30 °C overnight. The phosphorylated MBP and casein were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid at 10% (w/v) and collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were solubilized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.01%(w/v) Brij35. The proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.01% (w/v) Brij35 and used as substrates. Phosphatase assays were carried out using 20–50 ng of the purified recombinant enzyme and 5 μg of 32P-labeled protein substrates in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 0.01% Brij35 in a 25-μl reaction volume with or without various effectors. The enzyme reactions were carried out at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 100 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were subjected to scintillation counting to determine radioactive phosphate (32Pi) released during the phosphatase reaction. Characterization of the CaM-binding Protein Similar to PP2C—A cDNA library of P. patens was used for screening with 35S-CaM to isolate genes encoding CaM-binding proteins. The screening resulted in identification of a clone that showed strong binding to 35S-labeled plant CaMs, which was further confirmed by CaM binding assays using biotinylated bovine CaM. Sequence analysis of the isolated clone revealed that it encoded a protein of 373 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 40.2 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the protein was found to have the highest similarity to a gene product of A. thaliana registered as phosphatase 2C-like protein (GenBank™ accession number AF419561). The sequence also had moderate sequence similarity to other plant, yeast, and animal PP2Cs. Thus, the protein was designated Physcomitrella CaM-binding protein phosphatase (PCaMPP). Alignment of amino acid sequences of PCaMPP and human PP2Cα revealed moderate degrees of similarity (Fig. 1). Eukaryotic PP2Cs are known to possess conserved amino acid residues associating with divalent metals such as Mg2+ and Mn2+ as revealed by analysis of the crystal structure of human PP2Cα (22Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although amino acid identity of the presumed catalytic domains of human PP2Cα (amino acids 2–290) and the corresponding region of PCaMPP (amino acids 29–316) was only 22%, all of the metal-associating residues corresponding to Glu-37, Asp-38, Asp-60, Gly-61, Asp-239, and Asp-282 of human PP2Cα were conserved in PCaMPP (Fig. 1, open arrowheads). PCaMPP also possessed other highly conserved amino acids such as the residues corresponding to Thr-128, Gly-145, Gly-198, Val-221, and Gly-240 of human PP2Cα. CaM Binding Analyses of PCaMPP—In order to examine CaM-binding properties of PCaMPP, a GST fusion protein with the PCaMPP coding region (GST-PCaMPP-(373)) was expressed in E. coli and used for CaM binding assays. Fig. 3 shows that the expressed protein binds to CaM in the presence of Ca2+ but not in the presence of EGTA. The Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to GST-PCaMPP-(373) was dramatically reduced when a 50-fold excess amount of unlabeled CaM was present. In order to identify the CaM-binding region of PCaMPP, various PCaMPP deletion proteins were expressed in E. coli and used for CaM binding assays. CaM binding assays of the C-terminal deletion proteins revealed that GST-PCaMPP-(347) bound to CaM but that GST-PCaMPP-(336) did not, indicating that the CaM-binding region is present in the C-terminal domain of PCaMPP (Fig. 2).Fig. 2CaM binding assays of GST fusion proteins of PCaMPP. A, schematic representation of the constructs of GST-PCaMPP-(373), GST-PCaMPP-(348), and GST-PCaMPP-(336). The PCaMPP catalytic domain (c) and the C-terminal domain (hatched box) are indicated. B, results of CaM binding assays of GST-PCaMPP proteins. Lysates of control E. coli cells (lane 1) and cells carrying GST-PCaMPP-(373) (lane 2), GST-PCaMPP-(348) (lane 3), and GST-PCaMPP-(336) (lane 4) were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize total proteins (left) or transferred onto PVDF membranes (right panels). The membranes were incubated with 35S-labeled CaM (1 μg ml-1) in the presence of either 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm CaCl2 (Ca2 +), or 0.5 mm CaCl2 plus 50 μg ml-1 of unlabeled bovine CaM (Ca2 + + CaM). Positions of molecular mass markers are shown in kDa on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further deletion analysis of the PCaMPP C-terminal domain revealed that GST-PCaMPP-(324–373) and GST-PCaMPP-(291–348) bound to CaM, whereas GST-PCaMPP-(332–373) and GST-PCaMPP-(291–336) did not (Fig. 3, A and B). The CaM binding of GST-PCaMPP-(324–373) and GST-PCaMPP-(291–348) was Ca2+-dependent and was dramatically reduced in the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled CaM. These results indicated that the CaM-binding region of PCaMPP is present between amino acids 324 and 348. The results of CaM-agarose binding tests indicated that both GST-PCaMPP-(324–373) and GST-PCaMPP-(291–348) bound CaM-agarose in the presence of Ca2+, which were eluted out by a buffer containing 2.5 mm EGTA (Fig. 3C). CaM Binding Assays Using a Synthetic Peptide—To confirm CaM binding to the PCaMPP C-terminal domain identified by deletion analyses, a synthetic peptide, CBPep-1, having the same amino acid sequence as that of PCaMPP-(320–346) was used for a CaM-mobility shift assay on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4). CBPep-1 has a basic and hydrophobic character commonly found in a number of CaM-binding sequences of other proteins (Fig. 4A). In a non-denaturing gel with pH 8.8, bovine CaM that has acidic charges was mobilized toward the anode. Electrophoresis in the presence of Ca2+ showed that the mobility of CaM in the non-denaturing gel was shifted toward the cathode by the addition of increasing amounts of CBPep-1 (Fig. 4B). The mobility shift by CBPep-1 was not observed when the electrophoresis was carried out in the presence of 2 mm EGTA instead of Ca2+. The mobility shift assays using different plant CaM isoforms, PCM6, PCM1, and MsCaM, with CBPep-1 indicated that all of the CaM isoforms tested bound CBPep-1 in a similar manner to binding by bovine CaM (Fig. 4C). Phosphatase Activity of PCaMPP—Recombinant GST fusion proteins of PCaMPP were used for protein phosphatase assays in order to determine enzymatic properties of PCaMPP. MBP phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or Abl tyrosine kinase (AblK) and casein phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) were used as substrates. GST-PCaMPPh, with an extra C-terminal His tag, was used for phosphatase assays, because the His-tagged enzyme was apparently less vulnerable to degradation during the expression in bacteria and the protein purification was further facilitated by Ni2+-affinity chromatography (Fig. 5A). The phosphatase assays using different substrates revealed that GST-PCaMPPh has activity toward PKA-phosphorylated MBP. However, it had very little activity toward CKII-phosphorylated casein or AblK-phosphorylated MBP (data not shown). Thus, the PKA-phosphorylated MBP was used for the subsequent experiments. To determine divalent cation dependence of GST-PCaMPPh, the effects of Mg2+ and Mn2+ on the phosphatase activity were examined. Fig. 5B shows Mn2+-dependent activation of the GST-PCaMPPh. The activation occurred at an Mn2+ concentration as low as 0.1 mm and was nearly saturated at concentrations above 1 mm. In contrast, Mg2+ up to 5 mm had no effect on GST-PCaMPP phosphatase activity (data not shown). Eukaryotic protein phosphatases can be distinguished by their sensitivities to various organic and inorganic inhibitors. PPM family phosphatases (i.e. PP2Cs) that are insensitive to okadaic acid can be distinguished from the PPP family phosphatases (i.e. PP1, PP2A, and PP2B) that are sensitive. Thus, possible inhibitors of protein phosphatases, okadaic acid (1 and 5 μm), orthovanadate (1 mm), β-glycerophosphate (12.5 mm), and pyrophosphate (5 mm), were used for phosphatase assays to determine enzymatic properties of GST-PCaMPPh. The results of the assays revealed that pyrophosphate had an inhibitory effect on the Mn2+-dependent phosphatase activity (Fig. 5C). The activity was also inhibited by a high concentration (1 mm) of Ca2+, which antagonizes the effect of Mn2+. Effect of Mutations in the Putative Active Site—To examine the catalytic function of PCaMPP, two constructs for mutations in the putative active site were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 6A). In the mutant GST-PCaMPP(D92A/G93S)h, the residues Asp-92 and Gly-93 were replaced by Ala and Ser, respectively. Both Asp and Gly in these positions are highly conserved in known eukaryotic PP2Cs, and the replacement of these residues was expected to cause a great disturbance in the active site (22Das A.K.

A. 1998; 95: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In another mutant GST-PCaMPP(N95D)h, Asn-95 was replaced with Asp-95. This N95D mutation was thought to have a milder effect because other PP2Cs do not possess strictly conserved residues in the corresponding position; for example, it is typically Ala in mammalian PP2Cs and Gly in plant PP2Cs. However, it has been shown that replacement with Asp in this position in ABI1 and ABI2 PP2Cs in Arabidopsis mutants causes abscisic acid-insensitive phenotypes (24Leung J. Bouvier-Durand M. Morris P.-C. Guerrier D. Chefdor F. Giraudat J. Science. 1994; 246: 1448-1452Crossref Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 25Meyer K. Leube M.P. Grill E. Science. 1994; 246: 1452-1455Crossref Scopus (602) Google Scholar), indicating that the residue is biologically critical. These mutant proteins, as well as wild-type GST-PCaMPPh, were expressed in E. coli and purified by CaM-affinity chromatography (Fig. 6B). Protein phosphatase assays using these enzymes revealed that the mutants had reduced activity compared with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6C), indicating that PCaMPP has an active site similar to those of other eukaryotic PP2Cs. D92A/G93S double mutation appeared to have a much more severe effect than an N95D single mutation. Effect of CaM on the Phosphatase Activity—The effect of CaM on the GST-PCaMPPh activity was examined using different concentrations of bovine CaM. The reaction was carried out in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+, which alone did not have any effect on the activity. As shown in Fig. 7A, CaM at nanomolar concentrations significantly increased the phosphatase activity of GST-PCaMPPh. This increase was as much as 1.7-fold by saturating CaM concentrations (>0.4 μm), and the CaM concentration needed for half-maximal activation was ∼0.1 μm. The enhancement of the phosphatase activity by CaM was reversed by addition of"

In this study, a ribozyme variant was used to target the overlapping region of the mRNAs encoding human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major transcription regulatory proteins IE1 and IE2. The variant is about 90 times more efficient in cleaving the IE1/IE2 mRNA sequence in vitro than the ribozyme derived from the wild type RNase P ribozyme. Our results provide the first direct evidence that a point mutation at nucleotide position 80 of RNase P catalytic RNA from Escherichia coli (U80→ C80) increases the rate of chemical cleavage, and another mutation at nucleotide position 188 (C188→ U188) enhances substrate binding of the ribozyme. Moreover, the variant is more effective in inhibiting viral IE1 and IE2 expression and growth in HCMV-infected cells than the wild type ribozyme. A reduction of about 99% in the expression level of IE1 and IE2 and a reduction of 10,000-fold in viral growth were observed in cells that expressed the variant. In contrast, a reduction of less than 10% in IE1/IE2 expression and viral growth was observed in cells that either did not express the ribozyme or produced a catalytically inactive ribozyme mutant. Thus, engineered RNase P ribozyme variants are highly effective in inhibiting HCMV gene expression and growth. These results also demonstrate the feasibility of engineering highly effective RNase P ribozymes for gene targeting applications, including anti-HCMV gene therapy.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; IE, immediate-early; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; TK, thymidine kinase. causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised or immunologically immature individuals, including neonates and AIDS patients (1Mocarski E.S.

Lippincott-Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2675-2706Google Scholar). The emergence of drug-resistant strains of HCMV has posed a need for the development of new drugs and novel treatment strategies. RNA enzymes are being developed as promising gene-targeting agents to specifically cleave RNA sequences of choice (3Rossi J.J. Chem.

Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2407-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These ribozymes contain both a catalytic RNA domain that cleaves the target mRNA and a substrate-binding domain with a sequence antisense to the target mRNA sequence. Therefore, these gene-targeting ribozymes bind to the mRNA sequence through Watson-Crick interactions between the target sequence and the antisense sequence in the substrate-binding domain of the ribozyme. Compared with conventional antisense DNA and RNA, a ribozyme may have several unique features as it can cleave its target irreversibly, and multiple copies of its substrate can be cleaved by a single ribozyme molecule. Both hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes have been shown to cleave viral mRNA sequences and inhibit viral replication in cells infected with human viruses, whereas a ribozyme derived from a group I intron has been used to repair mutant mRNAs in cells (5zu Putlitz J.

Thus, ribozymes can be used as a tool in both basic research and clinical applications, such as in studies of developmental processes and in antiviral gene therapy (3Rossi J.J. Chem.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It catalyzes a hydrolysis reaction to remove a 5′ leader sequence from tRNA precursors (pre-tRNA) and several small RNAs. In Escherichia coli, RNase P consists of a catalytic RNA subunit (M1 RNA) of 377 nucleotides and a protein subunit (C5 protein) of 119 amino acids (9Altman S. Kirsebom L.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R.

Under certain buffer conditions, such as 100 mm Mg2+, M1 RNA acts as a catalyst and cleaves pre-tRNAs in vitro in the absence of C5 protein (11Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Extensive phylogenetic and biochemical analyses have provided significant insight into understanding the secondary structure (12Haas E.S. Brown J.W. Pitulle C. Pace N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These studies serve as a foundation for identifying the putative active site and substrate-binding site and for investigating the catalytic mechanism of this ribozyme. Studies on substrate recognition by M1 RNA and RNase P have led to the development of a general strategy in which M1 RNA and RNase P can be used as gene targeting tools to cleave any specific mRNA sequences (18Forster A.C. Altman S. Science. 1990; 249: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). One of the unique features of RNase P holoenzyme and its catalytic RNA is their ability to recognize the structures, rather than the sequences of their substrates, which gives them the ability to hydrolyze different natural substrates in vivo or in vitro. Thus, M1 ribozyme can cleave an mRNA substrate as long as the target sequence hybridizes with its complementary sequence (designated as external guide sequence) to form a complex resembling the portion of a tRNA molecule that includes the acceptor stem, the T-stem, the 3′ CCA sequence, and the 5′ leader sequence (18Forster A.C. Altman S. Science. 1990; 249: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 19) (Fig. 1A). A sequence-specific ribozyme, M1GS RNA, can be constructed by covalently linking a guide sequence to the 3′ terminus of M1 RNA (20Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Cobaleda C. Sanchez-Garcia I. Blood. 2000; 95: 731-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Frank D. Harris M. Pace N.R.

We have shown previously that M1GS ribozymes cleaved the mRNA sequence encoding the thymidine kinase(TK) of herpes simplex virus type 1 in vitro and inhibited TK expression in herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cells (20Liu F.

A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was constructed to target the mRNA coding for HCMV IE1 and IE2, the major transcription regulatory proteins required for viral gene expression and growth (1Mocarski E.S.

A reduction of 80% in the expression of IE1 and IE2 and a reduction of 150-fold in viral growth were observed in HCMV-infected cells that expressed the ribozyme (23Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Targeted cleavage of mRNA by RNase P ribozyme provides a unique approach to inactivate any RNA of known sequence expressed in vivo. In order to develop this ribozyme for practical use both as a research tool and as a therapeutic agent for gene-targeting applications, further studies are needed to improve M1GS RNA catalytic efficiency in vitro and its efficacy in vivo. By using an in vitro selection procedure, we have recently isolated M1GS ribozyme variants that are more efficient in cleaving a specific mRNA sequence (i.e. TK mRNA) than that derived from the wild type M1 RNA (26Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we used one of these ribozyme variants to target the HCMV IE1 and IE2 mRNA sequence, and we investigated its activity in cleaving the target mRNA in vitro and its efficacy in inhibiting IE1 and IE2 gene expression and viral growth in cultured cells. Our results indicate that the ribozyme derived from the selected variant is at least 90 times more efficient in cleaving the target HCMV mRNA sequence in vitro than the ribozyme derived from the wild type M1 RNA sequence. Biochemical characterization of the variant indicates that a point mutation at nucleotide position 80 of M1 RNA (U80→ C80) increases the rate of chemical cleavage, and another mutation at nucleotide position 188 (C188→ U188) enhances substrate binding of the ribozyme. These results provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of how RNase P ribozyme efficiently cleaves an mRNA substrate and generate guidelines for construction of highly active M1GS ribozymes for gene-targeting applications. The constructed ribozyme variant is also more effective in inhibiting IE1 and IE2 expression and HCMV growth in cultured cells. A reduction of 99% in the expression of IE1 and IE2 and a reduction of 10,000-fold in HCMV growth were observed in cells that expressed the ribozyme variant. These results provide the direct evidence that engineered RNase P ribozyme variants can be highly effective in inhibiting HCMV gene expression and growth. More importantly, our study demonstrates the feasibility of developing effective RNase P ribozymes for gene-targeting applications, including the treatment and prevention of HCMV infections. Antibodies, Viruses, and Cells—The monoclonal antibodies against human actin and HCMV gH were purchased from Sigma and Biodesign, Inc., respectively. The monoclonal antibodies c1202, c1203, and c1205, which react with HCMV proteins UL44, IE1/IE2, and UL83, respectively, were purchased from the Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research (Plantation, FL). Human foreskin fibroblasts and astrocytoma U373MG cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HCMV (strain AD169) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and was propagated in human foreskin fibroblasts and U373MG cells. Generation of Ribozyme and Substrate Constructs—Plasmid pFL117, pR27, and pC102, which contain the DNA sequences encoding M1 RNA, variant R27, and mutant C102, respectively, have been described previously (26Kilani A.F. Trang P. Jo S. Hsu A. Kim J. Nepomuceno E. Liou K. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10611-10622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA (New York). 1997; 3: 613-623PubMed Google Scholar). Variant constructs pV80 and pV188 were generated by changing U80→ C80 and C188→ U188 in the M1 sequence of pFL117, respectively. C102 contains several point mutations (e.g. A347C348→ C347U348, C353C354C355G356→ G353G354A355U356) at the catalytic domain (P4 helix) of the M1 RNA sequence (30Kim J.J. Kilani A.F. Zhan X. Altman S. Liu F. RNA (New York). 1997; 3: 613-623PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequences that encode ribozymes M1-IE, R27-IE, V80-IE, V188-IE, and C-IE were constructed by PCR using pFL117, pR27, pV80, pV188, and pC102 as the templates, respectively, with OliT7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) as the 5′ primer and M1IE12 (5′-TGGTGCAACGAGAACCCTGTGGAATTG-3′) as the 3′ primer. Similarly, the DNA sequences that encode C-R27-IE, C-V80-IE, and C-V188-IE were generated by PCR using oligonucleotide AF25 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) as the 5′ primer, oligonucleotide M1IE12 as the 3′ primer, C-R27, C-V80, and C-V188 DNAs as the templates, respectively. The DNA template for the in vitro transcription of RNA substrate ie37 was constructed by annealing the T7 promoter-containing oligonucleotide OliT7 with oligonucleotide sIE1 (5′-CGGGATCCTTTCTCGGGGTTCTCGTTGCGATCCTCGGTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′). The DNA that codes for ie37-3 was generated by PCR to replace the entire 12-nucleotide-long 3′ tail sequence of ie37 with a thymidine nucleotide. The DNA sequences that code for RNA substrates ie37-5 and ie37-3 were constructed by PCR using oligonucleotide sIE1 as the template, OliT7 as the 5′ primer, and oligonucleotides oliie37-5 (5′-CGGGATCCTTTCTCGGGGTTCTCGTTGCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′) and oliie37-3 (5′-AGGGTTCTCGT-3′) as the 3′ primers, respectively. Construction of Retroviral Plasmids and Ribozyme-expressing Cells—Retroviral constructs RvM1-IE, RvC-IE, RvC-V188-IE, RvC-R27-IE, RvV188-IE, and RvR27-IE were constructed by placing the DNA sequences that code for M1-IE, C-IE, C-V188-IE, C-R27-IE, V188-IE, and R27-IE under the control of the U6 promoter in the LXSN retroviral vector, respectively (20Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). To generate cell lines containing the M1GS-retroviral DNA sequence, the retroviral vector DNAs that contain the ribozyme sequence were transfected into amphotropic PA317 cells by using a mammalian transfection kit (Invitrogen). At 48 h post-transfection, culture supernatants that contained retroviral vector particles were collected and used to infect human U373MG cells. At 48–72 h postinfection, neomycin (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 600 μg/ml. Cells were subsequently selected in the presence of neomycin for 2 weeks, and neomycin-resistant cells were cloned (20Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). The level of M1GS RNA expression in individual cell clones was determined by Northern analysis with a probe complementary to the M1 RNA sequence. Only those cell clones that expressed similar levels of ribozymes were used for subsequent experiments. Viral Infection and Assays for Viral Gene Expression and Growth— 5 × 105 cells were either mock-infected or infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.05–1 as described previously (23Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The infected cells were incubated for a certain period of time (as stated under the “Results”) before they were harvested for viral mRNA or protein isolation. Total cellular RNA and protein samples were prepared from the cells as described previously (23Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Liu F. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5149-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the levels of viral immediate-early (IE) transcripts, some of the cells were also treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide prior to and during infection. To determine the mRNA expression using Northern analyses, the RNA fractions were separated in 1–2.5% agarose gels that contained formaldehyde, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, hybridized with the 32P-radiolabeled DNA probes containing the HCMV DNA sequence, and analyzed with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. The radiolabeled DNA probes used to detect M1GS RNAs, actin mRNA, HCMV immediate-early 5-kb RNA transcript, IE1 mRNA, IE2 mRNA, and US2 mRNA were synthesized from plasmids pFL117, pβ-actin RNA, pCig27, pIE1, pIE2, and pCig38, respectively, by using a random primed labeling kit (Roche Applied Bioscience) (23Trang P.

A. 1997; 94: 13985-13990Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The viral 5-kb RNA was transcribed from the region covering HCMV open reading frames between UL106 and UL110 (33Zhu H. Cong J.P. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13985-13990Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). 2H. Zhu, H. Zou, A. F. Kilani, P. Trang, and F. Liu, unpublished results. To examine the protein expression using Western analyses, the denatured polypeptides from cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels cross-linked with N,N″-methylenebisacrylamide, transferred electrically to nitrocellulose membranes, and reacted in an enzyme-linked immunoassay with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase in addition to the antibodies against human actin and HCMV IE1/IE2, UL44, UL83, and gH. The membranes were subsequently stained with a chemiluminescent substrate with the aid of a Western chemiluminescent substrate kit (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. Quantitation was performed in the linear range of RNA and protein detection. To determine the efficacy of the ribozymes in inhibiting viral growth, 5 × 105 cells were infected with HCMV at an m.o.i. of 0.5–2. The cells and medium were harvested at 1-day intervals through 7 days postinfection, and viral stocks were prepared by adding an equal volume of 10% skim milk, followed by sonication. The titers of the viral stocks were determined by infecting 1 × 105 human foreskin fibroblasts and counting the number of plaques 10–14 days postinfection. The values obtained were the average from triplicate experiments. It has been shown that cloned U373MG cells exhibit clonal variability in their susceptibility to HCMV infection (1Mocarski E.S. Courcelle C.T. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2629-2673Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the observed inhibition of viral gene expression and growth is due to the variability of the particular cloned U373MG cells used in the experiments rather than the ribozyme-mediated inhibition, two additional sets of cloned cells that expressed different ribozymes were used to assay the efficacy of the ribozymes in inhibiting HCMV gene expression and growth. Moreover, three additional cloned cell lines that expressed each of the ribozymes were mixed and used as the oligoclonal cell populations. The antiviral efficacies of this set of oligoclonal cell populations were also determined. Single Turnover Kinetic Analyses of in Vitro Cleavage Reactions— The cleavage reactions of substrate ie37 by different ribozymes were carried out in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 100 mm MgCl2), and single turnover kinetic analyses to determine the values of the observed cleavage rate (k obs) were performed as described previously (26Kilani A.F.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12042-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Analyses were performed with a trace amount of radioactive substrate and an excess of ribozyme. The concentration of radioactive substrate was less than 0.01 nm, and the concentrations of ribozyme tested ranged from 0.05 to 5 nm. Variations in the amount of substrate did not affect the observed cleavage rate (k obs) at a fixed excess ribozyme concentration, and the reaction followed pseudo first-order kinetics. Pseudo first-order rate constants of cleavage (k obs) were assayed at each ribozyme concentration by the slope of a plot –ln((Ft – Fe)/(1 – Fe)) versus time using a Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Ft and Fe represent the fraction of the substrate at time t and the end point (>10 h) of the experiments, respectively. The values of the overall cleavage rate (k cat/Km) s were calculated by the slope of a least squares linear regression (Kaleidagraph) of a plot of the values of k obs versus the concentrations of the ribozymes (26Kilani A.F.

Determination of Binding Dissociation Constant (Kd) and Apparent Reaction Rate Constant kapp—The procedures to measure the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of complexes of the ribozymes and the substrates were modified from Pyle et al.

In brief, various concentrations of M1GS RNAs were preincubated in buffer E (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 100 mm CaCl2, 3% glycerol, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) for 10 min before mixing with an equal volume of different concentrations of substrate RNA preheated under identical conditions. The samples were incubated for 10–120 min to allow binding, then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and run at 10 watts. The electrophoresis running buffer contained 100 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2 (35Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The values were the average of three experiments. The experimental procedures to determine the apparent reaction rate constant k app were carried out as described previously (26Kilani A.F. Trang P.

In brief, equimolar amounts of substrates and ribozymes were incubated in buffer B (16.6 mm PIPES, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm CaCl2) at 37 °C for 10 min to allow binding. After binding, the bound ribozyme-substrate complexes were separated from the unbound substrates using G-50 Sephadex gel filtration columns (Roche Applied Science). The eluted samples were examined in 5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels for the presence of labeled ribozyme-substrate complexes, and the concentrations of the complexes were quantitated by a STORM840 PhosphorImager. Ribozyme-substrate complexes were then diluted in different concentrations (2–70 nm) and incubated in buffer C (16.6 mm PIPES, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn from reaction mixtures at regular intervals (from 0 to 160 min). The cleavage products were separated on 15% denaturing gels, autoradiographed, and quantitated with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. The apparent rate constant, k app, was calculated by the slope of the plot of ln(S 0/St) versus time, where S0 equals the initial substrate concentration and St equals the substrate concentration at a given time point. The values obtained were the average of three experiments. Engineered RNase P Ribozymes Are Efficient in Cleaving the IE1/IE2 mRNA Sequence—IE1 and IE2, which are the viral immediate early (IE or α) gene products and share 85 amino-terminal amino acids due to alternative splicing and polyadenylation of transcripts initiating at a strong promoter-enhancer (1Mocarski E.S.

Therefore, targeting the overlapping region (e.g. exons 1–3) of the mRNAs coding for IE1 and IE2 should simultaneously shut down the expression of both proteins and may yield more effective inhibition of viral replication. Choosing a target region that is accessible to binding of M1GS ribozymes is important in order to achieve efficient targeting. This is because most mRNA species inside cells are associated with proteins and are present in folded conformations. We have used an in vivo mapping approach with dimethyl sulfate (20Liu F. Altman S.

It is unknown whether lumazine synthase of A. aeolicus can form a similar heterooligomeric complex. A hypothetical reaction mechanism for lumazine synthase is shown in Fig. 2 (2Kis K. Volk R. Bacher A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5-amino group of the pyrimidine derivative 2 is believed to react with the carbonyl group of compound 1, and the resulting Schiff base 5 then eliminates orthophosphate. Ketoenol tautomerization of the resulting intermediate 7 is followed by ring closure via intramolecular condensation, affording 9. The final reaction step could be the elimination of water from the covalent hydrate 9 followed by protonation of the resulting lumazine anion 10 (compare Fig. 3).Fig. 3Anionic species of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (3Kis K.

J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the Schiff base intermediate 5 is believed to be bound in an extended conformation. Thus, a rotation of the position 5 side chain of one of the proposed intermediates 5 or 6 must precede the formation of the pyrazine ring. Presteady state kinetics of lumazine synthase of B. subtilis have been studied in some detail (17Schramek N. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The most salient feature of those studies was a transient species with an absorbance maximum at 455 nm. In an earlier stopped flow study with lumazine synthase of E. coli (18Zheng Y.-J. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 28: 89-97Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the absorption of that reaction intermediate had been assigned to the final reaction product 3 as a consequence of insufficient instrumentation. Lumazine synthase from the hyperthermophilic eubacterium A. aeolicus is stable and catalytically active at temperatures up to at least 90 °C (5Zhang X. Meining W. Fischer M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1099-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Meining W. Mörtl S. Fischer M. Cushman M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of the protein in conjunction with the favorable spectroscopic properties of certain reaction intermediates prompted a presteady state kinetic analysis over a wide range of temperatures. Materials—3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate was prepared from ribose 5-phosphate using recombinant 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase (19Richter G. Krieger C. Volk R. Kis K. Ritz H. Götze E. Bacher A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 5-Nitro-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (20Cresswell R.M. Wood H.C.S. J. Chem.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were synthesized by published procedures. 5-Amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione was freshly prepared as described (11Bacher A. Baur R. Eggers U. Harders H.D. Otto M.K. Schnepple H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 632-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme Purification—Recombinant lumazine synthase of A. aeolicus was purified by published procedures (5Zhang X. Meining W. Fischer M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1099-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assay—Catalytic activity of lumazine synthase was determined as described elsewhere (22Fischer M. Haase I. Kis K. Meining W. Ladenstein R. Cushman M. Schramek N. Huber R. Bacher A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Dialysis—Equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed as published elsewhere (23Fischer M. Haase I. Feicht R. Richter G. Gerhardt S. Changeux J.-P. Huber R. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Single Turnover Experiments—Stopped flow experiments were performed with an SFM4/QS apparatus from Bio-Logic (Claix, France) equipped with a linear array of three mixers and four independent syringes. The content of a 1.5-mm light path quartz cuvette behind the last mixer was monitored with a Tidas diode array spectrophotometer (200–610 nm) equipped with a 15-watt deuterium lamp as light source (J&M Analytische Messund Regeltechnik, Aalen, Germany). The enzyme solution was mixed with substrate solution at different temperatures at a ratio of 1:1 with a total flow rate of 4 ml s–1. At that flow rate, the calculated dead time is 7.6 ms. Optical spectra integrated over 100 ms were recorded at intervals of 100 ms in the wavelength range of 240–500 nm. Global Analysis of Stopped Flow Data—Prior to numerical analysis, the data were corrected for absorbance of buffer and enzyme by subtraction of a blank data set obtained without addition of substrate. Data reduction and stronger weighting of early spectra were achieved by extracting 300 spectra on a pseudo-logarithmic time base from the difference data sets. These data sets were then analyzed using the program SPECFIT/32 3.0.32 (Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA). Under steady state conditions at 37 °C, lumazine synthase of A. aeolicus was found to obey Lineweaver-Burke kinetics over a wide concentration range (data not shown). The catalytic rate at 37 °C is 31 nmol mg–1 min–1, and the Km values for 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (2) and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (1) are 10 and 26 μm, respectively. The enzyme is catalytically active up to temperatures of at least 90 °C and obeys a linear Arrhenius relationship with remarkable accuracy (24Haase I. Mortl S. Kohler P. Bacher A. Fischer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The enzyme product, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (3), binds relatively tightly to A. aeolicus lumazine synthase (KD = 70 μm at pH 7.0 and 4 °C) as shown by equilibrium dialysis (data not shown). Binding is accompanied by a major change of the optical spectrum of the bound ligand. Although 3 in aqueous solution at neutral pH shows absorption maxima at 408 and 256 nm with a shoulder at 276 nm, the difference spectrum of 3 bound to lumazine synthase of A. aeolicus shows absorption maxima at 379 and 317 nm with a shoulder at 307 nm (Fig. 4A). Rapid mixing of A. aeolicus lumazine synthase with the pyrimidine substrate 2 at 15 °C afforded the series of optical spectra shown in Fig. 5, which are characterized by a rapid decrease of absorption at 284 nm and a shift of the absorption maximum from 284 to 278 nm (spectra are corrected for protein absorption). Deconvolution using the program package SPECFIT/32 revealed a single exponential process with a second order rate constant of 10.4 nm–1 s–1 at 15 °C. In line with the kinetic data, difference spectra recorded under steady state conditions confirmed that the absorbance of compound 2 is reduced by about 25% upon binding to the enzyme. Similar observations have been reported earlier in experiments with lumazine synthase of B. subtilis (17Schramek N. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows a series of spectra obtained after rapid mixing of compound 2 with a solution containing compound 1 and protein at 25 °C. The concentrations after mixing were 96 μm compound 2, 500 μm compound 1, and 105 μm enzyme subunits at pH 6.9. Since the carbohydrate type substrate 1 has no significant absorption in the spectral range used for analysis, it could be used in a relatively large excess to saturate the respective binding sites. Selected spectra from Fig. 6 are shown in Fig. 7. The spectrum recorded 5 s after mixing shows a shoulder at about 330 nm. The subsequent reaction phase is characterized by transient absorption in the long wavelength range; the absorption at 445 nm passes through a maximum at 147 s (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Absorbance changes obtained from single turnover experiment with lumazine synthase from A. aeolicus. Symbols represent the original data, lines represent the data obtained from numerical simulation using the kinetic constants in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The final reaction phase shows highly characteristic spectra with maxima at 392, 318, and 247 nm. The spectrum recorded at 1100 s (Fig. 7B) is virtually identical with the difference spectrum of compound 3 bound to lumazine synthase under steady state conditions (compare Fig. 4A) but differs substantially from that of 3 in the absence of enzyme. It is therefore obvious that the enzyme product is predominantly present in the protein-bound form at the end of the reaction trajectory at the solute concentrations used in our experiments. For a more detailed analysis, the data set in Fig. 6 was subjected to singular value decomposition using the program SPECFIT/32 (Spectrum Software Associates), which indicated five linearly independent optical spectra significantly above the noise floor (Fig. 9A, spectra A–E). The reconstructed transient spectrum A in Fig. 9A closely resembles that of free 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione. The transient spectrum B (Fig. 9A) resembles the difference spectrum of that compound in complex with the enzyme (compare Fig. 5). Spectrum C has a maximum at 287 nm and a broad shoulder around 335 nm and is well in line with the expectations for a Schiff base derivative of 5. Transient spectrum D is characterized by absorption maxima at 445 and 281 nm. The reconstructed spectrum E shows maxima at 391, 318, and 248 nm with shoulders at 310 and 285 nm and is similar to the difference spectrum of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine in complex with the enzyme (compare Fig. 4A). Reconstructed spectra similar to transients A–D have been reported in presteady state work with lumazine synthase of B. subtilis, whereas spectrum E differs from the final spectrum observed with the B. subtilis enzyme ((17Schramek N. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); also, for details, see “Discussion” in this article). Linear deconvolution of the data in Fig. 6 shows a rapid decrease of transient A (Fig. 9B). The half-life of that species is about 0.3 s at 25 °C. The transients B–D pass through maxima at 0.9, 12, and 142 s, respectively. Transient E begins to increase monotonously after about 2 s, but more than 10 min are required at 25 °C for that transient to reach a plateau. The data were numerically fitted to a kinetic model implicating four consecutive reaction steps according to Reaction 1, A+compound1→k1B→k2C→k3D→k4EReaction1(Eq. 1) Using Reaction 1, the kinetic data in Fig. 6 can be modeled by a set of one second order reaction and three first order reactions. The numerical values of the rate constants k 1 to k 4 at pH 6.9 and at 25 °C are shown in Table I. The rate-limiting step is the transformation of the transient species D into E with a rate constant k 4, which has a value of 0.003 s–1 at 25 °C. The lines in Fig. 9B were calculated using the parameters in Table I. The observed and simulated absorption values show excellent agreement (Fig. 8). Since lumazine synthase of A. aeolicus is stable and catalytically active over a wide range of temperatures, stopped flow experiments could be performed at temperatures ranging from 15 to 70 °C. Throughout that temperature range, numerical deconvolution afforded transient spectra that were closely similar to those shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 10A shows time-dependent optical absorbance at 460 nm in stopped flow experiments in the temperature range of 15–70 °C. As described above (compare Fig. 9A), the intermediate species D absorbs at a longer wavelength than any other reaction component and can therefore be monitored easily without contribution by any other reactant species. This facilitates experiments over a wide range of temperatures. At each temperature studied, the absorption at 460 nm passes through a maximum and subsequently declines to very low values. The maximum amplitude is virtually the same at temperatures between 35 and 70 °C but becomes progressively lower at temperatures below 35 °C. The maximum amplitude is reached 392 s after mixing at 15 °C and 2.2 s after mixing at 70 °C. As shown in Fig. 10B, the logarithm of the time required to reach the maximum concentration of intermediate D is proportional to the temperature. The result is well in line with the hypothesis that the reaction profile is not significantly affected by the temperature dependence of the Michaelis-Menten constants. The linear deconvolution of stopped flow experiments performed at different temperatures afforded values for k 1 to k 4 in the temperature range of 15–70 °C. The Arrhenius plots for k 1 to k 4 are all linear and have similar slopes (Fig. 11, Tables I and II). The resulting activation energies show values from 57 to 81 kJ mol–1.Table IIActivation parameters for binding of compound 2 to lumazine synthase from A. aeolicusEaΔG ‡ΔH ‡-TΔS ‡k (25 °C)kJ mol-1kJ mol-1kJ mol-1kJ mol-1μ m-1s-153.4 ± 4.382.4 ± 8.650.8 ± 4.331.6 ± 4.30.0224 ± 0.0051 Open table in a new tab The free energy difference between free and bound compound 2 and between free and bound 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine was calculated using the apparent dissociation constants of 4 and 70 μm, respectively (ΔG ‡ = –RTlnK‡). Thermodynamic activation parameters were calculated from the corresponding Eyring plots using the relationships ln(kT –1) = –ΔH ‡R–1T–1 + ln(k b h –1) + ΔS ‡ R –1 and ΔG ‡ = ΔH ‡ – TΔS ‡, where kb is Boltzmann's constant, h is Plack's constant, R is the gas constant, and ΔG ‡, ΔH ‡, and ΔS ‡ are the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of activation, respectively. As shown in Tables I and II, data for ΔG ‡, ΔH ‡, and –TΔS ‡ lie in the range of 75–88 kJ mol–1, 55–79 kJ mol–1, and 2–27 kJ mol–1, respectively. Due to a rare combination of properties, lumazine synthase of A. aeolicus is a particularly favorable experimental system for the presteady state kinetic analysis of a complex catalytic reaction sequence. (i) One of the substrates (compound 2), two intermediates, and the product (compound 3) have highly distinctive absorbance spectra that, together, cover a wide spectral range extending from ultraviolet into the visible range up to about 500 nm. Notably, the intermediates B and C absorb at longer wavelengths than their respective precursors. (ii) One of the substrates, the carbohydrate 1, has no significant absorbance in the entire spectral range and can be used in stoichiometric excess to facilitate the kinetic analysis. (iii) The enzyme reaction is naturally slow by comparison with the dead time of stopped flow equipment. (iv) The enzyme of A. aeolicus can be prepared in large amounts and is stable and catalytically active over a wide range of temperatures. The time-resolved ultraviolet spectra obtained with the enzyme from the hyperthermophilic A. aeolicus share many similarities with those obtained in our earlier study with the enzyme from the mesophilic B. subtilis but also display some surprising differences (17Schramek N. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). With the enzymes from both microorganisms, the most rapid process is a decline of the pyrimidine absorption in conjunction with a slight wavelength shift. Since the second substrate, 1, is not required for those absorption changes to take place, this rapid process is attributed to the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex. In line with that interpretation, the kinetics are well in line with a second order reaction (notably, the concentrations of the substrate 2 and of the protein subunits were closely similar in our experiments). Extensive x-ray structure analysis of lumazine synthase in complex with a variety of ligands has shown that the pyrimidine substrate is bound at the active site of the A. aeolicus enzyme in close proximity to a phenylalanine residue, which forms a coplanar complex with the pyrimidine ring of the substrate (5Zhang X. Meining W. Fischer M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1099-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Zhang X. Meining W. Cushman M. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The interaction between the π electron systems of the phenyl and pyrimidine residues of the protein and substrate, respectively, may be the reason for the relatively drastic modulation of the absorbance intensity of the bound ligand. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a concomitant protonation or deprotonation process due to modulation of the pK of the substrate by the protein environment. The temperature dependence of the rate constant k 1 describing the association of the protein and the pyrimidine type substrate is virtually identical in the presence and absence of the second substrate, 1 (Tables I and II). Again, this indicates that the formation of the complex of the substrate 2 and the protein is not significantly influenced by the second substrate, compound 1. Our earlier experiments with the B. subtilis enzyme (17Schramek N. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) had suggested the formation of a transient species with an absorption band around 320 nm, which was tentatively interpreted as the Schiff base 5 (compare Fig. 9). However, the transient species was so poorly populated that the spectrum could not be resolved by numerical deconvolution. In case of the A. aeolicus enzyme, this transient is more highly populated, and the spectrum of the intermediate can be extracted numerically. It is characterized by a maximum at 330 nm, which is well in line with the expected properties of the hypothetical Schiff base intermediate 5. The subsequent intense transient with maxima at 282 and 445 nm has been described in our earlier study (17Schramek N. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and could represent one of the intermediates 6 to 8. The final stage of the reaction is characterized by maxima at 247, 317, and 391 nm and is virtually identical with the difference spectrum of 3 in complex with lumazine synthase. These spectra are substantially different from that of 3 in either neutral or alkaline solution. However, they are similar to the spectrum of 6,7,8-trimethyllumazine 13 (Fig. 3) under alkaline conditions (Fig. 4B). Under alkaline conditions, lumazine derivatives with position 8 side chains carrying hydroxy groups in the 2′ or 3′ position form tricyclic anions (Fig. 3, compounds 11 and 12) through the addition of one of the side chain hydroxy groups to C-7 of the pteridine ring system (25Pfleiderer W. Bunting J.W. Perrin D.D. Nübel G. Chem. Ber. 1966; 99: 3503-3523Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Beach R.L. Plaut G.W.E. J. Org. Chem. 1971; 36: 3937-3943Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The formation of such a tricyclic system is not possible for 6,7,8-trimethyllumazine 13, which forms an exomethylene structure instead (Fig. 3, compound 14). An exomethylene type anion species 10 (Fig. 3) has also been shown by NMR spectroscopy to be present, albeit in very low amounts, in the equilibrium mixture of anionic species formed by 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine under alkaline conditions (26Beach R.L. Plaut G.W.E. J. Org. Chem. 1971; 36: 3937-3943Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Bown D.H. Keller P.J. Floss H.G. Sedlmaier H. Bacher A. J. Org. Chem. 1986; 51: 2461-2467Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The optical spectrum of 3 in alkaline solution is dominated by contributions of tricyclic species absorbing at 282, 313, and 366 nm (26Beach R.L. Plaut G.W.E. J. Org. Chem. 1971; 36: 3937-3943Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar); these spectral features are characteristic of the various species 10, 11, 12. Closer inspection, however, reveals a weak band in the region above 340 nm, which is likely to represent the small amount of exomethylene anion 10 in the mixture. Based on these data, it appears that (i) the pK of 3 is decreased considerably upon binding the enzyme and that (ii) the fixation of the extended ribityl side chain conformation precludes the formation of a tricyclic molecule. Thus, the exomethylene anion 10 is the dominant enzyme-bound species. Due to the remarkable thermostability of the enzyme under study, stopped flow experiments could be performed in a wide temperature range from 15 to 70 °C. Naturally, the time frame of these experiments varies over a wide range. The spectra from all experiments could be deconvoluted numerically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of enzyme presteady state kinetics over a wide range of temperatures. The temperature dependence of the rate constants k 1 to k 4 is summarized in Fig. 11. They all obey a linear Arrhenius relation, and the slopes of the regression lines are all similar. This result provides evidence that there are no temperature-dependent conformational changes of the enzyme (28Massey V. Curti B. Ganther H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate-determining step does not change within the temperature range measured (29Kistiakowsky G.B. Lumry R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 2006-2013Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, it comes as no surprise that the optical spectra obtained in stopped flow experiments develop in a closely similar manner over the entire temperature range studied. Based on these data, an attempt has been made to extract the activation parameters for all rate constants from the kinetic data (Tables I and II). The activation energies for all steps in the complex reaction trajectory of lumazine synthase are remarkably similar. There are no thermodynamic holes for any of the intermediates to fall into. It should be mentioned that the activation parameters for the rate-determining step, i.e. the formation of 3 from the transient species D, are closely similar to the activation parameters obtained for the overall reaction by steady state kinetic analysis.

Concomitant with inhibition of viral transcription, c-Jun was strongly up-regulated, which was consistent with the observation that AG 555 treatment also led to an activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by enhancing phosphorylation of JNK and p38. Increased JNK and p38 activity resulted in higher phosphorylation of the AP-1 family members c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2. Scanning the BPV-1 genome for potential binding sequences, an intragenic AP-1 site (BAP-1) within the E7 open reading frame was detected. Enhanced dimerization of phosphorylated activating transcription factor 2 together with c-Jun and binding to BAP-1 seem to be responsible for viral dysregulation because both suppression of BPV-1 and induction of c-Jun mRNA could be almost entirely abrogated by simultaneous treatment with SB 203580, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Moreover, dissecting the complex transcriptional pattern of episomal BPV-1 with specific primer sets for reverse transcription-PCR analysis, the repressive effect could be attributed to a selective down-regulation of the mRNA encoding the E2 transactivator function in favor of the E2 repressor, whose mRNA level remained constant during AG 555 treatment. These data indicate that tyrphostin AG 555 disturbs the balance of negative and positive regulatory factors necessary to maintain the homeostasis of a virus-transformed phenotype.

These data indicate that tyrphostin AG 555 disturbs the balance of negative and positive regulatory factors necessary to maintain the homeostasis of a virus-transformed phenotype. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation is a common feature of many cancers (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar, 2Levitzki A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of specific receptors or/and enhanced tyrosine kinase activity concomitantly elevate intracellular phosphorylation of many downstream regulatory proteins, which guarantees the maintenance of unscheduled DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (for review, see Ref. 3Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). In recent years, defined synthetic compounds have been designed which can efficiently block tyrosine kinase activity (tyrphostins) (4Lipson K.E. Pang L. Huber L.J. Chen H. Tsai J.M. Hirth P. Gazit A. Levitzki A. McMahon G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 844-852PubMed Google Scholar) and in turn the proliferative phenotype. In principle, two types of tyrphostin have been developed: one is acting at the substrate binding site of the enzyme, whereas the other functions by competing with the ATP binding domain, which is highly conserved among tyrosine kinases (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Tyrphostins structurally resemble tyrosine and erbstatin moieties and carry hydrophobic residues that enable crossing the cell membrane. The potential application of tyrphostins is not only considered for treatment of malignant disorders but also in other diseases such as atherosclerosis, psoriasis, and septic shock where increased tyrosine kinase activity could be discerned (5Ben-Bassat H.

Levitzki A. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 154: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tyrphostins are also useful tools to study regulatory mechanisms where enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation is involved (2Levitzki A. Pharmacol.

In the case of papillomavirus-linked diseases, alterations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; ATF-2, activating transcription factor 2; BPV-1, bovine papillomavirus type 1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HPV, human papillomavirus; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ORF, open reading frame; RT, reverse transcription./insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signal transduction and in turn increased tyrosine phosphorylation seem to play a pivotal role during multistep progression toward malignancy (7Maruo T. Yamasaki M. Ladines-Llave C.A. Mochizuki M. Cancer. 1992; 69: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Morrione A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. J.

For example, the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E5 oncoprotein exerts its transforming function through constitutive activation of growth stimulatory pathways via interaction with platelet-derived growth factor and EGF receptors (10Petti L. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Klein O. Kegler-Ebo D. Su J. Smith S. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3264-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, both BPV-1 E5 and the corresponding homolog of the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 can cooperate with ectopic EGF receptor expression in cell transformation assays (12Martin P. Vass W.C. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Velu T.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Leechanachai P. Banks L. Moreau F. Matlashewski G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar). Although the E5 open reading frame (ORF) of HPV-16 is often found to be deleted in cervical carcinoma cells after integration (14Jeon S. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Lambert P.F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2989-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the protein may have a function in premalignant lesions (15Kabsch K. Alonso A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12162-12172Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in which the DNA is still episomal (16Alazawi W. Pett M. Arch B. Scott L. Freeman T. Stanley M.A. Colem N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6959-6965PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguing also is the observation that rodent cells harboring a targeted disruption of the IGF receptor gene (IGF-R1) cannot be transformed by BPV-1 unless a functional IGF-R1 cDNA is provided (8Morrione A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5300-5303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This supports the notion that enhanced tyrosine kinase activity is apparently a general feature in viral carcinogenesis because elevated expression of EGF/IGF receptors has been reported in a wide proportion of papillomavirus-induced malignancies (17Nakamura K. Hongo A. Kodama J. Miyagi Y. Yoshinouchi M. Kudo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 760-765PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mathur S.P. Mathur R.S. Rust P.F. Young R.C. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2000; 46: 280-287Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A suitable model system, in which enhanced intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation signaling can be studied in the context of viral transcription and transformation, is provided by BPV-1-transformed mouse fibroblasts (ID13 cells) (19Law M.F. Lowy D.R. Dvoretzky I. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2727-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here, E5 is considered the main oncoprotein (20DiMaio D. Guralski D. Schiller J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1797-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) because mutations within the ORFs of E6 and E7 (encoding the major HPV-16/18-transforming proteins) (for review, see Ref. 21zur Hausen H. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2002; 5: 342-350Crossref Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) have only marginal effects in focus formation assays using rodent cells as recipients (22Rabson M.S. Yee C. Yang Y.C. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 626-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, E6 can also affect tyrosine phosphorylation by interacting with the focal adhesion protein paxillin, known to be involved in coordination of cell spreading and motility (23Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Similar to premalignant HPV-positive keratinocytes (24Dürst M. Kleinheinz A. Hotz M. Gissmann L. J. Gen. Virol. 1985; 66: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), BPV-1 persists as multicopy episomal nucleoprotein complexes in transformed cells (25Rösl F. Waldeck W. Zentgraf H. Sauer G. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 500-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rösl F. Waldeck W. Mol. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 4: 248-256Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This has the advantage that effects on the multipromoter-driven transcriptional activity (27Baker C.C. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Szymanski P. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5710-5720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can be investigated independently from any position effects (25Rösl F. Waldeck W. Zentgraf H. Sauer G. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 500-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) often occurring after viral integration into the host genome (29Jeon S. Lambert P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1654-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the tyrphostin AG 555 can selectively suppress BPV-1 transcription through MAP kinase pathway activation and binding of phosphorylated Jun/ATF-2 at a novel intragenic regulatory sequence. We also demonstrate that AG 555 affects the transcription of the major regulatory viral protein E2 by shifting the ratio between E2 transactivator in favor to the repressor function. These data indicate that fine tuning of BPV-1 gene expression in transformed cells is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Cell Culture and Treatment—ID13 mouse fibroblasts (19Law M.F. Lowy D.R.

Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 to ensure logarithmic growth. The final concentration of the tyrphostin AG 555 (cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-N-(3-phenylpropyl)-2-propenamide) was 30 μm in all experiments. Stock solutions of 10 mm in Me2SO were stored at –80 °C. To exclude potential Me2SO effects, the same final concentrations (0.3%) of Me2SO were added to nontreated controls. Actinomycin D (Calbiochem) was dissolved in water and added to cells in a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. SB 203580 (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO (stock concentration: 50 mm) and used in a final concentration of 10 μm. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted according to the guanidinium-thiocyanate protocol described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of total cellular RNA was separated on 1% agarose gels (31Khandjian E.W. Meric C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filters subsequently were hybridized with specific DNA probes that were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming (32Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biol. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). DNA Probes—pBPV-1 represents a unit length of BPV-1 DNA (33Chen E.Y. Howley P.M. Levinson A.D. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1982; 299: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) cloned in pBR322. c-Jun, encoding the mouse cDNA in a Rous sarcoma virus-driven vector, was kindly obtained from Peter Angel, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum Heidelberg (34Angel P.

Kedes (Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—For gel retardation and competition assays, the following oligonucleotides were used: AP-1 consensus sequence, 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′; TRE consensus sequence, 5′-AGCTAAAGTGGTGACTCATCACTAT-3′ derived from the collagenase 3-/matrix metalloprotease 13 promoter) (34Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar); SP-1 binding sequence: 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′, derived from the SV 40 promoter (36Dynan W.S Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar); and the BPV-1-specific AP-1 oligonucleotide 5′-AAACTTGGATGATTCACCTGC-3′, position 505–525 in the BPV-1 genome, detected by scanning the BPV-1 genomic sequence with a 7-bp consensus oligonucleotide of AP-1 (5′-TGACTCA-3′) using computer program Gap. The oligonucleotides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems synthesizer using phosphoramitide chemistry and purified further by high performance liquid chromatography. For EMSAs, the annealed oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3,000 Ci/mmol) with T4 polynucleotide kinase and gel purified from a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Cellular extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (37Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with the only modification that N-N-(l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl-agmatine (E64) and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzolsulfonylfluoride (Pefabloc SC) were included as protease inhibitors in concentrations suggested by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The binding was performed exactly as described (38Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sequence specificity of the binding was controlled in competition experiments by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of either unlabeled homologous or heterologous oligonucleotides. For monitoring c-Jun/ATF-2 composition in supershift assays, 2 μg of polyclonal antibodies directed against c-Jun or ATF-2 was added, and the reaction was incubated further for 1 h at 4 °C. In detail, the following antibodies (all obtained from Santa Cruz, Biotechnology as TransCRuz™ supershift reagents) were used: c-Jun-Ab, which recognizes both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated form of c-Jun (epitope corresponding to amino acids 56–69 mapping within the amino-terminal domain of the mouse c-Jun protein); ATF-2 antibody, specific for Thr71-phosphorylated ATF-2). The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5.5% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gels (29:1 cross-linking ratio), dried, and exposed overnight to Kodak X-Omat films. Western Blot Analyses—Total cellular protein extracts were prepared using ice cold RIPA buffer (0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl) supplemented with freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad), and 50 μg of total protein was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. After electrotransfer to Immobilon™-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation), the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution: TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.14 m NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% skim milk powder (Merck). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with the first antibody (diluted in blocking solution) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the second antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) diluted 1:5,000 in blocking solution. Finally the membranes were washed again for 30 min, incubated 2 min with the ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed on Kodak X-Omat films. For stripping, the membranes were incubated with 200 mm NaOH for 5 min and washed with water prior to incubation with an additional antibody. The following polyclonal antibodies were used (all purchased from New England Biolabs): phospho-p38, p38, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-c-Jun, phospho-ATF-2, and ATF-2. c-Jun antibody, and Cdk2 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The BPV E5 monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from R. Schlegel (Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.). Equal protein transfer and loading were routinely controlled by reincubating the filters with a monoclonal actin-specific antibody (ICN Biomedicals). p38 MAP Kinase Assay—All steps of the nonradioactive kinase assay system were performed exactly according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The first step includes an immunoprecipitation of p38 MAP kinase from a 100-μg protein extract via immobilized phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) monoclonal antibody. In vitro kinase assay was performed using purified ATF-2 protein as substrate. ATF-2 phosphorylation was detected by Western blot using phospho-ATF-2 (Thr71) antibody. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—For fluorescence analysis, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and stained 1 h with 50 μg/ml propidiumiodide + 40 μg/ml RNaseA in phosphate-buffered saline in the dark at 4 °C. Analysis was performed using a BD Biosciences flow cytometer (40Larsen J.K. Munch-Petersen B. Christiansen J. Jorgensen K. Cytometry. 1986; 1: 54-63Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cell cycle distribution and quantification of flow cytometric data were performed according to Dean and Jett (41Dean P.N. Jett J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 60: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). For each measurement, 10,000 cells were counted. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen according to the instructions of the provider. 30 μg of RNA was treated with 1 unit of DNase for 20 min at 37 °C to remove residual genomic DNA. The RT reaction was performed using the Omniscript RT kit from Qiagen; 2 μg of RNA was used for a 20-μl reaction volume to generate cDNA. E2 sequence-specific PCR was performed with 0.5 μl of RT Mix, now containing cDNA, 5 mmol of dNTPs, 5 pmol of primers, and 0.7 unit of Expand High Fidelity Polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in a 20-μl reaction volume using primers for full-length, amino-terminal, and carboxyl-terminal E2 DNA sequences: forward (F) primer, 5′-AGACAGCATGCGAACGTTTA-3′; reverse (R) primer, 5′-TGCTTGGCTCTCTCTTGACA-3′; amino-terminal Rn primer, 5′-TCCTCTTCTTCCTGCCTTGA-3′; carboxyl-terminal Fc primer: 5′-AGCCCAGCCTGTCTCTTCT-3. The PCR program (MJ Research PCR Cycler) was as follows: step 1, denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min; step 2, denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s; step 3, annealing with touch down 65–1 °C/cycle; step 4, elongation at 72 °C for 4 min; step 5, repeat steps 2–4, 19 times; step 6, denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s; step 7, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s; step 8, elongation at 72 °C for 4 min; step 9, repeat steps 6–8, 19 times; step 10, elongation at 72 °C for 12 min and cooling at 4 °C. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and detected after ethidium bromide staining under UV. Immunoprecipitation and Cdk2 Assay—Cdk2 activity was measured after immunoprecipitation of the protein from cell extracts and phosphorylation of histone H1 as substrate (42Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). 100 μg of each cell extract (treated and controls) was supplemented with 1 μl of anti-Cdk2 antibody (Santa Cruz) and incubated on ice for 2 h. The following step was the binding of protein-antibody aggregates by A/G-agarose beads and centrifugation to separate the bound complexes from free protein. The beads were washed using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm natriumvanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 5 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone) and kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and afterward a premix consisting of histone H1 (calf thymus, Calbiochem-Novabiochem), ATP (Roche Applied Science), and radioactive γ-ATP (Amersham Biosciences) was added. The kinase reaction was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and the detection of phosphorylated histone H1 was performed after 10% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and autoradiography of dried gels. AG 555 Selectively Down-regulates BPV-1 Transcription— Because of their structural similarity with tyrosine (Fig. 1, panel A) tyrphostins can block protein-tyrosine kinase activity by binding to the substrate binding site (2Levitzki A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To test the effect of AG 555 on viral transformed cells, BPV-1-transformed mouse fibroblasts (ID13 cells) were treated for different periods of time, and total RNA was examined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, panel B, cell incubation in the presence of 30 μm AG 555 resulted in a selective down-regulation of the most abundant viral transcripts (27Baker C.C. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 43Barksdale S.K. Baker C.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5605-5616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) already 4 h after drug application. To demonstrate that AG 555-mediated BPV-1 suppression was a selective process and not the consequence of a general transcriptional block per se, the RNA filters were rehybridized with endogenous reference genes. Notably, under conditions in which BPV-1 transcription was suppressed, an even costimulatory effect on c-Jun gene expression could be discerned. c-Jun induction was detectable already 2 h after AG 555 addition and remained elevated up to 8–10 h. Subsequent hybridization of the same filters with a housekeeping gene probe (β-actin) demonstrated that suppression was specifically directed against the virus-specific transcription cassette and did not represent the result of a nonspecific transcriptional impairment of the cells by the tyrphostin. Down-regulation of BPV-1 Transcription and Cell Cycle Arrest: Suppression of Cdk2 Activity—Measuring the cell cycle profile by flow cytometric analysis under conditions in which BPV-1 expression was found to be down-regulated, the majority of ID13 cells were growth-arrested with an accumulation of the cells at the late S/early G2 boundary, whereas the G1 phase was diminished (Fig. 2, panel A). For example, considering the fluorescence-activated cell sorter profile 8 h after AG 555 treatment, an increase of the S/G2 phase from 7.7 to 18.5% and from 12 to 25% and a decrease of G1 from 75 to 43%, respectively, could be noted (see Fig. 2, panel A). To analyze whether the inhibition of BPV-1 transcription and cell cycle arrest correlated with cyclin-dependent kinase activity suppression, cyclin-Cdk2 complexes were first immunoprecipitated with a Cdk2-specific antibody and subsequently functionally tested in an in vitro phosphorylation assay using histone H1 as substrate (Fig. 2, panel B, upper part). Compared with the untreated controls, Cdk2 remained active up to 2 h but declined significantly between 6 and 8 h after the addition of AG 555. To exclude that Cdk2 activity was reduced because of quantitative changes in Cdk2 itself, total cellular extracts were monitored by Western blot analysis. Consecutive incubation of the filter with specific antibodies against Cdk2 and actin as internal loading control confirmed equal Cdk2 expression (Fig. 2, panel C). In addition, consistent with the transcriptional data presented above (Fig. 1, panel B), the level of the E5 oncoprotein was down-regulated in the same time range, whereas the expression of Ha-ras and actin as internal reference was not affected (Fig. 2, panel D). These results suggest that AG 555 was efficiently inducing cell cycle arrest by negatively interfering with BPV-1 transcription and Cdk2 function. MAP Kinase Pathway Activation by AG 555—Because c-Jun expression was induced upon AG 555 treatment, we reasoned that tyrphostin treatment may act as a cellular stress signal (for review, see Ref. 44Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) that activates the MAP kinase pathway and in turn downstream target proteins. Mammalian MAP kinases consist of three groups: ERK, JNK, and the p38 MAP kinases (45Schaeffer J.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). To prove whether AG 555 was affecting MAP kinase activity, Western blot analyses using phosphorylation-specific antibodies raised against ERK, JNK, and p38 were performed. Fig. 3, panel A, shows that only the stress kinases JNK and p38 were phosphorylated, reaching a maximum between 4 and 6 h after the addition of AG 555. In contrast, ERK1 and ERK2 were unaltered under the same experimental conditions. Phosphorylation could be not attributed to an enhanced protein synthesis because control incubations of the filters with nonphosphorylation-specific antibodies revealed that the net amount of the corresponding proteins was the same. p38 MAP kinases are normally activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr within a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif (46Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). It was therefore unexpected that a tyrphostin, which can potentially interfere with tyrosine phosphorylation (2Levitzki A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), can activate p38. Because the p38 antibody used cannot distinguish between these two phosphorylation sites, it was mandatory to test whether phosphorylation was in fact accompanied with an increased enzymatic activity. p38 was therefore first immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts and subsequently assayed in vitro using purified ATF-2 (in the presence of ATP) as a substrate. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 was detectable already 30 min after the addition of AG 555, which coincides temporarily with p38 activation (Fig. 3, panel B) but precedes viral suppression (see below). JNK activity was measured in vivo by probing nuclear extracts with c-Jun phosphorylation-specific antibodies directed against the serine residues at positions 63 and 73 within the amino-terminal transactivating domain. As depicted in Fig. 3, panel B, even though c-Jun was induced on a transcriptional level (Fig. 1, panel B), no enhanced accumulation of the corresponding protein could be noted. These data indicate that the biological outcome of AG 555-mediated MAP kinase activation was restricted mainly to post-translational phosphorylation events on c-Jun and ATF-2. Identification of a Potential Intragenic AP-1 site within the BPV-1 Genome—To determine whether the repression of viral transcription is linked causally with MAP kinase activation, we anticipated that the activation of the AP-1 family members c-Jun and ATF-2 may either directly or indirectly influence BPV-1 expression. Because no AP-1 binding site within the BPV-1 genome has been described until now, we scanned the nucleotide sequence for putative bind"
