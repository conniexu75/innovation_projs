https://openalex.org/W2149938812,"In rats infused with asialoglycoprotein for 60 min, receptor-mediated endocytosis of the ligand occurred exclusively in hepatic parenchymal cells. We have used double-label immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin cryosections of rat liver to identify the site at which the asialoglycoprotein receptor and its ligand dissociate following their common endocytosis. Asialoglycoprotein receptor, ligand and clathrin were identified and quantitated by the use of monospecific antibodies followed by gold-protein A complexes. Both receptor and ligand were found associated with the membrane of clathrin-coated vesicles close to the cell surface. We identified other vesicles that contained ligand accumulated within the lumen. The membranes of these latter vesicles contained little receptor, but receptor was concentrated in tubular extensions that were largely free of ligand. We call this organelle CURL (compartment of uncoupling of receptor and ligand). CURL vesicles appear to transform into secondary lysosomes, wherein the ligand is degraded. The tubular vesicles are, we propose, an intermediate in recycling the receptor to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1608212624,"A series of glycolipid antigens reacting with the monoclonal antibody directed to the stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 was isolated and characterized from group O human erythrocyte membranes. A ceramide heptasaccharide (Structure 1), ceramide nonasaccharide (Structure 2), and ceramide decasaccharide (Structure 3) have been characterized (formula, see text) The main feature of this glycolipid series is its long core sugar chain with a nonbranched repeating N-acetyllactosamine (norpolylactosamine). This characteristic is in contrast to that of co-existing H-active glycolipid series in which the longer core structures are branched type repeating N-acetyllactosamine (isopolylactosamine). The reactivity of these glycolipids to monoclonal anti-stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 antibody varied proportionately to the length of their core sugar chains. A possible significance of these glycolipids as developmentally regulated antigens and as cancer-associated antigens was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1974828706,"A study of the anatomical distribution of the endogenous opioid dynorphin in rat brain showed that the peptide is localized in a widespread system with multiple cell groups and projections. This network is revealed by the use of multiple antiserums against dynorphin and can be distinguished from the system containing methionine-enkephalin and leucine-enkephalin, which is mapped by the use of antiserums against the enkephalins and biosynthetically related peptides in the adrenal. It thus appears that the brain contains at least three separate opioid neuronal networks: an enkephalin family with components similar to those found in the adrenal, a beta-endorphin family, and a dynorphin family."
https://openalex.org/W1515847027,"A new, hydrophilic beta-adrenergic receptor radioligand, (+/-)-[3H]CGP-12177 (4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole-2-on hydrochloride), was synthesized and radiolabeled to 40 Ci/mmol. The nonspecific binding of this compound to turkey erythrocyte ghosts and C6 glioma cell membranes was less than 5% of the total binding at five times the appropriate KD. Binding assays of intact C6 glioma cells also showed low nonspecific binding, less than 20% of the total binding at five times the appropriate KD. The affinities of the antagonists (-)- and (+)-propranolol as well as of the agonist (-)-isoproterenol were examined by their potency to displace various radioligands from intact C6 glioma cell and membrane preparations. With membrane preparations, both [3H] CGP-12177 and [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) were displaced stereospecifically by the antagonists (-)- and (+)-propranolol and the agonist (-)-isoproterenol. With whole cells, [3H]CGP-12177 and [3H]DHA behaved differently. [3H]DHA and [3H]carazolol could be stereospecifically displaced by antagonists but only partially displaced by agonists, while [3H]CGP-12177 could be completely displaced by both antagonists and agonists as in membranes. In contrast to [3H]CGP-12177, the lipophilic ligand [3H]DHA is actually taken up by cells. The inability of agonists to displace lipophilic radioligands from receptors on intact cells may not be due to a low affinity of agonists for receptors on cells, but to an agonist-induced change in the receptors which renders them inaccessible to hydrophilic agonists and antagonists. This change is likely to be their internalization into the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2122280772,"Using electron microscopy, we find that adenovirus and epidermal growth factor attached to colloidal gold (EGF-Au) enter KB cells together via coated pits and receptosomes. At 5 min, adenovirus begins to appear free in the cytosol and promotes the release of EGF-Au into the cytosol. Pseudomonas toxin (PE) also is internalized via coated pits and receptosomes. Adenovirus enhances the toxicity of PE 100-fold, and enhances a conjugate of PE and epidermal growth factor (PE-EGF), which enters cells via the EGF receptor, 10,000-fold. These results suggest that adenovirus disrupts receptosomes, enhancing delivery of material contained in them into the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2045380850,"Intracerebroventricular administration of dynorphin produced potent and long-lasting effects on motor function and the electroencephalogram in rats. In addition, local iontophoretic or pressure ejection of dynorphin consistently inhibited hippocampal unit activity. None of these effects were significantly affected by naloxone even at high doses. Moreover, a fragment of dynorphin that failed to displace any of a number of tritiated narcotics from rat brain homogenates produced similar effects on these physiological measures in vivo. On the basis of a variety of criteria for ""opiate action,"" the results suggest that a second biologically active site within the dynorphin sequence is capable of quite potent but nonopiate effects."

Kainic acid effects were also blocked, indicating a postsynaptic mechanism of action. The use of PDA helps to characterize one of two classes of excitatory amino acid synaptic receptors that mediate cone influence in the outer retina."
https://openalex.org/W1541602774,"Protein I is a neuron-specific, synaptic phosphoprotein highly localized on the surface of synaptic vesicles. We have recently isolated anti-Protein I IgG by affinity chromatography and shown that these antibodies inhibit specifically the phosphorylation of Protein I (Naito, S., and Ueda, T. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10657-10663). In an effort to characterize Protein I-associated synaptic vesicles with respect to the types of neurotransmitters, we have now developed a procedure, using the affinity-purified anti-Protein I IgG, which allows immunoprecipitation of those synaptic vesicles which contain Protein I. The isolated vesicles are largely free of contamination from other intracellular organelles and plasma membranes. We present evidence that these vesicles isolated from bovine cortex are able to accumulate L-glutamate specifically in an ATP-dependent, temperature-dependent but Na-independent manner. Thus, the structurally similar aminoacid neurotransmitters aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid, as well as other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and glycine, failed to show a significant ATP-dependent uptake into these vesicles. Moreover, the ATP-dependent glutamate uptake was not inhibited effectively by glutamine, aspartate, or gamma-aminobutyric acid. The ATP-dependent glutamate uptake requires ATP hydrolysis; thus there was little accumulation of glutamate in the absence of ATP or Mg2+, or when ATP was replaced by an unhydrolyzable beta, gamma-methylene ATP analog. The glutamate uptake appears to be driven at least in part by a membrane potential generated by Mg2+-ATPase, similar to that of the catecholamine and serotonin uptakes into storage granules. These observations suggest that Protein I may be involved in some aspect of the function of glutamate-containing synaptic vesicles in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1969126053,"This article addresses the problem of the segregation of cell lines during the development of peripheral nervous system components from the neural crest. We show here that committed precursors of peripheral neurons are present in the crest before the migration of its cells has started. If cultured in a serum-deprived medium, a subpopulation of the crest cells readily differentiates into neurons without dividing. Neuronal markers such as neurofilament proteins and receptor sites for tetanus toxin are not expressed in the committed neuronal precursors, but appear after a few hours in culture. They are coexpressed in neurons with the mesenchymal intermediate filament protein, vimentin, which is common to all neural crest cells regardless of their prospective fate. A strong inhibitory effect of serum factor(s) on neurite outgrowth is demonstrated. We show also that conditions stimulating proliferation of crest cells are incompatible with promotion of neuronal differentiation and vice-versa."
https://openalex.org/W1585463957,"In neuroblastoma-glioma (NG108-15) hybrid cells, opiates inhibit adenylate cyclase and stimulate a low Km GTPase. It has been postulated that the stimulation of GTPase plays a role in opiate inhibition of adenylate cyclase (Koski, G., and Klee, W. A. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 4185-4189). Treatment of NG108-15 cells with pertussis toxin attenuates receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The toxin acts by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of a 41,000-dalton substrate believed to be a part of the receptor-adenylate cyclase complex. We have found that toxin treatment of NG108-15 results in inhibition of the opiate-stimulated GTPase. The concentration of toxin required for inhibition of this GTPase was similar to that needed for both attenuation of opiate inhibition of adenylate cyclase and ADP ribosylation of the 41,000-dalton substrate. Inhibition of the opiate-induced GTPase by pertussis toxin in isolated membranes required NAD, consistent with the hypothesis that this effect of the toxin resulted from ADP ribosylation of a protein component of the system. Since the opiate-stimulated GTPase is believed to play a role in the receptor-mediated decrease in adenylate cyclase activity, inhibition of this GTPase may be an important part of the mechanism by which the toxin interferes with opiate action on adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1984130880,"Neurons containing the enzyme aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) but lacking either tyrosine hydroxylase or serotonin were found in the spinal cord of neonatal and adult rats by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. The majority of these neurons localized to area X of Rexed contact ependyma. Thus, spinal AADC neurons have the enzymatic capacity to catalyze directly the conversion of the amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine to their respective amines tyramine, tryptamine, or phenylethylamine. These amines normally present in the central nervous system may be of potential clinical significance as endogenous psychotomimetics."

https://openalex.org/W1537789352,"During blood coagulation alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha 2PI) is cross-linked with fibrin by an activated fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSFa) plasma transglutaminase, activated coagulation factor XIII). When alpha 2PI was treated with FSFa in the absence of acceptor amino groups, the inhibitor lost more than 90% of its capacity to be cross-linked to fibrin because of hydrolysis of the gamma-carboxamides of FSFa-susceptible glutamine residues. Chemical modifications of the inhibitor's lysine epsilon-amino groups did not affect the cross-linking capacity of the inhibitor with fibrin, whereas the same chemical modifications in fibrinogen resulted in a remarkable loss of cross-linking capacity. These observations suggest that alpha 2PI plays a role as an acyl donor with its FSFa-susceptible glutamine residues in the cross-linking reaction with fibrin, and fibrin serves as an acyl acceptor with its lysine residues. The number of FSFa-susceptible glutamine residues/molecule of the inhibitor was estimated by measuring the maximum incorporation of [3H]histamine into the inhibitor and by analyzing the distribution of radioactivity in a tryptic digest of [14C]histamine-incorporated alpha 2PI.l It was found that each inhibitor molecule has one glutamine residue that is most susceptible to FSFa. When the radioactive histamine-incorporated inhibitor was reacted with excess amounts of plasmin, a small fragment carrying all the released radioactivity was rapidly released from the NH2-terminal part of the inhibitor moiety of the complex. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the inhibitor was analyzed before and after treatment with FSFa or before and after incorporation of radioactive histamine. The glutamine residue at the second position from the NH2-terminal end was converted to a glutamic acid residue when the inhibitor was treated with FSFa. When the radioactive histamine-incorporated inhibitor ws analyzed, the radioactivity was found predominantly at the second position from the NH2-terminal end. These results indicate that the glutamine residue susceptible to FSFa in alpha 2PI is located next to the NH2-terminal residue."
https://openalex.org/W1979525278,"Dynorphin, an opioid peptide whose functions are unknown, is found in brain, pituitary, and peripheral organs. Specific radioimmunoassays were used to measure dynorphin in the hypothalamus and pituitary, during the day and at night, as a function of food and water deprivation. Immunoreactive dynorphin was increased in the hypothalamus and decreased in the pituitary at night. Water deprivation led to more than 50 percent reduction in daytime levels of pituitary dynorphin and concomitant increases in hypothalamic dynorphin."
https://openalex.org/W2008545362,"There is evidence that the mammalian female genital tract is capable of responding immunologically when challenged with alloantigens. The antigenic properties of male gametes have been well delineated. However, it is only rarely that a female mammal ever responds immunologically to the male gametic antigens as a result of coitus. When a proposed mechanism of suppression of antigenicity of epididymal spermatozoa was tested experimentally, the results indicated that two proteins (uteroglobin and transglutaminase) present in the prostate may be responsible for suppressing sperm antigenicity in the rabbit."
https://openalex.org/W2032050818,"Immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and dynorphin-(I-8) were visualized in rat hypothalamus by immunohistofluorescence with specific antibodies. In brains from colchicine-treated, adrenalectomized rats, neuronal perikarya with immunoreactive CRF were observed in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The CRF occurred together with the dynorphin-(1-8). However, the CRF immunoreactivity occurred only in a subpopulation of the dynorphin-(1-8) immunoreactive cells. These findings suggest that there may be a functional interrelationship of CRF with dynorphin-related opioid peptides and provide further evidence that neurons may contain more than one bioactive substance."
https://openalex.org/W1984857603,"Early morning insomnia, a significant increase in wakefulness during the final hours of drug nights, occurred after 1 or 2 weeks of nightly administration of benzodiazepine hypnotics with short elimination half-lives, when tolerance had begun to develop. Early morning insomnia may be a variant of rebound insomnia and therefore specific to benzodiazepines, or it may occur with any rapidly eliminated sedative-hypnotic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2068657939,"A fluorescence assay was developed to measure the rate of fusion of highly purified clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from bovine brain with purified lysosomes isolated from bovine kidney. Coated vesicles and stripped vesicles, prepared by removal of clathrin from coated vesicles with dilute alkaline buffer, were labeled with the nonfluorescent dye 6-carboxydiacetylfluorescein. Fusion of the vesicles with lysosomes resulted in mixing of the vesicle contents and exposure of 6-carboxydiacetylfluorescein to lysosomal esterases, which hydrolyze the probe's acetate groups to give the fluorescent 6-carboxyfluorescein. Fusion was therefore measured by recording the increase in fluorescence obtained upon mixing the vesicles with lysosomes. The results of the experiments indicated that the clathrin coat of coated vesicles inhibited the fusion of the vesicle membrane with that of the lysosome. In addition, fusion appears to require free Ca2+ and does not require vesicle-surface protein."
https://openalex.org/W1581570010,"The carbohydrate moieties of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase purified from rat kidney were released as oligosaccharides by hydrazinolysis. Fractionation of the oligosaccharide mixture by paper electrophoresis and Bi-Gel P-4 column chromatography and structural study of each component by sequential exoglycosidase digestion in combination with methylation analysis and periodate oxidation have revealed that it is composed of 23 neutral oligosaccharides, monosialyl derivatives of 67 oligosaccharides, disialyl derivatives of 62 oligosaccharides, and trisialyl derivatives of 5 oligosaccharides. The neutral oligosaccharides are either high mannose type or biantennary complex type, and the acidic oligosaccharides are bi-, tri-, and tetranntennary complex type sugar chains. Most of the complex type sugar chains contain an N-acetylglucosamine residue at the C-4 position of the beta-mannosyl residue of their trimannosyl core. Another characteristic feature of these complex type sugar chains is that they are enriched with nonreducing terminal beta-N-acetylglucosamine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1974825958,"Somatostatin, a tetradecapeptide with potent inhibitory actions on gastric acid secretion, potentiated carbamylcholine-induced synthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 from isolated perfused rat stomachs. The ability of somatostatin to inhibit acid secretion was blocked by indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. These results suggest that prostaglandins mediate gastric acid inhibition by somatostatin in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1582513609,"Definitive evidence is presented for the bifunctional nature of the biotin repressor protein which possesses both regulatory and enzymatic activities. The repressor protein can activate biotin in the presence of ATP to form biotinyl-5'-adenylate, the co-repressor which remains tightly bound to the repressor protein. This complex can either bind to the operator site and inhibit transcription or transfer the biotinyl moiety to a lysine residue of the apoenzyme of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The two activities were coincident throughout a purification procedure which resulted in a 3500-fold increase in activity. Gel electrophoresis of the purified preparation, under native or denaturing conditions, showed three proteins with the activity corresponding to the major protein band of apparent Mr = 34,000. On gel exclusion chromatography, the activity was also associated with a protein of Mr varying fro 37,000-44,000, indicating the protein is monomeric. The occasional appearance of multiple bands with biological activity in the native gels suggests that the repressor protein can also exist in multimeric forms. On chromatofocusing, the repressor activity and the holoenzyme synthetase activity were coincidental, with the peak of activity at pH 7.2, the isoelectric point. Only a single protein band with Mr = 34,000 was observed on SDS gel electrophoresis of all fractions showing activity."
https://openalex.org/W1489741161,"Uridylyltransferase, a component of the covalent modification cascade system that controls glutamine synthetase activity in Escherichia coli, has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The purification was facilitated by the use of an E. coli strain which carries multiple copies of a ColE1-hybrid plasmid containing the glnD gene that encodes uridylyltransferase and which overproduces its synthesis by 25-fold. Gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography studies show that the native enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of Mr = 95,000 +/- 5,000. The purified enzyme catalyzes the uridylylation as well as the deuridylylation of the regulatory protein PII, demonstrating that a single bifunctional enzyme is involved in the covalent interconversion of PII. Gel filtration studies indicate that the enzyme undergoes slow irreversible aggregation during most steps of purification with a concomitant loss of activity."
https://openalex.org/W1630147022,"We have purified glutamine synthetase over 130-fold from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme exhibits a Km for glutamate of 6.3 mM and a Km for ATP of 1.3 mM in the biosynthetic reaction, with a pH optimum from 6.1 to 7.0. Ten to twelve 43,000 molecular weight subunits comprise the active enzyme of 470,000 molecular weight. Rabbit antibodies prepared against the purified enzyme were used to show that induction of enzyme activity correlates with de novo synthesis of the enzyme subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1630211942,"Highly purified clathrin-coated vesicles, isolated from rat liver and calf brain, contain mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The coated vesicle receptors appear to have the same subunit molecular weight and similar binding affinity as the receptor previously purified from bovine liver and rat chondrosarcoma microsomes (Sahagian, G. G., Distler, J. J., and Jourdian, G. W. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 4289-4293 and Steiner, A. W., and Rome, L. H. (1982) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 214, 681-687). There is a considerable (greater than 60-fold) enrichment of receptors in liver coated vesicles as compared to liver microsomes. Experiments carried out with intact and detergent-disrupted coated vesicles indicated that the receptors face toward the inside of the coated vesicles. The data suggest that coated vesicles are involved in the intracellular transport of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2088415312,"We determined the nucleotide sequences of three nonallelic cytochrome c genes (from recombinant clones Ch4A-RC5, 6 and 8) isolated from the rat cytochrome c gene family. In contrast with a fourth gene (from Ch4A-RC4), which has an intron and correctly encodes rat cytochrome c, these three appear to be pseudogenes and resemble mRNA molecules in two respects: they are all missing the intron of clone 4, and sequence homology with clone 4 in their 3′ noncoding regions abruptly ends at two different A-rich tracts reminiscent of poly(A) tails. We also detect three cytochrome c mRNAs of sizes 1400, 1100 and 700 nucleotides in several tissues of the adult rat. The size differences among the mRNAs can be accounted for by length heterogeneity in their 3′ noncoding regions. Two of the 3′ ends map to the two points where the mRNA-like genes diverge from clone 4 at poly(A) tracts. Furthermore, short direct repeats flank the genes of clones 5, 6 and 8 at the positions where their sequences diverge. The observations suggest that these members of the cytochrome c multigene family may arise through insertion into the genome of DNA copies of cytochrome c mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1536860417,"The alpha 1-adrenergic receptor has been solubilized in active form from rat hepatic membranes with the nonionic detergent, digitonin, and purified by affinity and gel filtration chromatography to homogeneity with a specific activity of 14,400 pmol/mg of protein. The affinity chromatographic steps of the purification procedure were achieved by the use of a newly synthesized analog (2-[4(2-succinoyl)piperazin-1-yl]-4-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, CP-57,609) of the highly selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, immobilized via an amide linkage to agarose. The resulting purified receptor bound [3H]prazosin and a variety of adrenergic agents with the specificity, stereoselectivity, and affinities equivalent to those observed with membrane-bound and solubilized receptor preparations. The purified receptor.digitonin complex had a Stokes radius of 49 A and a sedimentation coefficient (s20w) of 7.1, as determined by AcA-34 gel filtration chromatography and sucrose gradient density centrifugation, respectively. Based on these hydrodynamic parameters, the calculated molecular weight of the receptor.digitonin complex was estimated at 147,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following the final purification step revealed a single band of protein at 59,000 daltons from which [3H]prazosin binding activity could be recovered after renaturation of the receptor protein. These findings indicate that the protein purified from rat hepatic membranes is the hormone binding component of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and that the receptor molecule most likely contains more than one Mr = 59,000 subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1608716577,"The regulatory nucleotide guanosine 5'-diphosphate, 3'-diphosphate (ppGpp) and its precursor guanosine 5'-triphosphate, 3'-diphosphate (pppGpp) are accumulated during stringent response in bacterial cells. The enzyme pppGpp-5'-phosphohydrolase, which catalyzes the conversion of pppGpp to ppGpp, was partially purified from Escherichia coli. It has Mr = 140,000 and an apparent Km of 0.11 mM for pppGpp. It requires Mg2+ and a monovalent cation. NH4+ is preferred over K+, while Na+ is inactive. The enzyme does not hydrolyze GTP, ATP, pppApp, or ppGpp. It is also not effectively inhibited by these nucleotides. pppGpp-5'-phosphohydrolase hydrolyzes the 3'-monophosphate analog pppGp equally well (apparent Km of 0.13 mM), yielding the recently identified MS III nucleotide (ppGp). pppGpp-5'-phosphohydrolase does not have RNA 5'-terminal gamma-phosphatase activity; however, 5'-terminal phosphates are released by pppGpp-5'-phosphohydrolase when the GTP-terminated RNA chains are first converted into oligonucleotides by RNase A treatment. pppGpp-5'-phosphohydrolase was found to actively hydrolyze the dinucleotide fragment pppGpNp but exhibited very low activity toward longer chain fragments. The 3'-unphosphorylated dinucleotide pppGpN was, however, not hydrolyzed. The ability of pppGpp-5'-phosphohydrolase to hydrolyze pppGpp, pppGp, and pppGpNp, but not pppG and pppGpN, indicates that pppGpp-5'-phosphohydrolase is rather nonspecific toward the 3'-OH substitutions of the substrates although a free, unsubstituted phosphate group at the 3'-OH position is essential."
https://openalex.org/W1607485493,"Catalytic and regulatory binding sites for ATP on the red cell Ca2+ pump have been investigated using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Both (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity and ATP-dependent Ca2+ flux are selectively and irreversibly inactivated by FITC and the pump is protected from FITC by the presence of ATP. The time course of inactivation by FITC is characteristically biphasic. Analysis of the kinetics of inactivation by FITC and protection by ATP reveals the participation of both high and low affinity binding sites for ATP and FITC. The sites binding ATP or reacting with FITC do not, however, appear to co-exist on the same enzyme molecules. Thus, flip-flop mechanisms for (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase, involving negative interactions between high and low affinity ATP sites, are considered unlikely. The two affinities for ATP are most simply explained by assuming that the Ca2+ pump protein exists in alternative conformational forms, E1 having a high affinity for ATP and E2 having a low affinity for ATP. Ca2+ pumping and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase involve interconversion between these forms. It is suggested that regulation of Ca2+ pump activity by Mg-ATP reflects acceleration of the conformational transition between the E1 and E2 forms, as well as a previously described acceleration of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis (Muallem, S., and Karlish, S. J. D. (1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 647, 73-86; Garrahan, P. J., and Rega, A. F. (1978) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 513, 59-65)."
https://openalex.org/W1515596817,"In primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, addition of dexamethasone (10 microM) plus glucagon (0.5 microM) caused several-fold increases in the activities of serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13), tryptophan oxygenase (EC 1.13.11.11), and tyrosine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.5) in 24 h. These inductions were inhibited by insulin. Addition of epinephrine or phenylephrine at 10 microM blocked these inductions. This suppressive effect of adrenergic compounds was completely abolished by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine at 10 microM. Immunochemical analysis with antiserum to serine dehydratase showed that the changes in enzyme activity were due to changes in the amount of enzyme. Epinephrine was effective even when glucagon was replaced by dibutyryl cAMP (50 microM), indicating that alpha-adrenergic suppression of enzyme inductions was mediated by a cAMP-independent mechanism. Furthermore, the findings that prazosin antagonized this epinephrine effect, but yohimbine did not, indicate that the alpha 1- but not the alpha 2-receptor is involved in this inhibition. However, the alpha-adrenergic effect was different from that of insulin in that, unlike the latter, the inductions of tryptophan oxygenase and tyrosine amino-transferase by dexamethasone alone were not inhibited. The alpha-adrenergic action apparently counteracts the action of glucagon and cAMP. For determination of the beta-adrenergic effect of catecholamines on the inductions of enzymes, beta-adrenergic compounds were tested without glucagon. Isoproterenol or epinephrine plus phenoxybenzamine induced tryptophan oxygenase and tyrosine aminotransferase. Induction of serine dehydratase was shown by isoproterenol only in the presence of 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. These results indicate that catecholamines play dual roles in regulation of the amount of enzyme through their alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic actions."

The reagent labels only a limited segment of the large subunit of the heterodimeric transpeptidase. Treatment of labeled and reconstituted enzyme with papain causes the release of the unlabeled catalytic domain and the cleavage of the membrane binding domain into two discrete 125I-labeled peptides. The hydrophobic peptides which remain associated with the vesicles were isolated by chromatography on Sephadex LH-60. They exhibit apparent molecular weights of 8700 and 3400. Amino acid analysis indicates that they contain 68 and 58% hydrophobic residues, respectively. The procedures developed in this study should make possible the large scale isolation of the unlabeled membrane binding domain of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase."

The MYCO-1A cell line was remutagenized, and a clone resistant to 20 microM mycophenolic acid, MYCO-1A-20, was isolated and characterized. Assays of IMP dehydrogenase activity in extracts prepared from mutant cells indicated that the enzyme behaved as a single kinetic species and that the maximal velocity of the mutant enzyme activity is 10-15-fold greater than that obtained from wild type extracts. Altered apparent Km values for substrates and the lack of normal sensitivity to mycophenolic acid of the enzymes from mutant cells imply that the mutants have an alteration in a structural gene coding for IMP dehydrogenase. Measurements of intracellular nucleotides indicated that the mycophenolic acid-resistant clones contained elevated levels of GMP and GTP. Incubation of wild type cells with 1 microM mycophenolic acid caused a depletion of intracellular GTP and GMP levels, an increase in the concentration of IMP, an increase in the total rate of de novo purine synthesis, and a massive excretion of inosine into the culture medium. Similar effects were found for MYCO-1A cells incubated with 5 microM, but not 1 microM, mycophenolic acid. However, neither purine overproduction nor nucleotide pool perturbations were observed for MYCO-1A-20 cells incubated with 25 microM mycophenolic acid. These results suggest that a genetic defect in IMP dehydrogenase activity in humans might lead to excessive purine overproduction with subsequent hyperuricemia and gout."
https://openalex.org/W1480079789,"Studies of isolated rat liver mitochondria were undertaken in order to evaluate the importance of glutamate transport, oxidation reduction state, and product inhibition on the rates of formation of ammonia from glutamate. Uptake and efflux of glutamate across the mitochondrial membrane were measured isotopically in the presence of rotenone. Efflux was stimulated by H+ in the mitochondrial matrix and was found to be first order with respect to matrix glutamate except when the matrix pH was unphysiologically low. The data suggest that the Km of matrix glutamate for efflux is decreased by H+. Matrix H+ also appeared to stimulate glutamate uptake, but the effect was to increase both the Km of medium glutamates and Vmax. Mitochondria were incubated at 15 and 28 degrees C with glutamate and malonate. Under these conditions, glutamate was metabolized only by the deamination pathway. Flux was evaluated by assay of ammonia formation. Oxidation reduction state was varied with ADP and uncoupling agents. Matrix alpha-ketoglutarate was varied either by the omission of malonate from the incubation media or by adding alpha-ketoglutarate to the external media. Influx and efflux of glutamate could be calculated from previously determined transport parameters. The difference between calculated influx and efflux was found to be equal to ammonia formation under all conditions. It was, therefore, possible to evaluate the relative contributions of oxidation reduction state, transport, and product inhibition as effectors of ammonia formation. The contribution of transport was relatively small while oxidation reduction state exerted a large influence. alpha-Ketoglutarate was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of ammonia production and glutamate dehydrogenase. Inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase by alpha-ketoglutarate was judged to be a potentially important modulator of metabolic fluxes."
https://openalex.org/W1585606515,"The quantitative characteristics of [U-14C]glutamate transport were determined in rotenone-inhibited energized rat kidney mitochondria at pH 7.0 and 28 degrees C. Glutamate efflux was observed to be first order with respect to matrix glutamate with a rate constant of 0.457 min-1. Uptake kinetic studies indicated that the Km of external glutamate was 1.4 mM and the Vmax 3.2 nmol/mg X min. These kinetic values were found to be unchanged at pH 6.6 or in mitochondria obtained from kidneys of chronically acidotic rats. Parallel studies of glutamate deamination were performed in which mitochondria were incubated in state 3, state 4, and with carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, in the presence of malonate. The oxidative deamination of glutamate determined with 1 and 10 mM glutamate never exceeded the simultaneously measured rate of glutamate transport. No glutamate was detectable within the mitochondrial matrix under the conditions of these metabolic experiments. The studies indicate that the glutamate hydroxyl transporter is quite slow and rate limiting for the oxidative deamination of external glutamate in rat kidney mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1537853340,"Phosphorylation by [gamma-32P]ATP of proteins associated with the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied both in vivo and in vitro. Although at least nine proteins are labeled in vivo, there is only one major protein labeled in vitro. This species with an apparent molecular weight of 114,000 has been identified as the plasma membrane Mg2+-ATPase. Phosphorylation of this enzyme occurs exclusively on serine residues. This is the first report that the proton-translocating ATPase of fungal plasma membranes is subject to phosphorylation by a protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1605387773,"N-(1-Anilinonaphthyl-4)maleimide (ANM) has been used to modify coupling factor 1 (CF1), the terminal coupling factor of photophosphorylation in chloroplasts. As with other monofunctional maleimides, incubation of thylakoids with ANM in the light, but not in the dark, causes energy transfer inhibition of photophosphorylation. In the dark, sites on both the gamma and epsilon subunits of CF1 are modified. The light-accessible site is also on the gamma subunit. Trypsin digestion of the enzyme after dithiothreitol activation reveals that the dark-and light-accessible sites on the gamma subunit are different amino acid residues. Fluorescence of ANM bound at the dark-and light-accessible sites has been measured after isolation of CF1 from thylakoids. The fluorescence emission maximum of ANM at the light-accessible site is blue-shifted and the quantum yield is increased 2-fold relative to ANM bound at dark-accessible sites. On the soluble enzyme, fluorescence polarization is high and equivalent for ANM bound at both dark-and light-accessible sites. Fluorescence energy transfer from a tryptophan in a hydrophilic region of the epsilon subunit to ANM bound to the epsilon subunit but not to the gamma subunit has been observed. The significance of these observations is discussed with respect to the structure of the gamma subunit and its role in conformational transitions within CF1 that occur during energization of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1496453877,"A set of chemical reactions was used to show that one glutamic acid residue at the active site of bovine lung angiotensin I-converting enzyme is esterified with the alkylating agent p-[N,N-bis(chloroethyl)amino] phenylbutyryl-L-Pro (chlorambucyl-L-Pro), an affinity label for this enzyme (Harris, R. B., and Wilson, I. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 811-815). The same procedure was used to confirm that a glutamic acid residue of carboxypeptidase A alpha is esterified by reaction with bromoacetyl-N-methyl-L-phenylalanine (Haas, G. M., and Neurath, H. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 3535-3546). In the procedure described in this paper, the esterified residue at the active site is converted to the hydroxamic acid by reaction with hydroxylamine and the hydroxamic acid is subject to the Lossen rearrangement. If a glutamic acid residue was esterified, 1 eq of 2,4-diaminobutyric acid will be formed. Aspartyl esters will give 2,3-diaminopropionic acid. The diamino acids can be quantitatively measured using the short column of an amino acid analyzer if the amount of lysine and histidine is largely decreased by modification with suitable side chain protecting groups. With carboxypeptidase A, the reactions were done on the whole undigested enzyme. With the converting enzyme, we first cleaved the esterified enzyme with cyanogen bromide. Twenty-nine cleavage peptides were separated on high performance liquid chromatography and one of these contained all of the bound radioactive inhibitor. This active site peptide was then subjected to the derivatization and Lossen procedures, and 1 eq of 2,4-diaminobutyric acid was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1558966588,"In this work we show that intact aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) and its 3' half-molecule, but not its 3' C-C-A-aa fragment, require selective ionic conditions for stimulating the mRNA-independent GTPase of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) in the presence of ribosomes.l Stimulation by aa-tRNA and its 3' half-molecule is only observed at 20 and 30 mM Mg2+ and not at 10 mM, where they exert inhibitory activity; by contrast, C-C-A-aa enhances the GTPase activity at all three of these Mg2+ concentrations. Ammonium ion is needed for stimulation by C-C-A-aa, whereas it inhibits the stimulation by aa-tRNA and its 3' half-molecule. The concentration of aminoacylated fragments needed for half-maximum stimulation follows this order: A-Val much greater than C-A-Val greater than C-C-A-Val much greater than 3' Val-tRNA1Val half-molecule greater than Val-tRNA1Val. The extent of maximum stimulation of the EF-Tu GTPase in the presence of ribosomes varies moderately depending on the aa-tRNA species; a clear dependence on the nature of the aminoacyl side chain is observed in the effects of their respective C-C-A-aa fragments tested (C-C-A-Arg, C-C-A-Val, C-C-A-Phe, C-C-A-Met, C-C-A-Lys). In the absence of ribosomes and at low [Mg2+], the one-round GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu is enhanced by C-C-A-aa fragments, whereas it is inhibited by the corresponding aa-tRNAs. Our results suggest that besides the 3' aminoacylated extremity another region(s) of the aa-tRNA molecule controls the GTPase of EF-Tu. The unspecific stimulation by C-C-A-aa and the specific, aa-tRNA-like effect of the 3' aa-tRNA half-molecule point to the importance of the T chi C loop and stem, as well as of the adjacent regions for the regulation of this function."

https://openalex.org/W1995601750,"The pluripotential hemopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) of genetically resistant Fv2rr adult C57BL/6 (B6) mice can be persistently infected by Friend virus (FV) when exposed to defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) and helper virus (LLV) at the time of transplantation into heavily irradiated syngeneic recipients (that is, B6 leads to B6 isologous chimeras). Whereas normal and LLV+ marrow were depleted of CFU-S after three serial transplantations at 14-day intervals, SFFV+ donor marrow exhibited prolonged self-renewal capacity. SFFV+ CFU-S from B6. Fv2rr chimeric mice gave rise to normal erythroid and myeloid progenitor cells and were easily detected and quantified over 17 serial marrow transfers equivalent to 260 cumulative days. Marrow cellularity on day 14 of each transfer remained constant during the entire transplantation time. When SFFV fell below detectable levels at passage 15, CFU-S self-renewal exhibited rapid and total decline. Since the frequency of LLV-infected cells in late marrow transfers rose during the period of CFU-S decline, we conclude that SFFV is directly associated with the triggering of CFU-S self-renewal. It is also suggested that this proliferative event may be a prerequisite for the development of FV-induced leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1491438064,"Given that the oxidation of nitroethane by D-amino acid oxidase proceeds through a transient carbinolamine adduct at the N5 position of the active-site FAD cofactor (Porter, D. J. T., Voet, J. G., and Bright, H. J. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4400-4416), it follows that 1-chloro-1-nitroethane should generate a stable amide at N5 and thereby function as a suicide inactivator of this enzyme. This hypothesis was validated as follows. 1-Chloro-1-nitroethane, as the nitronate ion (pKa = 7.0), inactivated D-amino acid oxidase completely with a Km value of 2 mM and a maximum rate of 0.02 s-1. The chloro and nitro groups were quantitatively recovered as free Cl- and NO2(-) after the enzyme was inactivated by 1.5 flavin equivalents of 1-chloro-1-nitroethane. Inactivation did not require O2 and was accompanied by bleaching of the flavin under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The modified coenzyme of the inactivated enzyme was identified as N5-acetyl-1,5-dihydro FAD. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of 1-chloro-1-nitroethane to acetate approximately 0.5 times as rapidly as the enzyme catalyzes suicide inactivation. The transient intermediate which is common to both the inactivation and oxidation pathways must be N5-(1-X-1-hydroxyethyl)-1,5-dihydro FAD, where X = nitro or chloro."
https://openalex.org/W1574134691,Experiments were designed to examine the early events in the initiation of glutamate deamination in kidney. Perfused kidneys from methionine sulfoximine-treated rats formed ammonia from [15N]glutamate via the purine nucleotide cycle. The turnover of the 6-amino group of adenine nucleotides to yield ammonia occurred at the rate of 0.30 mumol/g of kidney/min. This rate is 3-4 times larger than in liver and is in agreement with published rates of the purine nucleotide cycle in kidney. The addition of 0.1 mM fluorocitrate to glutamate perfusions stimulated ammonia formation 3 1/2-fold. The turnover of the 6-amino group of adenine nucleotides increased during the first 5 min after adding fluorocitrate to form ammonia predominately from tissue glutamate and aspartate. This turnover correlates with a 3 1/2-fold increase in kidney tissue IMP levels. As the ATP/ADP ratio fell the purine nucleotide cycle was inhibited and glutamate dehydrogenase was stimulated to form ammonia stoichiometric with glutamate taken up from the perfusate. Ammonia formation via glutamate dehydrogenase occurred at a rate of 1.0 mumol/g of kidney/min. Fluorocitrate completely blocked ammonia formation from aspartate in perfusions. The perfused kidney formed ammonia from aspartate via the purine nucleotide cycle at a rate of 1.0 mumol/g of kidney/min. The results indicate a discrete role for aspartate in renal metabolism. Ammonia formation via the purine nucleotide cycle can occur at significant rates and equal to the rate of ammonia formation from glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase.
https://openalex.org/W1603958693,"The transport of glutamate was studied in isolated rat liver mitochondria preloaded with glutamate in the presence of respiratory inhibitors. Glutamate efflux was initiated by dilution of the loaded mitochondria into a glutamate-free medium, and the rate of transport was measured by following the disappearance of glutamate from the mitochondrial matrix following rapid centrifugation through silicone oil. Glutamate efflux was inhibited extensively by bromcresol purple and partially by N-ethylmaleimide, compounds which are both known to inhibit mitochondrial glutamate uptake. The efflux process was stereospecific for L-glutamate and exhibited an activation energy of 19.2 kcal/mol. The rate of glutamate efflux was not affected by changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential. However, a good correlation was observed between the rate of glutamate efflux and the matrix pH, the efflux rate being stimulated by a decrease in matrix pH in the range from 8.0 to 7.2. In contrast, acidification of the incubation medium in the pH range 7.4 to 6.5 inhibited the rate of glutamate efflux. A kinetic analysis was made of the efflux reaction by a computer curve-fitting procedure which fits the experimental data to an integrated rate equation (Williamson, J.R., and Viale, R.O. (1979) Methods Enzymol. 56, 252-278). The results indicated that a fall in the matrix pH primarily caused a decrease in the K'm for matrix glutamate, with little change in V'max. In contrast, a low external pH had an effect on the V'max but not on the K'm for intramitochondrial glutamate. The results are in agreement with a symmetrical sequential model of glutamate transport where the glutamate anion binds to the protonated carrier."

https://openalex.org/W1494159186,"It has been previously shown that trypsin treatment of rat liver plasma membranes causes the solubilization of a guanylate cyclase of Mr = 140,000 (Lacombe, M. L., Haguenauer-Tsapis, R., Stengel, D., Ben Salah, A., and Hanoune, J. (1980) FEBS Lett. 116, 79-84). In this study, we observed that addition of Mn-GTP during this step greatly protected the enzyme from proteolytic degradation. This effect was specific for guanine nucleotides, being weaker for other nucleotides triphosphate and GDP, and absent for cyclic GMP and GMP. Metal-GTP complex was required with a strict specificity for Mn2+. In addition to the Mr = 140,000 enzyme, trypsin solubilization in the presence of Mn-GTP led to the formation of a small and active form of guanylate cyclase. Based on its behavior on Ultrogel AcA 34 and sucrose gradients, its apparent Mr was calculated to be 68,000. Both forms could be well separated by high performance liquid chromatography and were shown to be sequentially solubilized (the larger appearing before the smaller species). Mr = 140,000 species, but not the cytosolic enzyme, was able to generate the Mr = 68,000 enzyme upon tryptic treatment in the presence of Mn-GTP. The Mr = 140,000 and 68,000 enzymes exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Hill coefficient = 1) with Km for Mn-GTP of 130 and 70 microM, respectively. The proteolytically solubilized enzymes were strickingly heat labile and highly protected by Mn-GTP. These results support the hypothesis that the rat liver membrane-bound guanylate cyclase has a dimeric structure similar to that of the cytosolic enzyme. They also suggest a possible role for GTP in limiting the degradation rate of membrane guanylate cyclase in vivo and, thus, in regulating the active enzyme concentration."
