https://openalex.org/W3174017401,"The global supply of COVID-19 vaccines remains limited. An understanding of the immune response that is predictive of protection could facilitate rapid licensure of new vaccines. Data from a randomized efficacy trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in the United Kingdom was analyzed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2. Binding and neutralizing antibodies at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and noninfected vaccine recipients. Higher levels of all immune markers were correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. A vaccine efficacy of 80% against symptomatic infection with majority Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved with 264 (95% CI: 108, 806) binding antibody units (BAU)/ml: and 506 (95% CI: 135, not computed (beyond data range) (NC)) BAU/ml for anti-spike and anti-RBD antibodies, and 26 (95% CI: NC, NC) international unit (IU)/ml and 247 (95% CI: 101, NC) normalized neutralization titers (NF50) for pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization, respectively. Immune markers were not correlated with asymptomatic infections at the 5% significance level. These data can be used to bridge to new populations using validated assays, and allow extrapolation of efficacy estimates to new COVID-19 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3202815206,"The ordered assembly of tau protein into filaments characterizes several neurodegenerative diseases, which are called tauopathies. It was previously reported that, by cryo-electron microscopy, the structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer's disease1,2,﻿ Pick's disease3, chronic traumatic encephalopathy4 and corticobasal degeneration5 are distinct. Here we show that the structures of tau filaments from progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) define a new three-layered fold. Moreover, the structures of tau filaments from globular glial tauopathy are similar to those from PSP. The tau filament fold of argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) differs, instead resembling the four-layered fold of corticobasal degeneration. The AGD fold is also observed in ageing-related tau astrogliopathy. Tau protofilament structures from inherited cases of mutations at positions +3 or +16 in intron 10 of MAPT (the microtubule-associated protein tau gene) are also identical to those from AGD, suggesting that relative overproduction of four-repeat tau can give rise to the AGD fold. Finally, the structures of tau filaments from cases of familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia are the same as those from cases of Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy. These findings suggest a hierarchical classification of tauopathies on the basis of their filament folds, which complements clinical diagnosis and neuropathology and also allows the identification of new entities-as we show for a case diagnosed as PSP, but with filament structures that are intermediate between those of globular glial tauopathy and PSP."
https://openalex.org/W3202525453,"Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socioeconomic needs of many sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making1,2. State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536 km × 1,280 km and with lead times from 5-90 min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle."
https://openalex.org/W3136959883,"The transition metal kagome lattice materials host frustrated, correlated and topological quantum states of matter1–9. Recently, a new family of vanadium-based kagome metals, AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb or Cs), with topological band structures has been discovered10,11. These layered compounds are nonmagnetic and undergo charge density wave transitions before developing superconductivity at low temperatures11–19. Here we report the observation of unconventional superconductivity and a pair density wave (PDW) in CsV3Sb5 using scanning tunnelling microscope/spectroscopy and Josephson scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. We find that CsV3Sb5 exhibits a V-shaped pairing gap Δ ~ 0.5 meV and is a strong-coupling superconductor (2Δ/kBTc ~ 5) that coexists with 4a0 unidirectional and 2a0 × 2a0 charge order. Remarkably, we discover a 3Q PDW accompanied by bidirectional 4a0/3 spatial modulations of the superconducting gap, coherence peak and gap depth in the tunnelling conductance. We term this novel quantum state a roton PDW associated with an underlying vortex–antivortex lattice that can account for the observed conductance modulations. Probing the electronic states in the vortex halo in an applied magnetic field, in strong field that suppresses superconductivity and in zero field above Tc, reveals that the PDW is a primary state responsible for an emergent pseudogap and intertwined electronic order. Our findings show striking analogies and distinctions to the phenomenology of high-Tc cuprate superconductors, and provide groundwork for understanding the microscopic origin of correlated electronic states and superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome metals. A study reports unconventional superconductivity and a pair density wave in the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and provides a basis for understanding the microscopic origin of correlated electronic states and superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome metals."
https://openalex.org/W3204358368,"The kagome lattice of transition metal atoms provides an exciting platform to study electronic correlations in the presence of geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology1-18, which continues to bear surprises. Here, using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy, we discover a temperature-dependent cascade of different symmetry-broken electronic states in a new kagome superconductor, CsV3Sb5. We reveal, at a temperature far above the superconducting transition temperature Tc ~ 2.5 K, a tri-directional charge order with a 2a0 period that breaks the translation symmetry of the lattice. As the system is cooled down towards Tc, we observe a prominent V-shaped spectral gap opening at the Fermi level and an additional breaking of the six-fold rotational symmetry, which persists through the superconducting transition. This rotational symmetry breaking is observed as the emergence of an additional 4a0 unidirectional charge order and strongly anisotropic scattering in differential conductance maps. The latter can be directly attributed to the orbital-selective renormalization of the vanadium kagome bands. Our experiments reveal a complex landscape of electronic states that can coexist on a kagome lattice, and highlight intriguing parallels to high-Tc superconductors and twisted bilayer graphene."
https://openalex.org/W3200964027,"The use of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in organic solar cells has led to power conversion efficiencies as high as 18%1. However, organic solar cells are still less efficient than inorganic solar cells, which typically have power conversion efficiencies of more than 20%2. A key reason for this difference is that organic solar cells have low open-circuit voltages relative to their optical bandgaps3, owing to non-radiative recombination4. For organic solar cells to compete with inorganic solar cells in terms of efficiency, non-radiative loss pathways must be identified and suppressed. Here we show that in most organic solar cells that use NFAs, the majority of charge recombination under open-circuit conditions proceeds via the formation of non-emissive NFA triplet excitons; in the benchmark PM6:Y6 blend5, this fraction reaches 90%, reducing the open-circuit voltage by 60 mV. We prevent recombination via this non-radiative channel by engineering substantial hybridization between the NFA triplet excitons and the spin-triplet charge-transfer excitons. Modelling suggests that the rate of back charge transfer from spin-triplet charge-transfer excitons to molecular triplet excitons may be reduced by an order of magnitude, enabling re-dissociation of the spin-triplet charge-transfer exciton. We demonstrate NFA systems in which the formation of triplet excitons is suppressed. This work thus provides a design pathway for organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 20% or more."
https://openalex.org/W3202652874,"The Wigner crystal1 has fascinated condensed matter physicists for nearly 90 years2-14. Signatures of two-dimensional (2D) Wigner crystals were first observed in 2D electron gases under high magnetic field2-4, and recently reported in transition metal dichalcogenide moiré superlattices6-9. Direct observation of the 2D Wigner crystal lattice in real space, however, has remained an outstanding challenge. Conventional scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has sufficient spatial resolution but induces perturbations that can potentially alter this fragile state. Here we demonstrate real-space imaging of 2D Wigner crystals in WSe2/WS2 moiré heterostructures using a specially designed non-invasive STM spectroscopy technique. This employs a graphene sensing layer held close to the WSe2/WS2 moiré superlattice. Local STM tunnel current into the graphene layer is modulated by the underlying Wigner crystal electron lattice in the WSe2/WS2 heterostructure. Different Wigner crystal lattice configurations at fractional electron fillings of n = 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3, where n is the electron number per site, are directly visualized. The n = 1/3 and n = 2/3 Wigner crystals exhibit triangular and honeycomb lattices, respectively, to minimize nearest-neighbour occupations. The n = 1/2 state spontaneously breaks the original C3 symmetry and forms a stripe phase. Our study lays a solid foundation for understanding Wigner crystal states in WSe2/WS2 moiré heterostructures and provides an approach that is generally applicable for imaging novel correlated electron lattices in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W3202213959,"Abstract The densification of integrated circuits requires thermal management strategies and high thermal conductivity materials 1–3 . Recent innovations include the development of materials with thermal conduction anisotropy, which can remove hotspots along the fast-axis direction and provide thermal insulation along the slow axis 4,5 . However, most artificially engineered thermal conductors have anisotropy ratios much smaller than those seen in naturally anisotropic materials. Here we report extremely anisotropic thermal conductors based on large-area van der Waals thin films with random interlayer rotations, which produce a room-temperature thermal anisotropy ratio close to 900 in MoS 2 , one of the highest ever reported. This is enabled by the interlayer rotations that impede the through-plane thermal transport, while the long-range intralayer crystallinity maintains high in-plane thermal conductivity. We measure ultralow thermal conductivities in the through-plane direction for MoS 2 (57 ± 3 mW m −1 K −1 ) and WS 2 (41 ± 3 mW m −1 K −1 ) films, and we quantitatively explain these values using molecular dynamics simulations that reveal one-dimensional glass-like thermal transport. Conversely, the in-plane thermal conductivity in these MoS 2 films is close to the single-crystal value. Covering nanofabricated gold electrodes with our anisotropic films prevents overheating of the electrodes and blocks heat from reaching the device surface. Our work establishes interlayer rotation in crystalline layered materials as a new degree of freedom for engineering-directed heat transport in solid-state systems."
https://openalex.org/W3202239352,"Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has recently gained interest as a potential anti-ageing treatment for organisms from Drosophila to humans1-5. TRF restricts food intake to specific hours of the day. Because TRF controls the timing of feeding, rather than nutrient or caloric content, TRF has been hypothesized to depend on circadian-regulated functions; the underlying molecular mechanisms of its effects remain unclear. Here, to exploit the genetic tools and well-characterized ageing markers of Drosophila, we developed an intermittent TRF (iTRF) dietary regimen that robustly extended fly lifespan and delayed the onset of ageing markers in the muscles and gut. We found that iTRF enhanced circadian-regulated transcription and that iTRF-mediated lifespan extension required both circadian regulation and autophagy, a conserved longevity pathway. Night-specific induction of autophagy was both necessary and sufficient to extend lifespan on an ad libitum diet and also prevented further iTRF-mediated lifespan extension. By contrast, day-specific induction of autophagy did not extend lifespan. Thus, these results identify circadian-regulated autophagy as a critical contributor to iTRF-mediated health benefits in Drosophila. Because both circadian regulation and autophagy are highly conserved processes in human ageing, this work highlights the possibility that behavioural or pharmaceutical interventions that stimulate circadian-regulated autophagy might provide people with similar health benefits, such as delayed ageing and lifespan extension."
https://openalex.org/W3096926914,"Human exposure to toxic mercury (Hg) is dominated by the consumption of seafood1,2. Earth system models suggest that Hg in marine ecosystems is supplied by atmospheric wet and dry Hg(II) deposition, with a three times smaller contribution from gaseous Hg(0) uptake3,4. Observations of marine Hg(II) deposition and Hg(0) gas exchange are sparse, however5, leaving the suggested importance of Hg(II) deposition6 ill-constrained. Here we present the first Hg stable isotope measurements of total Hg (tHg) in surface and deep Atlantic and Mediterranean seawater and use them to quantify atmospheric Hg deposition pathways. We observe overall similar tHg isotope compositions, with median Δ200Hg signatures of 0.02‰, lying in between atmospheric Hg(0) and Hg(II) deposition end-members. We use a Δ200Hg isotope mass balance to estimate that seawater tHg can be explained by the mixing of 42% (median; interquartile range, 24-50%) atmospheric Hg(II) gross deposition and 58% (50-76%) Hg(0) gross uptake. We measure and compile additional, global marine Hg isotope data including particulate Hg, sediments and biota and observe a latitudinal Δ200Hg gradient that indicates larger ocean Hg(0) uptake at high latitudes. Our findings suggest that global atmospheric Hg(0) uptake by the oceans is equal to Hg(II) deposition, which has implications for our understanding of atmospheric Hg dispersal and marine ecosystem recovery."

https://openalex.org/W3203732228,"In 1878, Lord Rayleigh observed the highly celebrated phenomenon of sound waves that creep around the curved gallery of St Paul's Cathedral in London1,2. These whispering-gallery waves scatter efficiently with little diffraction around an enclosure and have since found applications in ultrasonic fatigue and crack testing, and in the optical sensing of nanoparticles or molecules using silica microscale toroids. Recently, intense research efforts have focused on exploring non-Hermitian systems with cleverly matched gain and loss, facilitating unidirectional invisibility and exotic characteristics of exceptional points3,4. Likewise, the surge in physics using topological insulators comprising non-trivial symmetry-protected phases has laid the groundwork in reshaping highly unconventional avenues for robust and reflection-free guiding and steering of both sound and light5,6. Here we construct a topological gallery insulator using sonic crystals made of thermoplastic rods that are decorated with carbon nanotube films, which act as a sonic gain medium by virtue of electro-thermoacoustic coupling. By engineering specific non-Hermiticity textures to the activated rods, we are able to break the chiral symmetry of the whispering-gallery modes, which enables the out-coupling of topological 'audio lasing' modes with the desired handedness. We foresee that these findings will stimulate progress in non-destructive testing and acoustic sensing."

To correlate such multimodal information across thousands of single cells in mouse brain tissue sections, we use integrated spatial genomics, imaging thousands of genomic loci along with RNAs and epigenetic markers simultaneously in individual cells. We reveal that cell type–specific association and scaffolding of DNA loci around nuclear bodies organize the nuclear architecture and correlate with differential expression levels in different cell types. At the submegabase level, active and inactive X chromosomes access similar domain structures in single cells despite distinct epigenetic and expression states. This work represents a major step forward in linking single-cell three-dimensional nuclear architecture, gene expression, and epigenetic modifications in a native tissue context."

Haematopoiesis first emerges in human BM at 11-12 weeks after conception1,2, yet almost nothing is known about how fetal BM (FBM) evolves to meet the highly specialized needs of the fetus and newborn. Here we detail the development of FBM, including stroma, using multi-omic assessment of mRNA and multiplexed protein epitope expression. We find that the full blood and immune cell repertoire is established in FBM in a short time window of 6-7 weeks early in the second trimester. FBM promotes rapid and extensive diversification of myeloid cells, with granulocytes, eosinophils and dendritic cell subsets emerging for the first time. The substantial expansion of B lymphocytes in FBM contrasts with fetal liver at the same gestational age. Haematopoietic progenitors from fetal liver, FBM and cord blood exhibit transcriptional and functional differences that contribute to tissue-specific identity and cellular diversification. Endothelial cell types form distinct vascular structures that we show are regionally compartmentalized within FBM. Finally, we reveal selective disruption of B lymphocyte, erythroid and myeloid development owing to a cell-intrinsic differentiation bias as well as extrinsic regulation through an altered microenvironment in Down syndrome (trisomy 21)."

These layered compounds are nonmagnetic and undergo charge density wave (CDW) transitions before developing superconductivity at low temperatures. Here we report the observation of unconventional superconductivity and pair density wave (PDW) in the vanadium-based kagome metal CsV3Sb5 using scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and Josephson STS. The differential conductance exhibits a V-shaped pairing gap Δ~0.5 meV below a transition temperature Tc~2.3 K. Superconducting phase coherence is observed by Josephson effect and Cooper-pair tunneling using a superconducting tip. We find that CsV3Sb5 is a strong-coupling superconductor (2∆/kBTc~5) and coexists with long-range 4a0 unidirectional and 2×2 charge order. Remarkably, we discover a bidirectional PDW accompanied by 4a0/3 spatial modulations of the coherence peak and gap-depth in the tunneling conductance. We term this novel quantum state a roton-PDW that can produce a commensurate vortex-antivortex lattice and account for the observed conductance modulations. Above Tc, we observe a large V-shaped pseudogap in the 4a0 unidirectional and 2a0 bidirectional CDW state. Electron-phonon calculations attribute the 2×2 CDW to phonon softening induced structural reconstruction, but the phonon mediated pairing cannot describe the observed strong-coupling superconductor. Our findings show that electron correlations drive the 4a0 unidirectional CDW, unconventional superconductivity, and roton-PDW with striking analogies and distinctions to the phenomenology of high-Tc cuprate superconductors, and provide groundwork for understanding their microscopic origins in vanadium-based kagome superconductors."

Although the elementary reaction pathways for ionized water have been studied, the short-lived intermediate complex and structural dynamic response after the proton transfer reaction remain poorly understood. Using a liquid-phase ultrafast electron diffraction technique to measure the intermolecular oxygen···oxygen and oxygen···hydrogen bonds, we captured the short-lived radical-cation complex OH(H3O+) that was formed within 140 femtoseconds through a direct oxygen···oxygen bond contraction and proton transfer, followed by the radical-cation pair dissociation and the subsequent structural relaxation of water within 250 femtoseconds. These measurements provide direct evidence of capturing this metastable radical-cation complex before separation, thereby improving our fundamental understanding of elementary reaction dynamics in ionized liquid water."

https://openalex.org/W3202543093,"During sleep, most animal species enter a state of reduced consciousness characterized by a marked sensory disconnect. Yet some processing of the external world must remain intact, given that a sleeping animal can be awoken by intense stimuli (for example, a loud noise or a bright light) or by soft but qualitatively salient stimuli (for example, the sound of a baby cooing or hearing one's own name1-3). How does a sleeping brain retain the ability to process the quality of sensory information? Here we present a paradigm to study the functional underpinnings of sensory discrimination during sleep in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that sleeping vinegar flies, like humans, discern the quality of sensory stimuli and are more likely to wake up in response to salient stimuli. We also show that the salience of a stimulus during sleep can be modulated by internal states. We offer a prototypical blueprint detailing a circuit involved in this process and its modulation as evidence that the system can be used to explore the cellular underpinnings of how a sleeping brain experiences the world."
https://openalex.org/W3204857201,"Prokaryotes adapt to challenges from mobile genetic elements by integrating spacers derived from foreign DNA in the CRISPR array1. Spacer insertion is carried out by the Cas1–Cas2 integrase complex2,3,4. A substantial fraction of CRISPR–Cas systems use a Fe–S cluster containing Cas4 nuclease to ensure that spacers are acquired from DNA flanked by a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)5,6 and inserted into the CRISPR array unidirectionally, so that the transcribed CRISPR RNA can guide target searching in a PAM-dependent manner. Here we provide a high-resolution mechanistic explanation for the Cas4-assisted PAM selection, spacer biogenesis and directional integration by type I-G CRISPR in Geobacter sulfurreducens, in which Cas4 is naturally fused with Cas1, forming Cas4/Cas1. During biogenesis, only DNA duplexes possessing a PAM-embedded 3′-overhang trigger Cas4/Cas1–Cas2 assembly. During this process, the PAM overhang is specifically recognized and sequestered, but is not cleaved by Cas4. This ‘molecular constipation’ prevents the PAM-side prespacer from participating in integration. Lacking such sequestration, the non-PAM overhang is trimmed by host nucleases and integrated to the leader-side CRISPR repeat. Half-integration subsequently triggers PAM cleavage and Cas4 dissociation, allowing spacer-side integration. Overall, the intricate molecular interaction between Cas4 and Cas1–Cas2 selects PAM-containing prespacers for integration and couples the timing of PAM processing with the stepwise integration to establish directionality."

https://openalex.org/W3203922860,"Inosine monophosphate (IMP) is the intracellular precursor for both adenosine monophosphate and guanosine monophosphate and thus plays a central role in intracellular purine metabolism. IMP can also serve as an extracellular signaling molecule, and can regulate diverse processes such as taste sensation, neutrophil function, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. How IMP regulates inflammation induced by bacterial products or bacteria is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that IMP suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production and augmented IL-10 production in endotoxemic mice. IMP exerted its effects through metabolism to inosine, as IMP only suppressed TNF-α following its CD73-mediated degradation to inosine in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. Studies with gene targeted mice and pharmacological antagonism indicated that A2A , A2B, and A3 adenosine receptors are not required for the inosine suppression of TNF-α production. The inosine suppression of TNF-α production did not require its metabolism to hypoxanthine through purine nucleoside phosphorylase or its uptake into cells through concentrative nucleoside transporters indicating a role for alternative metabolic/uptake pathways. Inosine augmented IL-β production by macrophages in which inflammasome was activated by lipopolysaccharide and ATP. In contrast to its effects in endotoxemia, IMP failed to affect the inflammatory response to abdominal sepsis and pneumonia. We conclude that extracellular IMP and inosine differentially regulate the inflammatory response."

As of Mid-June 2021, over 1500 SARS-CoV-2 genomesequences have been deposited in the GISAID database from Bangladesh which were extracted and categorized into two waves. By analyzing these genome sequences, it was discovered that the wave-2 samples had a significantly greater average rate of mutation/sample (30.79%) than the wave-1 samples (12.32%). Wave-2 samples also had a higher frequency of deletion, and transversion events. During the first wave, the GR clade was the most predominant but it was replaced by the GH clade in the latter wave. The B.1.1.25 variant showed the highest frequency in wave-1 while in case of wave-2, the B.1.351.3 variant, was the most common one. A notable presence of the delta variant, which is currently at the center of concern, was also observed. Comparison of the Spike protein found in the reference and the 3 most common lineages found in Bangladesh namely, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617 in terms of their ability to form stable complexes with ACE2 receptor revealed that B.1.617 had the potential to be more transmissible than others.

The breadth of Leptospira diversity associated with both human and animal disease poses major logistical challenges to the use of classical diagnostic techniques, and increasingly molecular diagnostic tools are used for their detection. In New Zealand, this has resulted in an increase in positive cases reported nationally that have not been attributed to the infecting serovar or genomospecies. In this study, we used data from all pathogenic Leptospira genomes to identify a partial region of the glmU gene as a suitable locus for the discrimination of the infecting species and serovars of New Zealand-endemic Leptospira . This method can be used in culture and culture-independent scenarios making it flexible for diagnostics in humans, animals, and environmental samples. We explored the use of this locus as a molecular barcoding tool via the Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing platform MinION. Sequences obtained by this method allowed specific identification of Leptospira species in mixed and enriched environmental cultures, however read error inherent in the MinION sequencing system reduced the accuracy of strain/variant identification. Using this approach to characterise Leptospira in enriched environmental cultures, we detected the likely presence of Leptospira genomospecies that have not been reported in New Zealand to date.

https://openalex.org/W3202344594,"Obesity arising from excessive dietary fat intake is a risk factor for cognitive decline, dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we studied the effect of long-term high-fat diet (HFD) (24 weeks) and return to normal diet (ND) on behavioral features, microglia and neurons in adult male C57BL/6J mice. Consequences of HFD-induced obesity and dietary changes on general health (coat appearance, presence of vibrissae), sensory and motor reflexes, learning and memory were assessed by applying a phenotypic assessment protocol, the Y maze and Morris Water Maze test. Neurons and microglia were histologically analyzed within the mediobasal hypothalamus, hippocampus and frontal motor cortex after long-term HFD and change of diet. Long periods of HFD caused general health issues (coat alterations, loss of vibrissae), but did not affect sensory and motor reflexes, emotional state, memory and learning. Long-term HFD increased the microglial response (increased Iba1 fluorescence intensity, percentage of Iba1-stained area and Iba1 gene expression) within the hypothalamus, but not in the cortex and hippocampus. In neither of these regions, neurodegeneration or intracellular lipid droplet accumulation was observed. The former alterations were reversible in mice whose diet was changed from HFD to ND. Taken together, long periods of excessive dietary fat alone do not cause learning deficits or spatial memory impairment, though HFD-induced obesity may have detrimental consequences for cognitive flexibility. Our data confirm the selective responsiveness of hypothalamic microglia to HFD."

https://openalex.org/W3204938861,"Abstract It is unclear how loss-of-function germline mutations in the widely-expressed co-chaperone AIP , result in young-onset growth hormone secreting pituitary tumours. The RET receptor, uniquely co-expressed in somatotrophs with PIT1, induces apoptosis when unliganded, while RET supports cell survival when it is bound to its ligand. We demonstrate that at the plasma membrane, AIP is required to form a complex with monomeric-intracellular-RET, caspase-3 and PKCδ resulting in PIT1/CDKN2A-ARF/p53-apoptosis pathway activation. AIP-deficiency blocks RET/caspase-3/PKCδ activation preventing PIT1 accumulation and apoptosis. The presence or lack of the inhibitory effect on RET-induced apoptosis separated pathogenic AIP variants from non-pathogenic ones. We used virogenomics in neonatal rats to demonstrate the effect of mutant AIP protein on the RET apoptotic pathway in vivo. In adult male rats altered AIP induces elevated IGF-1 and gigantism, with pituitary hyperplasia through blocking the RET-apoptotic pathway. In females, pituitary hyperplasia is induced but IGF-1 rise and gigantism are blunted by puberty. Somatotroph adenomas from pituitary-specific Aip -knockout mice overexpress the RET-ligand GDNF, therefore, upregulating the survival pathway. Somatotroph adenomas from patients with or without AIP mutation abundantly express GDNF, but AIP -mutated tissues have less CDKN2A-ARF expression. Our findings explain the tissue-specific mechanism of AIP-induced somatotrophinomas and provide a previously unknown tumorigenic mechanism, opening treatment avenues for AIP -related tumours."
https://openalex.org/W3204748229,"Background Data of critically ill COVID-19 patients are being evaluated worldwide, not only to understand the various aspects of the disease and to refine treatment strategies but also to improve clinical decision-making. For clinical decision-making in particular, prognostic factors of a lethal course of the disease would be highly relevant. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed the first 59 adult critically ill Covid-19 patients treated in one of the intensive care units of the University Medical Center Regensburg, Germany. Using uni- and multivariable regression models, we extracted a set of parameters that allowed for prognosing in-hospital mortality. Results Within the cohort, 19 patients died (mortality 32.2%). Blood pH value, mean arterial pressure, base excess, troponin, and procalcitonin were identified as highly significant prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. However, no significant differences were found for other parameters expected to be relevant prognostic factors, like low arterial partial pressure of oxygen or high lactate levels. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the pH value and the mean arterial pressure turned out to be the most influential prognostic factors for a lethal course."
https://openalex.org/W3203982701,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease in children. The serum level of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) is a useful AD index to reflect disease severity; however, it requires blood collection from young children. In comparison, urine samples are easier to collect in a pediatric clinical setting. Here, we analyzed the lipids excreted in urine to identify a diagnostic biomarker for AD. We generated a murine dermatitis model by repeated topical application of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) or tape-stripping the dorsal skin. Lipid metabolites excreted in the urine were comprehensively analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To corroborate our findings, we also analyzed urine samples from patients with AD. DNFB application induced AD-like skin lesions, including epidermal thickening, infiltration of eosinophils and T cells, and an increase in Th2 cytokine levels. Assessment of lipids excreted in urine showed a dominance of prostaglandins (PGs), namely, a PGF2α metabolite (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-tetranor-PGF1α ), a PGE2 metabolite (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-tetranor-PGE2 ), and a PGD2 metabolite (13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGJ2 ). mRNA and protein expression of PGF2α , PGE2 , and PGD2 synthase was upregulated in DNFB-treated skin. The tape-stripping model also caused dermatitis but without Th2 inflammation; urine PGF2α and PGD2 metabolite levels remained unaffected. Finally, we confirmed that the urinary levels of the aforementioned PG metabolites, as well as PGI2 metabolite, 6,15-diketo-13,14-dihydro-PGF1α and arachidonic acid metabolite, 17-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17-HETE) increased in patients with AD. Our data highlights the unique urinary lipid profile in patients with AD, which may provide insight into novel urinary biomarkers for AD diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3202034743,"Ultrasonography is widely used to measure gastrocnemius muscle architecture; however, it is unclear if values obtained from digitised images are sensitive enough to track architectural responses to clinical interventions. The purpose of this study was to explore the reliability and determine the minimal detectable change (MDC) of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) muscle architecture using ultrasound in a clinical setting. A trained sonographer obtained three B-mode images from each of the GM and GL muscles in 87 volunteers (44 males, 43 females; 22±9 years of age) on two separate occasions. Three independent investigators received training, then digitised the images to determine intra-rater, inter-rater, and test-retest reliability for fascicle length (FL), pennation angle (θ) and muscle thickness. Median FL, θ, and muscle thickness for GM and GL were 53.6–55.7 mm and 65.8–69.3 mm, 18.7–19.5° and 11.9–12.5°, and 12.8–13.2 mm and 15.9–16.9 mm, respectively. Intra- and inter-rater reliability of manual digitisation was excellent for all parameters. Test-retest reliability was moderate to excellent with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values ≥0.80 for FL, ≥0.61 for θ, and ≥0.81 for muscle thickness, in both GM and GL. The respective MDC for GM and GL FL, θ, and muscle thickness was ≤12.1 mm and ≤18.00 mm, ≤6.4° and ≤4.2°, and ≤3.2 mm and ≤3.1 mm. Although reliable, the relatively large MDC suggest that clinically derived ultrasound measurements of muscle architecture in GM and GL are more likely to be useful to detect differences between populations than to detect changes in muscle architecture following interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3202340498,"Vulnerability to climate change is highly dynamic, varying between and within communities over different timescales. This paper draws upon complex adaptive systems thinking to develop an approach for capturing, understanding, and monitoring climate vulnerability in a case study from northern Canada, focusing on Inuit food systems. In the community of Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, we followed 10 hunters over a 2-year period, asking them to document their harvesting activities and discuss their lived experience of harvesting under changing environmental and societal conditions. GPS monitoring and participatory mapping sessions were used to document 23,996km of trails ( n = 409), with conversational bi-weekly semi-structured interviews and secondary instrumental weather data used to contextualise climate change within a nexus of other socioeconomic, cultural, and political stressors that also affect harvesting. Our results demonstrate that climate change has considerable potential to affect harvesting activities, particularly when its impacts manifest as anomalous/extreme events. However, climate change impacts are not necessarily the most salient issues affecting harvesting on a day-to-day basis. Instead, factors relating to economics (particularly financial capital and the wage-based economy), social networks, and institutions are found to have a greater influence, either as standalone factors with cascading effects or when acting synchronously to augment the impacts of environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W3204188369,"Apoptosis is a programmed cell death that efficiently removes damaged cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Defect in apoptotic machinery can lead to tumor development, progression, and resistance to chemotherapy. PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) and BAX (BCL2-associated X protein) are among the most well-known inducers of apoptosis. It has been reported that expression levels of BAX and PUMA are controlled at the posttranslational level by phosphorylation. However, the posttranslational regulation of these proapoptotic proteins remains largely unexplored. In this study, using biochemical, molecular biology, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemistry techniques, we show that PUMA and BAX are the direct target of the F-box protein FBXL20, which restricts their cellular levels. FBXL20 directs the proteasomal degradation of PUMA and BAX in a protein kinase AKT1-dependent manner to promote cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. Interestingly, inactivation of AKT1 results in activation of another protein kinase GSK3α/β, which facilitates the proteasomal degradation of FBXL20 by another F-box protein, FBXO31. Thus, a switch between two signaling kinases AKT1 and GSK3α/β modulates the functional activity of these proapoptotic regulators, thereby determining cell survival or death. RNAi-mediated ablation of FBXL20 results in increased levels of PUMA as well as BAX, which further enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. We showed that high level expression of FBXL20 in cancer cells reduces therapeutic drug-induced apoptosis and promotes chemoresistance. Overall, this study highlights the importance of targeting FBXL20 in cancers in conjunction with chemotherapy and may represent a promising anticancer strategy to overcome chemoresistance.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of targeting FBXL20 in cancers in conjunction with chemotherapy and may represent a promising anticancer strategy to overcome chemoresistance. The phenomenon of programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a conserved cellular mechanism to maintain homeostasis during development and aging (1Elmore S. Apoptosis: A review of programmed cell death.Toxicol. Pathol. 2007; 35: 495-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (7813) Google Scholar). Cells undergo apoptosis by two distinct pathways, namely intrinsic and extrinsic pathway. BCL2 family proteins (BCL-2 homology domain containing proteins) play important roles in determining the cell fate by regulating the mitochondrial membrane potential in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. BCL-2 family proteins are classified into antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins. PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) and BAX (BCL2-associated X protein) are most well-known apoptotic inducers. Under normal condition, apoptotic activity of BAX is impaired by inhibitory interactions with antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins (2Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y.

Upon death stimuli, PUMA contributes to the induction of apoptosis by promoting the disruption of BAX-BCL2 interaction and thereby release BAX from BAX-BCL2 complex (5Yu J. Zhang L.

Released BAX is then oligomerized on the mitochondrial membrane to lower the membrane potential, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptosis (7Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Bax directly induces release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, presence of p53 activity in tumor increases the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs through facilitating the induction of apoptosis. PUMA is also been shown to be regulated by other transcription factors such as p73, E2F1, and FOXO3a (13Melino G. Bernassola F. Ranalli M. Yee K. Zong W.X. Corazzari M. Knight R.A. Green D.R.

However, mechanistic basis of proteasomal regulation of PUMA and BAX by E3 ubiquitin ligases is largely unknown. Human genome encodes for approximately 600 E3 ubiquitin ligases among which RING finger SCF (SKP1-Cullin1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligases are well studied and best known for targeting phosphorylated proteins for promoting their proteasomal degradation. SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases comprise of three invariable components (SKP1, Cullin1, and RBX1) and a variable component - F-box proteins. F-box proteins are associated with SKP1 through their conserved F-box motif to form SCF complex and function as substrate receptor (22Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Ubiquitin ligases: Cell-cycle control and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 23Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W. Systematic analysis and nomenclature of mammalian F-box proteins.Genes Dev. 2004; 8: 2573-2580Crossref Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Typically, F-box proteins recognize phosphorylated substrates and promote their polyubiquitination. Previous reports showed that phosphorylated form of PUMA and BAX is less stable than nonphosphorylated form, indicating that SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) might be involved in destabilization of PUMA and BAX (17Fricker M.

We show that FBXL20 regulates PUMA and BAX at the posttranslational level by promoting their degradation through 26S proteasome. FBXL20-mediated degradation of PUMA and BAX reduces the potency of chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis and thereby promotes tumor growth. Our study revealed that inactivation of AKT1 results in the stabilization of BAX and PUMA due to the proteasomal degradation of FBXL20 by SCFFBXO31 E3 ubiquitin ligase in GSK3α/β-dependent manner. Thus, our study delineates an important cellular signaling pathway required to maintain the basal levels of proapoptotic regulators. Overall, we propose that targeting FBXL20 in cancers in conjunction with chemotherapy may be a promising anticancer strategy. Proapoptotic genes, PUMA and BAX, are expressed at low levels in unstressed proliferating cells and rapidly induced in response to wide range of cellular stresses (5Yu J. Zhang L.

Med. 2006; 203: 1657-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicated that stability of PUMA and BAX is also regulated at the posttranslational level (17Fricker M. O'Prey J. Tolkovsky A.M. Ryan K.M. Phosphorylation of Puma modulates its apoptotic function by regulating protein stability.Cell Death Dis. 2010; 1e59Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Sandow J.J. Jabbour A.M. Condina M.R.

A. 2000; 97: 3850-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We therefore presumed that PUMA and BAX might be regulated at the proteasomal level and performed a screen wherein we ectopically expressed ORFs of 54 SCF-F-box proteins to identify putative F-box protein(s) that may regulate PUMA. From this screen, F box protein FBXL20 emerged as the potential candidate that reduced PUMA levels upon ectopic expression (Figs. 1A and S1A). Interestingly, we found that ectopically expressed FBXL20 also reduced BAX levels (Figs. 1A and S1A). To determine whether FBXL20 maintains physiological levels of PUMA and BAX, we generated FBXL20 stable knockdown (FBXL20-KD) MCF7 cells using two unrelated lentiviral shRNAs. As compared with the cells expressing nonsilencing shRNA (NS), the levels of PUMA and BAX were significantly increased in FBXL20-KD cells (Figs. 1B and S1B), while the levels of BIM and BCL2 were not affected by FBXL20 knockdown. However, the transcript levels of both PUMA and BAX were not altered in FBXL20-depleted cells (Fig. S1C). An increase in PUMA and BAX levels upon FBXL20 knockdown in MCF7 cells indicated that FBXL20-depleted cells could be more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs than wild-type NS cells. We therefore performed a series of experiments to examine the sensitivity of FBXL20 knockdown cells to Doxorubicin (DOXO) and Camptothecin (CPT). First, we performed MTT assay in MCF7 cells expressing NS and FBXL20 shRNA with varying concentrations of either DOXO or CPT and evaluated 50% growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) of these drugs. As shown in Figure 1C, the IC50 values of DOXO were ∼2.7 fold less in FBXL20 knockdown cells (IC50 0.18 ± 0.05 μM) than that in NS cells (IC50 0.5 ± 0.09 μM). Consistent with this result, the IC50 values of CPT were also approximately threefold lower in FBXl20-KD cells (IC50 1.0 ± 0.25 μM) as compared with NS cells (IC50 3.0 ± 0.1 μM) (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrated that FBXL20 depletion increased the sensitivity to Doxorubicin or Camptothecin. We then performed clonogenic survival assay and results showed that FBXL20-KD cells showed an increased sensitivity to DOXO or CPT as compared with the NS cells treated with DMSO (Figs. 1, D and E and S1D). In contrast, knockdown of PUMA in FBXL20-KD cells resulted in formation of increased number of colonies as compared with FBXL20-KD cells treated with either DOXO or CPT indicating that increased levels of PUMA in FBXL20-KD increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, at least in part (Fig. 1, D and E). Next, we determined the apoptotic index of MCF7 cells expressing either NS shRNA or FBXL20 shRNA, or coexpressing FBXL20 and PUMA shRNAs or coexpressing FBXL20 shRNA and BAX shRNA following treatment of DOXO. FACS analysis of Annexin-V/7-AAD stained cells revealed that percentage of apoptotic cells was increased in FBXL20-KD cells as compared with NS cells, which further increased following treatment with DOXO or CPT (Figs. 1F and S1E). However, codepletion of PUMA or BAX in FBXL20 knockdown cells decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells as compared with the FBXL20-KD cells alone (Figs. 1F and S1E). We next performed comet assay to determine whether increased level of apoptosis of DOXO/CPT treated FBXL20-KD cells was due to induction of DNA fragmentation. The results of comet assay demonstrated that FBXL20-KD cells were more susceptible to DNA fragmentation (as evident by the appearance of higher percentage of apoptotic comets and DNA in tail) as compared with the NS cells following treatment with either DOXO or CPT (Fig. 1, G and H). However, the extent of DNA tailing was significantly reduced upon knocked down of PUMA in FBXL20-KD cells, indicating that accumulated PUMA in FBXL20-KD cells could be responsible for induction of severe DNA damage (Fig. 1H). Conversely, ectopic expression of FBXL20 decreased DNA fragmentation and DNA tailing following treatment with either DOXO or CPT (Fig. S1, F and G). In addition to this, an ectopic expression of FBXL20 also inhibited the cleavage of caspase 9 and PARP1 induced by DOXO treatment, suggesting the role of FBXL20 in counteracting apoptosis (Fig. S1H). Mitochondrial membrane potential alteration is one of the markers routinely measured to detect apoptotic cells. We then monitored the mitochondrial membrane potential using JC1 dye, which exhibits potential dependent fluorescence emission shift from red to green upon induction of intrinsic apoptosis. FACS analysis of cells expressing either vector or FBXL20, treated with CPT, and stained with JC1 dye showed that FBXL20 expressing cells display substantially less emission shift as compared with the cells expressing vector (Fig. 1I). BAX oligomerization on mitochondrial outer membrane leads to membrane polarization, release of cytochrome c, and induction of apoptosis (9Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J.

Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). We found that FBXL20 also negatively regulates BAX (Fig. 1, A and B); we therefore, assessed the extent of BAX oligomerization in FBXL20-KD cells following treatment with Doxorubicin. Immunoblotting data showed that knockdown of FBXL20 resulted in an elevated level of BAX oligomers, which was further increased upon Doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1J). DNA damaged-induced increased oligomerization of BAX in FBXL20-KD cells could be due to either the increased expression levels of BAX or the increased disruption of BAX-BCL2 interaction resulting from the increased levels of PUMA. To address these possibilities, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assay to examine BAX and BCL2 interaction in MCF7 cells expressing NS and FBXL20 shRNA treated with and without Doxorubicin. Immunoblotting results of immunoprecipitates showed that BAX and BCL2 interaction was disrupted in NS and FBXL20-KD cells treated with Doxorubicin (Fig. S1I). Therefore, increased oligomerization of BAX in FBXL20-KD cells could be due to both increase levels of BAX as well as disruption of BCL2-BAX interaction. Collectively, these results suggest that FBXL20 inhibits the induction of apoptosis by reducing the expression levels of proapoptotic proteins PUMA and BAX. We next sought to understand the mechanism(s) by which FBXL20 regulates PUMA and BAX. To understand how FBXL20 reduces the levels of PUMA and BAX, we first examined mRNA level of PUMA and BAX upon ectopic expression of FBXL20. Real-time RT-PCR results showed that ectopic expression FBXL20 in MCF7 cells did not affect the mRNA levels of PUMA and BAX (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, protein levels of PUMA and BAX are significantly reduced by FBXL20 (Figs. 1A and S1, A and B). Generally, F-box proteins function by modulating activity of their substrates at the proteasomal level. We then examined whether PUMA and BAX are substrates of FBXL20 and are regulated at the proteasomal level. Consistent with this idea, treatment of cells with proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 inhibited the ability of FBXL20 to reduce expression levels of PUMA and BAX (Fig. 2C). This suggested that FBXL20-mediated reduction of PUMA and BAX protein level is a posttranscriptional event. Preceding results demonstrated that PUMA and BAX protein levels are increased upon FBXL20 knockdown (Fig. 1B). We therefore monitored PUMA and BAX protein turnover by cycloheximide chase assay. As shown in Figure 2, D–F, the turnover of PUMA and BAX decreased in FBXL20-KD cells (Fig. 2, D–F). PUMA and BAX are known to be regulated at the transcriptional level predominantly by p53 (11Nakano K. Vousden K.H. PUMA, a novel pro-apoptotic gene, is induced by p53.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar, 12Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R.

We therefore sought to examine whether FBXL20-mediated degradation of PUMA or BAX was p53-dependent. Immunoblot data showed that ectopically expressed FBXL20 reduced the expression levels of BAX and PUMA in both p53-wild-type and p53-deficient cells, indicating that FBXL20-mediated degradation of PUMA and BAX was p53-independent (Fig. 2G) Typically, F-box proteins associate with SCF complex through their F-box motif to promote substrate polyubiquitylation. To determine the involvement of F-box motif of FBXL20 in PUMA or BAX degradation, we generated F-box motif deletion mutant of FBXL20 (DDK-ΔF-FBXL20). Unlike wild type, ectopically expressed DDK-ΔF-FBXL20 failed to degrade both PUMA and BAX (Fig. 2, H and I), indicating that FBXL20 promotes the degradation of both PUMA and BAX via SCF complex. F-box protein-mediated degradation of their substrates requires an interaction with the substrates. To ascertain whether FBXL20 interacts with PUMA and BAX, we performed a series of coimmunoprecipitation experiments. First, we ectopically expressed DDK-tagged FBXL20 and HA-tagged PUMA in MCF7 cells and whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-DDK or anti-HA antibodies, respectively. Figure 3A showed the presence of HA-PUMA in DDK-FBXL20 immunoprecipitates. The reciprocal immunoprecipitation showed the presence of DDK-FBXL20 in HA-PUMA immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this observation, the interaction of FBXL20 with PUMA and BAX was also observed at the endogenous level (Fig. 3B). In addition, we also examined physical interaction of PUMA and BAX with FBXL20 by an in vitro by GST pull-down assay. As shown in Figure 3, C and D, in vitro interaction between purified GST-PUMA or GST-BAX and His-FBXL20 was detected. These results confirm that FBXL20 directly interacts with BAX and PUMA. Given that BH3 domain in PUMA is involved in protein–protein interaction, we presumed that the FBXL20 might interact with BH3 domain of PUMA. To investigate this possibility, we ectopically expressed DDK-FBXL20 and HA-PUMA or HA-ΔBH3-PUMA in MCF7 cells and immunoprecipitated with either anti-DDK or anti-HA antibodies, respectively. As shown in Figure 3E, DDK-FBXL20 interacted with HA-PUMA and not with HA-ΔBH3-PUMA indicating that FBXL20 interacts with BH3 domain of PUMA. In agreement with previous study, we found that BH3 domain of PUMA is important to interact with BAX. Interestingly, immunoblotting of FBXL20 immunoprecipitates revealed that interaction of FBXL20 with BAX is independent of PUMA (Fig. 3E). Typically, F-box proteins direct proteasomal degradation of their substrates by promoting their polyubiquitination (22Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Ubiquitin ligases: Cell-cycle control and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 25Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: On protein death and cell life.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). We then asked whether FBXL20 promotes polyubiquitination of PUMA and BAX. Ubiquitin possesses seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) that may be utilized to form polyubiquitin chains. Among these lysine residues, K48-linked polyubiquitin chains are generally marked for proteasomal degradation of target proteins (26Jacobson A.D. Zhang N.Y. Xu P. Han K.J. Noone S. Peng J. Liu C.W. The lysine 48 and lysine 63 ubiquitin conjugates are processed differently by the 26 s proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35485-35494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether FBXL20 promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination of BAX and PUMA. Immunoprecipitation of MCF7 cell extracts expressing either vector or DDK-FBXL20 or DDK-ΔF-FBXL20 with BAX and PUMA antibodies followed by immunoblotting with K48 linked Ub antibody showed that DDK-FBXL20 promoted K48-linked polyubiquitination of PUMA (Fig. 3F) and BAX (Fig. 3G). However, the knockdown of FBXL20 reduced K48-linked ubiquitination of PUMA (Fig. 3H) and BAX (Fig. 3I). Consistent with these results, in vitro ubiquitination assay also demonstrated that FBXL20 can promote the polyubiquitination of recombinant PUMA and BAX (Fig. 3, J and K). Collectively, these results suggested that FBXL20 interacts with PUMA and BAX and promotes polyubiquitina"
https://openalex.org/W3204475637,"Introduction The new, five-level EQ-5D generic questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) has never been used among diabetes patients in Poland. Objectives To develop health-related quality of life (HRQoL) norms for patients with self-reported diabetes, based on a large representative sample of the general Polish population, using the EQ-5D-5L. Materials and methods Members of the general public, selected via multistage stratified sampling, filled in the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and answered a question about the presence of diabetes. We estimated three types of EQ-5D-5L outcomes: limitations within domains, EQ VAS and EQ-5D-5L index. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and HRQoL, both in patients with diabetes and the general population sample. Results Among 2,973 respondents having complete EQ-5D-5L data, 255 subjects (8.6%) self-reported diabetes. Treatment with insulin, other drugs, combination therapy or lack of drug treatment was declared by 22.0%, 48.6%, 5.1% and 24.3% of patients, respectively. Respondents with diabetes had a lower EQ VAS score (18.5 points difference on a 100-points scale) and a lower EQ-5D-5L index score (0.135 difference; scale range: 1.59). The multivariate analysis showed that the factors independently improving the HRQoL in the general population were secondary or higher education, and factors reducing HRQoL were female sex, belonging to an older age group, being treated because of diabetes with insulin, other drugs or combination treatment. Respondents diagnosed with diabetes but not treated with drugs showed a decrease in EQ VAS scores, but not in the EQ-5D-5L index. Conclusions Diabetes leads to HRQoL deterioration in all age groups when compared to matched general population respondents without diabetes. The most significant HRQoL reduction experience older patients with a basic level of education. Obtained EQ-5D-5L normative data may be used in the clinical care of patients with diabetes and health technology assessment of new anti-diabetic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3204776850,"Background Though many previous studies have indicated immunological alterations in psychotic disorders, the role and prevalence of neuroinflammation is still unknown. Studies previously investigating immune related biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these patients are mainly small studies on few markers, and many have not compared patients to healthy controls. Methods We will conduct a large case-control study including at least 100 patients with recent onset psychotic disorders and 100 sex- and age matched healthy controls. The cases will include patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder according to ICD-10 (F20/F22-29) within a year prior to inclusion. We will collect both CSF, blood and fecal samples, to gain insight into possible immunological alterations. The psychopathology of all participants will thoroughly be evaluated using the SCAN interview, and multiple rating scales covering different symptom groups. All participants will partake in a detailed neurological examination, including the Neurological Evaluation Scale assessing neurological soft signs. Additionally, we will assess cognitive functioning, evaluate quality of life and level of functioning, and collect data on a broad array of possible confounders. Our primary outcomes will include CSF leucocytes, CSF/serum albumin ratio, CSF total protein, IgG index, CSF levels of IL-6 and IL-8, and presence of antineuronal autoantibodies in CSF and blood. For our secondary outcomes, exploratory analyses will be performed on a broader panel of neuroimmunological markers. All participants will be invited for a follow-up visit to assess longitudinal changes. The current study is part of a larger CSF biobank build-up for severe mental disorders (PSYCH-FLAME). Discussion This study will represent the largest investigation of CSF in patients with psychotic disorders compared to healthy controls to date. We expect the study to contribute with new, important knowledge on pathophysiological mechanisms, and to help pave the way for future investigations of individualized treatment options. Trial registration The study is approved by The Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics (Capital Region, j.no: H-16030985) and The Danish Data Protection Agency (j.no: RHP-2016-020, I-Suite no.: 04945)."
https://openalex.org/W3201687347,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent adult-onset motor neuron disorder. The disease is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to death usually within five years after the onset of symptoms. While most cases are sporadic, 5%-10% of cases can be associated with familial inheritance, including ALS type 6, which is associated with mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma ( FUS ) gene. This work aimed to evaluate how the most frequent ALS-related mutations in FUS, R521C, R521H, and P525L affect the protein structure and function. We used prediction algorithms to analyze the effects of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms and performed evolutionary conservation analysis, protein frustration analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations. Most of the prediction algorithms classified the three mutations as deleterious. All three mutations were predicted to reduce protein stability, especially the mutation R521C, which was also predicted to increase chaperone binding tendency. The protein frustration analysis showed an increase in frustration in the interactions involving the mutated residue 521C. Evolutionary conservation analysis showed that residues 521 and 525 of human FUS are highly conserved sites. The molecular dynamics results indicate that protein stability could be compromised in all three mutations. They also affected the exposed surface area and protein compactness. The analyzed mutations also displayed high flexibility in most residues in all variants, most notably in the interaction site with the nuclear import protein of FUS."
https://openalex.org/W3202298782,"Heterocorals represent an enigmatic group of Palaeozoic corals, known from relatively short time intervals in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The major differences between Heterocorallia and other Palaeozoic corals are the lack of an external theca (epitheca), lack of calices and the presence of dichotomously dividing septa-like structures. Heterocoral skeleton was presumably externally covered by the soft tissue and each branch of their skeleton has, until now, been regarded as a corallite–a skeleton of a single polyp. We investigated upper Famennian Oligophylloides from Morocco, focussing on branching processes, wall structure, previously poorly known initial growth stages and the growing tip, described here for the first time. We demonstrate that Oligophylloides shows a unique colony development not known in any group of anthozoans possessing a septate-like architecture and suggest that the previously postulated homology between true septa in hexa- and rugose corals on one hand, and Oligophylloides on the other, must be rejected. Based on the skeleton structure and branching patterns, we postulate, contrary to former ideas, that the stem and branches of heterocorals represent the skeleton of a multi-polyp colonial coral, similar to many extant octocorals. We found numerous potential homologies with octocoral skeletons (notably the Keratoisidinae within the Isididae) and, as a result, we propose the inclusion of the order Heterocorallia within the subclass Octocorallia. This suggestion requires, however, further research on the other taxa of heterocorals. We also propose some changes to the morphological terminology for the Heterocorallia."

The purpose of this study was to identify and validate an optimal primary culture model of normal and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) endothelial cells by comparing cell morphology and marker expression under different media conditions to in vivo donor tissues. Primary and immortalized HCECs, isolated from normal and FECD donors, were cultured in proliferation media (Joyce, M4, Bartakova) alone or sequentially with maturation media (F99, Stabilization 1, M5). CD56, CD73 and CD166 expressions were quantified in confluent and matured cell lines by flow cytometry. HCECs that were allowed to proliferate in Joyce’s medium followed by maturation in low-mitogen containing media yielded cells with similar morphology to corneal endothelial tissues. Elevated expression of CD56 and CD166 and low expression of CD73 correlated with regular, hexagonal-like HCEC morphology. CD56:CD73 &gt; 2.5 was most consistent with normal HCEC morphology and mimicked corneal endothelial tissue. Immortalization of normal HCECs by hTERT transduction showed morphology and CD56:CD73 ratios similar to parental cell lines. HCECs established from FECD donors showed reduced CD56:CD73 ratios compared to normal HCECs which coincided with reduced uniformity and regularity of cell monolayers. Overall, a dual media system with Joyce’s medium for proliferation and a low-mitogen media for maturation, provided normal cultures with regular, hexagonal-like cell morphologies consistent with corneal endothelial cells in vivo. CD56:CD73 expression ratio &gt;2.5 was predictive of in vivo-like cellular morphology."

Here, we discuss several key lessons learned and describe a framework within which our two communities can work together and invest in to improve future pandemic responses. The scientific and clinical communities have both experienced several harsh lessons on clinical care management and drug development during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we discuss several key lessons learned and describe a framework within which our two communities can work together and invest in to improve future pandemic responses. Over a year has passed since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified. Since then, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has claimed more than 4 million lives worldwide and affected billions more through reduced economic opportunity, healthcare access, educational progress, and community interactions. The pandemic spurred an unprecedented effort among scientific and medical communities to develop interventions to improve patient outcomes and alter the trajectory of the outbreak. However, vaccines and dexamethasone aside, other therapeutic interventions have had minimal impact on overall mortality from COVID-19. Further, in the chaotic early days of the pandemic, the principles of evidence-based medicine were often brushed aside—circumstantial evidence formed the basis of clinical management strategies, and anecdotes and hunches were the rationale for scientifically weak hypotheses in research. There was widespread duplication of research effort due to poor coordination, leading to wasted funding and time. Here, we contextualize the shared experience of scientific and clinical communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine some mis-steps and the lessons we have (re)learned. We frame these as a future-ready battleplan for the ongoing threat of emerging viral diseases; a plan that makes the best use of available resources and minimizes risk to patients. Outbreaks in China and Italy defined the COVID-19 clinical syndrome early; patients presented with respiratory symptoms (cough and shortness of breath) and systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, and myalgias), with some setting off on a trajectory to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pulmonary fibrotic changes, refractory hypoxemia, multiorgan failure, refractory shock, and ultimately, death. These features suggested a pathophysiology analogous to that of other severe respiratory infections and especially similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Despite this, much of the research activity in the early months of the pandemic involved attempts to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory viral illnesses through nuances in clinical and laboratory parameters. While some of this knowledge ultimately showed some prognostic value and identified potential therapeutic targets (as discussed later), this effort overshadowed the fact that severe COVID-19 was an inflammatory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There was extensive argument about whether COVID-associated respiratory failure should be managed as ARDS (Gattinoni et al., 2020Gattinoni L. Chiumello D. Caironi P. Busana M. Romitti F. Brazzi L. Camporota L. COVID-19 pneumonia: different respiratory treatments for different phenotypes?.Intensive Care Med. 2020; 46: 1099-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Eventually, decades-old evidence that low-stretch tidal volume ventilation is the primary method of ARDS treatment (Brower et al., 2000Brower R.G. Matthay M.A. Morris A. Schoenfeld D. Thompson B.T. Wheeler A. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome NetworkVentilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with traditional tidal volumes for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.N. Engl.

Med. 2017; 377: 562-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) prevailed, with improved ICU mortality, but only after many died from ARDS: a well-recognized disease process. Furthermore, it was clear early in the pandemic that patients died primarily because of immune dysfunction. Imbalanced immune activation was responsible for morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Tay et al., 2020Tay M.Z. Poh C.M. Rénia L. MacAry P.A. Ng L.F.P. The trinity of COVID-19: immunity, inflammation and intervention.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar). Parallels could have been drawn about SARS-CoV-2 after early retrospective reports indicated that the progression from mild to moderate to severe COVID-19 is associated with features of hyper-inflammatory response and sepsis (Zhou et al., 2020Zhou F. Yu T. Du R. Fan G. Liu Y. Liu Z. Xiang J. Wang Y. Song B. Gu X. et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17387) Google Scholar). These data were later reinforced by multiple studies showing that patients who died of COVID-19 ARDS evinced a pattern of distinct immune activation related to viral response and inflammation in the alveolus (Grant et al., 2021Grant R.A. Morales-Nebreda L. Markov N.S. Swaminathan S. Querrey M. Guzman E.R. Abbott D.A. Donnelly H.K. Donayre A. Goldberg I.A. et al.NU SCRIPT Study InvestigatorsCircuits between infected macrophages and T cells in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.Nature. 2021; 590: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A clear and coordinated clinical focus on immune dysfunction in COVID-19 could have helped design better trials with greater emphases on immunomodulatory strategies. In line with this, the World Health Organization International COVID-19 trial is set to restart with a focus on three immunomodulatory drugs. A key lesson from this experience is that pattern recognition based on similarity to known clinical syndromes is critical as a foundation upon which additional therapeutic modalities can be evaluated—even in times of uncertainty. Both antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs were considered and utilized early in the pandemic. However, much of this was administered off label, outside of observational studies and certainly outside of clinical trials. The most prominent example of this was hydroxychloroquine, used widely and repeatedly, based on highly politicized and poorly scrutinized research findings, eventually doing more harm than good (Axfors et al., 2021Axfors C. Schmitt A.M. Janiaud P. Van’t Hooft J. Abd-Elsalam S. Abdo E.F. Abella B.S. Akram J. Amaravadi R.K. Angus D.C. et al.Mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 from an international collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). More recently, we have seen this play out with the antiparasitic drug, Ivermectin—which was considered a bona fide therapeutic option in many settings based on in vitro data, despite high quality meta-analyses showing little or no effect. The use of investigational drugs as immediate therapeutic or prophylactic options has, in fact, limited their ability to be tested through robust clinical trials (Reardon, 2021Reardon S. Flawed ivermectin preprint highlights challenges of COVID drug studies.Nature. 2021; 596: 173-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is understandable that, in the face of substantial mortality and overwhelmed health systems with little access to clinical trials, some clinicians resorted to therapies without strong clinical evidence. Yet herein lies a key lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic—the need to default to core principles of evidence-based medicine. Especially amidst uncertainty, evidence-based practice allows the definition and testing of therapeutic interventions most likely to work, while we prove or disprove alternative hypotheses. In the face of an emerging deadly viral pathogen, sticking to these principles is more critical than ever. Pandemics give rise to a huge number of people at risk, providing a unique opportunity to conduct robust clinical drug trials. Conversely, the ad hoc use of experimental therapies results not only in an opportunity cost, but puts a vast number at risk of receiving unproven therapies that are either ineffective, harmful, or both. However, key to maintaining public “trust” in the evidence-based approach is to design therapeutic trials that have the highest likelihood of success, through the best use of solid scientific knowledge available at the time. This pandemic witnessed an unprecedented number of drugs clinically tested in less than 2 years, but few have borne out to be effective. Here, we discuss possible reasons for these inefficiencies in clinical drug development and highlight areas for possible improvement. Antiviral drugs target key processes during the viral life cycle, such as entry, replication, translation, or egress, and are typically selective for viral proteins/processes with few off-target effects, theoretically making them ideal viral pandemic therapeutics. Despite a large number of antiviral drugs being tested clinically, only one thus far, Remdesivir, has shown significant clinical benefit (Beigel et al., 2020Beigel J.H. Tomashek K.M. Dodd L.E. Mehta A.K. Zingman B.S. Kalil A.C. Hohmann E. Chu H.Y. Luetkemeyer A. Kline S. et al.ACTT-1 Study Group MembersRemdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 - Final Report.N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383: 1813-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4445) Google Scholar), and its utility in reducing death remains uncertain (Rochwerg et al., 2020Rochwerg B. Agarwal A. Siemieniuk R.A. Agoritsas T. Lamontagne F. Askie L. Lytvyn L. Leo Y.S. Macdonald H. Zeng L. et al.A living WHO guideline on drugs for covid-19.BMJ. 2020; 370: m3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). One of the reasons why many antiviral candidates failed is that in the panicked push for effective “emergency response” drugs, there was reduced scrutiny of pre-clinical experimental designs. Unlike Remdesivir, which had a known mechanism of action (MOA) and activity against related coronaviruses, many other candidate drugs were identified through unbiased screening assays. While such assays have their use, they have several caveats; for one, drug potencies can vary greatly based on the assay used. A large proportion of early testing involved the in vitro use of a single cell line (e.g., Vero-E6). Such cell lines often have altered immune responses to infection and do not fully recapitulate viral growth in vivo. Second, the MOA and in vivo bioavailability for drugs identified in unbiased screens were often unknown, making it difficult to ascertain off-target effects, and ultimately leading to many being false positives. Both limitations could be overcome through the focusing on repurposed drugs with known MOA and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) focusing on molecules that can be administered orally and tested in multiple cell lines and, where available, animal models. Another contributing factor was the failure to consider viral dynamics during COVID-19 disease. Several experimental drugs were used by pre-treating or treating experimental animals very early during infection (e.g., less than a day post-infection). This is unrealistic in clinical practice: most people are unaware of when they become infected, SARS-CoV-2 has a long incubation period during which a person is asymptomatic, and viral burden peaks very early in the symptomatic phase. Drugs that show efficacy in pre-treated animals would only be useful in humans if given in the pre-symptomatic phase of illness or prophylactically, which is improbable even when health systems are functioning optimally. Prophylactic antiviral therapy for COVID-19 seems implausible, as this requires administration to be regular or immediately prior to a known exposure, whereas exposure to COVID-19 is typically unpredictable. Regular drug administration requires a huge volume of drug to be manufactured, and even if such a prophylactic antiviral was readily available, the challenge of dispensing sufficient drug in a short time while balancing the risk of adverse events from a mass administration is daunting. For future pandemics, it would be reasonable to clinically evaluate only anti-viral agents that have shown efficacy against similar infectious pathogens in vivo, as was done for Remdesivir. Testing molecules discovered through in vitro assays alone without considering the natural history of the disease, PK/PD and viral replication kinetics is risky and unlikely to succeed. Attention must be paid to these variables, even if doing so may require time and patience. This is likely to be a thorough, more efficacious, and ultimately safer approach for patients. These principles, however, are different for immunomodulatory drugs. Early retrospective analyses showed that COVID-19 patients who had higher expression of inflammatory cytokines had poorer survival prognoses. This led to hypotheses that inhibiting specific cytokine-mediated pathways would be beneficial, and consequently, immunomodulatory therapies such as Anakinra (anti-IL1b) and Tocilizumab (anti-IL6) were repurposed for COVID-19. While monotherapy with these agents has thus far proved unsuccessful, broad-spectrum immunomodulators such as Dexamethasone, Baricitinib (anti-Janus kinase), or combinations of immunomodulatory drugs have shown efficacy in those with severe COVID-19 (Group 2021Group, R.C.; RECOVERY Collaborative GroupTocilizumab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial.Lancet. 2021; 397: 1637-1645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar; Kalil et al., 2021Kalil A.C.

In hindsight, it may have been possible to predict which drugs were likely to be efficacious and in which target patient population. Since the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 involved multiple inflammatory pathways and regulators driving large, complex, often non-overlapping transcriptional networks (Ho et al., 2021aHo J.S.Y.

Campisi L. Zhao N. Cesar Lagda A. Pietzsch C. Sook Yuin Ho J. Martinez-Gil L. Fenouil R. Chen X. Edwards M. et al.Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation.Science. 2016; 352https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad7993Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similarly, an immunomodulatory strategy would only be necessary or helpful for those with immune dysregulation (severe COVID-19) and could be harmful when the immune system is working effectively to control viral replication and disease (mild to moderate COVID-19). Some may argue that until specific drug were clinically evaluated in specific patient strata, we could not have known this to be true. However, we propose that knowledge of disease pathogenesis could have filtered earlier into prioritization of key drugs repurposing in specific patient populations. Finally, perhaps the hardest lesson we had to learn is that our arsenal of (usable) antivirals and immunomodulatory drugs is relatively empty and poorly equipped to deal with emerging pathogens. It is clearly time to re-think how antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs are prioritized, designed, and identified. A novel method of making vaccines (RNA-based vaccine) revolutionized our world during this pandemic. Novel drug design strategies, possibly embracing new technologies, are needed more than ever (Ho et al., 2021bHo J.S.Y. Zhu Z. Marazzi I. Unconventional viral gene expression mechanisms as therapeutic targets.Nature. 2021; 593: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). So how should we choose appropriate repurposed anti-inflammatory/anti-viral agents for clinical development during a pandemic, especially one with immunological features such as COVID-19? Immunological effects are difficult to evaluate without in vivo studies. Given the unavoidable and lengthy delay in establishing the best humanized animal model, starting directly with human studies using repurposed drugs may be acceptable if done with close interaction between clinicians and scientists. As randomized controlled trials (RCTs) cost time and money, choosing the wrong drugs or wrong approach for an RCT has a large opportunity cost. Starting RCTs with agents that are well established in clinical practice (e.g., Dexamethasone) is acceptable and has succeeded. However, in this pandemic, the initial choice for clinical evaluation of less understood anti-inflammatory drugs was largely driven by expert clinical opinion (not necessarily with pre-clinical rationale) and through observational reports (which suffer from selection bias). The case of Hydroxychloroquine, with hundreds of wasted randomized trials attempting to prove/disprove its effects, attests to the need for a stringent framework for the clinical development of repurposed agents in a global pandemic. We propose that the following key considerations be addressed through pre-clinical studies and early single-arm clinical studies, to “short-list” agents that are most likely to work prior to running large, randomized trials:•Biological and pre-clinical rationale and/or evidence in other analogous clinical situations•Established safety profile; expected toxicities•PK for modified dosing•Evidence of PD activity on target (analogous to phase 0 studies in oncology) The traditional clinical development model is an observational study followed by a single-arm trial assessing safety, and then by randomized studies in the select patient population (phase 2 followed by phase 3). In oncology, a phase 1b followed by a phase 2 expansion in a specific patient cohort is a commonly used approach, even in the setting of drug repurposing. An important component of these single-arm studies in the setting of cancer, however, is the inclusion of translational readouts to define the disease and response to treatment. Similarly, even within the exigencies of a viral pandemic, early single-arm studies testing efficacy and safety of repurposed drugs with known MOA and safety profiles should include as many biological assays of activity as possible, developed through close collaboration between clinicians and scientists. Clinical investigators must obtain input from virologists, immunologists, and pharmacologists to choose agents that will work during key viral kinetic time-points or that blunt specific (or broad) immune phenomena, and select drug doses and pharmacodynamic end-points to best assess on-target activity. These initial studies may need to focus on PK/PD, or surrogate biochemical or virological end-points, prior to looking at hard clinical end-points such as incidence of intubation, time in intensive care, or 30-day mortality, which typically need a much larger sample size and well defined control arms. Simultaneous animal studies can be used to refine these early trial protocols prior to agents being evaluated in phase 3 trials. When agents are ready for assessment in phase 3 trials, adaptive trial designs, which permit the testing of multiple agents simultaneously or in rapid sequence, is an efficient, cost-effective approach for otherwise time- and resource-intensive RCTs. Such a strategy will allow a shift from “logic-based medicine” to a sound evidence-based application, maximizing input from ongoing fundamental research and reducing the number of futile phase 3 trials testing drugs that were never likely to work. Unfortunately, logistic and economic decisions have severely hampered drug discovery in the last few decades. Until very recently, antiviral drug development has been considered slow compared to other diseases (∼5% drugs approved between 1972 to 2017, many against one virus [HIV], compared to 17% cancer). Drugs are also available to only ∼9 or 10 viruses out of the >200 known to cause human disease. Orphan viral diseases often have no coverage, setting us up for the next pandemic. To counter this, there needs to be a global effort to dedicate resources to (1) cataloging/sequencing new and emerging viruses/variants, (2) developing experimental models in vivo and in vitro for infectious diseases, (3) drug discovery for orphan viruses, (4) multiply medicinal chemistry efforts on known molecules with the potential of pan-viral activities (chain terminator or protease inhibitors), and (5) focus on molecules that are easy to administer (e.g., orally bioavailable). An important lesson from COVID-19 is the need to have, at the ready, rapidly implementable clinical trial protocols testing repurposed drug “X,” whose safety profiles are known and acceptable, whose MOA has biological plausibility, or at a minimum, has early in vivo/ ex vivo data in two independent systems supporting its use. Such trial protocols should have interim ethics and regulatory approval prior to a pandemic, which would then require final rapid review from regulators when the next pandemic hits. Forward planning would allow the testing of multiple candidate drugs simultaneously during the exponential growth in numbers seen during the initial stages of a pandemic. Most importantly, having such trials immediately implementable would limit the use of experimental therapies in poorly designed observational studies, or worse, ad hoc use that puts patients at risk and is destined at best for uninformative retrospective analyses. This requires the establishment of scientific/clinical cooperatives across state, national, and global borders to coordinate clinical trials and needs to be an international effort. It divides the work, divides the cost, builds capacity, and makes the impact instantaneously global. In addition, any candidate drug that gets tested simultaneously worldwide would put to rest concerns about its efficacy in specific social or racial groups—aspects that invariably come up in discussions whether founded in science or not. The establishment of such global cooperatives would also expedite the process for drug approval globally. Currently, drug approval is meted out by national government agencies even though safety and efficacy are evaluated similarly throughout the world. Nation-specific drug approvals have resulted in delays in drug distribution to communities that need them the most. If trials are conducted globally and subject to review by an international regulator, this could help expedite drug review processes within local jurisdictions. Such an international regulator is not unimaginable; as has been done for other global threats such as nuclear arms regulation and climate change. Once suitable broad-acting drugs are identified, manufacturers could be regulated against holding market exclusivity or have this limited through government “buyouts.” The rapid production of generic drugs would reduce cost and ensure equitable global distribution. Ensuring equitable access to a drug of utility in a viral pandemic setting is one of the foremost lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. By instituting a global cooperative scientific effort to find drugs that work, the scientific community could influence the distribution of any treatment more equitably. Inequitable distribution is perilous both to those with and without access to the treatment. As long as a pandemic virus rages and mutates “elsewhere,” the entire world remains at risk. Thus, a cooperative effort from the medical and scientific community, based on the principles outlined above, is essential to both identify suitable therapeutic interventions and to facilitate their distribution in the setting of a pandemic. Solidarity in the scientific community will also facilitate public education and legal reforms on misinformation, which are essential for the ultimate translation of research activity into lives saved."

However, poor knowledge of the disease and its control, staff attrition, and lack of intentional training for new staff can lead to under-performance and ineffectiveness of interventions. Thus, the Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program, in collaboration with National Malaria Elimination Program, planned a malaria short course (MSC) to strengthen the capacity of current program managers and incoming staff. To guide the development of the curriculum for the MSC, we conducted a needs assessment survey to ascertain the perceived usefulness of the MSC, the priority rating of MSC thematic domains and associated factors. Methods Overall, 384 purposively selected respondents across ten states and the Federal Capital Territory in Nigeria were interviewed. These comprised malaria and non-malaria control program staff at state, local government area (LGA) and ward levels. We administered a structured questionnaire to elicit information on socio-demographics, training needs, priority malaria thematic domains, perceived course usefulness and willingness of ministries/organizations to release staff to attend the MSC. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at p&lt;0.05. Results Mean age was 43.9 (standard deviation: 7.6 years), 172 (44.8%) were females. Of the 384 respondents, 181 (47.1%), 144 (37.5%) and 59 (15.4%) were at the ward, LGA and state levels, respectively. Seventy-two (18.8%) had never worked in malaria control program. Majority (98.7%, n = 379) reported the need for further training, 382 (99.5%) opined that the course would be useful, and all affirmed their employers’ willingness towards their participation at the training. Respondents rated high the domains of basic malariology, malaria treatment, malaria prevention, surveillance/data management, use of computers, leadership skills, program management and basic statistics. Predictors of malaria topical domains’ high rating were gender (odds ratio (OR) = 6.77; 95% CI:3.55–12.93) and educational qualifications (OR = 0.48; 95% CI:0.26–0.89). Conclusions A malaria short course is a necessity and appropriate for program officers at different levels of health administration in Nigeria to achieve malaria elimination, taking into consideration the challenges of human resource retention. The outcome of this study should inform the curriculum and the delivery of the MSC."
