https://openalex.org/W3023376619,"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elaborated Vaccine development for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is focused on the trimeric spike protein that initiates infection. Each protomer in the trimeric spike has 22 glycosylation sites. How these sites are glycosylated may affect which cells the virus can infect and could shield some epitopes from antibody neutralization. Watanabe et al. expressed and purified recombinant glycosylated spike trimers, proteolysed them to yield glycopeptides containing a single glycan, and determined the composition of the glycan sites by mass spectrometry. The analysis provides a benchmark that can be used to measure antigen quality as vaccines and antibody tests are developed. Science this issue p. 330"
https://openalex.org/W3022210384,"On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic1. The strategies based on non-pharmaceutical interventions that were used to contain the outbreak in China appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions and their timings3. Here, using epidemiological data on COVID-19 and anonymized data on human movement4,5, we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimate that there were a total of 114,325 cases of COVID-19 (interquartile range 76,776-164,576) in mainland China as of 29 February 2020. Without non-pharmaceutical interventions, we predict that the number of cases would have been 67-fold higher (interquartile range 44-94-fold) by 29 February 2020, and we find that the effectiveness of different interventions varied. We estimate that early detection and isolation of cases prevented more infections than did travel restrictions and contact reductions, but that a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. According to our model, the lifting of travel restrictions from 17 February 2020 does not lead to an increase in cases across China if social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of an on average 25% reduction in contact between individuals that continues until late April. These findings improve our understanding of the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19, and will inform response efforts across the world."
https://openalex.org/W3023677370,"A fundamental feature of cellular plasma membranes (PMs) is an asymmetric lipid distribution between the bilayer leaflets. However, neither the detailed, comprehensive compositions of individual PM leaflets nor how these contribute to structural membrane asymmetries have been defined. We report the distinct lipidomes and biophysical properties of both monolayers in living mammalian PMs. Phospholipid unsaturation is dramatically asymmetric, with the cytoplasmic leaflet being approximately twofold more unsaturated than the exoplasmic leaflet. Atomistic simulations and spectroscopy of leaflet-selective fluorescent probes reveal that the outer PM leaflet is more packed and less diffusive than the inner leaflet, with this biophysical asymmetry maintained in the endocytic system. The structural asymmetry of the PM is reflected in the asymmetric structures of protein transmembrane domains. These structural asymmetries are conserved throughout Eukaryota, suggesting fundamental cellular design principles. Lipidomics across the bilayer membrane plus biophysical and fluorescence approaches find asymmetry in phospholipid unsaturation and localization of protein transmembrane domains based on their ability to pack within the different membrane leaflets."
https://openalex.org/W3021391231,"Reverse genetics has been an indispensable tool to gain insights into viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. The genomes of large RNA viruses, such as those from coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and manipulate in Escherichia coli owing to the size and occasional instability of the genome1–3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse-genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform to genetically reconstruct diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Pneumoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples or synthetic DNA, and these fragments were then reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation-associated recombination cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome. T7 RNA polymerase was then used to generate infectious RNA to rescue viable virus. Using this platform, we were able to engineer and generate chemically synthesized clones of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)4, which has caused the recent pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance that we describe here facilitates rapid responses to emerging viruses as it enables the real-time generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants during an outbreak. A yeast-based synthetic genomics platform is used to reconstruct and characterize large RNA viruses from synthetic DNA fragments; this technique will facilitate the rapid analysis of RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, during an outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3022812876,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) remain major drug targets, despite our incomplete understanding of how they signal through 16 non-visual G-protein signal transducers (collectively named the transducerome) to exert their actions. To address this gap, we have developed an open-source suite of 14 optimized bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) Gαβγ biosensors (named TRUPATH) to interrogate the transducerome with single pathway resolution in cells. Generated through exhaustive protein engineering and empirical testing, the TRUPATH suite of Gαβγ biosensors includes the first Gα15 and GαGustducin probes. In head-to-head studies, TRUPATH biosensors outperformed first-generation sensors at multiple GPCRs and in different cell lines. Benchmarking studies with TRUPATH biosensors recapitulated previously documented signaling bias and revealed new coupling preferences for prototypic and understudied GPCRs with potential in vivo relevance. To enable a greater understanding of GPCR molecular pharmacology by the scientific community, we have made TRUPATH biosensors easily accessible as a kit through Addgene."

https://openalex.org/W3020974416,"The crosstalk between deregulated hepatocyte metabolism and cells within the tumour microenvironment, as well as the consequent effects on liver tumorigenesis, are not completely understood. We show here that hepatocyte-specific loss of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) disrupts liver metabolic homeostasis and promotes tumour progression. FBP1 is universally silenced in both human and murine liver tumours. Hepatocyte-specific Fbp1 deletion results in steatosis, concomitant with activation and senescence of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Depleting senescent HSCs by ‘senolytic’ treatment with dasatinib/quercetin or ABT-263 inhibits tumour progression. We further demonstrate that FBP1-deficient hepatocytes promote HSC activation by releasing HMGB1; blocking its release with the small molecule inflachromene limits FBP1-dependent HSC activation, the subsequent development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and tumour progression. Collectively, these findings provide genetic evidence for FBP1 as a metabolic tumour suppressor in liver cancer and establish a critical crosstalk between hepatocyte metabolism and HSC senescence that promotes tumour growth. Li et al. show that hepatocyte-specific loss of Fbp1 in mice leads to steatosis and senescence in hepatic stellate cells, thereby disrupting metabolism and facilitating liver tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3023198889,"Following implantation, the naive pluripotent epiblast of the mouse blastocyst generates a rosette, undergoes lumenogenesis and forms the primed pluripotent egg cylinder, which is able to generate the embryonic tissues. How pluripotency progression and morphogenesis are linked and whether intermediate pluripotent states exist remain controversial. We identify here a rosette pluripotent state defined by the co-expression of naive factors with the transcription factor OTX2. Downregulation of blastocyst WNT signals drives the transition into rosette pluripotency by inducing OTX2. The rosette then activates MEK signals that induce lumenogenesis and drive progression to primed pluripotency. Consequently, combined WNT and MEK inhibition supports rosette-like stem cells, a self-renewing naive-primed intermediate. Rosette-like stem cells erase constitutive heterochromatin marks and display a primed chromatin landscape, with bivalently marked primed pluripotency genes. Nonetheless, WNT induces reversion to naive pluripotency. The rosette is therefore a reversible pluripotent intermediate whereby control over both pluripotency progression and morphogenesis pivots from WNT to MEK signals."
https://openalex.org/W3023774503,"Here we report biallelic mutations in the sorbitol dehydrogenase gene (SORD) as the most frequent recessive form of hereditary neuropathy. We identified 45 individuals from 38 families across multiple ancestries carrying the nonsense c.757delG (p.Ala253GlnfsTer27) variant in SORD, in either a homozygous or compound heterozygous state. SORD is an enzyme that converts sorbitol into fructose in the two-step polyol pathway previously implicated in diabetic neuropathy. In patient-derived fibroblasts, we found a complete loss of SORD protein and increased intracellular sorbitol. Furthermore, the serum fasting sorbitol levels in patients were dramatically increased. In Drosophila, loss of SORD orthologs caused synaptic degeneration and progressive motor impairment. Reducing the polyol influx by treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors normalized intracellular sorbitol levels in patient-derived fibroblasts and in Drosophila, and also dramatically ameliorated motor and eye phenotypes. Together, these findings establish a novel and potentially treatable cause of neuropathy and may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3021072173,"Drug repurposing is potentially the fastest available option in the race to identify safe and efficacious drugs that can be used to prevent and/or treat COVID-19. By describing the life cycle of the newly emergent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in light of emerging data on the therapeutic efficacy of various repurposed antimicrobials undergoing testing against the virus, we highlight in this review a possible mechanistic convergence between some of these tested compounds. Specifically, we propose that the lysosomotropic effects of hydroxychloroquine and several other drugs undergoing testing may be responsible for their demonstrated in vitro antiviral activities against COVID-19. Moreover, we propose that Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a lysosomal storage disorder, may provide new insights into potential future therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2, by highlighting key established features of the disorder that together result in an ""unfavorable"" host cellular environment that may interfere with viral propagation. Our reasoning evolves from previous biochemical and cell biology findings related to NPC, coupled with the rapidly evolving data on COVID-19. Our overall aim is to suggest that pharmacological interventions targeting lysosomal function in general, and those particularly capable of reversibly inducing transient NPC-like cellular and biochemical phenotypes, constitute plausible mechanisms that could be used to therapeutically target COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3021991820,"Microplastics are an environmental contaminant of growing concern, but there is a lack of information about microplastic distribution, persistence, availability, and biological uptake in freshwater systems. This is especially true for large river systems like the Colorado River that spans multiple states through mostly rural and agricultural land use. This study characterized the quantity and morphology of microplastics in different environmental compartments in two large reservoirs along the Colorado River: Lakes Mead and Mohave, within Lake Mead National Recreation Area. To assess microplastic occurrence, surface water and surficial sediment were sampled at a total of nine locations. Sampling locations targeted different sub-basins with varying levels of anthropogenic impact. Las Vegas Wash, a tributary which delivers treated wastewater to Lake Mead, was also sampled. A sediment core (33 cm long, representing approximately 19 years) was extracted from Las Vegas Bay to assess changes in microplastic deposition over time. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were sampled at a subset of locations to assess biological uptake of microplastics. Microplastic concentrations were 0.44-9.7 particles/cubic meter at the water surface and 87.5-1,010 particles/kilogram dry weight (kg dw) at the sediment surface. Sediment core concentrations were 220-2,040 particles/kg dw, with no clear increasing or decreasing trend over time. Shellfish microplastic concentrations ranged from 2.7-105 particles/organism, and fish concentrations ranged from 0-19 particles/organism. Fibers were the most abundant particle type found in all sample types. Although sample numbers are small, microplastic concentrations appear to be higher in areas of greater anthropogenic impact. Results from this study improve our understanding of the occurrence and biological uptake of microplastics in Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and help fill existing knowledge gaps on microplastics in freshwater environments in the southwestern U.S."

RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE (RAFS) catalyzes raffinose formation by transferring a galactosyl group of galactinol to sucrose. However, whether RAFS contributes to plant drought tolerance and, if so, by what mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we report that expression of RAFS from maize (or corn, Zea mays) (ZmRAFS) is induced by drought, heat, cold, and salinity stresses. We found that zmrafs mutant maize plants completely lack raffinose and hyper-accumulate galactinol and are more sensitive to drought stress than the corresponding null-segregant (NS) plants. This indicated that ZmRAFS and its product raffinose contribute to plant drought tolerance. ZmRAFS overexpression in Arabidopsis enhanced drought stress tolerance by increasing myo-inositol levels via ZmRAFS-mediated galactinol hydrolysis in the leaves due to sucrose insufficiency in leaf cells and also enhanced raffinose synthesis in the seeds. Supplementation of sucrose to detached leaves converted ZmRAFS from hydrolyzing galactinol to synthesizing raffinose. Taken together, we demonstrate that ZmRAFS enhances plant drought tolerance through either raffinose synthesis or galactinol hydrolysis, depending on sucrose availability in plant cells. These results provide new avenues to improve plant drought stress tolerance through manipulation of the raffinose anabolic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W3023553925,"How transplanted haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) behave soon after they reside in a preconditioned host has not been studied due to technical limitations. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we first obtained the transcriptome-based classifications of 28 haematopoietic cell types. We then applied them in conjunction with functional assays to track the dynamic changes of immunophenotypically purified HSCs in irradiated recipients within the first week after transplantation. Based on our transcriptional classifications, most homed HSCs in bone marrow and spleen became multipotent progenitors and, occasionally, some HSCs gave rise to megakaryocytic-erythroid or myeloid precursors. Parallel in vitro and in vivo functional experiments supported the paradigm of robust differentiation without substantial HSC expansion during the first week. Therefore, this study uncovers the previously inaccessible kinetics and fate choices of transplanted HSCs in myeloablated recipients at early stage, with implications for clinical applications of HSCs and other stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W3021672960,"Citizen science (CS) contributes to the knowledge about species distributions, which is a critical foundation in the studies of invasive species, biological conservation, and response to climatic change. In this study, we assessed the value of CS for termites worldwide. First, we compared the abundance and species diversity of geo-tagged termite records in iNaturalist to that of the University of Florida termite collection (UFTC) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Second, we quantified how the combination of these data sources affected the number of genera that satisfy data requirements for ecological niche modeling. Third, we assessed the taxonomic correctness of iNaturalist termite records in the Americas at the genus and family level through expert review based on photo identification. Results showed that iNaturalist records were less abundant than those in the UFTC and in GBIF, although they complemented the latter two in selected world regions. A combination of GBIF and the UFTC led to a significant increase in the number of termite genera satisfying the abundance criterion for niche modeling compared to either of those two sources alone, whereas adding iNaturalist observations as a third source only had a moderate effect on the number of termite genera satisfying that criterion. Although research grade observations in iNaturalist require a community-supported and agreed upon identification (ID) below the family taxonomic rank, our results indicated that iNaturalist data do not exhibit a higher taxonomic classification accuracy when they are designated research grade. This means that non-research grade observations can be used to more completely map the presence of termite locations in certain geographic locations without significantly jeopardizing data quality. We concluded that CS termite observation records can, to some extent, complement expert termite collections in terms of geographic coverage and species diversity. Based on recent data contribution patterns in CS data, the role of CS termite contributions is expected to grow significantly in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W3021582474,"In type II polyketide synthases (PKSs), the ketosynthase–chain length factor (KS–CLF) complex catalyzes polyketide chain elongation with the acyl carrier protein (ACP). Highly reducing type II PKSs, represented by IgaPKS, produce polyene structures instead of the well-known aromatic skeletons. Here, we report the crystal structures of the Iga11–Iga12 (KS–CLF) heterodimer and the covalently cross-linked Iga10=Iga11–Iga12 (ACP=KS–CLF) tripartite complex. The latter structure revealed the molecular basis of the interaction between Iga10 and Iga11–Iga12, which differs from that between the ACP and KS of Escherichia coli fatty acid synthase. Furthermore, the reaction pocket structure and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the negative charge of Asp 113 of Iga11 prevents further condensation using a β-ketoacyl product as a substrate, which distinguishes IgaPKS from typical type II PKSs. This work will facilitate the future rational design of PKSs. Structures of the ketosynthase–chain length factor complex from ishigamide biosynthesis, cross-linked to the acyl carrier protein, reveal the molecular interactions between these domains and how the reaction pocket limits rounds of product extension."
https://openalex.org/W3021956938,"Background After decades of increased opioid pain reliever prescribing, providers are rapidly reducing prescribing. We hypothesized that reduced access to prescribed opioid pain relievers among patients previously reliant upon opioid pain relievers would result in increased illicit opioid use. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 602 publicly insured primary care patients who had been prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain for at least three consecutive months in San Francisco, recruited through convenience sampling. We conducted a historical reconstruction interview and medical chart abstraction focused on illicit substance use and opioid pain reliever prescriptions, respectively, from 2012 through the interview date in 2017–2018. We used a nested-cohort design, in which patients were classified, based on opioid pain reliever dose change, into a series of nested cohorts starting with each follow-up quarter. Using continuation-ratio models, we estimated associations between opioid prescription discontinuation or 30% increase or decrease in dose, relative to no change, and subsequent frequency of heroin and non-prescribed opioid pain reliever use, separately. Models controlled for demographics, clinical and behavioral characteristics, and past use of heroin or non-prescribed opioid pain relievers. A total of 56,372 and 56,484 participant-quarter observations were included from the 597 and 598 participants available for analyses of heroin and non-prescribed opioid pain reliever outcomes, respectively. Participants discontinued from prescribed opioids were more likely to use heroin (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.25–1.97) and non-prescribed opioid pain relievers (AOR = 1.75, 1.45–2.11) more frequently in subsequent quarters compared to participants with unchanged opioid prescriptions. Participants whose opioid pain reliever dose increased were more likely to use heroin more frequently (AOR = 1.67, 1.32–2.12). Results held throughout sensitivity analyses. The main limitations were the observational nature of results and limited generalizability beyond safety-net settings. Conclusions Discontinuation of prescribed opioid pain relievers was associated with more frequent non-prescribed opioid pain reliever and heroin use; increased dose was also associated with more frequent heroin use. Clinicians should be aware of these risks in determining pain management approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3020830295,"The ongoing substance misuse epidemic in the United States is complex and dynamic and should be approached as such in the development and evaluation of policy1. Drug overdose deaths (largely attributable to opioid misuse) in the United States have grown exponentially for almost four decades, but the mechanisms of this growth are poorly understood2. From analysis of 661,565 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, we show that the age-specific drug overdose mortality curve for each birth-year cohort rises and falls according to a Gaussian-shaped curve. The ascending portion of each successive birth-year cohort mortality curve is accelerated compared with that of all preceding birth-year cohorts. This acceleration can be attributed to either of two distinct processes: a stable peak age, with an increasing amplitude of mortality rate curves from one birth-year cohort to the next; or a youthward shift in the peak age of the mortality rate curves. The overdose epidemic emerged and increased in amplitude among the 1945–1964 cohort (Baby Boomers), shifted youthward among the 1965–1980 cohort (Generation X), and then resumed the pattern of increasing amplitude in the 1981–1990 Millennials. These shifting age and generational patterns are likely to be driven by socioeconomic factors and drug availability, the understanding of which is important for the development of effective overdose prevention measures. A new age–period–cohort analysis reveals distinct generational patterns in deaths from opioid overdose in the United States, suggesting increased risks for Baby Boomers and Millennials."
https://openalex.org/W3021762919,"The lanthanide elements (Ln3+), those with atomic numbers 57-63 (excluding promethium, Pm3+), form a cofactor complex with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) in bacterial XoxF methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) and ExaF ethanol dehydrogenases (EDHs), expanding the range of biological elements and opening novel areas of metabolism and ecology. Other MDHs, known as MxaFIs, are related in sequence and structure to these proteins, yet they instead possess a Ca2+-PQQ cofactor. An important missing piece of the Ln3+ puzzle is defining what features distinguish enzymes that use Ln3+-PQQ cofactors from those that do not. Here, using XoxF1 MDH from the model methylotrophic bacterium Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, we investigated the functional importance of a proposed lanthanide-coordinating aspartate residue. We report two crystal structures of XoxF1, one with and another without PQQ, both with La3+ bound in the active-site region and coordinated by Asp320 Using constructs to produce either recombinant XoxF1 or its D320A variant, we show that Asp320 is needed for in vivo catalytic function, in vitro activity, and La3+ coordination. XoxF1 and XoxF1 D320A, when produced in the absence of La3+, coordinated Ca2+ but exhibited little or no catalytic activity. We also generated the parallel substitution in ExaF to produce ExaF D319S and found that this variant loses the capacity for efficient ethanol oxidation with La3+ These results provide evidence that a Ln3+-coordinating aspartate is essential for the enzymatic functions of XoxF MDHs and ExaF EDHs, supporting the notion that sequences of these enzymes, and the genes that encode them, are markers for Ln3+ metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3022175316,"Abstract Nuclear protein of the testis (NUT) midline carcinoma (NMC), is a rare and highly aggressive form of undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma. NMC is molecularly characterized by chromosomal rearrangement of the NUT gene to another gene, most commonly the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) gene BRD4 , forming the BRD4-NUT fusion oncogene. Therefore, inhibiting BRD4-NUT oncogenic function directly by BET inhibitors represents an attractive therapeutic approach but toxicity may limit the use of pan-BET inhibitors treating this cancer. We thus performed a drug screening approach using a library consisting of epigenetic compounds and ‘Donated Chemical Probes’ collated by the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) and identified the p300/CBP HAT inhibitor A-485, in addition to the well-known BET inhibitor JQ1, to be the most active candidate for NMC treatment. In contrast to JQ1, A-485 was selectively potent in NMC compared to other cell lines tested. Mechanistically, A-485 inhibited p300-mediated histone acetylation, leading to disruption of BRD4-NUT binding to hyperacetylated megadomains. Consistently, BRD4-NUT megadomain-associated genes MYC , CCAT1 and TP63 were downregulated by A-485. A-485 strongly induced squamous differentiation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Combined inhibition of p300/CBP and BET showed synergistic effects. In summary, we identified the p300/CBP HAT domain as a putative therapeutic target in highly therapy-resistant NMC."
https://openalex.org/W3021041392,"1. Remotely tracking distinct behaviours of animals using acceleration data and machine learning has been carried out successfully in several species in captive settings. In order to study the ecology of animals in natural habitats, such behaviour classification models need to be transferred to wild individuals. However, at present, the development of those models usually requires direct observation of the target animals. 2. The goal of this study was to infer the behaviour of wild, free-roaming animals from acceleration data by training behaviour classification models on captive individuals, without the necessity to observe their wild conspecifics. We further sought to develop methods to validate the credibility of the resulting behaviour extrapolations. 3. We trained two machine learning algorithms proposed by the literature, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), on data from captive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and later applied them to data from wild foxes. We also tested a new advance for behaviour classification, by applying a moving window to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Finally, we investigated four strategies to validate our classification output. 4. While all three machine learning algorithms performed well under training conditions (Kappa values: RF (0.82), SVM (0.78), ANN (0.85)), the established methods, RF and SVM, failed in classifying distinct behaviours when transferred from captive to wild foxes. Behaviour classification with the ANN and a moving window, in contrast, inferred distinct behaviours and showed consistent results for most individuals. 5. Our approach is a substantial improvement over the methods previously proposed in the literature as it generated plausible results for wild fox behaviour. We were able to infer the behaviour of wild animals that have never been observed in the wild and to further illustrate the credibility of the output. This framework is not restricted to foxes but can be applied to infer the behaviour of many other species and thus empowers new advances in behavioural ecology."

Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) is responsible for the cytosolic diacetylation of newly synthesized histone H4 on lysines 5 and 12, which accompanies replication-coupled chromatin assembly.

We demonstrate that HAT1 physically associates with chromatin near DNA replication sites. We found that the association of HAT1 with newly replicated DNA is transient, but can be stabilized by replication fork stalling. The association of HAT1 with nascent chromatin may be functionally relevant, as HAT1 loss decreased replication fork progression and increased replication fork stalling. Moreover, in the absence of HAT1, stalled replication forks were unstable, and newly synthesized DNA became susceptible to MRE11-dependent degradation. These results suggest that HAT1 links replication fork function to the proper processing and assembly of newly synthesized histones.

https://openalex.org/W3021242589,"Mutations in CHCHD10, a gene coding for a mitochondrial protein, are implicated in ALS-FTD spectrum disorders, which are pathologically characterized by transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) accumulation. While both TDP-43 and CHCHD10 mutations drive mitochondrial pathogenesis, mechanisms underlying such phenotypes are unclear. Moreover, despite the disruption of the mitochondrial mitofilin protein complex at cristae junctions in patient fibroblasts bearing the CHCHD10S59L mutation, the role of CHCHD10 variants in mitofilin-associated protein complexes in brain has not been examined. Here, we utilized novel CHCHD10 transgenic mouse variants (WT, R15L, & S59L), TDP-43 transgenic mice, FTLD-TDP patient brains, and transfected cells to assess the interplay between CHCHD10 and TDP-43 on mitochondrial phenotypes. We show that CHCHD10 mutations disrupt mitochondrial OPA1-mitofilin complexes in brain, associated with impaired mitochondrial fusion and respiration. Likewise, CHCHD10 levels and OPA1-mitofilin complexes are significantly reduced in brains of FTLD-TDP patients and TDP-43 transgenic mice. In cultured cells, CHCHD10 knockdown results in OPA1-mitofilin complex disassembly, while TDP-43 overexpression also reduces CHCHD10, promotes OPA1-mitofilin complex disassembly via CHCHD10, and impairs mitochondrial fusion and respiration, phenotypes that are rescued by wild type (WT) CHCHD10. These results indicate that disruption of CHCHD10-regulated OPA1-mitofilin complex contributes to mitochondrial abnormalities in FTLD-TDP and suggest that CHCHD10 restoration could ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction in FTLD-TDP."
https://openalex.org/W3022586452,"In our search for bioactive mushrooms native to British Columbia, we determined that the ethanol extracts from fruiting bodies of the terrestrial polypore Albatrellus flettii had potent anti-cell viability activity. Using bioassay-guided fractionation, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, we successfully isolated three known compounds (grifolin, neogrifolin and confluentin). These compounds represent the major anti-cell viability components from the ethanol extracts of A. flettii. We also identified a novel biological activity for these compounds, specifically in down-regulating KRAS expression in two human colon cancer cell lines. Relatively little is known about the anti-cell viability activity and mechanism of action of confluentin. For the first time, we show the ability of confluentin to induce apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in SW480 human colon cancer cells. The oncogenic insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IMP1) has been previously shown to regulate KRAS mRNA expression in colon cancer cells, possibly through its ability to bind to the KRAS transcript. Using a fluorescence polarization assay, we show that confluentin dose-dependently inhibits the physical interaction between KRAS RNA and full-length IMP1. The inhibition also occurs with truncated IMP1 containing the KH1 to KH4 domain (KH1to4 IMP1), but not with the di-domain KH3 and KH4 (KH3&4 IMP1). In addition, unlike the control antibiotic neomycin, grifolin, neogrifolin and confluentin do not bind to KRAS RNA. These results suggest that confluentin inhibits IMP1-KRAS RNA interaction by binding to the KH1&2 di-domains of IMP1. Since the molecular interaction between IMP1 and its target RNAs is a pre-requisite for the oncogenic function of IMP1, confluentin should be further explored as a potential inhibitor of IMP1 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3023520777,"Treatment modalities for breast cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide, include surgery, radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy. The advancement in medical technology has facilitated substantial reduction in breast cancer mortality. However, patients may experience cognitive impairment after chemotherapy. This phenomenon called chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (i.e., ""chemobrain"") is common among breast cancer survivors. However, cognitive function deficits may exist before chemotherapy initiation. This study examined the functional network alterations in breast survivors by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).We recruited 172 female participants and separated them into three groups: C+ (57 breast cancer survivors who had finished 3-12-month-long chemotherapy), C- (45 breast cancer survivors who had not undergone chemotherapy), and HC (70 participants with no breast cancer history). We analyzed mean fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuation and graph theoretical topologies from resting-state fMRI and applied network-based analysis to portray functional changes among the three groups.Among the three groups, the C- group demonstrated hyperactivity in the prefrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus and right angular gyrus. Only the left caudate demonstrated significantly more hypoactivity in the C- group than in the C+ group. Graph theoretical analysis demonstrated that the brains of the C+ group became inclined toward regular networks and the brains of the C- group became inclined toward random networks.Subtle alterations were noted in the brain activity and networks of our cancer survivors. Moreover, functional network disruptions occurred regardless of chemotherapeutic agent administration."
https://openalex.org/W3022021576,"People’s perceptions about health risks, including their risk of acquiring HIV, are impacted in part by who they see portrayed as at risk in the media. Viewers in these cases are asking themselves “do those portrayed as at risk look like me?” An accurate perception of risk is critical for high-risk populations, who already suffer from a range of health disparities. Yet, to date no study has evaluated the demographic representation of health-related content from social media. The objective of this case study was to apply automated image recognition software to examine the demographic profile of faces in Instagram posts containing the hashtag #HIV (obtained from January 2017 through July 2018) and compare this to the demographic breakdown of those most at risk of a new HIV diagnosis (estimates of incidence of new HIV diagnoses from the 2017 US Centers for Disease Control HIV Surveillance Report). We discovered 26,766 Instagram posts containing #HIV authored in American English with 10,036 (37.5%) containing a detectable human face with a total of 18,227 faces (mean = 1.8, standard deviation [SD] = 1.7). Faces skewed older (47% vs. 11% were 35–39 years old), more female (41% vs. 19%), more white (43% vs. 26%), less black (31% vs 44%), and less Hispanic (13% vs 25%) on Instagram than for new HIV diagnoses. The results were similarly skewed among the subset of #HIV posts mentioning pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This disparity might lead Instagram users to potentially misjudge their own HIV risk and delay prophylactic behaviors. Social media managers and organic advocates should be encouraged to share images that better reflect at-risk populations so as not to further marginalize these populations and to reduce disparity in risk perception. Replication of our methods for additional diseases, such as cancer, is warranted to discover and address other misrepresentations."
https://openalex.org/W3023239317,"In the U.S., an estimated one in five individuals experience a mental illness annually which contribute to significant human and economic cost. Pharmacists serving in a public health capacity are positioned to provide first aid level intervention to people experiencing a mental health crisis. Research on pharmacy professionals (pharmacists, technicians, students) undergoing training in Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) can provide evidence of the potential benefits of such training. The objectives of this study were to 1) describe the reluctance and confidence to intervene in mental health crises of pharmacy professionals previously trained in MHFA, 2) describe their self-reported use of MHFA behaviors since becoming trained, and 3) describe participant open-ended feedback on their MHFA training. Materials and methods: An electronic survey was disseminated in May and June, 2019 using a four-email sequence to pharmacy professionals who had completed MHFA training from one of five pharmacist MHFA trainers throughout 2018. Domains included demographics, six Likert-type reluctance items, seven Likert-type confidence items for performing MHFA skills, and frequency of using a set of nine MHFA skills since being trained. Prompts collected open-ended feedback related to MHFA experiences and training. Descriptive statistics were used for scaled and multiple-choice items and a basic content analysis was performed on the open-ended items to group them into similar topics. Results: Ninety-eight out of 227 participants responded to the survey yielding a response rate of 44%. Participants reported high levels of disagreement to a set of reluctance items for intervening and overall high levels of confidence in performing a range of MHFA skills. Participant self-reported use of a set of MHFA skills ranged from 19% to 82% since being trained in MHFA. Almost half (44%) of participants had asked someone if they were considering suicide. A majority (61%) also had referred someone to resources because of a mental health crisis. Open-ended responses included positive experiences alongside important challenges to using MHFA in practice and recommendations including additional training focused on the pharmacy setting. Conclusions: Pharmacy professionals in this evaluation reported little reluctance and high confidence related to using MHFA training and reported use of MHFA skills since being trained."
https://openalex.org/W3022232353,"Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is approved for the treatment of different human inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and cytokine release syndrome. Tocilizumab binds to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and thereby blocks signaling of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Initial studies and all authority assessment reports state that tocilizumab is effective in humans, but cannot bind to the murine or rat IL-6R and thus not block IL-6 signaling in the mouse. However, several recent studies described the use of tocilizumab in mice and reported biological effects that were attributed to IL-6 blockade. In this study, we investigate the capability of tocilizumab to block IL-6 signaling using different human and murine cell lines. Our results unequivocally confirm the original state of the art that tocilizumab blocks signaling via the human IL-6R, but does not block IL-6 signaling in murine cells."
https://openalex.org/W3020976804,"Recent research suggests that perceived economic threat constitutes a valid predictor of people's attitudes and behaviors. While accumulated empirical evidence has mostly underlined the deleterious psychological effects (e.g., reduced psychological well-being) of perceived economic threat in times of economic strain, we postulate that individuals experiencing higher economic threat linked to the Spanish economic crisis are more prone to engage in other-beneficial prosocial behavior. Across two independently collected community samples, we tested this theoretical formulation and examined the potential mediating roles of empathic concern (Studies 1 & 2) and identification (Study 2). Study 1 (N = 306) revealed that participants who descended in the social scale due to the negative national economic context were engaged in a larger number of helping behaviors over the last three months compared to participants who did not descend the social ladder-independently of several sociodemographic and ideological factors. Moreover, our data indicated these effects were driven by increased empathic concern. Study 2 (N = 588), in which two hypothetical helping-behavior scenarios were randomly administered (crisis-related vs. control), showed that participants under high perceived financial threat exhibited an undifferentiated pattern of prosociality. However, moderated-mediation analyses indicated that empathic concern explained the perceived financial threat-helping behavior link in the hypothetical crisis-related scenario but not in the hypothetical control scenario. Together, these findings extend prior literature on the psychosocial effects of perceived economic threat and the determinants of other-oriented behavior. Implications of these findings and suggestions for further research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3021289407,"DNA forms conformational states beyond the right-handed double helix; however, the functional relevance of these noncanonical structures in the brain remains unknown. Here we show that, in the prefrontal cortex of mice, the formation of one such structure, Z-DNA, is involved in the regulation of extinction memory. Z-DNA is formed during fear learning and reduced during extinction learning, which is mediated, in part, by a direct interaction between Z-DNA and the RNA-editing enzyme Adar1. Adar1 binds to Z-DNA during fear extinction learning, which leads to a reduction in Z-DNA at sites where Adar1 is recruited. Knockdown of Adar1 leads to an inability to modify a previously acquired fear memory and blocks activity-dependent changes in DNA structure and RNA state-effects that are fully rescued by the introduction of full-length Adar1. These findings suggest a new mechanism of learning-induced gene regulation that is dependent on proteins that recognize alternate DNA structure states, which are required for memory flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W3022286508,"The potential of probiotics to manipulate the intestinal microbial ecosystem toward commensal bacteria growth offers great opportunity for enhancing health and performance in poultry. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of five probiotic-based formulations in modulating cecal microbiota in broilers at 21 and 42 days of age. Probiotics investigated included a synbiotic (SYNBIO), a yeast (YEAST), and three single-strain formulations of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (SINGLE1), B. subtilis (SINGLE2) and B. licheniformis (SINGLE3). Alpha-diversity analyses showed that cecal microbiota of SINGLE1, SINGLE2, and YEAST had low diversity compared to the control diet with no feed additive (CON) at 21d. At the same age, weighted Unifrac distance measure showed significant differences between samples from SYNBIO and CON (P = 0.02). However, by analyzing principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) with unweighted Unifrac, there was no evidence of clustering between CON and probiotic treatments. By 42d, there were no differences in alpha or beta-diversity in the microbiota of probiotic treatments compared to CON. Similarly, taxonomic microbial profiling did not show major changes in cecal microbial taxa. In conclusion, not all probiotic-based formulations tested had a core benefit on the modulation of microbiota. However, based on the quantitative beta diversity results, SYNBIO greatly influenced the cecal microbial community structure attributable to transient variations in relative taxon abundance."
https://openalex.org/W3022997786,"Bone loss is a severe complication of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Trehalose was intermittently administered in bile duct-ligated (BDL) male rats, a PBC-related osteoporosis model, for 4 weeks to reduce osteoporosis. Femoral bones were assessed ex vivo by micro computed tomography (CT) and histomorphometry. The potential mechanisms related to the reduction of osteoporosis were explored by evaluating the effect of trehalose on osteoblast autophagy, osteogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and ERK phosphorylation. The results demonstrated that trehalose reduced osteoporosis of BDL rats and decreased osteoblast-mediated osteoclast differentiation by enhancing osteoblast autophagy to regulate osteoprotegerin (OPG) secretion. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) increased the expression of OPG and OPG/receptor activator genes for nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) ratio, and reduced osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting autophagy flux and inducing autophagosome formation. Furthermore, trehalose increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MC3T3-E1 cells, and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 reversed the upregulation of OPG gene and reduction of trehalose-induced osteoclastogeneis. The treatment with HCQ markedly increased the ERK phosphorylation. The correlation between autophagosome formation and ERK phosphorylation was confirmed in autophagy proteins (ATG) 4B or ATG5-deficient cells. Thus, trehalose could decrease osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis and reduce PBC-related bone loss by regulating ERK phosphorylation via autophagosome formation."

This study was designed to identify specific biochemical manifestations of CKDu cases. All (119) non-dialysis definite CKDu patients in Girandurukotte and Wilgamuwa were selected. Blood and urine samples were collected and measured biochemical parameters. All analyses were performed in IBM SPSS statistics version 23 (IBM Corp, USA). The median blood pressure was normal though nearly half of the patients (45.4%) who were in the advanced stages (Stage 3b, 4 and 5) of CKDu. Patients without a history of hypertension before the diagnosis of CKDu (100%) and minimal proteinuria (26%) are similar to the previous findings. Patients without a history of diabetes before the CKDu diagnosis had high percentages of diabetes (15.7%) and pre-diabetes (59.8%) and hence indicated the possibility of uremia induced impaired glucose intolerance in the rural areas of the country. There were 62.2% patients who had low vitamin D and only a minority had evidence of bone mineral diseases. Out of liver disease markers serum glutamic pyruvic transaminases (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminases (SGOT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and Lactic acid degydrogenase (LDH) had an inverse correlation with the advancement of the disease indicating subclinical liver disease. Osmolality in serum and urine showed a discrepancy despite > 50% of CKDu patients had increased their serum osmolality. The current study supports most of the previously described manifestations of CKDu. Moreover, some specific patterns have been identified which need to be validated in a larger group."

The objective of this study was to establish a rat model of mastitis induced by S. aureus infection and to explore changes in the proteomes of mammary tissue in different udder states, providing a better understanding of the host immune response to S. aureus mastitis. On day 3 post-partum, 6 rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 3), with either 100 μL of PBS (blank group) or a S. aureus suspension containing 2×107 CFU·mL−1 (challenge group) infused into the mammary gland duct. After 24 h of infection, the rats were sacrificed, and mammary gland tissue was collected. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based technology was applied to compare the proteomes of healthy and mastitic mammary tissues. Compared with the control group, the challenge group had 555 proteins with significant differences in expression, of which 428 were significantly upregulated (FC>1.2 and p<0.05) and 127 were downregulated (FC>0.83 and p<0.05 or p<0.01). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that upregulated differentially significant expressed proteins (DSEPs) were associated with mainly immune responses, including integrin alpha M, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4, and alpha-2-macroglobulin. This study is the first in which a rat model of S. aureus-induced mastitis was used to explore the proteins related to mastitis in dairy cows by TMT technology, providing a model for replication of dairy cow S. aureus-induced mastitis experiments."

The nature of metabolism in αICs and its relationship to transport was not well-understood. Here, using multiphoton live cell imaging in mouse kidney tissue, FIB-SEM, and other complementary techniques, we provide new insights into mitochondrial structure and function in αICs. We show that αIC mitochondria have a rounded structure and are not located in close proximity to V-ATPase containing vesicles. They display a bright NAD(P)H fluorescence signal and low uptake of voltage-dependent dyes, but are energized by a pH gradient. However, expression of complex V (ATP synthase) is relatively low in αICs, even when stimulated by metabolic acidosis. In contrast, anaerobic glycolytic capacity is surprisingly high, and sufficient to maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis in the presence of complete aerobic inhibition. Moreover, glycolysis is essential for V-ATPase-mediated proton pumping. Key findings were replicated in narrow/clear cells in the epididymis, also part of the MRC family. In summary, using a range of cutting-edge techniques to investigate αIC metabolism in situ, we have discovered that these mitochondria dense cells have a high glycolytic capacity."

Genome-wide specific length amplified fragment (SLAF) sequencing method is a rapidly developed deep sequencing technologies used for selection and identification of genetic loci or markers. This study aimed to elucidate the genetic diversity of 122 onion accessions in China using the SLAF-seq method. A set of 122 onion accessions including 107 A.fistulosum L. var. viviparum Makino, 3 A.fistulosum L. var. gigantum Makino, 3 A.mongolicum Regel and 9 A.cepa L. accessions (3 whites, 3 reds and 3 yellows) from different regions in China were enrolled. Genomic DNA was isolated from young leaves and prepared for the SLAF-seq, which generated a total of 1,387.55 M reads and 162,321 high quality SNPs (integrity >0.5 and MAF >0.05). These SNPs were used for the construction of neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, in which 10 A.fistulosum L. var. viviparum Makino accessions from Yinchuan (Ningxia province) and Datong (Qinghai province) had close genetic relationship. The 3 A.cepa L. clusters (red, white and yellow) had close genetic relationship especially with the 97 A.fistulosum L. var. viviparum Makino accessions. Population structure analysis suggested entire population could be clustered into 3 groups, while principal component analysis (PCA) showed there were 4 genetic groups. We confirmed the SLAF-seq approach was effective in genetic diversity analysis in red onion accessions. The key findings would provide a reference to the Lou onion germplasm in China."

Among them, translocations present a specific meiotic segregation pattern able to give a higher percentage of unbalanced gametes that can induce fertility problems. In this study, the meiotic segregation patterns of 1p, 1q and 18 Bubalus bubalis chromosomes were analyzed in both total sperm fraction and motile sperm fraction of a t(1p;18) carrier and a control bulls by triple-color FISH analysis with a pool of specific BAC probes. The frequencies of each total sperm fraction products in the carrier resulting from alternate, adjacent I, adjacent II and 3:1 segregation were 39%, 20%, 1% and 38%, respectively. On the other hand, the frequencies of each motile sperm fraction products in the carrier resulting from alternate, adjacent I, adjacent II and 3:1 segregation were 93%, 5%, 0% and 2%, respectively. The frequencies of normal sperms in the carrier were 27% and 69% in total sperm fraction and motile sperm fraction, respectively. The frequencies detected in motile sperm fraction were also validated by comparison with bull's progeny. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the meiotic segregation patterns in motile sperm fractions of B. bubalis bull carrying a chromosomal translocation. These data suggest that translocation has a very limited effect on aneuploidy in the gametes, and therefore, on the reproductive abilities of the bull."

Although altered energetics play a central role in MH, MH-susceptible humans and mouse models are often described as having no phenotype until exposure to a triggering agent. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of the R163C ryanodine receptor 1 mutation, a common MH mutation in humans, on energy expenditure, and voluntary wheel running in mice. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect respiration calorimetry in wild-type (WT) and heterozygous R163C (HET) mice over a range of ambient temperatures. Energy expenditure adjusted for body weight or lean mass was increased (P < .05) in male, but not female, HET mice housed at 22°C or when housed at 28°C with a running wheel. In female mice, voluntary wheel running was decreased (P < .05) in the HET vs WT animals when analyzed across ambient temperatures. The thermoneutral zone was also widened in both male and female HET mice. The results of the study show that the R163C mutations alters energetics even at temperatures that do not typically induce MH."
https://openalex.org/W3021721934,"Uremic cardiomyopathy, characterized by hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis, is a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Urea transporter (UT) inhibition increases the excretion of water and urea, but the effect on uremic cardiomyopathy has not been studied. We tested UT inhibition by dimethylthiourea (DMTU) in 5/6 nephrectomy mice. This treatment suppressed CKD-induced hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. In CKD mice, cardiac fibrosis was associated with upregulation of UT and vimentin abundance. Inhibition of UT suppressed vimentin amount. Left ventricular mass index in DMTU-treated CKD was less compared with non-treated CKD mice as measured by echocardiography. Nephrectomy was performed in UT-A1/A3 knockout (UT-KO) to further confirm our finding. UT-A1/A3 deletion attenuates the CKD-induced increase in cardiac fibrosis and hypertension. The amount of α-smooth muscle actin and tgf-β were significantly less in UT-KO with CKD than WT/CKD mice. To study the possibility that UT inhibition could benefit heart, we measured the mRNA of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and found both were sharply increased in CKD heart; DMTU treatment and UT-KO significantly abolished these increases. Conclusion: Inhibition of UT reduced hypertension, cardiac fibrosis, and improved heart function. These changes are accompanied by inhibition of renin and ACE."

We compared cannula and scalpel-bougie emergency front-of-neck access techniques in an anaesthetised porcine model with thick pretracheal tissue. Cannula and scalpel-bougie cricothyroidotomy techniques were performed in 11 and 12 anaesthetised pigs, respectively. Following successful tracheal access, oxygenation was commenced and continued for 5 min using Rapid-O2 device for cannula and circle breathing system for scalpel-bougie study groups. The primary outcome was a successful rescue oxygenation determined by maintenance of arterial oxygen saturation >90% 5 min after the beginning of oxygenation. Secondary outcomes included success rate of airway device placement, time to successful airway device placement, and trauma to the neck and airway. The success rate of rescue oxygenation was 18% after cannula, and 83% after scalpel-bougie technique (P = 0.003). The success rate of airway device placement was 73% with cannula and 92% with scalpel-bougie technique (P = 0.317). Median (inter-quartile-range) times to successful airway device placement were 108 (30–256) and 90 (63–188) seconds (P = 0.762) for cannula and scalpel-bougie emergency front-of-neck access, respectively. Proportion of animals with iatrogenic trauma additional to the procedure itself was 27% for cannula and 75% for scalpel-bougie technique (P = 0.039). Thus, in the porcine model of obesity, the scalpel-bougie technique was more successful in establishing and maintaining rescue oxygenation than cannula-based technique; however, it was associated with a higher risk of severe trauma."
https://openalex.org/W3021624749,"Prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2α) analogues such as latanoprost are common first-line intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering medications. However, their clinical use is limited in some patient populations due to minimal or no IOP lowering response or side effects. In searching for a more targeted approach for IOP reduction, our lab recently identified Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) as a molecule that was required for latanoprost-mediated IOP reduction and also acted as a stand-alone IOP lowering agent. In order to determine whether latanoprost and STC-1 were equivalent and/or additive for IOP reduction, we treated C57BL/6J mice with one or a combination of these agents and measured IOP. Importance of the FP receptor for latanoprost- and STC-1-mediated IOP reduction was examined in C57BL/6J mice utilizing the pharmacologic FP receptor inhibitor AL-8810 as well as FP receptor knockout mice generated in our laboratory. Latanoprost-free acid (LFA) and STC-1 reduced IOP to a similar degree and were non-additive in C57BL/6J mice. As expected, the IOP lowering effects of LFA were abrogated by pharmacologic inhibition of the FP receptor with AL-8810 and in FP receptor knockout mice. In contrast, STC-1 maintained IOP-lowering effects in the presence of AL-8810 and also in FP receptor knockout mice. These results suggest that LFA and STC-1 show equivalent and non-additive IOP reduction in C57BL/6J mice and that unlike LFA, STC-1-mediated IOP reduction occurs independent of the FP receptor."

The purpose of this study is to investigative whether anti-human serum albumin (HSA) autoantibodies exist in AIBD sera and their potential pathogenesis. By immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting, immunofluorescence assay, anti-HSA autoantibodies could be detected in AIBD sera; by ELISAs, positive rates of AIBD sera for IgG and IgA anti-HSA autoantibodies were 29% and 34%, respectively. The IgG anti-HSA autoantibodies in ABID sera recognized a number of HSA antigen epitopes and therefore a polyclonal antibody against HSA were next employed to study its pathogenesis. In vitro cell and tissue culture models, anti-HSA antibody could influence DNA damage-related signaling proteins, via activation of phospho-p38 signaling pathway. This is the first report that an autoantibody may influence DNA damage-related signaling proteins. Statistical analyses also proved that anti-HSA autoantibodies were positively correlated with various known autoantibodies and clinical features of ABID patients. In summary, IgG and IgA autoantibodies to HSA may have diagnosis values for AIBD. DNA damage-related signaling proteins might be involved in the pathogenic role of anti-HSA autoantibodies in AIBD. Phospho-p38 signaling pathway is a potential target for treatment of AIBD positive for serum anti-HSA autoantibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3022343681,"Patients with DYT1 dystonia caused by the mutated TOR1A gene exhibit risk neutral behaviour compared to controls who are risk averse in the same reinforcement learning task. It is unclear whether this behaviour can be linked to changes in cortico-striatal plasticity demonstrated in animal models which share the same TOR1A mutation. We hypothesised that we could reproduce the experimental risk taking behaviour using a model of the basal ganglia under conditions where cortico-striatal plasticity was abnormal. As dopamine exerts opposing effects on cortico-striatal plasticity via different receptors expressed on medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the direct (D1R dominant, dMSNs) and indirect (D2R dominant, iMSNs) pathways, we tested whether abnormalities in cortico-striatal plasticity in one or both of these pathways could explain the patient’s behaviour. Our model could generate simulated behaviour indistinguishable from patients when cortico-striatal plasticity was abnormal in both dMSNs and iMSNs in opposite directions. The risk neutral behaviour of the patients was replicated when increased cortico-striatal long term potentiation in dMSN’s was in combination with increased long term depression in iMSN’s. This result is consistent with previous observations in rodent models of increased cortico-striatal plasticity at in dMSNs, but contrasts with the pattern reported in vitro of dopamine D2 receptor dependant increases in cortico-striatal LTP and loss of LTD at iMSNs. These results suggest that additional factors in patients who manifest motor symptoms may lead to divergent effects on D2 receptor dependant cortico-striatal plasticity that are not apparent in rodent models of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3022254669,"The 6-minute walk test is generally considered a standard test for the evaluation of short-term maximal physical performance. It has not been evaluated whether psychological factors, such as anxiety or depression, affect the performance or the results of the test. The main aim of this study was to investigate whether a correlation exists between psychological factors and the data from the 6-minute walking test. The study cohort consisted of 85 (♀ = 34 and ♂ = 51) 66 ± 10 (mean ± SD) year-old patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalized for disease exacerbation. Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) (% predicted) as predictor for lung function, as well as anxiety and depression symptoms assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as psychological predictors were collected. Bivariate correlations and hierarchical linear regression models were used to analyse the correlations. Walking distance was on average 260m ± 107m and ranged from 64m to 480m. HADS was negatively correlated with 6-min walking distance (r = 0.441, p = .0009, r = -.523, p = 00006). Hierarchical linear regression showed that FEV1 alone explained 33%, and together with the psychological variables anxiety and depression explained 42% of the variance of results from the 6-minute walking test. These findings demonstrated that 11% of the data correlated with the psychological variables alone (p = .011). The effect size for lung function (f2 = .717) and psychological variables (f2 = .352) were high, whereas the socio-demographic variables sex, age, educational level and BMI could not explain any additional variance in our cohort. In conclusion, our study indicates that psychological factors such as symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with lower physical functional performance in the 6-minute walking test. As such, these factors should also be assessed. Future research is needed to show if treatments of anxiety and depression can improve the walking distance in COPD patients."

This study aims to compare the impact on beta-cell function and insulin resistance of prednisone 40 mg between adults with newly diagnosed T2DM and healthy adults. Methods Five adults with T2DM and five healthy adults, all between 18–50 years, were enrolled. T2DM diagnosis was less than one year prior, HbA1c<75 mmol/mol (9.0%), with metformin treatment only. Pre- and post-therapy testing included 75-g oral glucose tolerance, plasma glucose, C-peptide, and insulin. Intervention therapy was prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days. Results Upon therapy completion, HOMA-IR did not increase or differ between groups. Percentile difference for HOMA-%B and insulinogenic index in those with T2DM was significantly lower statistically (50.4% and 69.2% respectively) compared to healthy subjects (19% and 32.2%). Conclusions Contrary to the assumption that insulin resistance is the main driver of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, results indicate that decreased beta-cell insulin secretion is the more likely cause in those with T2DM. This is evidenced by significant drops in C-peptide AUC and HOMA-%B and increased glucose AUC in T2DM group only.

The current study investigated the effect of different doses of pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin/human chorionic gonadotrophin (PMSG/hCG) and repeated ovarian stimulation (OS) on the expression of the Mili, Miwi, Mael, Tdrd1, Tdrd9, qnd Mitopld genes, which have crucial roles in the biogenesis and function of piRNAs. Here, we found that after treatment with 7.5 I.U. PMSG/hCG and two repeated rounds of OS, both the mRNA and protein levels of Tdrd9, Tdrd1 and Mael showed the greatest decrease in the ovarian tissue, but the plasma E2 levels showed the strongest increases (p<0.05). However, we found that the Mitopld, Miwi and Mili gene levels were decreased significantly after treatment with 12.5 I.U. PMSG/hCG. Our results suggested that exogenous gonadotropin administration leads to a significant decrease in the expression of the Mili, Miwi, Mael, Tdrd1, Tdrd9 and Mitopld genes, which are critically important in the piRNA pathway, and the changes in the expression levels of Tdrd9, Tdrd1 and Mael may be associated with plasma E2 levels. New comprehensive studies are needed to reduce the potential effects of OS on the piRNA pathway, which silences transposable elements and maintains genome integrity, and to contribute to the safety of OS."

In higher vertebrates, the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor gives rise to α-, β-, and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), which are involved in numerous physiological aspects. Genetic defects in POMC are linked to metabolic disorders in humans and animals. In the present study, we undertook an evolutionary genetic approach complemented with biochemistry to investigate the functional consequences of genetic polymorphisms in the POMC system of free-living outbred barn owl species (family Tytonidae) at the molecular level. Our phylogenetic studies revealed a striking correlation between a loss-of-function H9P mutation in the β-MSH receptor-binding motif and an extension of a poly-serine stretch in γ3-MSH to ≥7 residues that arose in the barn owl group 6–8 MYA ago. We found that extension of the poly-serine stretches in the γ-MSH locus affects POMC precursor processing, increasing γ3-MSH production at the expense of γ2-MSH and resulting in an overall reduction of γ-MSH signaling, which may be part of a negative feedback mechanism. Extension of the γ3-MSH poly-serine stretches ≥7 further markedly increases peptide hormone stability in plasma, which is conserved in humans, and is likely relevant to its endocrine function. In sum, our phylogenetic analysis of POMC in wild living owls uncovered a H9P β-MSH mutation subsequent to serine extension in γ3-MSH to 7 residues, which was then followed by further serine extension. The linked MSH mutations highlight the genetic plasticity enabled by the modular design of the POMC gene."
https://openalex.org/W3022143520,"A pharmacogenomics-based pathway represents a series of reactions that occur between drugs and genes in the human body after drug administration. PG-path is a pharmacogenomics-based pathway that standardizes and visualizes the components (nodes) and actions (edges) involved in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes. It provides an intuitive understanding of the drug response in the human body. A pharmacokinetic pathway visualizes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) at the systemic level, and a pharmacodynamic pathway shows the action of the drug in the target cell at the cellular-molecular level. The genes in the pathway are displayed in locations similar to those inside the body. PG-path allows personalized pathways to be created by annotating each gene with the overall impact degree of deleterious variants in the gene. These personalized pathways play a role in assisting tailored individual prescriptions by predicting changes in the drug concentration in the plasma. PG-path also supports counseling for personalized drug therapy by providing visualization and documentation."
https://openalex.org/W3022350360,"The MDR/MTB ELITe MGB® Kit on the ELITe InGenius® platform (ELITechGroup SpA, Italy) is the first system for simultaneous detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBc) genome and the main mutations responsible for resistance to Isoniazid (inhA, katG) and Rifampicin (rpoB), from decontaminated and heat inactivated samples. In this study we compared the performance of the MDR/MTB ELITe MGB® Kit (ELITe) with culture in 100 pulmonary and 160 extra-pulmonary samples. The sensitivity and specificity of ELITe compared to culture for pulmonary samples were 98.0% and 98.0% respectively; for extra-pulmonary samples the overall sensitivity was 86.3% (80% for urine, 85% for biopsy and gastric aspirate and 95% for cavitary fluid) and specificity was 100%. Genotypic Isoniazid and Rifampicin susceptibility typing was feasible in 96% of sputum MTBc-positive samples and 43% of extra-pulmonary samples; all samples were found to be drug susceptible by phenotypic and ELITe (100% agreement). Detection of mutations in the rpoB, kat G or inhA genes was evaluated on 300 spiked samples (60 per biological matrix) and all resistance profiles were correctly identified by ELITe. Molecular agreement between ELITe and Xpert was 98.0% and 93.3% for pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples, respectively. In conclusion, our results provide evidence to support the use of MDR/MTB ELITe MGB® Kit in combination with ELITe InGenius® for the diagnosis of MTBc and the detection of Rifampicin and Isoniazid resistance-related mutations in both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples. This system simplifies the laboratory workflow, shortens report time and is an aid in choosing appropriate therapeutic treatment and patient management."
