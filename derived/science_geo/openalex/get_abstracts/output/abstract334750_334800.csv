https://openalex.org/W2042105773,"Detailed chemical analyses reveal that acid precipitation (pH < 5.6) in the northeastern United States is caused by the strong mineral acids sulfuric and nitric. There is a large array of other proton sources in precipitation, weak acids and Bronsted acids; however, although these other acids contribute to the total acidity of precipitation, they have a minimal influence on the free acidity (ambient pH) of acid precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2077574262,"Merrihueite, a new mineral with the approximate chemical composition (K,Na)(2)(Fe,Mg)(5)Si(12)O(30), occurs with iron-rich olivine, iron-poor pyroxene, and nickel-iron in a few chondrules of the MezÃ¶-Madaras chondrite. The refractive index lies between 1.559 and 1.592; the birefringence for each composition is low to moderate. X-ray powder data for merrihueite are nearly identical to those for osumilite, (K,Na,Ca)(Mg,Fe)(2)(Al,Fe)(3)(Si,Al)(12)O(30)-H(2)O, and very similar to those for synthetic K(2)Mg(5) Si(12) O(30). Merrihueite is interpreted as an alkali-ferromagnesian silicate mineral of the osumilite type. It is named in honor of the late Craig M. Merrihue, meteoriticist, of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory."
https://openalex.org/W2081500671,"A new mineral, calcium chloride hexahydrate, was discovered in the Don Juan Pond in Victoria Land, Antarctica. The optical properties, chemical analysis, and powder patterns obtained by x-ray diffraction agree with those of artificial calcium chloride hexahydrate. The name Antarcticite is proposed for the new mineral."
https://openalex.org/W2084902380,"An electrochemical concentration cell is proposed as a means of extracting the energy released from the mixing of freshwater with seawater. In order to obtain the maximum power from such a cell, a small amount of seawater must be added to the freshwater prior to its introduction into the cell in order to lower the internal resistance of the cell. The work available from the electrochemical concentration cell is of the same order of magnitude as the work derived from the use of an osmotic pump to extract energy from seawater. Both of these saline water techniques should be considered when unconventional, long-range power sources are evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2031110915,"Ultraviolet spectrograms of Mars (2400 to 3500 angstroms, ~50-A resolution) have been obtained with an objective grating spectrograph on an Aerobee rocket. The data indicate a reflectivity of 0.04 to 0.08 in the ultraviolet, increasing toward shorter wavelength according to a Rayleigh Law. The data can be represented by a model having an atmosphere of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and argon, and a surface pressure of about 5 to 20 millibars. The photographic appearance of the planet in the blue is interpreted as a loss of surface contrast and reflectivity rather than an absorption in the atmosphere by the ""blue haze."" The model permits prediction of the general appearance of the planet in the photographic ultraviolet, blue, visible, and red. There are serious biological implications since the model suggests that ultraviolet radiation (2000 to 3000 A) will reach the surface."
https://openalex.org/W1986648597,"X-ray diffraction studies, chemical analyses, infrared-absorption studies, and nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectrum analysis demonstrate the existence of the mineral brucite, Mg(OH)(2), in the skeletal carbonate secreted by the red marine alga Goniolithon sp. Electron microprobe examination of the carbonate shows that the brucite is concentrated in certain areas of the skeletal structure. These results explain the anomalously high solubility and large cell size of the Goniolithon ""carbonate"" observed by earlier investigators."
https://openalex.org/W1999908819,"Brucite, Mg(OH)(2), identified by differential thermal analysis, has been found in the high-magnesian calcite skeleton of Goniolithon, a marine calcareous alga. This mineral amounts to about 5 percent of the skeleton by weight, and can account for the discrepancy between total amount of magnesium determined by chemical analysis and the magnesium in metastable solid solution in calcite as determined by the size of the unit cell of calcite."
https://openalex.org/W2092407644,"Lidar (from ""light detection and ranging"") is the optical counterpart of meteorological radar. At optical wavelengths, very much smaller atmospheric particles can be detected than at microwave wavelengths. With a laser power source, a transmitter uses a lens system to beam very intense pulses of monochromatic light of extremely short duration. Light backscattered by the atmosphere is collected in a receiver system that is essentially a telescope coaligned with the transmitter, and a narrow-pass filter allows only light of the transmitted frequency to be detected by a photomultiplier. Data are presented on an oscilloscope as a trace of signal intensity versus range (the A-scope of radar practice) and photographed."
https://openalex.org/W4229911846,"Spherical particles of silicate composition occur on the surface of some shatter cones from the collar rocks around the Vredefort structure, South Africa. They are best developed on shatter cones from a shale horizon but are also found on more arenaceous rocks and banded ironstones. They have not been found on shatter cones from the purer quartzites."

https://openalex.org/W1967837787,"Stacked mammoth bones at the Colby site in northern Wyoming reflect human cultural activity that is believed to have been peripheral to the butchering and processing of the animals. A projectile point found beneath the first bones placed in the pile leaves no doubt of human involvement in the stacking of the bones, but the significance of this kind of cultural activity is open to several interpretations."

https://openalex.org/W1994088795,"Infrared spectra of Saturn's ring correspond closely with the reflection spectrum of water ice. This result supports Kuiper's suggestion for the composition of the ring. The absence of the strong absorption at 8873 A in spectra of Io, Ganymede, and Callisto leads to a new upper limit for the abundance of methane in possible atmospheres of these satellites."

https://openalex.org/W1992503132,"A novel, simply made, hand-powered microcentrifuge has been developed for use in the field. It handles as many as eight samples simultaneously. The principal materials are sheet nylon, polyester cord, and polyethylene tubing. Maximum speed of the centrifuge is 10,000 revolutions per minute; maximum radial acceleration, 8400g. Among other uses, the centrifuge serves to obtain plasma for immunoelectrophoresis and flocculation and agglutination tests and for determination of plasma cholinesterase and total solids (refractometrically). Hematocrit values may be obtained and blood parasites concentrated."
