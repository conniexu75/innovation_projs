Analysis of amino acid sequences available from various mammalian and avian ATPDases revealed their close homology with CD39, a putative B-cell activation marker. We, therefore, isolated CD39 cDNA from human endothelial cells and expressed this in COS-7 cells. CD39 was found to have both immunological identity to, and functional characteristics of, the vascular ATPDase. We also demonstrated that ATPDase could inhibit platelet aggregation in response to ADP, collagen, and thrombin, and that this activity in transfected COS-7 cells was lost following exposure to oxidative stress. ATPDase mRNA was present in human placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and heart and was not detected in brain. Multiple RNA bands were detected with the CD39 cDNA probe that most probably represent different splicing products. Finally, we identified an unique conserved motif, DLGGASTQ, that could be crucial for nucleotide binding, activity, and/or structure of ATPDase. Because ATPDase activity is lost with endothelial cell activation, overexpression of the functional enzyme, or a truncated mutant thereof, may prevent platelet activation associated with vascular inflammation.

The quiescent vascular endothelium maintains blood fluidity by inhibiting blood clotting, by the regulation of platelet activation and adhesion, and by promoting fibrinolysis. In large part, the antithrombotic effects are mediated by surface molecules present on resting endothelial cells (EC), 1The abbreviations used are: ECendothelial cellATPDaseATP diphosphohydrolasemAbmonoclonal antibodyPCRpolymerase chain reactionFCSfetal calf serum. such as thrombomodulin and heparan sulfate (1Preissner K.T. Haemostasis. 1988; 18: 271-306PubMed Google Scholar). ECs also have the potential to regulate platelet activation by the synthesis of prostacyclin and nitric oxide and by the surface expression of ATP diphosphohydrolase (ATPDase). This ecto-enzyme (EC 3.6.1.5) has been also described as apyrase, ecto-ATPase, ecto-ADPase, nucleotide phosphohydrolase, or ATP pyrophosphohydrolase (2Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). ATPDases are generally low abundance proteins that have been difficult to purify, given their sensitivity to detergents and the propensity to co-isolate with other proteins. High levels of ATPDase activity are, however, associated with the vasculature (endothelium, smooth muscle, and cardiac cells), lymphocytes, and platelets (2Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). endothelial cell ATP diphosphohydrolase monoclonal antibody polymerase chain reaction fetal calf serum. Extracellular tri- and diphosphate nucleosides appear in tissue fluids and plasma as a consequence of lysis of blood cells and tissues and through secretion from platelet-dense granules (3Luthje J. J. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Vascular ATPDase expressed by quiescent ECs hydrolyzes extracellular ATP and ADP to AMP, which is further converted to adenosine by 5′-nucleotidase (3Luthje J. J. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In addition, ADP, which interacts with purinergic P2t receptors, is a powerful agonist for platelet recruitment, adhesion, and aggregation, whereas adenosine is an antagonist of these processes (5Niewiarowski S. Thomas D.P. Nature. 1969; 222: 1269-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Pearson J.D. Gordon J.L. Nature. 1979; 281: 384-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 7Gordon E.L. Pearson J.D. Slakey L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15496-15504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the function of ATPDase is critical for the inhibition of platelet aggregation following the hydrolysis of ADP to AMP with the ultimate generation of adenosine (4Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). We have recently provided evidence for the loss of ATPDase activity following EC activation, such as would occur in vascular inflammatory states or xenograft rejection, where platelet deposition is a consistent component (8Robson S.C. Candinas D. Hancock W.W. Siegel J. Millan M. Bach F.H. Transplant Proc. 1996; 28: 536PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bach F.H. Robson S.C. Winkler H. Ferran C. Stuhlmeier K. Wrighton C. Hancock W.W. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Such changes in the level of expression and activity of the ATPDase may, therefore, be of pathogenetic significance and prompted our attempts to identify and study this vascular ecto-enzyme. The biochemical characterization of ATPDase purified from various tissues and organisms has generally revealed a highly glycosylated protein of molecular mass 70-100 kDa. This ecto-enzyme is Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent, is not sensitive to known inhibitors of the various other ATPases, and hydrolyzes nucleoside tri- and diphosphates but not monophosphates. These enzymatic characteristics have facilitated classification of these proteins into a subgrouping termed E-type ATPases (2Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Recently, ATPDase from human placenta, porcine pancreas, bovine aorta, and chicken gizzard have been purified and partially sequenced (10Christophoridis S. Papamarcaki T. Galaris D. Kellner R. Tsolas O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Sevigny J. Cote Y.P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Sevigny J. Levesque F.P. Grondin G. Beaudoin A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 13Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our analysis of these sequence data has shown significant homology to human CD39 (Fig. 1) (14Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.L. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III., R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583PubMed Google Scholar). CD39 is known to be an acidic glycoprotein with molecular mass 70-100 kDa that contains two potential transmembrane regions and six potential glycosylation sites. Interestingly, CD39 was originally described as a B-cell activation marker and has been shown to be expressed on the surface of other activated lymphocytes and quiescent vascular endothelium (14Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.L. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III., R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, CD39 is considered to participate in the enhancement of cell-cell interactions; monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to certain epitopes of CD39 induce homotypic adhesion, probably through involvement of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) (15Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244PubMed Google Scholar). Potato apyrase (a plant ATPDase) has been recently purified and was independently found to have sequence homology to certain newly identified nucleotide triphosphatases and to murine and human CD39 (16Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Subsequent work by Wang and Guidotti has confirmed that B-cell CD39 had ecto-apyrase activity (17Wang T.-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because the functional significance of these observations remains unclear, we have further evaluated the role of CD39/ATPDase in modulating platelet reactivity and examined the distribution and nature of CD39 mRNA expression in human tissues. Porcine pancreas and bovine aorta ATPDases were purified according to the methods described previously (11Sevigny J. Cote Y.P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Sevigny J. Levesque F.P. Grondin G. Beaudoin A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Purified proteins were then sequenced at the Biotechnology Research Institute of Montreal. The sequence of N terminus of the porcine pancreatic ATPDase and five internal sequences from the bovine aortic ATPDase following CNBr cleavage were obtained and were available for our study. To amplify a cDNA fragment directly from mRNA, 0.1 μg of total RNA was prepared from human umbilical ECs (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) annealed with oligo(dT)16 primer, and the first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The product of this reaction served as a template for PCR amplification. The following primers were designed based on the CD39 cDNA sequence (14Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.L. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III., R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBank accession no. S73813): forward primer, 5′-GAAAGGATCCGAAAACAAAAGCTGCTACT-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-AGAATCTAGACAGTAAAAGCCAAGGAAGC-3′. The DNA fragment of interest was amplified by PCR with the “hot start” technique, according to the Perkin-Elmer protocol. Amplification was carried out for 36 cycles (1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 57°C, and 3 min at 72°C), followed by 10 min at 72°C. The amplified PCR product was examined on 1% agarose gel. Restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing confirmed that the obtained cDNA fragment was CD39. The PCR product was subcloned into the pCRII vector (TA cloning kit; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA); subsequently, plasmid was multiplied in “One Shot” bacteria (Invitrogen), purified, and digested with NotI and SpeI. The insert was purified on glass beads (Bio101, Vista, CA) and then cloned into a mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) previously digested with NotI and XbaI. Plasmid DNA was purified with a Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and checked for the correct orientation of the insert by restriction mapping; this was then followed by confirmation of the correct sequence (Applied Biosystem, model 373A). All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 30-mm well and transfected 20-24 h later with Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were exposed to 1 μg of DNA (pCDNA3 or pCDNA3-CD39) and 4 μl of Lipofectamine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FCS for 5 h, followed by the addition of an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% FCS. Twenty-four h after transfection, the culture medium was changed (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% FCS), and ~70 h posttransfection, COS-7 cells were used for analyses. Control COS-7 cells used for transfection were negative for CD39 as analyzed by Western blotting and FACS with anti-CD39 mAb; ATPDase biochemical activity was negligible. COS-7 cells were fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. The presence of CD39 antigen was revealed by anti-human CD39 mAb (Accurate, Westbury, NY) using biotinylated goat antimouse IgG and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) as a detection system. 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) was used as the horseradish peroxidase substrate. COS-7 cells after transient transfection were harvested by gentle pipetting with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10 mM EDTA. They were washed with buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 5% FCS, and 0.02% sodium azide) and incubated with either antihuman CD39 mAb, BU61 (IgG1) (Accurate) or an isotype-matched control mAb, anti-CD25/ACT-1 (IgG1) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice and incubated with antimouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Finally, cells were washed twice and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan bench top model using Cellquest II software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data were collected from viable cells only, as determined by propidium iodide uptake. Cells were washed three times with Tris-saline buffer, pH 8.0 at 4°C, harvested by scraping in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing aprotinin (0.02 KIU/ml) and centrifuged 800 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in the harvesting buffer and then disrupted in a Potter homogenizer and centrifuged 800 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants containing cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis. Cell membranes were used for ATPDase activity and platelet aggregation assays. These were prepared by ultracentrifugation of cell lysates at 47,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C, followed by second centrifugation (57,000 rpm for 50 min at 4°C) of the resuspended pellet. Membranes were resuspended in 7.5% glycerol in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protein was measured according to the Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Proteins (20 μg per lane) were separated on a 10% gel under denaturing conditions, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semidry electroblotting and probed with either a rabbit polyclonal antibody to porcine pancreas ATPDase or monoclonal antibody to CD39 (Accurate). Bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG or goat antimouse IgG (Pierce) and the Enhanced ChemiLuminescence assay (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal antibody to ATPDase was generated to a peptide sequence corresponding to the N terminus of the purified protein from porcine pancreas (KSDTQETYGALDLGGA) (11Sevigny J. Cote Y.P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This antibody cross-reacted with ATPDase from bovine aorta, lung, and trachea, as determined by Western blotting. COS-7 cell lysates were incubated with either 200 μM ADP or 200 μM ATP, and Ca2+- or Mg2+-dependent release of free phosphate was determined. Malachite green was added to stop the reaction, and absorbance was measured at 610 nm to determine levels of phosphate generation against the standard curve of KH2PO4 (21Geladopoulos T.P. Sotioudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Monolayers of transiently transfected COS-7 cells and appropriate control cells were analyzed for the ability to hydrolyze extracellular [14C]ADP (50 μCi/reaction; DuPont NEN) and was carried out on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Whatman Laboratory Division, Clifton, NJ). The solvent system comprised of isobutyl alcohol:1-pentanol:ethylene glycol monoethyl ether:NH4OH water at ratios 90:60:180:90:120. The separated compounds were scanned for radioactivity with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and degradation of the [14C]ADP was determined by ImageQuant software according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blood was taken after informed consent from apparently healthy human volunteers and anticoagulated with 0.1 volume 3.2% sodium citrate. Platelet rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation of whole blood at 280 × g for 15 min at 22°C. The platelet aggregation assay used a two-sample, four-channel Whole Blood Lumi-Aggregometer, model 560 (Chronolog Corp., Havertown, PA). Platelet-rich plasma was preincubated with COS-7 cell membrane or cell lysate preparations for 10 min at 37°C in a siliconized glass cuvette containing a stirring bar, followed by stimulation with either ADP (5 μM), collagen (5 μg/ml), or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) (Chronolog Corp.). Platelet aggregation was recorded for at least 10 min. Data were expressed as the percentage of light transmission with platelet-poor plasma equal to 100%. COS-7 cells (control, transfected with pCDNA3 and with pCDNA3-CD39) were exposed for 2 h to either H2O2 (100 μM; Sigma) or xanthine oxidase (100 milliunits/ml; Boehringer Mannheim) and xanthine (200 μM; Sigma) to directly generate the oxidative stress observed to abrogate EC ATPDase function (8Robson S.C. Candinas D. Hancock W.W. Siegel J. Millan M. Bach F.H. Transplant Proc. 1996; 28: 536PubMed Google Scholar). 2Robson, S. C., Kaczmarck, E., Siegel, J. B., Candinas, D., Koziak, K., Millan, M., Hancock, W. W., and Bach, F. H. (1997) J. Exp. Med., in press. These experiments were performed to determine the direct effect of reactive oxygen intermediates upon enzymatic function and immunoreactivity of the recombinant CD39/ATPDase. Cells were harvested, and the lysates and membrane preparations were then used for biochemical analysis to determine their effect on stimulated platelet aggregation and were subjected to Western blotting. For tissue mRNA analysis, a Multiple Tissue Northern blot, a charge-modified nylon membrane to which poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg per lane) from multiple human tissues had been transferred, was used (Clontech Laboratories, San Diego, CA). For the probe, our pCDNA3-CD39 construct was digested with BamHI and XbaI, and CD39 cDNA fragment (1714 base pairs) was purified with the Gene-Clean kit (Bio101) and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using Ready-To-Go labeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Prehybridization, hybridization, washes, and stripping of the membrane were carried out with the rapid hybridization protocol from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Final washes were at 60°C in 0.2 × sodium saline citrate/0.1% SDS. The blots were exposed to Kodak Biomax Mr film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with intensifying screens at −80°C for 1 day. We purified ATPDase from pig pancreas and bovine aorta according to the method described earlier and sequenced these proteins (11Sevigny J. Cote Y.P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Sevigny J. Levesque F.P. Grondin G. Beaudoin A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The obtained sequences originated from the N terminus of the pig pancreas ATPDase and five internal fragments of bovine aorta ATPDase, and all showed remarkable homology to human CD39 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 also presents previously published partial amino acid sequences of ATPDases purified from human placenta (10Christophoridis S. Papamarcaki T. Galaris D. Kellner R. Tsolas O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and chicken gizzard (13Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which confirm previously unrecognized homology with CD39. The molecular mass of both CD39 and vascular ATPDase is 78 kDa and becomes 54 kDa after removal of Asp-linked oligosaccharides by N-glycosidase (12Sevigny J. Levesque F.P. Grondin G. Beaudoin A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 15Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244PubMed Google Scholar); these data suggest that CD39 and ATPDase may represent the same protein. To test the hypothesis that CD39 has ATPDase activity, we isolated CD39 cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR reaction using RNA prepared from human umbilical EC as a template for the first cDNA strand. Primers homologous to CD39 generated PCR product of the expected size, viz. 1714 base pairs. The PCR product was subjected to restriction mapping and then sequenced (data not shown). This confirmed the identity of the PCR fragment with the published sequence of human CD39 (14Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.L. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III., R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was subcloned into the pCRII vector, excised with NotI and SpeI, and subsequently cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCDNA3. COS-7 cells were then transiently transfected with pCDNA3-CD39 and used for further analyses. In each experiment, we used nontransfected COS-7 cells and cells transfected with pCDNA3 alone as the controls. The expression of CD39 on the surface of COS-7 cells was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. Cells used for flow cytometry analysis were incubated with either mAb to CD39 or to CD25 of the same isotype. Cytofluorometric analysis confirmed the presence of CD39 on the surface of transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2). Immunocytostaining confirmed that only cell populations transfected with pCDNA3-CD39, and not the control cells, were stained by the mAb to human CD39 (data not shown). To evaluate the identity of CD39 with ATPDase, cell lysates from control and transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Both the mAb to CD39 and a polyclonal antibody to ATPDase recognized a band of the same mobility, with the molecular mass ~80 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively), a finding strongly supporting our hypothesis of identity between CD39 and ATPDase. In addition, the polyclonal antibody recognized a second band around 53 kDa, which could represent a truncated form of the ATPDase nonreactive with the monoclonal antibody to CD39. Consistently, specific CD39 and ATPDase immunoreactivity was detected only in pCDNA3-CD39 transfected cell populations. On the basis of apparent molecular and antigenic similarities between CD39 and ATPDase, we next evaluated selected biochemical functional characteristics of CD39. We incubated COS-7 cell membrane preparations with exogenous ADP or ATP and determined ATPDase activity by measuring divalent cation-dependent phosphate release by standard biochemical techniques. The control COS-7 cells essentially did not hydrolyze ADP or ATP, whereas pCDNA3-CD39 transfected cells exhibited very high levels of ATPDase activity for both substrates (Fig. 4). The ATPDase expressed by CD39 transfected cells did not act on exogenous AMP. In addition, ADP hydrolysis was totally inhibited by 5 mM EDTA, reduced by 60% with 20 mM sodium azide and unaffected by 3 mM ouabain. These inhibitory data are largely consistent with the classification of the vascular ATPDase as an E-type ATPase (2Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We also investigated the activity of expressed enzyme by studying the capacity of intact transfected COS-7 cells to hydrolyze radiolabeled ADP, assayed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). In a representative experiment, transiently transfected cells converted 68% of the 50 μCi of [14C]ADP to [14C]AMP over 20 min, as compared to 11 and 9% for cells transfected with the pCDNA3-only and nontransfected COS-7 cells, respectively, under the identical experimental conditions. Additionally, protein from crude preparations of human umbilical cord vein immunoprecipitated with anti-CD39 also had all of the required characteristics of E-type ATPase. These included specific substrate specificity for ATP and ADP, Ca2+ and Mg2+ dependence, insensitivity to 5 mM tetramizole (an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase), and inhibition by 20 mM sodium azide by 57 and 47% for ADP and ATP as substrates, respectively. Because our interest in the vascular ATPDase has concerned the regulation of platelet activation by adenosine nucleotides in the setting of vascular inflammatory disorders, we next investigated the effect of COS-7 cells transfected with pCDNA3-CD39 on platelet aggregation in vitro. Membrane preparations from cells expressing CD39 consistently inhibited platelet aggregation in response to exogenous ADP, whereas membranes from the control cells transfected with pCDNA3-only had no significant effect (Fig. 5A). Comparable specific inhibitory effects were observed when platelets were stimulated by collagen (5 μg/ml) or by low levels of thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence of the transfected COS-7 membranes. Thus, platelet aggregation in response to agonists other than ADP was inhibited only by COS-7 cells expressing CD39 (Fig. 5, B and C). These latter observations also confirm the established dependence of platelet aggregation following collagen and thrombin stimulation upon platelet-released ADP in vitro. To generate oxidative stress and to evaluate the effect of reactive oxygen intermediates upon the ATPDase function of CD39, COS-7 cells transfected with pCDNA3-CD39 were exposed for 2 h to either H2O2 or xanthine oxidase and xanthine. Cells were harvested, and cell lysates were used for analysis of their effect on platelet aggregation (Fig. 6A). A striking effect of oxidation was observed for the interaction of transfected cells with platelets. After incubation with the xanthine oxidase/xanthine combinations, pCDNA3-CD39 transfected cells almost completely lost their ability to inhibit platelet aggregation, whereas the prior incubations with H2O2 completely abolished the antiaggregatory effect of ATPDase expressed by the transfected COS-7 cells. These results were concordant with the observed loss of ATPDase biochemical activity following oxidative interaction (Fig. 6B) and the reduced immunoreactivity with anti-CD39 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 6C). Once we had determined identity between CD39 and the ATPDases, the subsequent analysis of available amino acid sequences of the ATPDases purified from different mammalian sources led us to the conclusion that there was only one shared sequence that was common to human placental and the porcine pancreatic ATPDase and also present within human CD39, viz. DLGGASTQ, contained within the N-terminal sequence of the porcine pancreatic ATPDase (Fig. 1). This sequence was also identified as the putative apyrase conserved region 4 by Handa and Guidotti (16Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, there are some modifications of this sequence for other ATPDases; therefore, this motif may also be presented as (D/E)(L/M/V)GG(A/G)S(T/A/V)Q. To determine tissue-specific CD39/ATPDase mRNA distribution, we analyzed RNA purified from various human tissues by hybridization with the CD39 cDNA (1714-base pair fragment). We found high levels of CD39 mRNA in human placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and heart but no detectable signal in brain and very little in liver (Fig. 7). We were able to detect as many as five different mobility mRNA transcripts reacting with the same probe, from two up to four of them in the individual tissues. To confirm that these bands were specific for CD39, we hybridized the same blot with 5′ and 3′ fragments of CD39 cDNA, 427 and 342 base pairs, respectively. The resulting patterns of hybridization were identical with that one with the full-length probe (data not shown). Our data demonstrate in a persuasive manner that CD39 encodes the vascular ATPDase. This conclusion was originally based on the discovery of sequence homologies between CD39 and human placental ATPDase and bovine aortic ATPDase (Fig. 1). Our hypothesis was further substantiated by other recognized sequence homologies that we noted in mammalian and avian nonvascular ecto-enzymes and the report that the potato soluble apyrase contains certain “apyrase conserved regions” also found in garden pea nucleoside triphosphatase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae golgi guanosine diphosphatase (GDPase), Toxoplasma gondii isoforms of an nucleoside triphosphatase, NTP1 and NTP3, a yeast hypothetical 71.9-kDa protein, a Caenorhabditis elegans 61.3-kDa protein, and human and murine CD39 (16Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The following observations also strengthen our conclusion. Both ATPDases and CD39 are known to be membrane glycoproteins with the same molecular weight range. Both proteins have a comparable cellular distribution, are postulated to be involved in cell adhesion, and may undergo up-regulation after viral transformation of certain cells (2Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 14Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.L. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K.

We were able to generate CD39 cDNA from human umbilical endothelial cells RNA by reverse transcription-PCR. This PCR product, which was of expected size, was then subjected to restriction mapping and sequencing, which confirmed that this product represented true CD39 cDNA (data not shown). The CD39 cDNA was then cloned into the pCDNA3 vector and expressed in COS-7 cells. Using cell membranes or whole-cell lysates, we established that CD39 protein expressed by these transiently transfected cells reacted with both monoclonal antibodies to CD39 and to polyclonal antibodies directed at ATPDase. By FACS analysis using mAb to CD39, we clearly demonstrated that ATPDase was expressed at the surface of COS-7 cells (Fig. 2). Both polyclonal antibody generated by us to the porcine ATPDase N-terminal peptide fragment and cross-reactive with the bovine vascular ATPDase and monoclonal antibody to CD39 detected the appropriate and same mobility band on Western blotting (Fig. 3). Our functional data show for the first time that the ATPDase activity associated with CD39 expressed by COS-7 cells can hydrolyze the substrate ADP. This specific ADPase enzyme activity can be induced over 100-fold by the COS-7 transfection with CD39. Likewise, we were able to show enzymatic activity of CD39 for the substrate ATP to be induced over 30-fold by COS-7 transfection (394 nmol/mg protein/min in representative experiments). We also have demonstrated that intact transfected COS-7 cells were able to hydrolyze radiolabeled ADP. This latter result obtained by TLC clearly indicated that the active site of ATPDase faces the extracellular milieu. Wang and Guidotti (17Wang T.-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) have also established that Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells express both CD39 and potentially Ca2+, Mg2+ apyrase activity. They were able to show by the DEAE-dextran method that COS-7 cells developed 5.4-fold increased ecto-ATPase activity following transfection with CD39 cDNA prepared from B cells, when compared to vector alone (17Wang T.-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Of potential significance was our observation that preparations of cell membranes from COS-7 cells transfected with pCDNA3-CD39 could inhibit platelet aggregation in response to ADP, collagen, and thrombin (Fig. 5). ADP release from platelet granules is a vital part of the feedback process that amplifies and propagates platelet activation induced by ADP itself or other more potent agonists (3Luthje J. J. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Hence, ADP may be an important mediator of vascular thrombosis in inflammatory states. It has been suggested that a major role for the ATPDase may be to inhibit ADP or ATP-induced signal transduction in platelets, leukocytes, and vascular endothelium mediated through the purinergic receptors P2t and P2y (2Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 23Welford L.A. Cusack N.J. Hourani S.M.O. Eur. J.

Acta. 1992; 1134: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of ATP and ADP by ATPDase would remove these purinergic mediators from the extracellular environment and ultimately favor the generation of adenosine (3Luthje J. J. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) with the associated anti-inflammatory sequelae related to the interaction with P1 receptors (2Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 4Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). CD39 has been shown to play a role in B-cell adhesion, in part related to cellular integrins (14Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.L. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III., R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244PubMed Google Scholar). It is further possible that the interaction of adenosine nucleotides with CD39 may also influence cell signaling and integrin affinity for their respective ligands. The identification of CD39 as the vascular ATPDase and the documentation of the significant role in modulating platelet reactivity in vitro will further help to test this hypothesis in several experimental models. Our observation that exposure of COS-7 CD39 transfectants to reactive oxygen intermediates results in loss of platelet antiaggregatory properties coupled to inhibition of biochemical ATPDase activity is in keeping with the oxidant-dependent loss of ATPDase function noted in association with EC activation in vitro and following vascular injury in vivo (8Robson S.C. Candinas D. Hancock W.W. Siegel J. Millan M. Bach F.H. Transplant Proc. 1996; 28: 536PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bach F.H. Robson S.C. Winkler H. Ferran C. Stuhlmeier K. Wrighton C. Hancock W.W. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).2 ATPDase activity has been shown to be lost in vivo with reperfusion injury and this process may be ameliorated by the administration of antioxidants (25Candinas D. Koyamada N. Miyatake T. Siegel J. Hancock W.W. Bach F.H. Robson S.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that this loss, and the resultant decreased capacity to degrade ADP, could play a significant role in the extensive platelet activation and vascular inflammation seen in graft rejection and other forms of vascular injury. Certainly, the intravenous administration of apyrases to experimental animals has been shown to prolong xenograft survival and abrogate the platelet activation and deposition seen in this setting (26Koyamada N. Miyatake T. Candinas D. Hechenleitner P. Siegel J.B. Hancock W.W. Bach F.H. Robson S.C. Transplantation. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Because of the variable sensitivity of organs to vascular injury and thrombosis, the tissue-specific distribution for CD39/ATPDase was studied. Northern analysis of RNA extracted from different tissues was, therefore, performed with a full-length CD39 probe (Fig. 7). Among the tissues examined, the strongest signals were observed in certain highly vascularized organs, i.e. placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Heart and liver had lower levels of mRNA transcripts. Two dominant CD39 mRNA transcripts are noted in most tissues akin to the pattern observed when mRNA preparations from cultures of human ECs are studied (data not shown). However, we were also able to detect as many as five different mRNA transcripts reacting with the entire CD39 cDNA probe (Fig. 7) and the 3′ and 5′ cDNA regions. These data suggest that these multiple RNA transcripts probably are alternative splicing variants. The pathophysiological significance of this observation is presently undetermined. Interestingly, there was no convincing evidence for the presence of CD39 transcripts in RNA isolated from human brain. This last observation suggests that the specialized vascular tissues of the brain may not express CD39 at levels comparable to the other organs tested and does not explain the data published previously showing the presence of ATPDase activity in nerve tissues and on the external surface of intact synaptosomes (27Trams E.G. Lauter C.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1978; 59: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Cummins J. Hyden H. Biochim. Biophys.

Possibly other E-type ATPases or ATPDases unrelated to CD39 are expressed in brain and hepatobiliary tissues, as would be suggested by the finding that ATPase activity may be demonstrated in immunoprecipitated neural cell adhesion molecule from rat brain (reviewed in Ref. 2Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and in cell-CAM105 from rat liver (30Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14403-14407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1995; 270: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and regions sensitive to oxidative reactions by sequential mutagenesis experiments will help elucidate the reason(s) for the potential posttranslational modification or other modulation of ATPDase activity with EC activation. This knowledge should permit us to express CD39/ATPDase in an active form despite EC activation, as we have done for thrombomodulin (32Wrighton C.J. Kopp C.W. McShea A. Vetr H. Bach F.H. Transplant. Proc. 1995; 27: 288-289PubMed Google Scholar), and to explore the consequences of this intervention in transplantation models associated with vascular inflammation (33Bach F.H. Winkler H. Ferran C.

https://openalex.org/W2102481823,"The amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) is the major constituent of neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease and occurs as a soluble 40-42-residue peptide in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of both normal and AD subjects. It is unclear whether Aβ, once it is secreted by cells, remains free in biological fluids or is associated with other proteins and thus transported and metabolized with them. Such knowledge of the normal fate of Aβ is a prerequisite for understanding the changes that may lead to the pathological aggregation of soluble Aβ <i>in vivo</i>, the possible influence of certain extracellular proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E, on plaque formation, and the pharmacology of putative Aβ-lowering drugs. To address the question of Aβ distribution in human biological fluids, we incubated fresh human plasma from 38 subjects with physiological concentrations (0.5-0.7 nM) of radioiodinated Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> and seven plasma samples with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. Lipoproteins and lipid-free proteins were separated and analyzed for bound iodinated Aβ<sub>1-40</sub>. We found that up to 5% of Aβ added to plasma is bound to selected lipoproteins: very low density, low density, and high density, but not lipoprotein(a). The large majority (≈89%), however, is bound to albumin, and very little Aβ is free. Aβ distribution in plasma was not significantly influenced by apolipoprotein E genotype. We conclude that Aβ is normally bound to and transported by albumin and specific lipoproteins in human plasma under physiological conditions."

An inherited deficiency of AC activity leads to the lysosomal storage disorder known as Farber disease (FD), also called Farber lipogranulomatosis (2Moser H.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2589-2599Google Scholar). Patients with FD accumulate ceramide in most tissues, leading to painful swelling of the joints and tendons, pulmonary insufficiency, and a shortened life-span. The clinical diagnosis of FD is usually confirmed by biochemical methods, including the determination of lysosomal ceramide accumulation and/or the deficiency of AC activity. To date, seven FD subtypes have been described with varying degrees of clinical involvement; notably, a direct correlation between the amount of ceramide accumulation and the clinical severity of FD patients has recently been demonstrated (3Levade T.

Moreover, sphingosine (the catabolic product of ceramide degradation) has been shown to inhibit protein kinase C activity and can exert a variety of effects on cell growth and differentiation (6Hannun Y.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AC activity may be the rate-limiting step in determining the intracellular levels of this compound.About 2 years ago, AC was purified to apparent homogeneity from human urine (11Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The final preparation contained a single polypeptide of ~50 kDa that could be resolved into two subunits (designated α (13 kDa) and β (40 kDa)) after treatment with sulfhydryl-reducing reagents. Treatment of the purified enzyme with N-glycanase F reduced the molecular mass of the β subunit to ~29 kDa, whereas the molecular mass of the α subunit remained unchanged. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the purified urinary enzyme, and the biosynthesis of AC was studied in human skin fibroblasts. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that both subunits arose from a single precursor of ~55 kDa by proteolytic processing.This manuscript reports the isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA encoding human AC and the identification of the first molecular lesion causing FD. The availability of this cDNA should facilitate further molecular genetic analysis of FD patients and stimulate additional studies defining the role of AC in ceramide metabolism, cell differentiation, and mammalian development.DISCUSSIONCeramide plays a critical role in normal cell function and disease pathogenesis. Thus, understanding the metabolism of this lipid is of critical importance to both basic biologists and physicians alike. Toward this end, we report the isolation and expression of a full-length cDNA encoding AC, the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of ceramide into free fatty acid and sphingosine. Authenticity of this cDNA was based on colinearity with 117 amino acid residues derived from purified AC, as well as transient expression studies in COS-1 cells. Moreover, a homoallelic point mutation was identified within the corresponding AC cDNA and genomic sequences from a patient with FD, which is the lysosomal storage disorder due to the deficiency of AC enzymatic activity.Initially, a putative full-length AC cDNA was obtained from a human skin fibroblast library. However, several features of this cDNA indicated that it may have been artifactual, including the facts that the first in-frame ATG was not followed by a signal peptide coding region, that there were no cysteine residues encoded within the 5′ region, which presumably contained the α-subunit sequences (11Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and that the molecular mass of the putative peptide encoded by this region did not agree with the known molecular mass (~13 kDa) of the authentic α-subunit. Analysis of a different AC cDNA isolated from a human pituitary library revealed that the 5′ end was different from that encoded by the fibroblast sequence; this cDNA had an extended 5′ open reading frame including three cysteine residues, an authentic signal coding region, and a 17-bp 5′-untranslated sequence. Except for these 95 nucleotides, the fibroblast and pituitary sequences were identical.Based on these findings, a hybrid AC cDNA was constructed that contained the 5′ pituitary sequence and the remaining fibroblast sequence. This full-length cDNA consisted of a 17-bp 5′-untranslated sequence, a 1185-bp open reading frame encoding 395 amino acids, a 1110-bp 3′-untranslated sequence containing three polyadenylation sites, and a 17-bp poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). The region from nucleotide 427 (i.e. the N-terminal codon of the β-subunit) to nucleotide 1185 encoded a peptide with a calculated mass of 29 kDa that contained six potential N-glycosylation sites and 5 cysteine residues. The upstream region encoded a putative α-subunit with a predicted molecular mass of 13 kDa containing three cysteine residues but no N-glycosylation sites.Previous studies using purified AC have shown that the human enzyme was a heterodimeric protein consisting of an unglycosylated α-subunit (~13 kDa) and an N-glycosylated β-subunit (~40 kDa) (10Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete deglycosylation resulted in the reduction of the molecular mass of the β-subunit by about 11 kDa, which corresponds to three or four N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Biosynthetic studies carried out in cultured skin fibroblasts indicated that both subunits arose from a single glycosylated precursor protein of about 55 kDa by proteolytic processing (11Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).After transfection of the full-length AC cDNA into COS-1 cells, metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation studies using monospecific anti-AC antibodies raised against the purified enzyme revealed a protein pattern identical to that of human fibroblasts. Denaturing SDS gel electrophoresis showed that in the transfected COS cells, a 55-kDa precursor protein was processed into the 40-kDa β- and 13-kDa α-subunits. Endoglycosidase F treatment resulted in a reduced molecular mass for the precursor and the β-subunit (from 55 to 40 kDa and from 40 to 29 kDa, respectively), whereas the size of the α-subunit remained unchanged. Furthermore, COS-1 cells transfected with the full-length AC cDNA had up to 10-fold higher activities over the endogenous level of non-transfected and mock-transfected cells. The maximum of AC activity peaked between pH 4 and pH 5 and was not detectable at neutral or alkaline pH values (data not shown). These studies provided additional proof that the protein encoded by the full-length cDNA was AC.Further evidence was provided by the analysis of the AC sequence obtained from a patient with FD. Three nucleotide changes (M72V, I92V, and T222K) were identified in this patient as compared to the wild type sequence. Analysis of 14 unrelated normal individuals demonstrated that M72V and I92V were normal polymorphisms, whereas T222K was only found in the FD patient. Furthermore, analysis of the consanguineous parents revealed that both were heterozygous for the T222K mutation.This manuscript reports the first isolation of a full-length cDNA encoding AC and the first identification of a mutation causing FD. The availability of this cDNA allows us to generate the respective animal model and should help us to define a possible role of AC in signal transduction, as well as the identification of various molecular lesions underlying the different clinical subtypes of FD.

An inherited deficiency of AC activity leads to the lysosomal storage disorder known as Farber disease (FD), also called Farber lipogranulomatosis (2Moser H.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S.

Patients with FD accumulate ceramide in most tissues, leading to painful swelling of the joints and tendons, pulmonary insufficiency, and a shortened life-span. The clinical diagnosis of FD is usually confirmed by biochemical methods, including the determination of lysosomal ceramide accumulation and/or the deficiency of AC activity. To date, seven FD subtypes have been described with varying degrees of clinical involvement; notably, a direct correlation between the amount of ceramide accumulation and the clinical severity of FD patients has recently been demonstrated (3Levade T.

In addition to its central role in disease pathogenesis, sphingolipid biosynthesis, and membrane formation, ceramide is an important cell-signaling molecule involved in a variety of diverse processes such as neurite growth, monocyte differentiation, and Fas (Apo1/CD95)-induced apoptosis (for reviews, see Refs. 4Hannun Y.A.

DISCUSSIONCeramide plays a critical role in normal cell function and disease pathogenesis. Thus, understanding the metabolism of this lipid is of critical importance to both basic biologists and physicians alike. Toward this end, we report the isolation and expression of a full-length cDNA encoding AC, the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of ceramide into free fatty acid and sphingosine. Authenticity of this cDNA was based on colinearity with 117 amino acid residues derived from purified AC, as well as transient expression studies in COS-1 cells. Moreover, a homoallelic point mutation was identified within the corresponding AC cDNA and genomic sequences from a patient with FD, which is the lysosomal storage disorder due to the deficiency of AC enzymatic activity.Initially, a putative full-length AC cDNA was obtained from a human skin fibroblast library. However, several features of this cDNA indicated that it may have been artifactual, including the facts that the first in-frame ATG was not followed by a signal peptide coding region, that there were no cysteine residues encoded within the 5′ region, which presumably contained the α-subunit sequences (11Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and that the molecular mass of the putative peptide encoded by this region did not agree with the known molecular mass (~13 kDa) of the authentic α-subunit. Analysis of a different AC cDNA isolated from a human pituitary library revealed that the 5′ end was different from that encoded by the fibroblast sequence; this cDNA had an extended 5′ open reading frame including three cysteine residues, an authentic signal coding region, and a 17-bp 5′-untranslated sequence. Except for these 95 nucleotides, the fibroblast and pituitary sequences were identical.Based on these findings, a hybrid AC cDNA was constructed that contained the 5′ pituitary sequence and the remaining fibroblast sequence. This full-length cDNA consisted of a 17-bp 5′-untranslated sequence, a 1185-bp open reading frame encoding 395 amino acids, a 1110-bp 3′-untranslated sequence containing three polyadenylation sites, and a 17-bp poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). The region from nucleotide 427 (i.e. the N-terminal codon of the β-subunit) to nucleotide 1185 encoded a peptide with a calculated mass of 29 kDa that contained six potential N-glycosylation sites and 5 cysteine residues. The upstream region encoded a putative α-subunit with a predicted molecular mass of 13 kDa containing three cysteine residues but no N-glycosylation sites.Previous studies using purified AC have shown that the human enzyme was a heterodimeric protein consisting of an unglycosylated α-subunit (~13 kDa) and an N-glycosylated β-subunit (~40 kDa) (10Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete deglycosylation resulted in the reduction of the molecular mass of the β-subunit by about 11 kDa, which corresponds to three or four N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Biosynthetic studies carried out in cultured skin fibroblasts indicated that both subunits arose from a single glycosylated precursor protein of about 55 kDa by proteolytic processing (11Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).After transfection of the full-length AC cDNA into COS-1 cells, metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation studies using monospecific anti-AC antibodies raised against the purified enzyme revealed a protein pattern identical to that of human fibroblasts. Denaturing SDS gel electrophoresis showed that in the transfected COS cells, a 55-kDa precursor protein was processed into the 40-kDa β- and 13-kDa α-subunits. Endoglycosidase F treatment resulted in a reduced molecular mass for the precursor and the β-subunit (from 55 to 40 kDa and from 40 to 29 kDa, respectively), whereas the size of the α-subunit remained unchanged. Furthermore, COS-1 cells transfected with the full-length AC cDNA had up to 10-fold higher activities over the endogenous level of non-transfected and mock-transfected cells. The maximum of AC activity peaked between pH 4 and pH 5 and was not detectable at neutral or alkaline pH values (data not shown). These studies provided additional proof that the protein encoded by the full-length cDNA was AC.Further evidence was provided by the analysis of the AC sequence obtained from a patient with FD. Three nucleotide changes (M72V, I92V, and T222K) were identified in this patient as compared to the wild type sequence. Analysis of 14 unrelated normal individuals demonstrated that M72V and I92V were normal polymorphisms, whereas T222K was only found in the FD patient. Furthermore, analysis of the consanguineous parents revealed that both were heterozygous for the T222K mutation.This manuscript reports the first isolation of a full-length cDNA encoding AC and the first identification of a mutation causing FD. The availability of this cDNA allows us to generate the respective animal model and should help us to define a possible role of AC in signal transduction, as well as the identification of various molecular lesions underlying the different clinical subtypes of FD.

Two distinct PIP5Ks have been characterized in erythrocytes, the 68-kDa type I (PIP5KI) and 53-kDa type II (PIP5KII) isoforms. Using peptide sequences from the erythroid 68-kDa PIP5KI, we have isolated cDNAs encoding PIP5KIα from human brain. Partial cDNAs obtained for a second isoform, PIP5KIβ, established that the human STM7 gene encoded a previously unrecognized PIP5KI. However, the peptide sequences demonstrated that erythroid PIP5KI corresponded to PIP5KIα. Recombinant, bacterially expressed PIP5KIα possessed PIP5K activity and was immunoreactive with erythroid PIP5KI antibodies. By Northern analysis, PIP5KIα and PIP5KIβ had wide tissue distributions, but their expression levels differed greatly. PIP5KIs had homology to the kinase domains of PIP5KIIα, yeast Mss4p and Fab1p, and a new Caenorhabditis elegans Fab1-like protein identified in the data base. These new isoforms have refined the sequence requirements for PIP5K activity and, potentially, regulation of these enzymes.

This conversion is pivotal to the phosphoinositide cycle as PtdIns(4,5)P2 is hydrolyzed by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C to generate the second messengers 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These second messengers activate several protein kinase C isoforms and effect the release of stored intracellular calcium, respectively. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is also phosphorylated by agonist-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, resulting in synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a second messenger whose targets are largely unknown, but may include protein kinase C isoforms (1Palmer R.H.

The diversity of PtdIns(4,5)P2 actions suggests that PIP5Ks are crucial enzymes for many cellular functions (reviewed in Ref. 9Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Anderson R.A. Adv.

The best characterized isoforms are the erythroid enzymes which have been categorized as type I or type II PIP5Ks based on their separation by phosphocellulose ion exchange (10Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R.

These PIP5Ks differ in molecular mass and are biochemically and immunologically distinct. Two notable differences are that PIP5KI, but not PIP5KII, can be stimulated by phosphatidic acid and can use PtdIns4P present in membranes as a substrate (10Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L.

PIP5KI and PIP5KII also seem to be functionally distinct.PIP5KI, but not PIP5KII, isoforms have been implicated in the secretion of neurotransmitters and small G-protein regulation. Neurotransmitter release from permeabilized PC12 cells has been divided into an initial Mg-ATP-dependent step, followed by a Ca2+-triggered exocytotic event (8Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H.

PIP5KI isoforms, and the production of PtdIns(4,5)P2, are required for the priming step, while PIP5KII is ineffective (8Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). PIP5KI isoforms also appear to associate with, and are putatively stimulated by, the small G-proteins Rac and Rho (16Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M.

The direct action of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PIP5Ks in these diverse processes argues that the kinases are tightly regulated components of these signaling pathways and not merely passive replenishers of phosphoinositide pools.The recent isolation of a cDNA encoding a human type II phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5KIIα) established a novel lipid kinase family with two yeast homologues, Mss4p and Fab1p (25Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We have now expanded this family by isolating the first type I PIP5K cDNAs and identifying a Fab1p homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans. The cDNAs and sequences of these crucial enzymes will permit studies into the unique biochemical properties of the PIP5KI subfamily and how they integrate into signaling pathways, cytoskeletal control, and secretion.

This conversion is pivotal to the phosphoinositide cycle as PtdIns(4,5)P2 is hydrolyzed by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C to generate the second messengers 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These second messengers activate several protein kinase C isoforms and effect the release of stored intracellular calcium, respectively. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is also phosphorylated by agonist-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, resulting in synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a second messenger whose targets are largely unknown, but may include protein kinase C isoforms (1Palmer R.H.

Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The diversity of PtdIns(4,5)P2 actions suggests that PIP5Ks are crucial enzymes for many cellular functions (reviewed in Ref. 9Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Anderson R.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 115-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Multiple PIP5K isoforms have been purified and biochemically characterized (9Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7207-7210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized isoforms are the erythroid enzymes which have been categorized as type I or type II PIP5Ks based on their separation by phosphocellulose ion exchange (10Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18012-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

These PIP5Ks differ in molecular mass and are biochemically and immunologically distinct. Two notable differences are that PIP5KI, but not PIP5KII, can be stimulated by phosphatidic acid and can use PtdIns4P present in membranes as a substrate (10Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18012-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7207-7210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIP5KI and PIP5KII also seem to be functionally distinct.PIP5KI, but not PIP5KII, isoforms have been implicated in the secretion of neurotransmitters and small G-protein regulation. Neurotransmitter release from permeabilized PC12 cells has been divided into an initial Mg-ATP-dependent step, followed by a Ca2+-triggered exocytotic event (8Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H.

PIP5KI isoforms, and the production of PtdIns(4,5)P2, are required for the priming step, while PIP5KII is ineffective (8Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). PIP5KI isoforms also appear to associate with, and are putatively stimulated by, the small G-proteins Rac and Rho (16Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 17Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol.

Besides being important regulators of cytoskeletal assembly, Rac and Rho have been linked to secretion and certain growth factor receptor signaling cascades, all processes known to involve PIP5Ks and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (19Hartwig J.H.

In an attempt to elucidate the potential mechanism for the nuclear transport of BRCA1 protein, three regions of highly charged, basic residues, 503KRKRRP508, 606PKKNRLRRKS615, and 651KKKKYN656, were identified as potential nuclear localization signals (NLSs). These three regions were subsequently mutated to 503KLP508, 607KLS615, and 651KLN656, respectively. Wild-type and mutated proteins were tagged with the flag epitope, expressed in human DU145 cells, and detected with the M2 monoclonal antibody. In DU145 cells, the KLP mutant completely fails to localize in nuclei, whereas the KLS mutant is mostly cytoplasmic with occasional nuclear localization. The KLN protein is always located in nuclei. Consistently, hSRP1α (importin-α), a component of the NLS receptor complex, was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using BRCA1 as the bait. The specificity of the interaction between BRCA1 and importin-α was further demonstrated by showing that the 503KRKRRP508 and 606PKKNRLRRKS615 regions, but not 651KKKKYN656, are critical for this interaction. To determine if the cytoplasmic mislocation of endogenous BRCA1 in breast cancer cells is due to a deficiency of the cells, wild-type BRCA1 protein tagged with the flag epitope was ectopically expressed in six breast cancer cell lines. The analysis demonstrated that, in all six, this protein localized in the cytoplasm of these cells. In contrast, expression of the construct in four non-breast cancer cell lines resulted in nuclear localization. These data support the possibility that the mislocation of the BRCA1 protein in breast cancer cells may be due to a defect in the cellular machinery involved in the NLS receptor-mediated pathway of nuclear import.

These data support the possibility that the mislocation of the BRCA1 protein in breast cancer cells may be due to a defect in the cellular machinery involved in the NLS receptor-mediated pathway of nuclear import. BRCA1, located on chromosome 17q21, was cloned and shown to be responsible for about 50% of familial breast and ovarian cancers (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5303) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by this gene contains a zinc finger motif and an acidic block of residues (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5303) Google Scholar). These features suggest that BRCA1 may function as a transcription factor, although there is no experimental evidence so far to support this supposition. Similarly, the precise biological function of BRCA1 protein remains unclear. There are several lines of circumstantial evidence, however, suggesting that BRCA1 may have a role in cellular growth and differentiation. First, BRCA1 mRNA is highly expressed in tissues where cells are rapidly proliferating and differentiating (2Lane T.F. Deng C. Elson A. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Leder P. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2712-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3Marquis S.T. Rajan J.V. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xu J. Yin G.Y. Abel K.J. Weber B.L. Chodosh L.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Second, homozygous deletion of the BRCA1 gene in mice causes lethality in early embryogenesis due to the retardation of cell growth and malformation of the embryo (4Gowan L.C. Johnson B.L. Sulik K.K. Koller B.H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 5Liu C.-Y. Fleskon-Nikitin A. Li S. Zeng Y.Y. Lee W.-H.

Roberts J. Rossant J. Mak T.W. Cell. 1996; 85: 1009-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Third, the expression of both BRCA1 mRNA and protein is increased following cell cycle progression. Moreover, phosphorylation of the BRCA1 protein by cyclin-dependent kinases is also positively regulated during the cell cycle (7Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar). As a tumor suppressor gene, it is unusual that mutations in BRCA1 are clearly linked to inherited breast and ovarian cancers but are rarely found in sporadic tumors (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5303) Google Scholar, 8Futreal P.A. Liu Q.

Trowsdale J. Nicolai H. Solomon E. Foulkes W. Stamp G. Signer E. Jeffreys A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 343-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This result has raised questions concerning the authenticity of the BRCA1 gene as a breast tumor suppressor (10Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins can be independent of their genetic mutations. For example, wild-type p53 protein has also been found mislocated in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, while mutant p53 remains in the nucleus (11Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These studies suggested the existence of multiple pathways for the inactivation of p53 function in breast cancer cells. It is therefore possible that BRCA1 may be functionally inactivated by its mislocation from the nuclear to cytoplasmic compartment in sporadic breast cancer cells. Nuclear transport is a complicated process involving multiple factors. Since it is a large molecule, it is likely that the BRCA1 protein is actively translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by the NLS 1The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization signal. receptor-mediated transport system (reviewed in Refs. 12Hicks G.R.

Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). After translocation, importin-β dissociates from the complex in the vicinity of the inner aspect of the nuclear envelope while importin-α accompanies the substrate to its sites of function (21Görlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Any defect in this transportation system could lead to a failure in the translocation of BRCA1 to the nucleus. However, it is very unlikely that the cells could survive a major deficit in nuclear transport. nuclear localization signal. In contradiction to the findings of ourselves (22Chen Y. Chen C.F.

Science. 1996; 272: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it has been reported that BRCA1 is a secreted protein (25Jensen R.A. Thompson M.E. Jetton T.L. Szabo C.I. Van der Meer R.

Since the subcellular location of proteins is a fundamental aspect of their function, it is important to solidify the data regarding the location of BRCA1 in normal and cancer cells. In an attempt to address these questions, we initiated experiments to investigate the nuclear transport of the BRCA1 protein by ascertaining the identity of its functional NLS motifs, by identifying proteins with which it interacts, and by extending the investigation of its subcellular distribution in breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that there are two functional nuclear localization sequences in the BRCA1 protein that interact with hSRP1α (importin-α or karyopherin-α (18Görlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A.

Furthermore, ectopically expressed wild-type BRCA1 protein is located in nuclei of normal and non-breast tumor cell lines but is detected in the cytoplasm of all breast cancer cell lines tested. Human cell lines DU145 (prostate cancer), T24 (bladder cancer), T47D, ZR75, MB231, MB468, MDA330, MCF7 (breast cancer), HBL100 (normal breast epithelial cells immortalized with SV40), and CV1 (monkey kidney cell line) were grown at 37°C in a humidified 10% CO2-containing atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc.) on plastic surfaces. Each 10-cm dish of cells grown to 60% confluency was transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate method (28Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.1Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate precipitate was left in the culture medium for 6-8 h. At that time the medium was drained, and the cells were refed with fresh medium. To introduce mutations into the three putative nuclear localization sequences of BRCA1, a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was used. Briefly, the following external and internal primers with HindIII restriction sites (underlined below) were used to create in-frame deletions of each NLS sequence, replacing the deletion with a single leucine residue. The external primers used for all of the NLS mutations were 5′-GATTTGAACACCACTGAGAAGCGTGCA (733-759 of BRCA1 cDNA) and 5′-CTTTAAGGACCCAGAGTGGGCAGAGAA (2679-2653). For the KLP mutation, the following internal primers were used: 1A, 5′-CCTTTTAAGCTTTAATTTATTTGTGAGGGGACGCTC (1506-1483), and 1B, 5′-CCTTAAAGCTTCCTACATCAGGCCTTCATCCTGA (1522-1544). For the KLS mutation the following internal primers were used: 2A, 5′-CCTCCCAAGCTTAGGTGCTTTTGAATTGTGGATATTT (1818-1794), and 2B, 5′-CCTCCCAAGCTTTCTTCTACCAGGCATATTCATGCGC (1843-1867). The KLN mutation was generated with the following internal primers: 3A, 5′-CCTCCCAAGCTTTATCTCTTCACTGCTAGAACAACT (1950-1927), and 3B, 5′-CCTCCCAAGCTTAACCAAATGCCAGTCAGGCACAGC (1966-1989). Plasmid BSK-BRCA1a, which contains a full-length BRCA1 cDNA (7Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the template for polymerase chain reaction using each pair of internal and external primers. The resulting DNA fragments were gel-purified and cut with AflII and HindIII for the N-terminal cDNA fragments and with KpnI and HindIII for the C-terminal cDNA fragments. The AflII and KpnI restriction sites are within the BRCA1 DNA sequence downstream and upstream of each 5′ and 3′ external primer, respectively. The N- and C-terminal fragments were then used to replace the AflII/KpnI fragment in pBSK-BRCA1a. Ligation of the HindIII site at each of the NLS sites generated in-frame deletions, with the addition of a CTT codon for leucine. The AflII/KpnI fragments from pBSK-BRCA1-KLP, KLS, and KLN were then used to replace a similar fragment in the expression vector pCEP-flag-BRCA1 (23Chen Y. Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Lee W.H. Allred D.C. Osborne C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 125-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pCEP-flag-BRCA1KLP, pCEP-flag-BRCA1KLS, and pCEP-flag-BRCA1KLN. Cells were transfected with pCEP-flag-BRCA1KLP, pCEP-flag-BRCA1KLS, or pCEP-flag-BRCA1KLN for expression of the flag-tagged NLS mutated proteins and pCEP-flag-BRCA1 for flag-tagged wild-type BRCA1. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were fixed and indirectly immunostained with the anti-flag M2 mAb (Eastman Kodak Co.) using previously described procedures (29Mancini M.A. Shan B. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The microscopic images were acquired using a Hammamatsu Color Chilled 3CCD camera attached to a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. The image files were digitally processed for presentation using Adobe Photoshop. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were lysed with lysis 250 buffer (7Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar) and denatured by boiling in sample buffer for 5 min. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, flag-tagged BRCA1 protein was detected in Western blots using the anti-flag M2 mAb, and endogenous BRCA1 was detected with the monoclonal antibody 6B4 (23Chen Y. Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Lee W.H. Allred D.C. Osborne C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 125-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of an activation domain in BRCA1 was done by a yeast one-hybrid assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y153, which contains a lacZ reporter under the control of a promoter with GAL4-binding sites in the upstream activating sequence of GAL1 (UASG) (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The BRCA1 deletion constructs in Fig. 2 were obtained by translationally fusing the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (31Keegan L. Gill G. Ptashne M. Science. 1986; 231: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 32Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) in pAS (30Durfee T.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar) using convenient restriction sites. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by colony color and quantitated using chlorophenyl red-β-D-galactopyranoside in assays as described previously (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). A cDNA library prepared from human B lymphocytes was screened as described previously (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The protein from pAS-BRCA3.5 (see Fig. 2) served as the “bait,” which consisted of amino acids 1-1142 of BRCA1 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (31Keegan L. Gill G. Ptashne M. Science. 1986; 231: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 32Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) in plasmid pAS (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Yeast strain Y153 was co-transfected with pAS-BRCA3.5, pAS-KLP, pAS-KLS, or pAS-KLN and pACT-importin220-529 (see Fig. 3A) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). For importin-α expression, a cDNA encoding amino acids 220-529 was fused to the activation domain of GAL4 (31Keegan L. Gill G. Ptashne M. Science. 1986; 231: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 32Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) in pACT (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). pAS-KLP, pAS-KLS, and pAS-KLN were constructed by fusing BRCA11-1142 cDNAs from pBSK-BRCA1-KLP, KLS, and KLN to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 in pAS (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). β-galactosidase activity was assayed as described above. To initiate the study of BRCA1 nuclear transport, we began with the identification of its NLS motif(s). By analysis of the amino acid sequence, three possible nuclear localization sequences with highly charged, basic residues were found in BRCA1, 503KRKRRP508, 606PKKNRLRRKS615, and 651KKKKYN656 (Fig. 1A). To determine if these sequences are functional in nuclear localization, polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”) was performed that generated in-frame deletions and replacement with a single leucine residue at each of the sites (Fig. 1A). The wild-type and mutated BRCA1 proteins were tagged by fusion with the flag epitope in a pCEP-based plasmid. The expression of these tagged proteins in human DU145 cells was done by transient transfection, and the proteins were detected by immunoblotting with either anti-BRCA1 mAb 6B4 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-5) or anti-flag M2 mAb (Fig. 1B, lanes 6-10). As shown in Fig. 1B, anti-flag M2 mAb detected only ectopically expressed flag-tagged BRCA1, which co-migrates with endogenous BRCA1 as a 220-kDa protein (lanes 1-5) in each population of transfected cells (lanes 7-10) but not in untransfected cells (lane 6). This result indicated that all of the plasmid constructs transfected into DU145 cells were capable of expressing flag-tagged BRCA1 proteins, which were either wild type or mutated. The subcellular localization of wild-type and each of the mutated proteins was determined by immunostaining with the anti-flag M2 mAb. Consistent with its previous localization (22Chen Y. Chen C.F. Riley D.J. Allred D.C. Chen P.L. Von Hoff D. Osborne C.K. Lee W.H. Science. 1995; 270: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), wild-type flag-tagged BRCA1 protein is located in the nucleus (Fig. 1C, a and b). The 651KLN656 mutant (Fig. 1C, g and h) is also nuclear, indicating that the residues 651KKKKYN656 are not important for nuclear transport of the flag-BRCA1KLN protein. In contrast, the 503KLP508 and 607KLS615 mutations both resulted in cytoplasmic localization of flag-BRCA1KLP and flag-BRCA1KLS proteins (Fig. 1C, c and d, and e and f, respectively), indicating that both of these stretches of basic residues are critical for nuclear import. It was noted that flag-BRCA1KLS, when overexpressed, can, in some instances, localize in the nucleus. This is illustrated in Fig. 1C, e and f, where two highly expressing cells are adjacent to each other, and one shows cytoplasmic staining and the other nuclear (arrowheads). However, flag-tagged BRCA1KLP was never observed in the nucleus. Nuclear transport of BRCA1 clearly requires interactions with other cellular proteins. We elected to use the yeast two-hybrid method to identify and clone genes encoding BRCA1-interacting proteins. Since BRCA1 has been proposed to be a transcription factor (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5303) Google Scholar), it may therefore have transactivation activity. The presence of such activity would confound a two-hybrid assay. To functionally identify potential transactivation domains in BRCA1, various domains of BRCA1 protein were fused in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (Fig. 2) in plasmid pAS (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). If these fusion proteins contain an activation domain, they will activate the GAL4 UASG-responsive β-galactosidase reporter (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) after transfection into the Y153 strain. Through this analysis we defined a strong activation domain located between amino acids 1142 and 1646 (Fig. 2). This activation domain was deleted in BRCA3.5 (Fig. 2), which only contains amino acids 1-1142 of BRCA1. BRCA3.5 was then fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of pAS vector as the bait for screening BRCA1-interacting proteins as described previously (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Four different clones were isolated and sequenced. When compared with GenBank™, we found that one is novel, one has homology to an uncharacterized zinc finger domain-containing protein, and two bear sequence homology to previously cloned cDNAs (Table I). Interestingly, the sequence of hBRAP21 is identical to that of the nuclear localization signal receptor hSRP1α (26Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), also known as importin-α (18Görlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) or karyopherin-α (27Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar).Table I.Summary of clones encoding BRCA1-interacting proteinsCloneInsert sizeaInsert size is given in kilobase pairs.β-Galactosidase activitySimilarity with known sequenceshBRAP20.8++++With sequence conserved in S. cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis eleganshBRAP121.2+++Part of an uncharacterized zinc finger domain-containing proteinhBRAP141.1++Novel sequencehBRAP210.9++Identical to the nuclear localization signal receptor (hSRP1α/importin-α)a Insert size is given in kilobase pairs. Open table in a new tab To investigate the potential interaction of BRCA1 with importin-α and to further confirm the functional NLS of BRCA1, we tested the specificity of the interaction of BRCA1 and importin-α using the yeast two-hybrid method. To do this, either wild-type BRCA3.5 from amino acid 1 to 1142 or the same region containing the mutated NLS sequences (KLP, KLS and KLN; see Fig. 1A) was translationally fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 in the pAS expression vector (Fig. 3A). In addition, the region of importin-α from amino acid 220 to 529, which is known to interact with BRCA3.5, was fused to the activation domain of GAL4 in pACT (Fig. 3A) (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The various BRCA1 proteins were co-expressed with the importin-α in the Y153 cells. A strong interaction between importin-α with BRCA3.5 or the KLN mutant was observed by the generation of blue colonies and an increase in β-galactosidase activity about 100-fold over that of the negative control, untransfected Y153 cells (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the observation that flag-BRCA1KLN is localized in nuclei (Fig. 1C, g and h). However, the KLP mutant failed to interact with importin-α and resulted in white colonies and no increase of β-galactosidase activity over background (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, a 10-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity over background was observed with the KLS mutant (Fig. 3B). As noted earlier, this increase in activity is consistent with the immunostaining data for the BRCA1 protein containing this mutation, which showed occasional nuclear localization when overexpressed (Fig. 1C, panels e and f). Previously, we transfected an expression plasmid containing flag-tagged BRCA1 into two breast cancer cell lines, T47D and MB468, and one immortalized non-breast epithelial cell line, HBL100. The flag-tagged BRCA1 protein was found in the cytoplasm of the T47D and MB468 cells and the nucleus of HBL100 cells by immunostaining with anti-flag M2 monoclonal antibody. To confirm this observation and to verify the expression of full-length flag-tagged BRCA1 protein, we repeated this experiment using four non-breast cancer and six breast cancer cell lines listed in Table II. As shown in Fig. 4 (summarized in Table II), nuclear localization of flag-BRCA1 is observed in normal monkey kidney cells CV1 (Fig. 4, a and b) and in DU145, T24, and HBL100 cells (Table II). In contrast, cytoplasmic localization of this protein is seen in ZR75 and MB231 (Fig. 4, c and d, and e and f, respectively) and in MB468, MDA330, and MCF7 breast tumor cells (Table II). These data suggest an altered transport or retention system for the BRCA1 protein in breast cancer cells.Table II.Summary of flag-BRCA1 staining resultsCell lineLocalizationAnti-BRCA1aChen et al.

Open table in a new tab BRCA1 is a nuclear protein. The identification of two regions of charged, basic amino acids between 503 and 508 and between 606 and 615 that are both crucial for efficient nuclear transport of the BRCA1 protein further supports this notion. The distance between these two motifs is much greater than the 10 amino acids separating the bipartite sites of nucleoplasmin (33Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). The structure and function of the NLSs in BRCA1 is similar to other nuclear proteins in which two NLSs are more widely spaced such as those in the polyoma large T antigen (34Richardson W.D. Roberts B.L. Smith A.E. Cell. 1986; 44: 77-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), influenza A virus NS1 protein (35Greenspan D. Palese P. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3020-3026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and adenovirus DNA-binding protein (36Morin N. Delsert C. Klessig D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While we cannot rule out the possibility that other sequences are also required for translocation of BRCA1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, the NLS at 503-508 is essential for this process. This observation was supported by results showing that mutation of the NLS at 503-508 in BRCA1 completely abolished its interactions with importin-α. The NLS at 606-615 in BRCA1 is less critical, because mutation of this NLS did not completely diminish the nuclear import of BRCA1. Our results indicating that BRCA1 is a nuclear protein with a functional NLS are at odds with the report indicating that the protein is membrane-bound, and secreted (25Jensen R.A. Thompson M.E. Jetton T.L. Szabo C.I. Van der Meer R. Helou B. Tronick S.R. Page D.L. King M.C. Holt J.T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Such a discrepancy is puzzling but may be explained by cross-reactivity of the peptide antisera to the epidermal growth factor receptor (37Wilson C.A. Payton M.N. Pekar S.K. Zhang K. Pacifici R.E. Gudas K.L. Thukral S. Calzone F.J. Reese D.M. Slamon D.I. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using mouse polyclonal antibodies specific for the BRCA1 protein, we have consistently found BRCA1 to be a 220-kDa nuclear protein that is aberrantly located in the cytoplasm of advanced breast cancer cells (22Chen Y. Chen C.F. Riley D.J. Allred D.C. Chen P.L. Von Hoff D. Osborne C.K. Lee W.H. Science. 1995; 270: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 23Chen Y. Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Lee W.H. Allred D.C. Osborne C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 125-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Scully et al. (24Scully R. Ganesan S. Brown M. De Caprio J.A. Cannistra S.A. Feunteun J. Schnitt S. Livingston D.M. Science. 1996; 272: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported that the 220-kDa BRCA1 protein remains in the nucleus of some breast cancer cell lines. Although the precise reason for this discrepancy is unclear, one cannot exclude the possibility of less specific antibodies, potential immunostaining artifacts, or both. By ectopically expressing epitope-tagged BRCA1 protein and using the specific anti-flag M2 monoclonal antibody, we have circumvented the difficulties in obtaining highly specific antibodies against BRCA1. Through this completely different approach, wild-type flag-tagged BRCA1 expressed in breast cancer cells remains in the cytoplasm. This result further suggests that its mislocation in breast cancer cells is not due to mutations of BRCA1 itself. Rather, the aberrant localization seems to be the result of alterations in the cells, perhaps at the level of nuclear transport of BRCA1. In this regard, the demonstration here that BRCA1 interacts with the importin-α subunit of the nuclear transport receptor complex could be an important clue. However, if there is a problem with the importin-α subunit or the importin-substrate complex, why is it manifested in breast epithelial cells? Does this indicate an unsuspected specificity of importin-α for BRCA1? And, does the defect in the function of BRCA1 reside in the cytoplasm or the nucleus? Once translocation across the nuclear pore complex occurs, importin-α is reported to accompany the transport substrate to its areas of nuclear function (21Görlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). If there is a problem with BRCA1 dissociating from importin-α in the nucleus, perhaps BRCA1 protein is immediately exported from the nucleus, resulting in the appearance of cytoplasmic localization. Co-localization experiments similar to those in Görlich et al. (21Görlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) using normal and breast cancer cells might address this possibility. An alternative possibility is that, in breast cancer cells, there is a problem in the regulation of the nuclear transport of BRCA1. The known mechanisms for regulating nuclear translocation (reviewed in Refs. 12Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar and 13Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar) are as follows: (a) phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, e.g. c-rel and v-jun and cell cycle-regulated proteins such as cyclin B-Cdk complex and pendulin; (b) cytoplasmic retention by masking of the NLSs as seen in dorsal, NF-κB, the glucocorticoid receptor, and the periodicity protein; or (c) more general regulation at the level of the nuclear pore complex. Perturbations in the gene products in any of these regulatory systems could potentially result in cytoplasmic localization of BRCA1 in breast epithelial cells. The possibility that some of the other BRCA1-interacting proteins identified in the two-hybrid screen could have this kind of role in breast cancer cells is being investigated. Whatever the pathogenic alteration in breast cancer cells is, it is not, at this time, obvious whether the mislocation of BRCA1 is the cause of or the result of the tumor phenotype. Interestingly, there are other reports of mislocation to the cytoplasm of a nuclear tumor suppressor protein in breast and other types of cancer cells. Of 27 breast cancer cases examined, 37% demonstrated cytoplasmic staining for p53, which by sequencing was revealed to be wild type (11Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In another study, wild-type p53 was found located in the cytoplasm of human cervical carcinoma cell lines with integrated human papillomavirus-18 or −16 (38Liang X.H. Volkmann M. Klein R. Herman B. Lockett S.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2645-2652PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these studies suggest that the tumor suppressor function of normal p53 can, in some cases, be inactivated by cytoplasmic mislocation (11Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 38Liang X.H. Volkmann M. Klein R. Herman B. Lockett S.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2645-2652PubMed Google Scholar). These data are similar to our observations for BRCA1 and seem to suggest a global alteration of subcellular compartmentation in breast cancer cells. If this is the case, then BRCA1 and p53 along with, perhaps, other nuclear regulatory proteins may be retained in the cytoplasm of these cells, the composite effect of which may contribute to their tumorigenesis."

Found as the major noncollagenous proteins of the mineralized dentin matrix, the PPs have been considered to be the archetype of macromolecules that might regulate biomineralization processes (2Heuer A.H.

Tissue Res. 1994; 30: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To understand how the PPs might carry out these diverse functions, it is crucial to know their amino acid sequences and structures. The PP from various species contain from 35 to 45 residue % aspartic acid and 40 to 55 residue % serine, of which as many as 90% of the Ser residues are phosphorylated (8Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Veis A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4326-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Rahima M. Veis A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1988; 42: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The difficulties of Edman sequencing of phosphoserine-rich proteins have limited the information attainable by conventional sequencing efforts (10Butler W.T. Bhown M. Dimuzio M.T. Cothran W.C.

Recently, chemical sequencing using means to derivatize the phosphoserines has provided a longer NH2-terminal sequence (13Crossley M.A. Huq N.L. Kirszbaum L. Reynolds E.C. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 154Google Scholar). Sequencing via cloning of a PP cDNA has also been difficult. A putative PP cDNA was described (14MacDougall M. Slavkin H.C. Zeichner-David M. Biochem J. 1992; 287: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) several years ago, but no sequence data have been reported. Nucleotide probes have generally been unsuccessful because of the high redundancy of the Ser codons (15George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody screening of cDNA libraries was not fruitful because of the difficulties of producing high titer PP antibodies (16Rahima M. Tsay T.-G. Andujar M. Veis A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Rabie A.M. Veis A. Connect.

We have recently taken a new approach to the production of an antibody to a highly purified, dephosphorylated phosphophoryn (dPP) and, as described below, have been successful in using that antibody to identify several cDNAs in our established rat incisor odontoblast cDNA library (15George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ritchie H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of the clones obtained thus far yielded the expected Asp-Ser-rich composition but, more importantly, revealed both an unexpected, unique “triplet cassette” repeat motif as well as a “doublet” repeat motif. These might account for several of the biomineralization regulatory functions of the phosphophoryns. We report here the nature of these unique sequence blocks. Furthermore, the identification of a PP cDNA clone has allowed the chromosomal localization of the corresponding PP gene. As shown below, the PP gene is colocalized with the gene for a mineralization disorder, dentinogenesis imperfecta, type II, correcting an erroneous assignment (14MacDougall M. Slavkin H.C. Zeichner-David M. Biochem J. 1992; 287: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PP was extracted from rat incisors by the procedure of Rahima and Veis (9Rahima M. Veis A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1988; 42: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The high Mr PP components were isolated by CaCl2 precipitation from the crude extract, followed by chromatography on a Bio-Gel DEAE 5-PW preparative column. Analytical gel electrophoresis showed the presence of three bands, with molecular mass 95, 90, and 85 kDa. Preparative gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution was used for isolation of the 95-kDa protein band. The PP95kDa was dephosphorylated with potato acid phosphatase (19Bessey O.A. Lowry O.H. Brock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 321-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dephosphorylated PP95K (dPP95kDa), isolated by a second round of electrophoresis followed by electroelution, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) using carbodiimide. The KLH-dPP95K conjugate was then injected into a goat. Booster injections followed at 16 and 25 days, and the immune serum was collected at day 42. The antibody was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and then passed over an affinity column of dPP95kDa coupled to Sepharose 4B. The purified antibody was eluted. Our λgt11 rat odontoblast expression library (15George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified on LB/agar plates and screened using standard procedures. The translation product is expressed as a β-gal-cDNA fusion protein when the lacZ gene is induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The fusion proteins were adsorbed to Hybond nylon membranes, washed for 30 min in 50 mM Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS), drained, and blocked at 4°C in 4% casein solution. The stock anti-dPP95K antibody was added at 1:100 dilution in TBS, 3% bovine serum albumin and reacted with the membrane overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed with TTBS, drained, and incubated for 3 h with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG at 1:1000 in TBS. After washing in TTBS, the membranes were developed with 4-chloro-napthol in methanol/TBS. Positive clones were identified, collected by stab, and stored in suspension media at 4°C. The clones were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using λgt11 forward and reverse primers and subcloned into pGEM-T plasmid vector (Promega). The Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical) double stranded DNA sequencing protocol was used. Electrophoresis was on 6% polyacrylamide gels according to standard protocols. An Invitrogen mRNA isolation kit was used to obtain rat incisor odontoblast pulp, heart, liver, and muscle mRNA. For each tissue 1 μg of mRNA was electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond N+, and fixed by baking at 80°C. Membranes were prehybridized and hybridized by the Stratagene Quickhybridization method. A [32P]DCTP-labeled probe was obtained using random priming of clone 2PP with a nick translation labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). After hybridization the filters were washed at 65°C with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and then autoradiographed. The chromosomal location of the mouse PP gene, designated as Dmp2, dentin matrix protein 2 (the symbol PP has been used to designate another protein), was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived from matings of ((C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)Fl females and C57BL/6J) males. This interspecific backcross mapping panel has been typed for over 2000 loci that are well distributed among all of the autosomes as well as the X chromosome (20Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J and M. spretus DNAs were digested with restriction enzymes and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization for informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) (21Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the rat cDNA probe (22Benovic J.L. Onorato J.J. Arriza J.L. Stone W.C. Lohse M. Jenkins N.A.

Veis A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 7.8-kb BglI M. spretus RFLP was used to follow the segregation of the Dmp2 locus in the backcross mice. Recombinationdistances were calculated using the computer program SPRETUS MADNESS (24Green E.L. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Oxford University Press, New York1981: 77-113Crossref Google Scholar). Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to explain the allele distribution patterns. Polypeptide structure was modeled by energy minimization using the DISCOVER CVFF repetitive build program (BIOSYM software) on a Silicon Graphics R-4000, X/Z graphics workstation. The acid phosphatase was ~95% effective in dephosphorylating the PP95K. The dPP95K migrated as a single sharp blue Stains All stained band on the preparative gels and was easily eluted. The KLH-dPP95K conjugate enhanced the immunogenic response to dPP95K, and the anti-dPP95K was reactive with both dPP95K and PP95K. The anti-dPP95K was readily purified from an ammonium sulfate precipitate of the crude serum by passage over a PP95K-Sepharose 4B affinity column. At a 1:100 dilution of the antiserum, it was possible to detect as little as 0.1 nmol of PP95K on slot blots. The screen of the odontoblast λgt11 cDNA expression library with the anti-dPP95K yielded about 20 clones. A clone that produced an ~2500 base pair nucleotide sequence, designated as 2PP, was selected for further study. The coding region of the 2PP cDNA provides the carboxyl-terminal portion of the corresponding protein. The nucleotide generated amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1. We are in the process of completing the sequencing in the 5′ direction, but the very repetitive nature of the sequence makes progress slow. The overall amino acid composition of the 245-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain shows that Ser, Asp, and Asn comprise 94% of this portion of the molecule, with Ser accounting for ~60%. There is a single Cys residue, and all of the other amino acids (Gly, Arg, Lys, His, Glu, and Thr) are hydrophilic. There is not a single hydrophobic residue nor any proline present in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the phosphophoryn sequence thus far obtained. (Eq. 1) However, even a cursory examination of the sequence in Fig. 1 shows the presence of two prominent sequence motifs. Most striking is the presence of several sets of Asp-Ser-Ser (DSS) triads in the 245 amino acid residues of the carboxyl-terminal region. If one recognizes the DSS triplets as structural units, then the sequence can be written as below, with numbering in the amino-terminal direction using the carboxyl-terminal residue as −1: This portion of the PP sequence can be divided in two domains, from −245 to −75, and from −74 to −1. The first domain of 171 residues contains the [DSS]n>1 repeats, with n as large as 14, and only 4 residues different from Asp or Ser. The most carboxyl-terminal domain, from −74, has no extended DSS domains and contains all of the other non-Asp or -Ser residues. As noted by the underlines, there are five [SD] repeat sequences, [SD]m with m = 2 or 3. These data are in agreement with the conclusions of Sabsay et al. (11Sabsay B. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Lechner J.H. Veis A. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who examined peptides released by enzymatic digestion and partial acid hydrolysis of intact phosphorylated PP. They had concluded that the end regions had to contain sequences containing the majority of the non-Ser and -Asp residues and flanked a central core composed almost completely of Ser and Asp(Asn). The existence of these two sequence domains raises the question of their structural consequences. Because the PP is about 90% phosphorylated as isolated from dentin, the (DSS)n domain sequence structure was modeled as a completely Ser phosphorylated polypeptide, (DS*S*)12 by energy minimization on a Silicon Graphics R-4000, X/Z graphics workstation using the DISCOVER CVFF force field and automatic set parameters for 10,000 iterations, until the system energy converged at −207 kcal/mol. The CVFF repetitive build program (25Dauber-Osguthorpe P Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar) is a generalized force field with parameters specifically designed to minimize polypeptide conformations and is part of the INSIGHT II 950 molecule modeling system from BIOSYM/MSI (San Diego, CA). The potential electrostatic repulsions of the charged phosphate and carboxylate groups were taken into account, along with the other backbone and side chain interactions. The most probable structure is a nonplanar, folded, modified trans-extended backbone chain as depicted in Fig. 2A. Three features are evident. Because of the trans-peptide backbone, the adjacent S* phosphates in each triplet are on opposite edges of the chain, creating two ridges of phosphates. There are also two ridges of Asp carboxyls, running alongside the phosphate ridges. These ridges can be seen best in the end view in Fig. 2B. Within the repetitive [DSS] domains, the most important feature is the [SDS] repeat, which creates pairs of phosphates along the same edge of the extended chain, separated by a single amino acid residue (Fig. 2A). The pairs of phosphates alternate in direction along the backbone. The phosphates in each pair are separated by 5.1 Å, but the pairs are separated along the same edge by about 18 Å. Likewise, the carboxylate edges are very specifically structured and spaced along the peptide backbone. The repetitive DSS motif aligns a carboxyl of the next triplet with each pair of phosphates in the combined phosphate-carboxylate ridge (Fig. 2B). It will be important to investigate the potential calcium ion binding properties of such domains. On the other hand, the [SD]m sequences are quite different. These have only two ionic edges in the trans-extended chain conformation, with all of the phosphates on one edge and the carboxylates on the other (Fig. 2C). At the biochemical level, the PPs have been found only in mineralized dentin. To verify that the 2PP was expressed only in the teeth, a 2PP probe was used in Northern analysis to examine the RNA from a variety of tissues. The probe detected a single RNA band (Fig. 3) at ~7-7.5 kb in the odontoblast pulp mRNA, but none of the other tissue mRNAs, including brain, liver, and bone, showed any reactivity (data not shown), indicating that the 2PP mRNA was indeed tooth-specific. The chromosomal backcross mapping results indicated that the Dmp2 gene is located in the central region of mouse chromosome 5, linked to Ffg5, Dmp1, and Adrbk2. Although 111 mice were analyzed for every marker and are shown in the segregation analysis (Fig. 4), up to 191 mice were typed for some pairs of markers. Each locus was analyzed in pairwise combinations for recombination frequencies using the additional data (24Green E.L. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Oxford University Press, New York1981: 77-113Crossref Google Scholar). The ratios of the total number of mice exhibiting recombinant chromosomes to the total number of mice analyzed for each pair of loci, and the most likely gene order is: centromere-Fgf5-4/191-Dmp2-0/150-Dmp1-2/114-Adrbk2. The recombination frequencies (expressed as genetic distances in centimorgans ± standard error) are Fgf5-2.1 ± 1.0-[Dmp2, Dmp1]-1.8 ± 1.2 Adrbk2. No recombinants were detected between Dmp1 and Dmp2 in 150 animals typed in common, suggesting that the two loci are within 2.0 centimorgans of each other (upper 95% confidence limit). Our interspecific map of chromosome 5 has been compared with a composite mouse linkage map that reports the map location of many uncloned mouse mutations (Mouse Genome Database, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). The central region of mouse chromosome 5 shares homology with human chromosomes 4q and 22q (summarized in Fig. 4). In particular Fgf5 has been placed on human 4q21 and Adrbk2 on human 22q11. The placement of Dmp1 and Dmp2 between these two genes in the mouse suggests that Dmp1and Dmp2 will reside on 4q or 22q as well. Alpin et al. (26Alpin H.M. Hirst K.L. Crosby A.H. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 30: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have confirmed that Dmp1 is on chromosome 4q21 in the human. Thus the above data demonstrate that the clone 2PP represents a tooth (dentin pulp)-specific mRNA, whose gene, Dmp2, probably co-localizes on human chromosome 4q21 with the gene for another tooth dentin-specific protein, Dmp1 (23George A. Gui J. Jenkins A.N. Gilbert J.D. Copeland G.N. Veis A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The inherited genetic disorder of dentin mineralization, dentinogenesis imperfecta, type II, has also been linked to human chromosome 4q21 (27Crosby A.H. Scherpbier-Heddema T. Wijmenga C. Altherr M.R. Murray J.C. Buetow K.H. Dixon M.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 832-839PubMed Google Scholar). Bone sialoprotein and osteopontin have also been localized to this region (28Goold R.D. diSibio G.L. Xu H. Lang D.B. Dadgar J. Magrane G.G. Dugaiczyk A. Smith K.A. Cox D.R. Masters S.B. Myers R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1271-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but neither has shown any defect relative to dentinogenesis imperfecta, type II (29Crosby A.H. Edwards S.J. Murray J.C. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 27: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These data show that the prior report (30MacDougall M. Zeichner-David M. Murray J. Crall M. Davis S. Slavkin H.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 190-194PubMed Google Scholar) that the PP gene was not on 4q21 and not related to dentinogenesis imperfecta, type II, was in error because of misidentification of the PP gene. The unique nature of the phosphophoryns and many studies showing that in vitro they can modulate phosphate crystal nucleation and regulate crystal growth (5Veis A. Sabsay B. Westbroek P. deJong E.W. Biomineralization and Biological Metal Accumulation. D. Reidel Publishing Co., Dordrecht, Holland1982: 273-284Google Scholar, 6Linde A. Lussi A. Crenshaw M.A. Calcif.

Tissue Res. 1994; 30: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have led to numerous discussions of the potential role of the phosphophoryns in vivo and to the discussion of this group of molecules as models for protein modulations of biomineralization (2Heuer A.H. Fink D.J. Laria V.J. Arias J.L. Calvert P.D. Kendall K. Messing G.L. Blackwell J. Reike P.C. Thompson D.H. Wheeler A.P. Veis A. Caplan A.I.

In spite of the monotony of Ser and Asp composition, the present work demonstrates that the phosphophoryn molecule clearly has Ser- and Asp-rich domains of different structure. The unique [DSS]n triplet repeats create domains with very specific yet unique patterns of phosphates and carboxylates. These distinctive ionic patterns may be involved in either the site-specific binding of phosphophoryn to collagen fibrils (32Traub W. Jodaikin A. Arad T. Veis A. Sabsay B. Matrix. 1992; 12: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), nucleation of crystallization (6Linde A. Lussi A. Crenshaw M.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 44: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), or the regulation of the crystal growth patterns (7Fredi-Milhofer H. Moradian-Oldak J. Weiner S. Veis A. Mintz K.P. Addadi L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1994; 30: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, it will now be important to determine, with recombinant constructs of these domains, their interaction with calcium phosphate crystals and crystallization. Further, as sequencing through the NH2-terminal domains is completed, these and other constructs of the domains of the PP can be explored with regard to the mechanism of their phosphorylation. Work is already in progress to verify the relationship between tooth mineralization disorders and PP content and expression. These studies should ultimately reveal the function of this archetypal mineralized tissue-related molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2022841709,"Transaldolase (TAL) is a key enzyme of the reversible nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that is responsible for the generation of NADPH to maintain glutathione at a reduced state (GSH) and, thus, to protect cellular integrity from reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). Formation of ROIs have been implicated in certain types of apoptotic cell death. To evaluate the role of TAL in this process, Jurkat human T cells were permanently transfected with TAL expression vectors oriented in the sense or antisense direction. Overexpression of TAL resulted in a decrease in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities and NADPH and GSH levels and rendered these cells highly susceptible to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. In addition, reduced levels of TAL resulted in increased glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities and increased GSH levels with inhibition of apoptosis in all five model systems. The effect of TAL expression on susceptibility to apoptosis through regulating the PPP and GSH production is consistent with an involvement of ROIs in each pathway tested. Production of ROIs in Fas-mediated cell death was further substantiated by measurement of intracellular ROI production with oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probes, by the protective effects of GSH precursor, N-acetyl cysteine, free radical spin traps 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide and 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide, the antioxidants desferrioxamine, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and Amytal, and by the enhancing effects of GSH depletion with buthionine sulfoximine. The results provide definitive evidence that TAL has a role in regulating the balance between the two branches of PPP and its overall output as measured by GSH production and thus influences sensitivity to cell death signals.

https://openalex.org/W1985826486,"The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is required for assembly and secretion of the lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (apoB): very low density lipoproteins and chylomicrons. Evidence indicates that the subclasses of these lipoproteins that contain apoB-48 are assembled in a distinct two-step process; first a relatively lipid-poor primordial lipoprotein precursor is produced, and then bulk neutral lipids are added to form the core of these spherical particles. To determine if either step is mediated by MTP, a series of clonal cell lines stably expressing apoB-53 and MTP was established in non-lipoprotein-producing HeLa cells. MTP activity in these cells was ~30%, and apoB secretion was 7-33% of that in HepG2 cells on a molar basis. Despite having robust levels of triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis, these cell lines, as exemplified by HLMB53-59, secreted >90% of the apoB-53 on relatively lipid-poor particles in the density range of 1.063-1.21 g/ml. These results suggested that coexpression of MTP and apoB only reconstituted the first but not the second step in lipoprotein assembly. To extend this observation, additional studies were carried out in McArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cells, in which the second step of apoB-48 lipoprotein assembly is well defined. Treatment of these cells with the MTP photoaffinity inhibitor BMS-192951 before pulse labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine led to an 85% block of both apoB-48 and apoB-100 but not apoAI secretion, demonstrating inhibition of the first step of lipoprotein assembly. After a 30-min [35S]methioneine/cysteine pulse labeling and 120 min of chase, all of the nascent apoB-48 was observed to have a density of high density lipoproteins (1.063-1.21 g/ml), indicating that only the first step of lipoprotein assembly had occurred. The addition of oleic acid to the cell culture media activated the second step as evidenced by the conversion of the apoB-48 high density lipoproteins to very low density lipoproteins (d < 1.006 g/ml) during an extended chase period. Inactivation of MTP after completion of the first step, but before stimulation of the second step by the addition of oleic acid, did not block this conversion. Thus, inhibition of MTP did not hinder the addition of bulk core lipid to the primordial lipoprotein precursor particles, indicating that MTP is not required for the second step of apoB-48 lipoprotein assembly.

Despite having robust levels of triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis, these cell lines, as exemplified by HLMB53-59, secreted >90% of the apoB-53 on relatively lipid-poor particles in the density range of 1.063-1.21 g/ml. These results suggested that coexpression of MTP and apoB only reconstituted the first but not the second step in lipoprotein assembly. To extend this observation, additional studies were carried out in McArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cells, in which the second step of apoB-48 lipoprotein assembly is well defined. Treatment of these cells with the MTP photoaffinity inhibitor BMS-192951 before pulse labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine led to an 85% block of both apoB-48 and apoB-100 but not apoAI secretion, demonstrating inhibition of the first step of lipoprotein assembly. After a 30-min [35S]methioneine/cysteine pulse labeling and 120 min of chase, all of the nascent apoB-48 was observed to have a density of high density lipoproteins (1.063-1.21 g/ml), indicating that only the first step of lipoprotein assembly had occurred. The addition of oleic acid to the cell culture media activated the second step as evidenced by the conversion of the apoB-48 high density lipoproteins to very low density lipoproteins (d < 1.006 g/ml) during an extended chase period. Inactivation of MTP after completion of the first step, but before stimulation of the second step by the addition of oleic acid, did not block this conversion. Thus, inhibition of MTP did not hinder the addition of bulk core lipid to the primordial lipoprotein precursor particles, indicating that MTP is not required for the second step of apoB-48 lipoprotein assembly. INTRODUCTIONLipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (apoB) 1The abbreviations used are: apoBapolipoprotein BMTPmicrosomal triglyceride transfer proteinVLDLvery low density lipoproteinLDLlow density lipoproteinHDLhigh density lipoproteinPBSphosphate buffered salineMEMminimal essential mediumMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxide. are the main carriers of triglyceride and cholesteryl esters in the circulatory system (1Havel R.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Bondy P.K. Rosenber L.E. Metabolic Control and Disease. 8th Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1980: 393-494Google Scholar). Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is a triglyceride-rich particle produced by the liver. In humans, VLDL contains one copy of apoB-100 per particle. In other species, such as rats, mice, rabbits, and dogs, the liver also produces VLDL containing one copy of a smaller form of apoB generated by post-transcriptional deamination of cytidine residue 6666 of the mRNA, converting it to a uridine, changing codon 2153 from a glutamine to a translation stop signal (2Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The resulting translation product contains the amino-terminal 48% of full-length apoB-100 and is termed apoB-48. Post-transcriptional editing of the apoB mRNA at the same nucleotide residue also occurs in the intestinal enterocytes of all vertebrates studied to date. ApoB-48 produced in the intestines is packaged into chylomicron particles that are more highly enriched in triglycerides and larger in diameter than VLDL.Early ultrastructural studies (3Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) of rat liver demonstrated immunoreactive apoB on VLDL size particles at the junction between the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, while apoB in the proximal regions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum was associated with smaller particles. Furthermore, lipid droplets lacking immunoreactive apoB were identified in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These observations were interpreted to indicate that small apoB particles that were formed in the rough endoplasmic reticulum were fusing with preformed lipid droplets from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum at the border between these subcellular structures. These observations formed the basis for a model in which VLDL is assembled in two steps (for review, see Ref. 4Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The first step includes all of the events leading up to production of small, dense, apoB-containing primordial lipoprotein precursor particles. The second step is the addition of the bulk lipid by fusion of the small primordial lipoprotein precursors to preformed lipid droplets to form mature VLDL.A recent study in McArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cells (5Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed this model by demonstrating that nascent apoB-48 polypeptide chains are cotranslationally complexed with lipids to form a primordial lipoprotein particle with the density of high density lipoproteins (HDL, d = 1.063-1.21 g/ml). In a distinct second step, the major load of lipid is added to the primordial lipoprotein particle to form a particle of VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) density. These two steps could be temporally dissociated by manipulating the fatty acid content of the cell culture medium (5Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of fatty acid, the cells slowly secreted lipid-poor apoB-48 HDL density particles, suggesting that only the first step of assembly had occurred. Upon supplementation of the medium with oleic acid, large quantities of lipid were added to the apoB-48 HDL that remained within the cell, resulting in secretion of VLDL density particles. In contrast, apoB-100 is rapidly assembled into VLDL density particles regardless of lipid supplementation of the medium, precluding the use of apoB-100 to study the second step in this model system. Thus, the second step of apoB-48 VLDL assembly was stimulated by a high level of lipid synthesis in response to fatty acid feeding. In the same study (5Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide, conversion of apoB-48 HDL to VLDL was partially inhibited regardless of lipid supplementation. This finding suggests that a protein factor may be required to add bulk core lipid to nascent apoB-48 lipoproteins to convert them to VLDL.Besides apoB and lipid synthesis, the only other known factor required for lipoprotein assembly is the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (for review, see Ref. 6Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MTP is a soluble heterodimeric protein composed of a unique 97-kDa subunit and protein disulfide isomerase, a ubiquitous multifunctional protein (7Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. Spinner S.N. Joiner B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9800-9807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active MTP complex resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in cells that produce apoB lipoproteins (8Wetterau J.R. Zilversmitt D.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The absence of MTP has been identified as the proximal cause of the autosomal recessive disease abetalipoproteinemia (9Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 10Shoulders C.C. Brett D.J. Bayliss J.D. Narcisi T.M.E. Jarmuz A. Grantham T.T.

The principal characteristic of this disease is the nearly complete inability to secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins from the hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes, leading to exceedingly low levels of cholesterol in the plasma (11Kane J.P. Havel R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1139-1164Google Scholar). In cell culture studies, it has been shown that expression of apoB alone in non-lipoprotein-producing cell lines does not lead to secretion of apoB lipoproteins. Conversely, coexpression of apoB and MTP leads to secretion of apoB lipoproteins (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol.

Furthermore, inactivation of MTP in liver-derived cells with a photoaffinity inhibitor abolishes apoB secretion (15Jamil H. Gordon D.A. Eustice D.C. Brooks C.M. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chen Y. Ricci B. Chu C.-H. Harrity T.W. Ciosek Jr., C.P. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11991-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that MTP is necessary to mediate the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles. What is not clear is which step(s) in the lipoprotein assembly pathway is mediated by MTP. Since MTP catalyzes the transfer of lipid between phospholipid surfaces, it is possible that MTP mediates both the first and second step of apoB-48 lipoprotein assembly. In this report, we describe studies in a non-lipoprotein-producing cell line stably expressing MTP and apoB and in the McArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cell line, designed to address this question.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll tissue culture media, sera, and reagents and enzymes and buffers for DNA manipulation were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals and immunological reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. McArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 10 μM nonessential amino acids, MEM vitamins, and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate. The HeLa-derived HLM-40 cell line that stably expresses the large subunit of human MTP has been described (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Goat anti-human apoB antiserum was purchased from Biodesign International (Kennebunk, ME). Rabbit anti-rat apoB antiserum has been described (5Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Express [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling mixture was obtained from DuPont NEN. Amplify gel-enhancing agent was purchased from Amersham Corp. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.MethodsPlasmid Constructs and TransfectionsPlasmids expressing human apoB-53 (pB53) were kindly supplied by Dr. Zemin Yao (Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario) (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance gene (pRC/hygro) was constructed as follows. The hygromycin expression cassette was excised from commercial vector pREP7 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by digestion with restriction enzymes SalI and SmaI and subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) using standard molecular biological techniques (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After removal from pBluescript II KS with XbaI and XhoI, the ends of the 1.86-kilobase pair hygromycin fragment were filled in using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and ligated into plasmid pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) previously digested with NaeI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to remove the neomycin resistance gene.Plasmid pB53 was cotransfected at a molar ratio of 4:1 with pRC/hygro into HLM-40 cells with the Lipofectin Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the cells were subcultured at a ratio of 1:4 and fed selection medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, MEM nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mg/ml active concentration of Geneticin, and 360 units/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem). After 3 weeks of selection, the cells were fed the same medium containing 1.0 mg/ml of Geneticin and 240 units/ml of hygromycin (maintenance medium). Individual hygromycin-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded as clonal cell lines for analysis of apoB expression.From previous studies (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), it was expected that expression of apoB in the HLM-40 cell line would lead to secretion of this protein into the medium. Thus, conditioned medium from each hygromycin-resistant clonal cell line was assayed for apoB as follows. Cells were grown to confluency in 48-well tissue culture plates. Maintenance medium was removed, and the cells were fed 0.5 ml of lipid-rich medium (RPMI 1640, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mM oleic acid, 1.0 mM glycerol) for 24 h. Aliquots of media (100 μl) were assayed for apoB by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (17Lin M.C.M. Gordon D. Wetterau J.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1073-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several clonal cell lines secreting apoB-53 were identified, one of which (HLMB53-59) was chosen for further analysis. MTP-mediated triglyceride transfer activity was measured in cell extracts as described (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Buoyant density fractionation by sequential ultracentrifugation and subsequent immunoblot analysis of the lipoproteins secreted from HLMB53 cell lines were carried out as described (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).In Situ Inactivation of MTP with a Photoaffinity InhibitorMcArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and MEM vitamins (growth medium). All supplements were added according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. McArdle RH-7777 cells grown to 90% of confluency in 10.0-cm dishes were used in all experiments described below.To establish the parameters for in situ inactivation of MTP in McArdle RH-7777 cells, the following experiment was carried out. Cultures were brought to 10.0 μM BMS-192951 in growth medium containing 0.5% Me2SO. All subsequent manipulations were carried out in the dark until the cells were harvested. After incubation for 1 h under standard cell culture conditions, the cultures were exposed to ultraviolet light at 365 nm for 0-15 min (UVP, San Gabriel, CA) at 4°C. One culture dish remained in the incubator as the zero time control. The cultures were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and extracts were prepared as described (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To ensure removal of all noncovalently bound BMS-192951, the extracts were exhaustively dialyzed against a buffer containing 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl, and 0.02% sodium azide for 16 h at 4°C. MTP-mediated triglyceride transfer activity was measured in the dialyzed extracts by the standard assay (9Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar).To determine the effect of in situ inactivation of MTP on apoB and apoAI secretion, McArdle RH-7777 cells were treated with 10.0 μM BMS-192951 as above. After exposure to ultraviolet light, the cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS and fed prelabeling medium (methionine- and cysteine-free growth medium containing 15% dialyzed fetal bovine serum) for 1 h. The prelabeling medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed once with PBS and pulse-labeled for 30 min with labeling medium (prelabeling medium plus 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine). The labeling medium was removed, and growth medium was added for 3 h. The media were harvested; adjusted to 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mM benzamidine, 5.0 mM EDTA, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin; and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4°C to remove loose cells. The amount of apoB and apoAI in each sample was determined by immunoprecipitation of 0.5-ml aliquots of medium diluted 1:1 with NET buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005 M EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) as described previously (17Lin M.C.M. Gordon D. Wetterau J.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1073-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-rat apoB and rabbit anti-hamster apoAI antisera were utilized at a final dilution of 1:500. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for apoB and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for apoAI. Radioactivity in the apoB and apoAI bands was directly quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Cell FractionationTo determine if inhibition of MTP causes a shift in the buoyant density of lipoproteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or those secreted into the medium, cultures of McArdle RH-7777 cells were treated as indicated in Fig. 4. Upon completion of the experimental protocol, media were removed, treated with protease inhibitors, centrifuged as described above, and stored at 4°C for further analysis. Endoplasmic reticulum lumenal extracts were isolated by a modification of the previously published technique (5Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were rinsed with and scraped into 5.0 ml of 0.25 M sucrose solution (made in 3.0 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.4) and pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. All subsequent steps were carried out in buffers containing 1.0 mM EGTA, 2.0 μg/ml calpain I inhibitor, 1.0 μM pepstatin A, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After resuspension in 1.0 ml of 0.05 M sucrose solution (made in 3.0 M imidazole buffer, pH 7.4), the cells were transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 s at 3,000 × g. The cell pellets were gently resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.05 M sucrose solution, transferred to a 2.0-ml Dounce homogenizer, and homogenized by 15 strokes with the tight fitting pestle. After the addition of 52 μl of 47% sucrose solution (made in 3.0 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.4), the cells were further homogenized by an additional five strokes with the tight-fitting pestle. The homogenates were quantitatively transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube at a final volume of 800 μl and were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 0.25 M sucrose solution and recentrifuged under the same conditions. The supernatants were pooled and recentrifuged once to remove all cellular debris and nonmicrosomal membrane components. Final supernatants (1.0 ml) were added to 0.5 ml of 0.25 M sucrose, 2.5 ml PBS, 0.5 ml 47% sucrose, and 0.5 ml 1.0 M sodium carbonate and incubated for 25 min at room temperature with gentle mixing every 5 min. Samples were brought to 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C in a Beckman model TL-100 ultracentrifuge in the TLA 100.3 rotor. The supernatants were removed and neutralized to pH 7.4 with glacial acetic acid, and EGTA and protease inhibitors were added to achieve the final concentrations listed above.Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation and ImmunoprecipitationAliquots (5.0 ml) of cell culture media and lumenal extracts were loaded onto sucrose gradients, centrifuged, and fractionated as described (5Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were brought to 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005 M EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and a final volume of 1.5 ml, and 1.5 μl of nonimmune rabbit serum was added. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, 75 μl of 5% protein A-Sepharose (w/v) was added for 30 min. The protein A-Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube containing 10 μl of rabbit anti-rat apoB antisera. All subsequent immunoprecipitation steps were carried out as described (17Lin M.C.M. Gordon D. Wetterau J.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1073-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analytical MethodsProtein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay as described by the manufacturer. Data shown are representative of at least two independent experiments.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have clearly demonstrated that MTP is required for the efficient assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins (for review, see Ref. 6Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). While these studies have been useful in defining the overall requirement for lipid transfer activity in the lipoprotein assembly pathway, they have not determined the exact steps mediated by MTP. Besides translation of the apoB mRNA and translocation of this secretory protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, assembly of apoB-48 containing VLDL or chylomicrons requires at least two additional processes. First, the nascent apoB polypeptide must be properly folded and complexed with enough lipid to stabilize the amphipathic, lipid-binding α-helices and β-sheet structures found throughout the protein downstream of the amino-terminal 50-60 kDa (20Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra U.K. Anatharamaiah C.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This step yields a relatively lipid-poor primordial lipoprotein precursor particle of HDL density. Second, bulk quantities of neutral lipid must be loaded into the core of the particle, increasing its diameter and decreasing its density to that of mature VLDL or chylomicrons (for review, see Ref. 4Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Inferences drawn from early indirect studies have led us to propose (6Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Gordon D.A. Yao Z. Jamil H. Yan M. Wang S. McLeod R. Wetterau J.R. Circulation. 1995; 92: I-362Google Scholar) that MTP mediates the first step of lipoprotein assembly. For instance, an ultrastructural analysis of liver from a homozygous abetalipoproteinemia patient showed no evidence of small, dense lipoprotein particles in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (22Avigan M.I. Ishak K.G. Gregg R.E. Hoofnagle J.H. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 1223-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). While studies such as these suggest a role for MTP in the first step of apoB-48 lipoprotein assembly, they do not address whether MTP plays a role in the second step. Given its lipid transfer capabilities, MTP may also mediate the loading of bulk neutral lipids to the core of nascent apoB-48 lipoproteins.In this report, we describe a series of studies designed to address which step(s) in apoB-48 lipoprotein assembly are mediated by MTP. First, MTP and apoB-53 were expressed in HeLa cells, a non-lipoprotein-producing, nonhepatic, nonintestinal cell line that has a robust level of lipid synthesis (~1/2 the level of HepG2 cells for triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine and 2 times HepG2 levels for cholesteryl ester) 3D. A. Gordon and H. Jamil, unpublished observation. but does not express MTP or apoB. Thus, by coexpressing apoB and MTP and analyzing the cell culture medium for the presence of apoB and the physical nature of the apoB lipoproteins, it can be inferred whether either or both steps in lipoprotein assembly involve MTP. The results showed that coexpression of MTP and a close relative to apoB-48, apoB-53, led to the secretion of a particle with the density of HDL when the cells were fed oleic acid and glycerol. Feeding cholesterol in addition to oleic acid did not lead to the formation of less dense particles.These results can be explained as follows. First, expression of apoB-53 alone in HeLa and other non-lipoprotein-producing cell lines does not lead to lipoprotein secretion (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E.

A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is generally accepted (4Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that the product of the first step of apoB-48 lipoprotein assembly is a relatively lipid-poor particle of HDL or similar density that can be secreted from the cell, albeit inefficiently relative to the mature VLDL (4Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that coexpression of apoB-53 and MTP yields secretion of an HDL density particle and not a VLDL density particle suggests that MTP expression along with apoB in an appropriate ce"
https://openalex.org/W2137528739,"The small GTPases of the Rho family play a key role in a number of signaling pathways activated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). However, little is known concerning the mechanism of regulation of these proteins. In this study we demonstrate that in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, LPA induces a sustained, time-dependent relocalization of RhoA to the Triton X-100-soluble low speed membrane fraction, which can be reversed by removal of LPA from the medium. Translocation was only observed with micromolar concentrations of LPA and was inhibited by pretreating the cells with pertussis toxin but not with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. LPA also induced translocation of CDC42Hs to the membranes but had no effect on the distribution of Rac1, RhoB, or Rho-GDI. Translocation of RhoA was also induced by endothelin-1. Conversely, platelet-derived growth factor did not cause the translocation of RhoA to any membrane fraction but stimulated relocalization of Rac1 to the high speed membrane fraction. Significantly, incubation of cell lysates with guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) was sufficient to translocate RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs from the cytosol to the membranes, whereas incubation with GDP had the opposite effect. These data suggest that the translocation of the Rho family proteins to the membrane fraction is controlled by their activation state and that agonists show selectivity in inducing the activation/translocation of these proteins. The small GTPases of the Rho family play a key role in a number of signaling pathways activated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). However, little is known concerning the mechanism of regulation of these proteins.

The Rho family of Ras-related small GTPases, which includes RhoA, -B, -C, and -G, Rac1 and −2, and CDC42Hs and TC10 (1Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar), plays an important role in the regulation of cell function.

The proteins of the Rho family cycle between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states, aided by a number of regulatory proteins. Several guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which promote binding of GTP to Rho family members by facilitating the release of GDP, have recently been identified (8Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). A large number of GTPase-activating proteins, which act on Rho proteins, have also been characterized (9Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, most of the exchange factors or GTPase-activating proteins identified thus far do not show absolute specificity for one member of the Rho family, although some show preferences for particular G proteins. In addition, all Rho family members bind to a cytosolic regulatory protein, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI), 1The abbreviations used are: Rho-GDIRho GDP dissociation inhibitorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)LPAlysophosphatidic acidPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)AMP-PNPadenylyl imidodiphosphate. which inhibits GDP dissociation (10Ueda T.

A number of signaling pathways in fibroblasts that are activated by the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) utilize small GTPases. Studies using the C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum, which catalyzes the ADP ribosylation and inactivation of Rho, have shown that this modification interferes with LPA-stimulated stress fiber formation (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Likewise, using the C3 toxin, Malcolm et al. (13Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RhoA is required for the activation of phospholipase D by LPA in Rat1 fibroblasts. High concentrations of LPA also stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts via a mechanism that involves activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein, Ras, and the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (14Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar) demonstrated that LPA activates gene transcription by the serum response factor through a mechanism that requires RhoA, Rac, or CDC42Hs. However, despite the growing evidence that Rho proteins are required in LPA signaling, little is known concerning their regulation. In this study we investigated the effect of LPA treatment on the subcellular distribution of Rho family proteins in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Mitogenic concentrations of LPA stimulated a sustained increase of RhoA and CDC42Hs, but not Rac1, in the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fractions of these cells that was time- and dose-dependent and reversible. Furthermore, translocation of RhoA could be blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. On the other hand, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) did not cause the translocation of RhoA but induced the association of Rac1 with a different membrane fraction. It is proposed that the selective membrane translocation of RhoA and Rac1 by LPA and PDGF is related to the activation and function of the GTPases. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), penicillin, and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. LPA (1-oleoyl) was from Avanti Polar Lipids. PDGF-ββ was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Fetal bovine serum, endothelin-1, sodium orthovanadate, leupeptin, antipain, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium fluoride, sodium pyrophosphate, Tween 20, Triton X-100, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. GDP, GTP, GTPγS, and ATP were from Boehringer Mannheim. Pertussis toxin was purchased from List Biological Laboratories. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein, tyrphostin A25, and herbimycin A) were from Calbiochem. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in HEPES-buffered DMEM with 4 mM L-glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For all experiments, cells were grown on 100-mm dishes for 1-2 days to subconfluency (60-70%). The medium was then replaced with a low serum medium (DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 24 h to allow the cells to become quiescent. The cells were then treated with serum-free medium (DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics) for 1 h prior to agonist stimulation. Serum-starved cultures on 100-mm dishes were treated with various concentrations of LPA, PDGF, or endothelin-1 for different times as noted in the experiments. The medium was removed and the cells were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 μM sodium orthovanadate and scraped in 1 ml/dish lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml antipain and leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 10 mM NaF, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). The cells were lysed by five passes through a 27-gauge needle (17Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar) on ice. Trypan blue staining of the lysate indicated >95% disruption of the plasma membrane. In the initial experiments, lysates were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min to prepare cytosolic and total particulate fractions. However, in most experiments the lysate was first centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to prepare the nuclear fraction (low speed pellet) and then recentrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min to pellet the remainder of the particulate fraction (high speed pellet), which consists of the heavy and light membrane fractions (17Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). Each fraction was washed at least twice with lysis buffer to remove cytosolic proteins. The nuclear fraction was further purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation, as described previously (17Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the low speed pellet was laid over a 2.0 M sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min to separate adherent membranes from the nuclei (17Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). The Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction was prepared from 3T3 fibroblasts in two ways. (i) Control and activated fibroblasts were broken open in lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and then fractionated into low and high speed pellets as normal. (ii) The low speed pellet was prepared as normal from control and activated fibroblasts and then stirred in the presence and absence of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4°C. The samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate the solubilized proteins from non-solubilized material. Protein determination was done by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphodiesterase I (plasma membrane), cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondria), and lactate dehydrogenase (cytosol) marker enzymes were assayed as described in Storrie and Madden (19Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). DNA and RNA were used as markers for the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively (19Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and were detected on agarose gels, with and without RNase treatment, by ethidium bromide staining. The Golgi fraction was detected by Western blotting using an α-mannosidase II antibody. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 14% acrylamide gels (Novel Experimental Corp.), and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Novel Experimental Corp.) for 1 h at 20 V using a Novex wet transfer unit. The membranes were blocked overnight with 10% (w/v) nonfat dried milk (RhoA, RhoB, CDC42Hs, and Rho-GDI immunoblots) or 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin containing 1% (v/v) goat serum (Rac1 immunoblots). Blots were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate primary antibody (diluted 1:500) in 1% bovine serum albumin and then for 45 min with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories), prior to development using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). Bands corresponding to the GTPases were measured by densitometry (Apple Macintosh, OneScanner), and the band intensities were measured using NIH Image. Purified recombinant proteins were used as standards to calibrate the densitometer. Antibodies to peptides of RhoA, RhoB, Rho-GDI, Rac1, and CDC42Hs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Western blotting of purified recombinant proteins confirmed that the antibodies were specific (results not shown). In unstimulated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, RhoA was found in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions (Fig. 1). Scanning densitometry of several immunoblots (n = 3) indicated that approximately 75% of the total RhoA was present in the cytosol. Stimulation of the fibroblasts with 100 μM LPA for 20 min resulted in an increase of approximately 25% in the amount of RhoA in the total membrane fraction but did not produce any detectable decrease in the cytosolic fraction (not shown). Further fractionation of the membranes showed that in unstimulated 3T3 fibroblasts RhoA was present in the membranes pelleted by low and high speed centrifugation (Fig. 1). LPA treatment resulted in an increase in RhoA of about 50% in the fraction obtained by centrifugation at 500 × g but had no perceptible effect on the RhoA concentration in the membranes pelleted by the subsequent 120,000 × g centrifugation (Fig. 1). Microscopic analysis of the low speed fraction indicated that it contained mainly large membrane fragments (not shown). Marker enzyme analysis of the different fractions indicated that 60% of the plasma membrane marker alkaline phosphodiesterase I was recovered in the low speed pellet, under stimulated and unstimulated conditions (not shown), with the remainder detected in the high speed membranes (40%). In addition, the cytochrome c oxidase mitochondrial marker was also found in both the low speed (65%) and high speed (35%) membrane fractions. Likewise, the α-mannosidase II marker was detected in both the low speed (55%) and high speed (45%) membrane fractions. In contrast, DNA (nuclear marker) was recovered almost entirely in the low speed fraction, with only a trace detected in the high speed membranes and none in the cytosol, whereas RNA (endoplasmic reticulum marker) was highly enriched in the high speed membranes but barely detectable in the low speed membranes (not shown), as seen previously (17Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). As expected, lactate dehydrogenase activity was not detected in the low or high speed membrane fractions but was found exclusively in the cytosol (not shown). In order to ascertain if the LPA-stimulated translocation of RhoA was to the nucleus, that organelle was further purified from the low speed membranes by sucrose density centrifugation. However, RhoA was not detectable in the nuclei, either before or after LPA treatment (Fig. 2A), suggesting that RhoA was associated with a different subcellular fraction, e.g. plasma membrane. Membrane fractions were also prepared from control and LPA-activated cells in the presence and absence of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 to determine whether RhoA was translocating to the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. Triton X-100 treatment resulted in a 95% decrease in the level of RhoA in the low and high speed pellets under basal conditions and eliminated the translocation of RhoA to the low speed membrane fraction (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the GTPase was associating with Triton X-100-soluble membranes. Indeed, Triton X-100 solubilized all of the RhoA associating with the low speed fraction (not shown), confirming that the protein was not relocalizing to the cytoskeleton. RhoA translocated to the low speed pellet in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Relocalization of RhoA became evident 2.5 min after addition of LPA to the cell medium, but the effect was not maximal until after 20 min of stimulation. Interestingly, LPA treatment also stimulated translocation of another Rho family protein, CDC42Hs, to the low speed fraction (Fig. 3), but not to the high speed fraction (not shown). The time course of CDC42Hs translocation was similar to that of RhoA, but there was only a 30% increase in membrane-associated CDC42Hs with maximum stimulation. Maximum translocation of both GTPases was still evident 1 h after addition of LPA (not shown). The small GTPases Rac1 (Fig. 3) and RhoB (not shown) did not translocate to any membrane fraction after LPA stimulation. A small amount of Rho-GDI (5% of the cellular total) was found in the low speed fraction. However, the level of Rho-GDI in the membranes did not increase after LPA treatment (Fig. 3), indicating that Rho-GDI did not relocalize after agonist treatment. Furthermore, the absence of an increase in Rho-GDI, RhoB, or Rac1 proved that the increased association of RhoA and CDC42Hs with the membranes was not due merely to an increase in the amount of unbroken cells in the low speed fraction. Significantly, removal of LPA from the medium resulted in the rapid relocalization of RhoA from the membranes to the cytosol (Fig. 4). RhoA levels in the low speed pellet returned to basal values 5 min after the agonist was removed, indicating that translocation of the small GTPase was reversible and that LPA must remain in the medium to sustain the increased RhoA concentration in the membrane fraction. Interestingly, LPA only induced translocation of RhoA at relatively high (micromolar) concentrations (Fig. 5). Increased RhoA levels were detected in the membranes after treatment with 1 and 10 μM LPA, with maximal translocation seen at 100 μM LPA. A similar dose-response curve was obtained for CDC42Hs (not shown).Fig. 5Lysophosphatidic acid stimulates translocation of RhoA in a concentration-dependent manner. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were treated without LPA (C) or with the indicated concentration of LPA for 20 min, lysed, and the low speed membranes prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The RhoA content of the low speed membranes was determined by Western blotting of proteins (2 μg). A, results are representative of four different experiments. B, data are expressed as a percentage of the control treatment and are the average ± standard error of four experiments. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pretreatment of the cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 16 h reduced the LPA-stimulated association of RhoA with the membrane fraction (Fig. 6). Almost all of the translocation effect was blocked by this treatment, suggesting that LPA-induced translocation of RhoA is largely stimulated through a heterotrimeric G protein(s) of the Gi family. On the other hand, pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein, tyrphostin A25, or herbimycin A had no effect on the relocalization of RhoA (not shown), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is not involved in the effect. Interestingly, endothelin-1 treatment also increased the concentration of RhoA in the low speed membrane fraction by approximately 25% (Fig. 7) but had no detectable effect on the localization of Rac1 or CDC42Hs (not shown). In contrast to LPA and endothelin-1, 50 ng/ml PDGF stimulated a time-dependent increase in Rac1 in the high speed membrane fraction but had no effect on Rac1 levels in the low speed fraction (Fig. 8) or on the distribution of RhoA (Fig. 8) or CDC42Hs (not shown). The effect of PDGF on Rac 1 translocation was dose-dependent, with a half-maximal effect at 30 ng/ml (not shown).Fig. 8Effect of PDGF on the cellular distribution of RhoA and Rac1. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with 50 ng/ml PDGF for the indicated times. The cells were lysed and fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cytosol (C), low speed membranes (L), and high speed membranes (H) were analyzed for RhoA and Rac1 content by Western blotting of proteins (1.5 μg). A, results are representative of three independent experiments. B, for each fraction, data are expressed as a percentage of the control treatment and are the average ± standard error of three experiments. □, C; ⋄, L; ∘, H.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Swiss 3T3 lysates were incubated with 100 μM GTPγS to determine its effect on the distribution of RhoA, Rac1, CDC42Hs, and Rho-GDI. GTPγS stimulated the translocation of RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs from the cytosol to the total membrane fraction in a time-dependent manner (not shown) but had no effect on the distribution of Rho-GDI (Fig. 9, lanes 5). Interestingly, unlike the agonist-stimulated GTPase translocation described above, GTPγS treatment also produced a significant decrease in the GTPase content of the cytosol. Furthermore, the magnitude of GTPγS-stimulated translocation was much greater than that of agonist-stimulated relocalization (55% increase in RhoA levels in the total particulate fraction compared with a 25% increase after LPA treatment), and all three GTPases studied were translocated to both the low and high speed membrane fractions (not shown). GTP treatment did not cause a statistically significant increase in the amount of membrane-associated RhoA, CDC42Hs, or Rac1 (Fig. 9, lanes 4). On the other hand, GDP treatment reduced the amount of RhoA, CDC42Hs, and Rac1 in the membranes by almost 30% but did not produce a statistically significant increase in the cytosolic concentration of these GTPases (Fig. 9, lanes 3). The distribution of Rho family GTPases was not affected by 1 mM ATP (Fig. 9, lanes 2) or by 1 mM ADP, 100 μM ATPγS, and 100 μM AMP-PNP (not shown), indicating that the translocation effect is specific for guanine nucleotides. In this study, we demonstrate that RhoA translocates to the membrane fraction in a time- and dose-dependent manner when Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts are stimulated with LPA. Under optimal conditions, the RhoA in the total particulate fraction increased by 25% (not shown). Further investigation revealed that translocation was to the low speed membrane fraction (Fig. 1), which was largely composed of nuclei and large membrane fragments (17Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar) and had a high alkaline phosphodiesterase I activity, a marker of plasma membranes. Since RhoA is involved in the activation of a nuclear phospholipase D (20Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29843-29847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility of its relocalization to the nucleus. However, no RhoA was detected in a nuclear fraction (Fig. 2A) before or after LPA stimulation. Similarly, since RhoA is required for the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar) and can be relocalized to a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in platelets (21Zhang J. King W.G. Dillon S. Hall A. Feig L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22251-22254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility of its translocation to the cytoskeleton. However, LPA did not stimulate such a redistribution (Fig. 2B). Translocation of RhoA was evident after 2.5 min of LPA stimulation, was maximal at 20 min (Fig. 3), and was sustained for more than 1 h. The translocation appears not to be required for formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, since stress fibers are visible 2 min after addition of LPA, reach maximal density after 10 min, and then decrease gradually (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RhoA translocation was only observed at LPA concentrations above 1 μM (Fig. 5) and was inhibited by pertussis toxin (Fig. 6), whereas stress fiber formation is maximally activated by 40 nM LPA and is not affected by the toxin (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 22Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rho-mediated stress fiber formation in response to LPA is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A25 (23Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the translocation was not. Although the LPA concentration dependence of RhoA relocalization is similar to that for activation of phospholipase D (13Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the time course of the translocation differs from that for the activation of the phospholipase, which is maximal in 2 min and then becomes down-regulated (13Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24van der Bend R.L. De Widt J. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Significantly, the high concentrations of LPA required to translocate RhoA are similar to those that stimulate mitogenesis (25van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LPA-stimulated mitogenesis (25van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and RhoA translocation (Fig. 6) are both mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Although previous studies have revealed that LPA-activated mitogenesis involves activation of Gi, Ras, and the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (14Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), it is not inconceivable that RhoA may also play a role in this signaling network. Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by the observations that RhoA enhances Ras-triggered morphological transformation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (26Qiu R.-G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 27Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and that Rho family GTPases synergize with Raf to increase mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (28Frost A.J. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, translocation of RhoA does not seem to be dependent on Ras since it is not reduced by pretreating the cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, whereas LPA activation of Ras is inhibited by genistein (15van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the two GTPases are involved in different Gi-mediated signaling pathways. One possibility is that translocation of RhoA is involved in LPA-activated gene transcription by the serum response factor (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LPA also stimulated the relocalization of CDC42Hs but not Rac1 to the low speed fraction (Fig. 3). Therefore, it is possible that LPA may also activate some of the signaling pathways that require CDC42Hs, for example activation of Jun kinase (29Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H.

Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) through activation of p21-activated kinase. LPA treatment had no effect on the subcellular distribution of Rho-GDI (Fig. 3), indicating that it does not relocalize to the membranes, in agreement with previous studies (32Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dash D. Aepfelbacher M. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This result suggests that during activation, Rho-GDI dissociates from the Rho proteins either prior to or during relocalization of the GTPases to the membrane. Like LPA, endothelin-1 stimulated translocation of RhoA to the low speed fraction (Fig. 7), but it is not known which heterotrimeric G protein mediates this effect. PDGF stimulated translocation of Rac1 to the high speed fraction in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 8). Rac1 is involved in PDGF-stimulated membrane ruffling in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (4Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 6Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar), and PDGF stimulates GTP loading of Rac1 (34Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), apparently through activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (34Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D.

Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 577-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the Rac1 translocation observed here is unlikely to be involved in membrane ruffling since this is stimulated by 3 ng/ml PDGF (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 23Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas translocation was half-maximal at 30 ng/ml PDGF. Another possibility is that translocation of Rac1 may play a role in a mitogenic signaling pathway since Rac also plays an essential role in Ras transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts (27Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 36Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Incubation of Swiss 3T3 lysates with GTPγS stimulated translocation of RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs from the cytosol to the membranes but had no effect on the distribution of Rho-GDI (Fig. 9). It has been proposed that binding of GTPγS to Rho proteins is sufficient to induce translocation and that the GTPγS-bound forms may interact with a putative binding protein in the membrane (32Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that Rho-GDI has a 10-fold higher affinity for the GDP-bound forms of Rho proteins than for the GTP-bound forms (37Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so that the GTP-bound forms are more likely to dissociate from Rho-GDI and translocate to the membranes. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that GDP stimulated translocation of the Rho family proteins to the cytosol (Fig. 9). The high levels of GDP presumably increased the proportion of GDP-bound Rho proteins, which are more likely to interact with Rho-GDI and become localized to the cytosol. Importantly, the GTPγS-induced translocation of RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs was nonselective. Therefore, the specific agonist-stimulated translocations described in the present study might involve the activation of selective guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which promote binding of GTP to specific GTPases. Although many exchange factors act on more than one Rho protein in vitro (8Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), it is possible that some may be more selective in vivo or that more specific exchange factors may be found. The present data suggest that a specific signal is required to promote the translocation of a given GTPase to the membranes, but it is not clear if activation of the GTPase occurs in the cytosol or the membrane. The selectivity of the agonists (LPA and PDGF) for certain Rho proteins and different membrane fractions raises the possibility that the different membranes have specific targets for the GTPases and that their translocation is a critical component of the signaling processes.

Toward understanding how these trafficking events are regulated, we examined a series of receptor mutants.

A truncation mutant that lacked most of the cytoplasmic tail also signaled robustly, lacked phosphorylation, and was defective in agonist-triggered internalization. However, in contrast to the specific phosphorylation site mutant, the truncation mutant did not display tonic cycling and localized exclusively to the cell surface. An analysis of a series of truncation mutants localized residues important for receptor trafficking to a 10-amino acid stretch in its cytoplasmic tail.

Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). There are large unexplained species differences in sensitivity to TCDD toxicity that cannot be attributed to differences in Ah receptor concentration or binding affinity and seem to involve factors downstream of the Ah receptor (1Okey A.B. Riddick D.S. Harper P.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). Ligand activation of the Ah receptor in mammalian liver induces expression of CYP1A1 and −1A2 and the more recently discovered CYP1B1 (3Sutter T.R. Tang Y.M. Hayes C.L. Wo Y.-Y.P. Jabs E.W. Li X. Yin H. Cody C.W. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13092-13099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes exhibit differences in substrate specificity, regulation, and tissue distribution. Because single amino acid differences can change CYP catalytic activity (4Lindberg R.L.P. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 339: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), species differences in CYP1 structure and function may contribute to differences in sensitivity to TCDD toxicity.The chicken and chick embryo close to hatching are among the more sensitive species to TCDD toxicity. They have long served as models for the study of Ah receptor-mediated toxicity and changes in heme and hemoprotein synthesis (2Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar), but the chick TCDD-induced CYP enzymes have only been partially characterized. We have identified and purified two catalytically distinct TCDD-induced chick embryo liver CYP enzymes with nearly identical molecular weights (5Rifkind A.B. Kanetoshi A. Orlinick J. Capdevila J.H. Lee C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3387-3396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One, designated TCDDAHH, was selectively active in classic CYP1A1-mediated mixed function oxidations, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and 7-ethoxyresorufin deethylase. The other, TCDDAA, was active in epoxygenation of the endogenous fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) and lacked AHH or 7-ethoxyresorufin deethylase activity. As TCDDAA was also preferentially active in some CYP1A2-selective activities, i.e. uroporphyrinogen decarboxylation 2Sinclair, P. R., Gorman, N., Walton, H. S., Sinclair, J. F., Bentivegna, C.

Kanetoshi A. Orlinick J. Capdevila J.H. Lee C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3387-3396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seemed that TCDDAA and TCDDAHH might be orthologous to mammalian CYP1A2 and −1A1, respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONImmunoscreening identified three partial clones as TCDDAA and two as TCDDAHH (Fig. 1). Rescreening of the library (6Strauss W.J. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston D. Moore J.G. Seidman J. Smith S. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY1994: 6.3.1-6.3.3Google Scholar) with a 812-bp probe (full clone 8) and a 265-bp EcoRI/SphI fragment from clone 4 produced two 1.9-kb clones (clones 10 and 2B). Both contained the N-terminal amino acid sequence found for the purified TCDDAA protein (5Rifkind A.B. Kanetoshi A. Orlinick J. Capdevila J.H. Lee C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3387-3396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full coding sequence of TCDDAHH was obtained by RT-PCR and 5′-RACE. It contained the N-terminal amino acids found for the purified protein (5Rifkind A.B. Kanetoshi A. Orlinick J. Capdevila J.H. Lee C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3387-3396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) plus the initial methionine.The TCDDAA cDNA (Fig. 2) contained a 5′-UTR of 147 bp, an open reading frame of 1584 bp coding for 528 amino acids, and a 3′-UTR of 107 bp. The TCDDAHH cDNA (Fig. 3) contained 71 bp of 5′-UTR sequence, 1590 bp coding for 530 amino acids, and a 3′-UTR of 425 bp. Both enzymes contained the characteristic heme binding motif (15Black S.D. Coon M.J. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. vol. 60. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY1987: 35-87Google Scholar) underlined in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. Their distributions of basic, acidic, and hydrophobic amino acids were consistent with the distribution in other CYP enzymes (15Black S.D. Coon M.J. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. vol. 60. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY1987: 35-87Google Scholar) (64, 63, and 182, respectively, for TCDDAA and 60, 56, and 188 for TCDDAHH). The N-terminal amino acid sequences for both contained the typical hydrophobic signal sequence that anchors P450 in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, followed by a halt-transfer signal containing several positively charged amino acids (15Black S.D. Coon M.J. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. vol. 60. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY1987: 35-87Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequences extending to the halt-transfer signals were longer for the chick than for the mammalian or fish CYP1 enzymes, suggesting that the chick enzymes have a longer segment inserted in the membrane or a part that is free in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The two cDNAs have dissimilar 3′- and 5′-UTRs and 80% DNA sequence and 78% amino acid identities in their coding regions. A partial sequence reported by Murti et al. (16Murti J.R. Adiga P.R. Padmanaban G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) resembles TCDDAA but lacks the canonical heme binding region and several other CYP1A consensus sites.Fig. 3cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence for chick TCDDAHH. The same features are highlighted as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TCDDAA was found to have several potential secondary modification sites not present in TCDDAHH or the other CYP1 proteins listed in Table I. These include an N-linked glycosylation site (NFSI, amino acids 153-156 (all numbering is based on the sequence for TCDDAA in Fig. 4)), a cAMP/cGMP protein kinase phosphorylation site (KRFS, amino acids 520-523), a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (KQSDPYRY, amino acids 190-198), a protein kinase C phosphorylation site (SMK, amino acids 523-525), three casein II phosphorylation sites (SVLE, amino acids 60-63; TAVE, amino acids 273-276; and SIQD, amino acids 491-494), and an amidation site (DGKK, amino acids 494-497). TCDDAHH had a protein kinase C phosphorylation site (SFK, amino acids 435-437) and a casein II phosphorylation site (SRTE, amino acids 450-453) not present in TCDDAA. These findings suggest that TCDDAA and to a lesser extent TCDDAHH have the potential to undergo several posttranslational modifications distinct from each other. Protein kinase C and casein II phosphorylation sites, amidation sites, and N-myristylation sites were also found that were common to both TCDDAA and TCDDAHH. Some but not all of those were also present in other CYP1 enzymes. Both chick enzymes, but not the mammalian or fish CYP1A enzymes, also contained a 10-amino acid sequence identified as a prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site (IAASPTASSSC, amino acids 156-166).Table IPercent amino acid identities between TCDDAA and TCDDAHH and other CYP enzymesPercent identityTCDDAATCDDAHHMammalian CYP1A1Human6159Mouse6359Hamster6058Rabbit6159Rat6260Guinea pig6158Mammalian CYP1A2Human6155Mouse5753Hamster5753Rabbit5853Rat5753Guinea pig5956Fish CYP1APlaice5553Scup5855Toadfish5555Trout5655Mammalian CYP1BHuman3433Rat3534Mammalian CYP2Rat 2A12527Rat 2B12829Rabbit 2C32525Rat 2E12526ChickenCYP2H12527CYP2H22527CYP172928 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Multiple sequence alignments for TCDDAA and TCDDAHH, human, rat, and rabbit CYP1A1 and −1A2, and two fish CYP1A enzymes.

Those values meet the criteria for inclusion in the CYP1A family (46% or greater similarity for amino acid sequences of different species to be included in the same family) (17Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Table I, both chick enzymes were more similar to CYP1A1 than CYP1A2. Moreover, even though TCDDAA is enzymatically and immunologically more like −1A2 and TCDDAHH is enzymatically more like CYP1A1, the amino acid sequence of TCDDAA is more like that of CYP1A1 than is the sequence of TCDDAHH. Thus, neither TCDDAHH nor TCDDAA can be said to be directly orthologous to CYP1A1 or −1A2.There is other evidence for differences between chick TCDDAA and TCDDAHH and mammalian CYP1A2 and −1A1. 1) Whereas CYP1A2 and −1A1 iron are found in high and low spin states, respectively, both TCDDAA and TCDDAHH are low spin (18Nakai K.

Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For these reasons, and because one of the two trout enzymes has been designated “CYP1A3” (17Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C.

Rather, the two chick enzymes formed a separate branch between the fish and mammalian CYP1A sequences. Identification of the chick sequences, therefore, adds a new branch to the CYP1A phylogenetic tree (22Morrison H.G. Oleksiak M.F. Cornell N.W. Sogin M.L. Stegeman J.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and demonstrates that the chick CYP1A enzymes are a separate lineage.Fig. 5Phylogenetic tree for the CYP1A family enzymes.

Chen T.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) indicate that CYP1A1 and −1A2 split after land animals diverged from fish about 400 million years ago (24Carroll R.L. Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution. W. H. Freeman and Co., NY1988Google Scholar). Our data further imply that 1) the earliest land animals in the common ancient reptilian/mammal/bird line, did not contain a CYP1A2 or a TCDDAA precursor distinct from CYP1A1, and 2) mammalian CYP1A1 and −1A2 and chick TCDDAHH and TCDDAA each split after precursors of modern mammals branched from that line about 300 million years ago (24Carroll R.L. Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution. W. H. Freeman and Co., NY1988Google Scholar). Thus, these findings advance the time of the split of mammalian −1A1 and −1A2 by about 100 million years. More precise timing will require data on CYP1A enzymes in earlier evolving mammals and other avian orders. The evidence that amino acid identities are lower for CYP1A1 and −1A2 (66%, mean for the six species compared in Table I) than for TCDDAA and TCDDAHH (78%) suggests that the two TCDD-induced mammalian enzymes are more divergent than the two chick enzymes.The amino acid sites that differ for CYP1A1 and −1A2 are principally contained in a sequence of about 127 amino acids (amino acids 197-323 in Fig. 4). That region contains 13 sites where fish and chick CYP1As are conserved with mammalian CYP1A1 but none with −1A2, suggesting that the ancestral CYP1A progenitors were more −1A1- than −1A2-like (see also Ref. 22Morrison H.G. Oleksiak M.F. Cornell N.W. Sogin M.L. Stegeman J.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). That is supported by evidence that fish CYP1A (21Stegeman J.J. Smolowitz R.M. Hahn M.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1991; 110: 486-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), mammalian CYP1A1 (25Dees J.H. Masters B.S.S. Muller-Eberhard U. Johnson E.F. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1423-1432PubMed Google Scholar) and TCDDAHH4 but not mammalian −1A2 or TCDDAA are all expressed in vascular endothelial cells as well as liver. The 127-amino acid region also includes 11 sites selectively shared by TCDDAA and −1A2 but only three by TCDDAHH and −1A2. One or more of the former may contribute to the −1A2-like activity of TCDDAA. TCDDAA, however, lacks the CYP1A2-specific immunologic epitope (amino acids 291-298 in Fig. 4) (26Edwards R.J. Murray B.P. Singleton A.M. Murray S. Davies D.S. Boobis A.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, another region must account for the selective immunologic cross-reactivity of immunopurified anti-TCDDAA serum to TCDDAA and rat CYP1A2 (5Rifkind A.B. Kanetoshi A. Orlinick J. Capdevila J.H. Lee C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3387-3396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).On Northern analysis (Fig. 6A) mRNA from TCDD-treated but not control embryos contained single transcripts of approximately 1.9 kb for TCDDAA in liver and kidney but not heart and single transcripts of 2.3 kb for TCDDAHH in liver, kidney, and heart, consistent with the tissue-specific expression of the CYP enzyme proteins (5Rifkind A.B. Kanetoshi A. Orlinick J. Capdevila J.H. Lee C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3387-3396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The findings demonstrate definitively that TCDD induces two distinct chick CYP1A genes. They also provide additional evidence for differences between the chick enzymes and CYP1A1 and −1A2 because −1A2 is expressed only in liver and is found constitutively as well as in the induced state.Fig. 6A, Northern analysis of TCDDAA, TCDDAHH, and actin mRNA in liver, heart, and kidney of 17-day-old chick embryos 16 h after treatment with 1 nmol of TCDD (+) or solvent alone (−) (0.005 ml of dioxane).

From the top panel it is also seen that liver glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was increased by TCDD treatment in livers of the 17-day-old chick embryos, as has been reported in human keratinocytes exposed to TCDD (27McNulty S.E. Toscano Jr., W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TCDDAHH (upper middle panel) was induced in 48-h-old embryos 24 h after TCDD treatment, and the induction was increased in the 72-h-old embryos. TCDDAA (lower middle panel) was expressed in the controls at the earliest time examined (28 h of development), suggesting that there is constitutive expression of this gene in the early embryo. The expression of TCDDAA was increased by TCDD in the 36-h-old embryos 12 h after treatment and further increased at 48-72 h of development. AHH induction has been reported in 5-day-old chick embryos (28Hamilton J.W. Denison M.S. Bloom S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3372-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that there is a functional Ah receptor in the developing chicken 3-4 days earlier than previously recognized.In situ hybridization studies in 72-h-old embryos 48 h after TCDD treatment (Fig. 6C) showed that mRNAs for both enzymes are expressed in the areas of gut epithelium that later develop into liver. Sense probes did not hybridize (data not shown). Both antisense probes were negative for the solvent-treated controls and positive for the TCDD-treated embryos. TCDDAHH but not TCDDAA was expressed in the dorsal aorta and other vascular endothelial cells and in endocardium. TCDDAA but not TCDDAHH was expressed in the mesonephric duct, which gives rise to the kidney. The localization of TCDDAHH in vascular endothelium further suggests that TCDD may have widespread effects via its expression in blood vessels.Our evidence that mammalian and chick CYP1A enzymes branched into two functionally analogous pairs of enzymes independently suggests that the split in both cases may have responded to similar evolutionary pressures. That, together with the evidence that both chick enzymes are expressed very early in development, suggests that CYP1A enzymes have functions beyond their harmful actions as activators of carcinogens, perhaps providing a defense against environmental pollutants. For example, with respect to known activities of these enzymes, increased estradiol-2-hydroxylation may help to maintain tissue estrogen levels. Increased arachidonic acid epoxygenase activity (which occurs for TCDDAA and some but not all CYP1A2 enzymes (29Rifkind A.B. Lee C. Chang T.K.H. Waxman D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar)) may help to maintain calcium, fluid, and hormonal homeostasis (30Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). High activity of CYP1A1 for metabolism of growth-modulating retinoids has recently been shown (31Raner G.M. Vaz D.N. Coon M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar).The common view of CYP1A1 and −1A2 as injurious has not succeeded in explaining the role of these enzymes in TCDD toxicity. Thus, the carcinogenic effect of TCDD does not involve metabolic activation of TCDD by CYP1A enzymes (1Okey A.B. Riddick D.S. Harper P.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). There are large unexplained species differences in sensitivity to TCDD toxicity that cannot be attributed to differences in Ah receptor concentration or binding affinity and seem to involve factors downstream of the Ah receptor (1Okey A.B. Riddick D.S. Harper P.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). Ligand activation of the Ah receptor in mammalian liver induces expression of CYP1A1 and −1A2 and the more recently discovered CYP1B1 (3Sutter T.R. Tang Y.M. Hayes C.L. Wo Y.-Y.P. Jabs E.W. Li X. Yin H. Cody C.W. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13092-13099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes exhibit differences in substrate specificity, regulation, and tissue distribution. Because single amino acid differences can change CYP catalytic activity (4Lindberg R.L.P. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 339: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), species differences in CYP1 structure and function may contribute to differences in sensitivity to TCDD toxicity.The chicken and chick embryo close to hatching are among the more sensitive species to TCDD toxicity. They have long served as models for the study of Ah receptor-mediated toxicity and changes in heme and hemoprotein synthesis (2Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Employing purified forms of Escherichia coli-expressed prSSU, mature small subunit, glutathione S-transferase-transit peptide fusion protein, and SS-tp in dye release studies demonstrated that lipid interaction is mediated primarily through the transit peptide. Using chemically synthesized peptides (20-mers), the lipid-interacting domain of the transit peptide was partially mapped to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of the transit peptide. Peptides corresponding to other regions of the transit peptide and control peptides promoted significantly less calcein release. Interaction between the transit peptide and the bilayer was very rapid and could not be resolved by stopped-flow fluorometry with a mixing time of <50 ms. Interaction between the peptides and bilayer was also lipid class-dependent. Disruption occurred only when the bilayer contained the galactolipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). The extent of bilayer disruption directly correlated with the relative concentration of MGDG in the liposome, with maximum calcein release occurring in 20 mol % MGDG liposomes. Lipid bilayers with greater than 20 mol % MGDG could not be achieved as determined by calcein entrapment. Electron microscopy of the liposomes before and after addition of the transit peptide suggested that the transit peptide induced a dramatic reorganization of lipids.

https://openalex.org/W2107427363,"Ran, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is a necessary component in the active transport of proteins through nuclear pores. Disruption of Ran function affects the regulation of mitosis, DNA synthesis, and RNA processing and export. To explore the mechanisms of Ran function, mutants of the Ran GTPase were characterized, several of which are capable of dominantly interfering with nuclear protein import. Unlike wild-type Ran, the putative gain-of-function mutant (G19V Ran) was not sensitive to the exchange factor, RCC1. In addition the G19V Ran and effector domain mutants (L43E and E46G Ran) were not sensitive to the GTPase-activating protein, Fug1. Epitope-tagged G19V Ran and L43E Ran isolated from transfected BHK21 cells were each about 50% GTP-bound, whereas the wild-type and a C-terminal deletion mutant (Δ-DE Ran) were primarily bound to GDP. While G19V Ran interacted with known Ran-binding proteins and with an isolated Ran-binding domain, the T24N Ran did not, and binding by L43E Ran was substantially reduced. Wild-type HA1-tagged Ran expressed in BHK21 cells was nuclear, whereas the G19V, T24N, L43E, and E46G forms of Ran were predominantly localized at the nuclear envelope, and Δ-DE Ran was primarily cytosolic. Similar results were observed when permeabilized BHK21 cells were incubated with extracts of COS cells expressing the mutants. Thus mutations that affect the interaction of Ran with regulatory proteins and effectors can disrupt the normal subcellular localization of Ran, lending support for the current model of Ran-mediated nuclear import.

In addition the G19V Ran and effector domain mutants (L43E and E46G Ran) were not sensitive to the GTPase-activating protein, Fug1. Epitope-tagged G19V Ran and L43E Ran isolated from transfected BHK21 cells were each about 50% GTP-bound, whereas the wild-type and a C-terminal deletion mutant (Δ-DE Ran) were primarily bound to GDP. While G19V Ran interacted with known Ran-binding proteins and with an isolated Ran-binding domain, the T24N Ran did not, and binding by L43E Ran was substantially reduced. Wild-type HA1-tagged Ran expressed in BHK21 cells was nuclear, whereas the G19V, T24N, L43E, and E46G forms of Ran were predominantly localized at the nuclear envelope, and Δ-DE Ran was primarily cytosolic. Similar results were observed when permeabilized BHK21 cells were incubated with extracts of COS cells expressing the mutants. Thus mutations that affect the interaction of Ran with regulatory proteins and effectors can disrupt the normal subcellular localization of Ran, lending support for the current model of Ran-mediated nuclear import. INTRODUCTIONRan/TC4 is a 25-kDa protein belonging to the Ras superfamily of GTPases and is highly conserved among all eukaryotes (1Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).A family of proteins has been described that interacts with Ran in the GTP-bound state and inhibits GTP release (9Lounsbury K.M. Beddow A.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11285-11290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these Ran-binding proteins (RanBPs) have been identified. One is a 29-kDa cytosolic protein referred to as HTF9A/RanBP1 (10Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and another is a 350-kDa protein localized at the nuclear membrane termed Nup350 or RanBP2 (11Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D.

Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Alignment of these and other similar proteins has revealed a 135-amino acid residue Ran-binding domain (RanBD), which is necessary and sufficient for binding to Ran (13Beddow A.L. Richards S.A. Orem N.R. Macara I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, Ran can associate, through a different type of domain, with the β-subunit of the nuclear cargo receptor, β-karyopherin/β-importin/p97 (14Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The interaction of Ran with β-karyopherin is not inhibited by the RanBD, suggesting that Ran may interact with a complex of nuclear transport proteins including a RanBP and β-karyopherin (15Lounsbury K.M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 17Nehrbass H. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).The Ran GTPase has been shown to be necessary for the in vitro nuclear import and export of synthetic karyophiles possessing nuclear localization signals (NLSs) (for review, see Refs. 14Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and 18Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that several mutants of Ran can dominantly interfere with the dexamethasone-stimulated nuclear import of glucocorticoid receptors expressed in BHK21 cells (19Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A putative gain-of-function mutant (G19V Ran), a loss-of-function mutant (T24N Ran), and a C-terminal deletion mutant (Δ-DE Ran) all inhibited protein nuclear import. However, an effector domain mutant, L43E Ran, had no effect on import, yet was markedly toxic to cell growth. Ran, therefore, possesses an essential function, dominantly inhibited by the L43E Ran mutant, that is independent of nuclear protein import. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these cell biological effects, it was essential to characterize the Ran mutants biochemically. The present study describes the subcellular distribution of the mutants and their interactions with known regulatory factors.DISCUSSIONThese results demonstrate that the interaction of Ran with effectors and regulatory proteins is sensitive to mutations in distinct regions of the GTPase structure. They demonstrate also that the subcellular distribution of Ran is determined by the nucleotide state of the protein and by its ability to bind specific RanBPs. Mutants that cannot cycle between the GDP- and GTP-bound states accumulate at the nuclear envelope and support a model for Ran function in which nuclear protein import and shuttling between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments is coupled to the GTP-GDP cycle. This model is reminiscent of that for the shuttling of Rab proteins such as Sec4p between the cytosol and vesicle membranes (34Novick P. Ciba Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 218-228PubMed Google Scholar).The biochemical characterization of Ran mutants reveals differences between the interactions of Ran with regulatory factors versus those of other GTPases such as Ras or Rab3A. Unlike G12V Ras, which remains sensitive to Ras exchange factors (35McGrath J.P. Capon D.J. Goeddel D.V. Levinson A.D. Nature. 1984; 310: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), G19V Ran was insensitive to RCC1-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange. Nonetheless, G19V Ran isolated from transfected cells possessed a much higher GTP:GDP ratio than did wild-type Ran, suggesting that G19V Ran is an activating mutation. This result is important in light of the fact that G19V Ran is a dominant interfering mutant of nuclear protein import (19Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The ability of G19V Ran to accumulate in the GTP-bound state despite insensitivity to RCC1 may be a consequence of the high GTP:GDP ratio in the cell, and of the low endogenous GTPase activity of the G19V mutant.The analysis of the dominant-negative mutation of Ran (T24N) supports and confirms results from other laboratories (28Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Like T17N Ras, T24N Ran binds nucleotide poorly and likely for this reason is unable to interact stably with either class of RanBPs.The effector regions of Ran are not yet defined. Effector domain mutants of other small GTPases, such as Ras and Rab3A, have been valuable in distinguishing the contributions of multiple regulators and downstream effectors to their cellular functions. Given the overall similarity between the structures of Ras and Ran (36Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 37Scheffzek K. Klebe C. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 374: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the amino acid residues of Ran corresponding to the Switch 1 domain of Ras are likely to be involved in effector interactions. Mutation of Ran at residue 43 (L43E Ran) is analogous to Ile-36 effector domain mutants of Ras (25Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and the V55E mutants in Rab3A, while the E46G mutation is analogous to a D58V mutation in the Rab3A effector domain, described previously (29Burstein E.S. Brondyk W.H. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22715-22718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ran L43E Ran mutant was insensitive to GTP hydrolysis stimulated by recombinant Fug1, the murine homolog of RanGAP (Fig. 1) (6DeGregori J. Russ A. von Melchner H. Rayburn H. Priyaranjan P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Unlike the Rab3A V55E, however, L43E Ran was sensitive to nucleotide exchange stimulated by RCC1, and a significant fraction of this mutant was GTP-bound when isolated from intact cells. The biochemical properties of both L43E Ran and E46G Ran were similar to the D58V mutation in Rab3A, suggesting that residues necessary for interactions at the Ran effector domain differ slightly in function from those at the Rab3A effector domain. The L43E Ran mutation also disrupted binding to RanBPs and β-karyopherin. This defect may account for the inability of L43E Ran to dominantly interfere with nuclear protein import despite the fact that it is trapped in the GTP-bound state within the cell (19Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Together, these results suggest the existence of multiple effector domains on Ran, a situation analogous to that of the Rac/Rho GTPase family (38Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Association of Ran with RanBDs appears to be mediated, at least in part, through a region adjacent to and probably including β2 effector region of Ran. The region on Ran that interacts with β-karyopherin must, however, be distinct from the RanBD binding site; this region is exposed either by removal of the C terminus of Ran or by association of GTP-Ran with a RanBD (15Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The surface of Ran that interacts with the RanBD must also be distinct from that for RCC1 binding, because these two factors can also form a ternary complex with Ran (21Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Dasso M. Seki T. Azuma Y. Ohba T. Nishimoto T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10658-10663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the Leu-43 mutation that interferes with RanBD binding does not reduce the sensitivity of Ran to RCC1-catalyzed exchange. Finally, RanBDs must also be capable of forming ternary complexes with Ran and RanGAP because RanBDs act as co-stimulators of GTP hydrolysis on Ran in the presence of RanGAP (13Beddow A.L. Richards S.A. Orem N.R. Macara I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 40Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The subcellular locations of the Ran mutants discussed in this report differ in significant aspects from those described by others. For example Ren et al. (26Ren M. Coutavas E. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4216-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) found that a G19V/Q69L mutant of Ran exhibited a predominantly nuclear localization when overexpressed in 293 Tag cells, and in budding yeast a GST fusion of G21V GSP1p (the yeast homolog of Ran; Ref. 1Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was also nuclear (42Schlenstedt G. Saavedra C. Loeb J.D. Cole C.N. Silver P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that G19V Ran associates with the nuclear envelope when expressed as an HA1-tagged protein in BHK21 cells; however, some nuclear accumulation is evident for G19V in an in vitro assay. The cause for the nuclear pore localization in transfected cells may thus be due to the inability of G19V Ran to exit the nucleus. G19V Ran is predominantly GTP-bound in cells, so it is likely that the binding at the nuclear envelope is due to interaction with the RanBDs of RanBP2, a component of the nuclear pore complex (11Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14209-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 12Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T. Nishii K. Kuma K. Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Our observations are supported by in vitro analysis of the interaction of Ran bound to a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP with a nuclear pore complex (43Melchior F. Guan T. Yokoyama N. Nishimoto T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Wild-type HA1-Ran is nuclear, as is endogenous Ran (3Ren M. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the abnormal localization of the G19V mutant is not mediated by the epitope tag. The level of heterologously expressed HA1-Ran proteins is only 1.7-fold higher than the level of endogenous Ran in transfected BHK21 cells (19Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore the cells are not burdened by massive overexpression (>10-fold over endogenous levels) as occurs in 293 Tag cells when expression is driven from autonomously replicating plasmids (26Ren M. Coutavas E. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4216-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is likely that the observed subcellular distributions of the HA1-tagged Ran mutants identify physiologically meaningful states of the Ran nuclear transport cycle. On the other hand, the attachment of large epitopes such as GST or green fluorescent protein to Ran results in ATP-independent nuclear accumulation of Ran in vitro and in the nuclear accumulation of Ran in transfected cells, irrespective of the type of Ran mutant employed. These observations suggest that such large fusion proteins are inappropriate for studies of the subcellular localization of Ran.The localization of the HA1-tagged L43E and E46G Ran mutants were similar to that of G19V Ran. Although a large fraction of L43E Ran in the intact cell is likely to be GTP-bound, we could not detect a stable interaction of this mutant with RanBPs in the overlay assay. It remains unclear at present, therefore, whether L43E or E46G Ran associates with RanBP2 in the nuclear pore, or becomes trapped in the pore by interaction with other components of the transport machinery. Because little L43E or E46G Ran enters the nucleus during in vitro import, it is possible that, unlike G19V, L43E Ran cannot enter the nucleus. The location of L43E Ran in the nuclear pore was unexpected as it shows no dominant interference in nuclear protein import (19Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Possibly weak interaction with RanBP2 allows association of L43E Ran with the nuclear pore yet reduces its inhibitory potency.Contrary to expectations, the T24N Ran mutant was also distributed partially at the nuclear membrane, although with significant accumulation in the nucleoplasm. Because T24N Ran does not interact in vitro with RanBP2, which is localized at the nuclear pore, other components of the nuclear pore may exist that can interact with Ran in the GDP-bound state. One candidate protein for the T24N Ran-binding protein is p10/NTF2 (43Melchior F. Guan T. Yokoyama N. Nishimoto T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that Ran in the GDP-bound state can form a complex with p10, NLS receptor, and nucleoporin is consistent with this idea (17Nehrbass H. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). T24N Ran can potently inhibit nuclear protein import in vivo (19Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), an effect that may be a consequence of the interaction of T24N Ran with this complex.Deletion of the C terminus of Ran resulted in a predominantly cytosolic distribution of the protein. Ren et al. (26Ren M. Coutavas E. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4216-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have reported previously that Δ-DE Ran, when expressed in 293 Tag cells, is nuclear. We believe that this difference, as with the G19V Ran results, may be a consequence of the very high levels of heterologous protein expression in the 293 Tag cells. The localization of Δ-DE Ran is consistent with our recent discovery that this mutant interacts efficiently with the cytoplasmic protein β-karyopherin/β-importin, a component of the NLS receptor (15Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Such an interaction may account for the dominant inhibition of nuclear protein import by Δ-DE Ran in intact cells (19Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Taken together, these results argue that Ran can interact with nuclear pore complexes that are in different states, and which may represent different steps in the nuclear transport mechanism. This hypothesis is consistent with the model described recently by Nehrbass and Blobel (17Nehrbass H. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), in which transient complexes assemble and disassemble within the nuclear pore in a process coupled to the Ran GTP/GDP cycle. Ran·GDP forms a complex with p10, α- and β-karyopherin/importin, nuclear cargo, and nucleoporins. We predict that the T24N Ran inhibits nuclear protein import by stabilizing this complex, preventing nucleotide exchange-coupled disassembly. The G19V Ran mutant may stabilize a Ran·GTP-β-karyopherin-RanBP2 complex and block further cycling. The possibility that the different Ran mutants described above can trap the nuclear pore complex machinery at different steps in the transport process suggests that they may provide useful tools to test the validity of models for Ran-mediated functions in intact cells.

In addition, Ran can associate, through a different type of domain, with the β-subunit of the nuclear cargo receptor, β-karyopherin/β-importin/p97 (14Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin.

The interaction of Ran with β-karyopherin is not inhibited by the RanBD, suggesting that Ran may interact with a complex of nuclear transport proteins including a RanBP and β-karyopherin (15Lounsbury K.M.

A putative gain-of-function mutant (G19V Ran), a loss-of-function mutant (T24N Ran), and a C-terminal deletion mutant (Δ-DE Ran) all inhibited protein nuclear import. However, an effector domain mutant, L43E Ran, had no effect on import, yet was markedly toxic to cell growth. Ran, therefore, possesses an essential function, dominantly inhibited by the L43E Ran mutant, that is independent of nuclear protein import. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these cell biological effects, it was essential to characterize the Ran mutants biochemically.

Here, we investigated the involvement of redox regulation in the nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling pathway and neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which acts as a reductant in cells both by its direct reducing activity and by increasing the synthesis of the cellular antioxidant glutathione, inhibited neuronal differentiation induced by NGF or by the expression of oncogenic ras in PC12 cells. NAC suppressed NGF-induced c-fos gene expression and AP-1 activation. These results suggest that neuronal differentiation and NGF signaling are subject to regulation by the cellular redox state. NAC also suppressed the NGF-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and decreased the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPKs. The suppression of MAPK by NAC was independent of glutathione synthesis. In parallel with the suppression of MAPK, the activation of MAPK kinase kinase activity was also suppressed in the presence of NAC. In contrast, NGF-induced activation of Ras was not inhibited by NAC. The inhibitory effect of NAC on the MAPK cascade was independent of transcription and translation. Thus, NAC suppresses NGF-induced neuronal differentiation by uncoupling the signal transduction from Ras to the MAP kinase cascade in PC12 cells.

FKBP59 and FKBP12 belong to the large family of immunophilins that bind the macrolide immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to isolate target proteins that interact with the immunosuppressant drug binding domain of the rabbit FKBP59. The cDNA for an as yet unidentified protein was isolated and cloned from a Jurkat cell library. The cDNA sequence of 1804 base pairs reveals an open reading frame of 417 amino acids. In vitro experiments suggest a direct interaction between FKBP59 and this new target protein. This specific association seems to be restricted to the FKBP family, since it also occurs both in vivo and in vitro with FKBP12 but not with cyclophilin 40. This novel protein was named FKBP-associated protein (FAP48). The formation of the complexes between FKBP59 or FKBP12 and FAP48 is prevented by FK506 and rapamycin in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that FAP48 shares or overlaps the macrolide binding site on FKBP59 as well as on FKBP12 and therefore may represent a natural common ligand of these immunosuppressant drug receptors."

The rod photoreceptor CNG channel has been most extensively studied in both native rod outer segment (ROS) membranes and heterologous cell expression systems. It consists of two homologous subunits, generally referred to as the α- and β-subunits, which assemble into a hetero-oligomeric membrane protein complex. The cDNA for the bovine and human α-subunit encodes an 80-kDa polypeptide that forms a functional homo-oligomeric channel when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells (7Kaupp U.B. Niidome T.

The β-subunit also contains a binding site for calmodulin (13Chen T.-Y. Illing M. Molday L.L. Hsu Y.-T. Yau K.-W. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Instead, a polypeptide of approximately 220-kDa is labeled by a β-subunit-specific antibody by Western blots (13Chen T.-Y. Illing M. Molday L.L. Hsu Y.-T. Yau K.-W. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genomics. 1995; 28: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have cloned a cDNA from a human retinal library that encodes a truncated homolog of the bovine GARP protein. On the basis of its similarity to the GARP component of the bovine rod β-subunit, this protein has been suggested to be a third or γ-subunit of the human rod CNG channel. Since no evidence was presented to show that this polypeptide is associated with the human rod channel, questions remain whether this truncated GARP protein is, in fact, a true subunit of the human rod CNG channel.In order to resolve the uncertainties surrounding the subunit composition of the human rod CNG channel and, in particular the primary structure of the β-subunit, we have cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA for the human β-subunit. In this paper we show that the human rod CNG β-subunit, like the bovine subunit, has a bipartite structure with a GARP component comprising the N-terminal part of this subunit. Two other GARP variants, which are not subunits of the channel, have also been cloned and found to be expressed specifically in outer segments of rod photoreceptors.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have cloned and expressed the full-length β-subunit of the human rod CNG channel. Evidence for this is based on the following observations: 1) this polypeptide when expressed in COS-1 cells co-migrates with the 220-kDa polypeptide (β-subunit) found in immunoaffinity purified channel preparations from human ROS; 2) it binds both N-terminal and C-terminal anti-β-subunit-specific antibodies; and 3) the full-length human β-subunit has structural features found for the bovine rod β-subunit. These results clarify several unresolved issues surrounding the β-subunit of the human rod CNG channel. In particular the hRCNC2a and hRCNC2b clones, which were first reported by Chen et al. (12Chen T.-Y. Peng Y.-W. Dhallan R.S. Ahamed B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1993; 362: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) to code for the second subunit of the rod CNG channel, are most likely either incomplete clones or alternatively spliced forms of the β-subunit that are expressed in low abundance in the retina. This is based on the finding that although the polypeptides encoded by these subunit 2 clones assemble into functional “native-like” channels when coexpressed with the human rod α-subunit in HEK 293 cells, they have significantly lower apparent Mr than the human β-subunit cloned in this study and found in ROS (13Chen T.-Y.

These variants are identical in sequence to the β′-part of the bovine rod channel, but have N-terminal extensions of ~105 amino acids corresponding to the C-terminal region of GARP. It is possible, therefore, that the human subunit 2b variant is an analogous spliced variant of the human β-subunit, perhaps expressed in another retinal cell. The report of Ardell et al. (16Ardell M.D. Makhija A.K. Oliveira L. Miniou P. Viegas-Péquignot E. Pittler S.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) indicating that a human glutamic acid-rich protein is a third or γ-subunit of the human rod CNG channel is somewhat misleading. Although this GARP component is translated as the N-terminal 291 amino acids of the full-length β-subunit, in its free form, it is not associated with the purified rod CNG channel complex. Accordingly, it cannot be defined as a third subunit of the channel.The full-length β-subunit of the human rod CNG channel, like its bovine counterpart, has a bipartite structure. The C-terminal part contains the previously cloned human rod CNG subunit 2 and exhibits the structural features of other CNG channel subunits including the six predicted transmembrane segments, a voltage-sensor motif, and a pore region. This part of the β-subunit also contains the calmodulin binding site that modulates the apparent affinity of the channel for cGMP (11Körschen H.G. Illing M. Seifert R. Sesti F. Williams A. Gotzes S.

Most, if not all, of the information required for channel activity is contained within this part of the subunit, since the functional properties of the native rod CNG channel are reproduced when this part of the β-subunit is co-expressed with the α-subunit (11Körschen H.G.

Sequence comparisons indicate that the GARP part of the β-subunit can be further subdivided into two regions. The N-terminal 291 amino acids of the human and bovine homologs are most similar, being ~60% identical in sequence and corresponding to the truncated GARP forms expressed as individual polypeptides in ROS. This region has a relatively high glutamic acid content of ~13%, but interestingly, it has an even higher content of proline residues of ~15-17%. To date related proteins have not been found in the Protein Data Bases. The C-terminal regions of the human and bovine f-GARP that contain a stretch of glutamic acid residues is less highly conserved between human and bovine proteins. In fact two repetitive regions found in the bovine sequence are not present in the human sequence.The role of GARP in ROS is not known at the present time. However, since the GARP part does not appear to affect the electrophysiological properties of the channel (11Körschen H.G. Illing M. Seifert R. Sesti F. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Müller F.

Recent studies have indicated that the β-subunit of CNG channels in other tissues is shorter in length than the complete β-subunit of the rod channel and contains only the C-terminal segment of GARP (22Biel M. Zong X. Ludwig A. Sautter A. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6349-6355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is possible that this short segment may also be involved in interaction of the channel with cell-specific proteins.GARP, in addition to being a component of the β-subunit of the rod CNG channel, is also expressed in two alternatively spliced forms referred to here as free GARP or f-GARP and truncated GARP or t-GARP. These two variants cloned from a bovine retinal cDNA library are identical to the corresponding GARP sequences of the bovine rod β-subunit except for the addition of short C-terminal segments of 19 and 8 amino acids for f-GARP and t-GARP, respectively. Immunochemical labeling studies indicate that these variants are specifically expressed in ROS as soluble or peripheral membrane proteins but are not associated with the purified rod CNG channel. The t-GARP variant appears to be the more abundantly expressed form based on Western blot analysis of ROS described here and Northern blot analysis of retina mRNA previously reported (11Körschen H.G. Illing M. Seifert R. Sesti F. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Müller F. Dosé A. Godde M. Molday L. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cloning and expression studies indicate that the t-GARP homolog is also present in human ROS. A third GARP component in human ROS corresponding to the human f-GARP is also likely to exist based on the existence of a 120-kDa polypeptide by Western blot analysis. Rat ROS also contain these three GARP components indicating that the GARP component of the rod β-subunit and the two expressed GARP variants are common to mammalian rod photoreceptors.In summary the studies reported here indicate that mammalian rod photoreceptors contain three GARP variants, a GARP component that constitutes the N-terminal part of the rod CNG β-subunit, f-GARP, and t-GARP. Structural features of these GARP components appear to contribute to their anomalous migration on SDS gels. Studies are now being carried out to determine the role of these GARP components in the structure and function of rod photoreceptor cells and their possible role in retinal degenerative diseases.

In photoreceptor cells and olfactory neurons, these channels play a key role in signal transduction by controlling the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell in response to signal-induced changes in intracellular levels of cGMP or cAMP (5Yau K.-W. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 289-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 6Zufall F. Firestein S. Shepherd G.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 577-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The rod photoreceptor CNG channel has been most extensively studied in both native rod outer segment (ROS) membranes and heterologous cell expression systems. It consists of two homologous subunits, generally referred to as the α- and β-subunits, which assemble into a hetero-oligomeric membrane protein complex. The cDNA for the bovine and human α-subunit encodes an 80-kDa polypeptide that forms a functional homo-oligomeric channel when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells (7Kaupp U.B. Niidome T. Tanabe T. Terada S. Bönigk W. Stühmer W. Cook N.J. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 342: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 8Dhallan R.S. Macke J.P.

In ROS membrane preparations, the N-terminal 92 amino acids of the α-subunit are missing resulting in a truncated polypeptide that migrates as a 63-kDa polypeptide by SDS-gel electrophoresis (9Cook N.J.

More recently, the cDNA for the complete bovine β-subunit has been cloned and found to code for a 155-kDa polypeptide (11Körschen H.G. Illing M. Seifert R. Sesti F. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C.

Both the native and heterologously expressed bovine β-subunit migrate anomalously on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a 240-kDa polypeptide. The β-subunit, itself, does not form a functional channel, but when coexpressed with the α-subunit, it assembles into a functional hetero-oligomeric channel having electrophysiological properties similar to those of the native rod CNG channel (11Körschen H.G.

The N-terminal region is essentially identical to a previously cloned retinal glutamic acid-rich protein called GARP (14Sugimoto Y. Yatsunami K. Tsujimoto M. Khorana H.G. Ichikawa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3116-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal region contains structural features of other CNG channel subunits including six predicted transmembrane segments, a cyclic nucleotide binding domain, a voltage sensor-like motif, and a pore region. The β-subunit also contains a binding site for calmodulin (13Chen T.-Y. Illing M. Molday L.L. Hsu Y.-T. Yau K.-W. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Polypeptides of this apparent Mr, however, are not present in CNG channel preparations immunoprecipitated from human ROS. Instead, a polypeptide of approximately 220-kDa is labeled by a β-subunit-specific antibody by Western blots (13Chen T.-Y. Illing M. Molday L.L. Hsu Y.-T. Yau K.-W. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11757-11761Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). More recently, Ardell et al. (16Ardell M.D. Makhija A.K. Oliveira L. Miniou P. Viegas-Péquignot E. Pittler S.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have cloned a cDNA from a human retinal library that encodes a truncated homolog of the bovine GARP protein. On the basis of its similarity to the GARP component of the bovine rod β-subunit, this protein has been suggested to be a third or γ-subunit of the human rod CNG channel. Since no evidence was presented to show that this polypeptide is associated with the human rod channel, questions remain whether this truncated GARP protein is, in fact, a true subunit of the human rod CNG channel.In order to resolve the uncertainties surrounding the subunit composition of the human rod CNG channel and, in particular the primary structure of the β-subunit, we have cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA for the human β-subunit. In this paper we show that the human rod CNG β-subunit, like the bovine subunit, has a bipartite structure with a GARP component comprising the N-terminal part of this subunit. Two other GARP variants, which are not subunits of the channel, have also been cloned and found to be expressed specifically in outer segments of rod photoreceptors."

One of these genes, SUG1, encodes a member of a large family of putative ATPases, the Conserved ATPase containing Domain (CAD) proteins (also known as AAA proteins) that are involved in a wide variety of cellular functions. Subsequently, SUG1 was identified as a subunit of the 26 S proteasome. We have now cloned the gene defined by the second complementation group. SUG2 encodes an essential 49-kDa protein that is also a member of the CAD family and is 43% identical to SUG1. The mutation in sug2-1, like that in sug1-1, is found in the CAD near the highly conserved ATPase motif. We present biochemical and genetic evidence that SUG2 is associated in vivo with SUG1 and is a novel CAD protein subunit of the 26 S proteasome. With its highly conserved mammalian homologs, human p42 and ground squirrel CADp44, SUG2 defines a new class of proteasomal CAD proteins.

The GAL4 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for a very large stimulation (~1000-fold) in the transcription of genes required for galactose metabolism under inducing conditions. The N-terminal 97 amino acids of GAL4 encode the DNA binding domain, while activation function and interaction with the negative regulator GAL80 map to 34 amino acids near the C terminus (1Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Yeast Saccharomyces. Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar). Partial deletion of this activation domain in the gal4D and gal4-62 alleles leads to a defect in activation by GAL4 and an inability to grow on galactose as the sole carbon source (2Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Matsumoto K. Adachi Y. Toh-e A. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 508-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A frameshift mutation of gal4-62 that changes the C-terminal amino acids of the truncated protein from FGITT to FMNV restores the ability to grow on galactose. While the truncated gal4D activation domain retains only 3% of wild type activity, the frameshift mutation restores activity to 40% (4Johnston S.A. Salmeron J.M. Dincher S.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Salmeron J.M. Leuther K.K. Johnston S.A. Genetics. 1990; 125: 21-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if a small change in the truncated activation domain could restore function, we might genetically identify proteins contacted by GAL4 in the activation process by selecting extragenic suppressors of gal4D. This strategy yielded mutants in two complementation groups (2Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 1J. Bromberg and S. A. Johnston, unpublished data. One of these, sug1, had been isolated independently by Matsumoto et al. (3Matsumoto K. Adachi Y. Toh-e A. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 508-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a suppressor for galactose (sug) of the gal4-62 allele and was presumed to be an information suppressor. However, sug1-1 suppresses gal4D, which terminates at the same amino acid as the gal4-62 allele with a frameshift and multiple stop codons, arguing that sug1-1 does not act as an information suppressor. We have previously characterized the sug1-1 allele. It is able to suppress a variety of mutations in the activation domain of GAL4, short of its complete deletion, but is unable to suppress mutations in other regions of the protein. The SUG1 gene was cloned and sequenced and was one of the first identified members of a large family of proteins that contain a highly conserved 220 amino acid motif. We have referred to this as the CAD (Conserved ATPase-containing Domain) (2Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) because one of its most highly conserved features is a Walker-type nucleotide binding motif. Proteins that share this motif are also collectively known as the AAA family (6Confalonieri F. Duguet M. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). They are involved in a remarkably wide range of cellular processes, including vesicle fusion, proteolysis, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial biogenesis and transcription. The basic function of the CAD is still unknown. Although sug1 was originally identified as a suppressor of transcriptional defects, subsequent studies suggested that SUG1 is a component of the 26 S proteasome (7Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I.

A screen for suppressors of the cdc28N-1 mutation in yeast yielded a sug1 mutation (cim3) along with a mutation in a known component of the 26 S proteasome, CIM5 (14Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Both the cim5 mutation and the cim3 mutations affect the half-life of some proteasomal substrates in vivo (14Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 15Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More convincingly, a protein nearly identical to the human homolog of SUG1 (16Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Moore D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) was biochemically isolated as a component of PA700, a complex that stimulates the activity of 20 S proteasome purified from bovine red blood cells (17Akiyama K.

Subsequently, it has been physically demonstrated that yeast SUG1 is a component of the 26 S proteasome (7Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Hengartner C. Young R.A. Goldberg A.L. Finley D.

These proteins are postulated to act as “reverse chaperones,” unwinding protein substrates in an ATP-dependent manner for digestion by the 26 S proteasome (13Lupas A. Koster A.J. Baumeister W. Enzyme Protein. 1994; 47: 252-273Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The mechanism for rescue of mutant gal4 proteins by sug1-1 is not yet understood. Only two complementation groups were recovered in our selection for suppressors of gal4D. There were 14 independent isolates in each group,1 suggesting that the selection was saturated. Matsumoto et al. (3Matsumoto K. Adachi Y. Toh-e A. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 508-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found, and we have confirmed, that a mutation in the second complementation group, sug2-1, is synthetically lethal with sug1-1, suggesting that the two genes are functionally related and may be physically associated with each other. Therefore, we reasoned that characterization of SUG2 could be important to understanding proteasomal function and might provide insight into the mechanism of gal4D rescue. We describe here cloning and characterization of the SUG2 gene and the identification of its protein product as a novel CAD family subunit of the yeast 26 S proteasome. Like SUG1, SUG2 has highly conserved mammalian homologs. With its human homolog p42 (24Fujiwara T. Watanabe T.K. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and its functionally interchangeable ground squirrel homolog CADp44 (25Bauer V.M. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Andrews M.T.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic SUG1 gene of Sc342 was tagged at the N terminus with the 11-amino acid T7 (S10) epitope tag (Novagen) to produce Sc507. Three tandem copies of the epitope tag are appended to the N terminus of SUG2 in Sc562, also derived from Sc342. Yeast transformations were done by the lithium acetate methods (32Ito H. Fukuda Y.

For mapping the putative SUG2 clone to the sug2-1 locus, a PCR fragment (1.58 kb) from the genome containing the entire SUG2 gene as well as 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was blunt-end cloned into the SmaI site of pUC118. By using ClaI sites in the oligonucleotides, the SUG2 containing fragment (from 210 base pairs 5′ of the ATG to 41 base pairs 3′ of the stop codon) was subcloned to integrating vector pRS306 carrying a URA3 marker. The recombinant plasmid was linearized within the gene at the single BglII site and transformed into Sc392. Genomic DNA was prepared from 2 Ura+ isolates. The locus of integration was confirmed by diagnostic PCR using one oligonucleotide in the genome and another in the URA3 gene. The SUG2 disruption construct was generated by replacing the 1.05-kb StuI-BclI fragment (leaving 54 amino acids at the N terminus and 29 amino acids at the C terminus) of SUG2 in pUC118 with a 1.1-kb SmaI-BamHI fragment containing the URA3 gene by blunt cloning. The SUG2::URA3 fragment was removed by ClaI digestion and transformed into Sc342 carrying pMTL1-SUG2 (SUG2 under GAL1/10 control). Successful integration events were selected on galactose plates lacking uracil and confirmed by diagnostic PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Sculptor kit (Amersham Corp.). pH6-SUG2 was constructed by amplifying the open reading frame of the SUG2 gene by PCR with a 5′ primer that produced an NcoI site at the start codon. The product was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression plasmid H6-pQE60, a derivative of pQE60 (Qiagen), to produce pH6-SUG2 which encodes SUG2 tagged at the N terminus with six histidines (Met-Ala-(His)6-Ala-SUG2). The sequence of SUG2 was determined by automated cycle sequencing using fluorescently tagged terminator base analogs (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Comparison of the SUG2 sequence with other CAD proteins in the GenEMBL combined data base was done at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST network service. Percent identity values for pairwise comparisons of CAD proteins were calculated using the GAP program, and the dendrogram of yeast CAD proteins was generated using the Pileup program in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group). Yeast cells were harvested at A600 = 0.6-0.8. Extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase (38Yokum R.R. Hanley S. West R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or α-galactosidase activity (39Kew O.M.A. Douglas H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 33-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described. Activity was converted to ΔA400·min−1 mg−1 protein. One unit of β-galactosidase is equal to a 0.0045 ΔA400·min−1 mg−1 protein. One unit of α-galactosidase is equal to a 0.0182 ΔA400 min−1 mg−1 protein. Two-hybrid reagents developed by Elledge and co-workers (28Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P. Shiou-Hweiyeh Yana Y. Kilburn A.E. Wen-hwalee A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) were used in this study. The full-length SUG1 gene was fused at its N terminus with the GAL4 DNA binding domain on pASCYH2 and used as bait in the two-hybrid assay. Strain Y190 carrying the bait was transformed with a cDNA library of fusions with the GAL4 activation domain on pACTII. Approximately 100,000 transformants were selected on His− Leu− Trp− medium containing 25 mM 3-aminotriazole. Blue colonies were identified using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside filter lift assay for β-galactosidase activity as described (28Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P. Shiou-Hweiyeh Yana Y. Kilburn A.E. Wen-hwalee A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Positive colonies failing to activate nonspecific fusions were chosen for further study. SUG2 tagged at the N terminus was produced in bacterial strain BL21(DE3) carrying pREP4 and pH6-SUG2 and was isolated as inclusion bodies. This protein was approximately 50% pure as estimated after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown) and was further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE. The H6-SUG2 band was cut out of the gel, and a suspension of finely macerated acrylamide in phosphate-buffered saline containing purified H6-SUG2 along with an equal mass of Adjuprime (Pierce) was used for all inoculations. After obtaining preimmune serum, antibodies were raised in mice by standard methods (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 92-121Google Scholar). Extracts for testing the specificity of the SUG2 antibody were prepared by directly boiling yeast grown in yeast extract peptone glucose medium and harvested at an A600 nm of 1.0 in 2 × SDS sample buffer. Two liters of yeast strain Sc507 (wild type for GAL4, SUG1, and SUG2) were grown at 30°C to an A600 nm of 1.0 in yeast extract peptone medium with 2% glucose as the carbon source. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with cold water and re-centrifuged, then resuspended in 3 ml/g wet weight SCED (1.2 M sorbitol, 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 60 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol). 50 μl of β-glucuronidase (Sigma) and 1 mg of zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp.) was added per g wet weight of cells. The suspension of cells was shaken at 150 rpm in an air incubator at 30°C until completely spheroplasted (30-45 min). The spheroplasts were centrifuged at approximately 700 × g at 4°C for 5 min and then gently resuspended in cold 1.2 M sorbitol and recentrifuged. This washing step was repeated. The pelleted spheroplasts were then resuspended in an equal volume of column buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM potassium acetate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM ATP, and 20% glycerol) made without the glycerol and incubated on ice for 5 min resulting in lysis of the spheroplasts. One spheroplast pellet volume of column buffer A containing 60% glycerol was then added to give a final concentration of glycerol of approximately 20%. The viscous extract was sonicated for seven bursts of 1 s using the microprobe of a Branson Sonifier 450 and then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transfered to a fresh tube and respun. The cleared extract was then diluted to 10 mg/ml protein with column buffer A. 10 ml (100 mg) was fractionated on a 2.5 × 100 cm Sephacryl S400 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) gel filtration column running at 1 ml/min at 4°C, and 15-ml fractions were taken. The remainder of the extract and all fractions were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in aliquots. 10 ml from 26 S peak fraction 8 of the crude extract fractionation was depleted of ATP by treatment with 4 units of apyrase type 5 (Sigma) for 1 h on ice. An appropriate amount of 2 M KCl was added to bring the fraction to 300 mM KCl, and it was then refractionated on the S400 HR column in column buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM potassium acetate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 300 mM KCl). The Sephacryl S400 HR column was calibrated with the following standards (Sigma) in column buffer A: dextran blue, thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). Proteasome peptidase activity was assayed, in the absence or presence of 0.05% SDS, against Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (Bachem) as described (41Chu-Ping M. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2547-3539Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride. Tagged SUG1 was detected with a monoclonal antibody to the T7 S10 epitope (Novagen). SUG2 was detected with mouse antiserum. 20 S proteasome subunits were detected with antiserum against the yeast enzyme generously provided by K. Tanaka. Immunoblots were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs (Pierce), the Rennaissance chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Corp.), and x-ray film (Amersham Corp.). Fixed protein A+ S. aureus cells were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and prepared as suggested by Mark Biggin. A 10% suspension of the cells was washed three times with 1 volume of TES (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2% Sarcosyl). They were then resuspended in 2 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 3% SDS and 10%β-mercaptoethanol and incubated in boiling water for 30 min. After washing two times in TES, cells were frozen aliquoted at −80°C as a 20% (w/v) suspension in TES until use. To load cells with antibody, 100 μl of cell suspension was washed three times with 1 ml of NET buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8) and then incubated with 40 μl of anti-yeast 20 S proteasome or preimmune serum in a total volume of 1 ml of NET for 2 h at 4°C with inversion. Cells were washed three times with 1 ml of NET buffer, taken up to a final concentration of 10% w/v in immunoprecipitation buffer, and stored at −80°C. Samples were pre-cleared before use in immunoprecipitation reactions. Extract or column fractions were diluted to a final volume of 400 μl with IP buffer (the appropriate column buffer supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM EDTA). 20 μl of 20% unloaded protein A+ S. aureus cells were added, and the reaction was nutated at 4°C for 1 h and then spun at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was used as the input for immunoprecipitations. For immunoprecipitations, 20 μl of loaded S. aureus cells were added to the pre-cleared extract and nutated at 4°C for 1 h. After gently pelleting the cells (7,500 rpm in a microcentrifuge), the supernatant was removed and concentrated by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid using 150 μg/ml deoxycholate as carrier. The pellet was then subjected to three 5-min washes with 1 ml of IP buffer. Both the concentrated supernatant proteins and the pellet were resuspended in equal volumes of 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer supplemented with 6 M urea and boiled for 5 min. Equal aliquots of the samples were separated on a 10% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected by Western blotting. The 20 S proteasome was detected in immunoprecipitations using the anti-20 S antibody that had been biotinylated using Biotin (Long Arm) NHS (Vector Laboratories) following the manufacturer's instructions. Avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used for visualization. Images on x-ray film were scanned using the Ofoto 1.1 software and an Apple One Scanner at 8 bit/300 dpi and stored as PICT files. Annotations and labels were added in Adobe Photoshop, and the images were printed on a Kodak XLS 8600 PS dye sublimation printer. A strain relying on gal4-69 (which, like gal4-62, encodes a protein truncated at amino acid 853) for activation of genes in the GAL regulon is unable to grow on galactose as the sole carbon source (Gal−) and is resistant to the galactose anti-metabolite 2-deoxygalactose (2-DG+). In an sug2-1 background, however, growth on galactose is restored (Gal+) and growth on 2-DG is inhibited (2-DG−). In order to isolate the dominant, wild type SUG2 gene, we transformed Sc392 (a sug2-1 gal4-69) strain with multi-copy and single-copy genomic libraries. For each library approximately 10,000 transformants selected on glucose medium were replica-plated to both galactose and glycerol/lactic acid/2-DG (gly/lac/2-DG) medium. Colonies that could not utilize galactose (Gal−) and grew on gly/lac/2-DG (2-DG+) were selected for further characterization. The single copy library did not yield any candidate clones. Plasmids were isolated from the five multi-copy transformants obtained, colony purified in Escherichia coli, and re-transformed into Sc392. Three of these plasmids complemented the sug2-1 mutation, i.e. they prevented the rescue of gal4-69 by the recessive sug2-1 allele. Restriction enzyme maps of these plasmids were identical. One plasmid, p49-7, was chosen for further study. Sequencing the entire insert of p49-7 revealed three full-length open reading frames, the previously identified GCD1 (42Hill D.E. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and CDC31 (43Spang A. Courtney I. Fackler U. Matzner M. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 128: 863-867Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) genes, and between them a novel CAD family gene with 43% identity to SUG1 (Fig. 1). Given the similarity to SUG1, we tested whether this CAD gene could complement the suppression of gal4-69 by sug2-1. A 1.58-kb fragment between GCD1 and CDC31, containing the entire predicted open reading frame of the CAD gene, as well as 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, was PCR-amplified and cloned. This fragment alone, when carried on a multicopy plasmid, was able to suppress the sug2-1 rescue of gal4-69 (Table I) while fragments containing GCD1 and CDC31 did not (data not shown).Table Isug2-1 rescues gal4-69 and cloned SUG2 suppresses this rescueStrainα-Galactosidase activity%sug2-1 gal4-6934W303 a (SUG2 mel°)<121R (SUG2 GAL4)100sug2-1 gal4-69 (YEp24 SUG2)5sug2-1 gal4-69 (YCp50 SUG2)22sug2-1 gal4-69 (SUG2 integrant)5 Open table in a new tab The 1.58-kb fragment between GCD1 and CDC31 only partially suppressed the rescue of gal4-69 when carried on a single copy plasmid (Table I). To determine if the cloned CAD gene was SUG2 or if it was an extragenic multicopy suppressor, it was integrated into an sug2-1 strain. A clone of the novel CAD gene on the URA3 integration vector pRS306 was cut within the CAD open reading frame and transformed into Sc392 (a sug2-1 gal4-69). All 12 integrants selected for uracil prototrophy were Gal−. Integration of this fragment diminished gal4-69 activity to a level equal to that found in a SUG2 wild type background (Table I), consistent with integration at the sug2-1 locus and generation of one wild type copy of SUG2 by recombination. To further demonstrate that the novel CAD gene maps to the sug2-1 locus, we performed crosses and random spore analysis. A strain in which the URA3 gene was targeted to the novel CAD protein locus by integration was crossed with a mating type switched derivative of the parental strain, Sc527 (α sug2-1 gal4-69"

Since ESL-1 is endogenously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in a non-E-selectin binding form, which can become activated upon transfection of a fucosyltransferase (FucT), we analyzed various CHO cell clones, each overexpressing one of seven different fucosyltransferases, by affinity isolation experiments with E-selectin-IgG. Two of the cell lines were the regulatory CHO mutants LEC11 and LEC12, each overexpressing a different hamster FucT, while the five other clones were stably transfected with human FucTIII to -VII. A large panel of glycoproteins was affinity-isolated with E-selectin-IgG from LEC11 cells and FucTIII transfectants, demonstrating that many different glycoproteins can acquire ligand activity upon α(1,3)-fucosylation. In contrast, ESL-1 was almost exclusively isolated as the dominant glycoprotein ligand from LEC12 cells as well as from FucTIV and FucTVII transfectants and less selectively from FucTV and FucTVI transfectants. The selective generation of ligand activity correlated with the selective generation of the HECA452-reactive carbohydrate epitope, which is known to bind to E-selectin.

In plants, four major HMG proteins, as in vertebrate tissues (HMG1/2, HMG14/17), have been detected, displaying a slightly higher mobility in SDS-PAGE than their animal counterparts (26Spiker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of these proteins by peptide mapping, amino acid analysis, and amino-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed significant dissimilarities to the animal proteins (26Spiker S. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, several members of the HMG1/2 and the HMGI/Y families have been identified by cDNA cloning from various plant species (28Grasser K.D. Plant J. 1995; 7: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The well conserved HMG1/2-like plant proteins (Mr around 17,000) contain only one HMG box DNA binding domain (as invertebrate HMG1/2-like proteins), in contrast to vertebrate HMG1/2, which have two. In addition, the plant proteins have an approximately 35-amino acid residue basic region at the amino terminus, and within their acidic carboxyl-terminal region the glutamic and aspartic acid residues are interspersed with some other residues, which is not the case in HMG1/2 (29Grasser K.D. Feix G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2573-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Laux T. Goldberg R.B.

The homologous HMG box proteins, wheat HMGb and maize HMGa, bind in vitro with some preference to diverse A/T-rich promoter regions of various plant genes (32Grasser K.D. Maier U.-G. Haass M.M.

Krech A.B. Feix G. Plant J. 1994; 6: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a ligase-mediated circularization assay, HMGa displayed a strong DNA bending activity (34Grasser K.D. Krech A.B. Feix G. Plant J. 1994; 6: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), as observed with HMG1 (16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C.

A. 1993; 90: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Up to now no plant HMG14/17-like protein has been identified. The most likely candidates are proteins such as wheat HMGc and HMGd (26Spiker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which bind to nucleosomes, although in the electrophoretic retardation assay used the interaction appeared to be rather unspecific (35Arwood L.J. Spiker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9771-9777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, HMGc and HMGd were released preferentially from nuclei by ethidium bromide (36Arwood L.J. Hill E. Spiker S. Physiol. Plant. 1991; 82: 419-422Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), a characteristic shared by animal HMG14/17 (37Schröter H. Maier G. Postingl H. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3867-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Pani B. Plossi P. Russo E. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal amino acid sequences of wheat HMGc and HMGd show no similarity to their putative animal counterparts (27Spiker S. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 74: 200-213Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but there is also no amino-terminal amino acid sequence homology between animal and plant HMG1/2 and HMGI/Y proteins (28Grasser K.D. Plant J. 1995; 7: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To solve the so far unknown primary structure of plant HMGc proteins and to analyze their DNA binding properties, we first purified HMGc from maize which was detected previously in nuclear extracts from immature kernels (39Grasser K.D. Wurz A. Feix G. Planta. 1991; 185: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the sequence information we obtained from sequencing amino-terminal and internal peptides, we could isolate two closely related cDNAs encoding maize HMGc. Sequence analysis revealed that HMGc has no similarity to HMG14/17 and belongs to the HMG1/2 family of chromosomal proteins containing an HMG box DNA binding domain, but it is distinct from the previously identified plant HMG1/2-like proteins, thus representing a novel type of plant HMG box protein. Frozen maize tissue (immature kernels or black Mexican sweet suspension culture cells, typically 100 g/extraction) was homogenized in liquid nitrogen with pestle and mortar. All of the following procedures were carried out at 4°C. The frozen homogenate was taken up in 10 volumes of buffer X (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF) containing a final concentration of 1.5-2.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid or 5% (w/v) perchloric acid. After stirring for 15 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Trichloroacetic acid was added to the supernatant (filtered through Miracloth) to a final concentration of 25% (w/v), and the mixture was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was washed twice with cold acetone, vacuum dried, and resuspended in 5 ml of buffer D (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM PMSF). The protein solution was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant applied to a ResourceQ FPLC column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with this buffer and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in buffer D. HMGc-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and the buffer was changed to buffer D using PD-10 columns (Pharmacia). Proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE in 18% polyacrylamide gels and Coomassie staining, amino-terminal sequencing, and MALDI-TOF/MS. HMGc was digested with 2% (w/w) trypsin or subtilisin overnight at 37°C. The peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF/MS and peptide sequencing. Maize HMGc eluted from the ResourceQ column and peptide digests were separated on a Vydac C-18 column (1.0 × 250 mm) using the HP 1100 HPLC system (Hewlett Packard). Peptides were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 70 μl/min applying the following water (solvent A)/acetonitrile (solvent B) gradient: at 0 min, 1% B; at 70 min, 35% B; at 90 min, 70% B. Fractions were collected manually. HMGc was separated in the same way except that the gradient was as follows: at 0 min, 2% B; at 60 min, 60% B. All mass spectrometric analyses were performed on the Hewlett Packard G2025A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). As matrix, sinapic acid was used for protein analysis and cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for peptide analysis. Automated Edman degradation of peptides and proteins was performed using the Hewlett Packard G1005A protein sequencing system. PCR was performed with 3 μg of reverse transcribed rice seedling leaf RNA (provided by R. Freyer), 1 μM primers (5′-ATGAAGGGCAAGGCCGACGCCTC and 5′-GCTCAGACATAGCTCGCCACTTC, according to the sequence D22537 of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base), 0.2 mM deoxyribonucloside triphosphates, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer. The obtained PCR fragment partially encoding a putative rice HMGc was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced. After digestion of this plasmid with SacII and SpeI the fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and labeled with digoxigenin (Boehringer Mannheim) by the random priming method. The labeled fragment was denatured by heating to 100°C and used as a hybridization probe to screen ~300,000 plaque-forming units of a maize Uni-ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene). Hybridizations were performed overnight at 58°C in 5 × SSC, 0.1% (v/v) N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% (w/v) SDS, 2% (w/v) blocking powder (Boehringer), before the nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature and twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 58°C. Hybridizing plaques were detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antiserum and the standard alkaline phosphatase color reaction (Boehringer). Positive phage clones were purified by rescreening at low plaque density. The recombinant pBluescript plasmids were isolated from purified phage clones by in vivo excision with helper phage ExAssist according to the manufacturer (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences of the cDNA inserts were determined with an automated sequencer (ALF, Pharmacia) and analyzed using the GCG V8.0 sequence analysis system. Screening of the library in search for cDNAs encoding the second type of maize HMGc was performed using the coding region of the first maize HMGc cDNA clone as hybridization probe as described above, but hybridization and stringent wash were performed at 65°C. The coding regions of HMGc1 and HMGc2 were amplified by PCR with primers (5′-AAGGATCCATGAAGGGCAAGGCTGACACCT, 5′-AATTAAGCTTACTCATCGTCATCGTTTTCCT and 5′-AAGGATCCATGAAGGGCAAGGCCAACGCCT, 5′-AATTAAGCTTACTCGTCGTCGTCGTTATCCTCGT) as described above, except HotTub polymerase (Amersham) was used. The obtained PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and HindIII, purified using PCR Preps (Promega), and cloned into the expression vector pQE9cm (created by replacing the ampicillin resistance of pQE9 (Qiagen) by the chloramphenicol resistance of pBCSK (Stratagene)) giving pQE9cm-HMGc1 and pQE9cm-HMGc2. These plasmids provide an amino-terminal 6 × His-tag suitable for Ni-NTA affinity purification (Qiagen) of the fusion proteins. The plasmids were checked by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli M15 cells were transformed to chloramphenicol resistance with the plasmids pQE9cm-HMGc1 and pQE9cm-HMGc2. Cultures were grown at 37°C in 2 × YT medium (containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 30 μg/ml kanamycin), induced at A600 = 0.8 with 2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and grown for 2 h. All of the following procedures were carried out at 4°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 100 μg/ml benzamidine), and lysed with a French press. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min the supernatant was applied to an Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). The column was washed with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 100 μg/ml benzamidine) and eluted with buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 350 mM imidazole, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 100 μg/ml benzamidine). The eluted proteins were then applied to an S-Sepharose Fast Flow FPLC column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer D (see above), and the column was washed with this buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in buffer D. Fractions containing HMGc were pooled, adjusted to 100 mM NaCl, and applied to a ResourceQ FPLC column as described above. Purified HMGc1 and HMGc2 were desalted and characterized as described above by amino-terminal sequencing, MALDI-TOF/MS, and SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by amino-terminal sequencing. EMSAs were performed as described previously (34Grasser K.D. Krech A.B. Feix G. Plant J. 1994; 6: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), using a 78-bp KpnI/XbaI fragment of pBluescript (Stratagene) terminally 32P-labeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The 78-bp minicircles were produced by intramolecular ligation of the 32P-labeled 78-bp fragment (after creating blunt ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I) using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of recombinant maize HMGa/M1-K123 protein as described before (34Grasser K.D. Krech A.B. Feix G. Plant J. 1994; 6: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Relaxed plasmid DNA (pBluescript) was produced by treatment of supercoiled DNA with vaccina virus topoisomerase I (provided by Dr. K. Schnetz) (1 unit/μg DNA) for 1 h at 37°C, in topoisomerase buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Topoisomerase I was added (1 unit/μg DNA), and aliquots of the mixture were added to various amounts of HMGc1 and HMGc2 in topoisomerase buffer. After 1 h at 37°C SDS was added (1% (w/v) final) and the DNA extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v). The deproteinized DNA was analyzed in 1% agarose TAE (40 mM Tris acetate, 1 mM EDTA) gels. HMGc proteins have been detected previously in wheat embryo chromatin (26Spiker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in nuclear extracts from immature maize kernels (39Grasser K.D. Wurz A. Feix G. Planta. 1991; 185: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but their primary structure has not yet been solved. To purify and characterize maize HMGc, we first fractionated extracts from immature kernels (14 days after pollination) with 1.5-2.5% trichloroacetic acid and 5% perchloric acid, taking advantage of the acid solubility of HMG proteins (1Johns E.W. The HMG Chromosomal Proteins. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar). HMGc, along with HMGa, HMGd, and several other proteins, is strongly enriched in the acid-soluble fractions (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4). One prominent protein band of the 1.5% trichloroacetic acid extract migrating immediately below HMGa (lane 1) was hardly soluble at higher acid concentrations. This protein, previously designated HMGb, proved by peptide sequencing after V8-digestion to be histone H2B1. The 2% trichloroacetic acid fraction was selected for the further purification of HMGc, since it combined a good yield with a reasonable enrichment of the HMG proteins. The proteins of the 2% trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction of a kernel extract were separated by ion exchange chromatography resulting in essentially pure HMGa and HMGc (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). Amino-terminal sequencing confirmed the identity of both proteins, demonstrating that the amino-terminal sequence of HMGa is in complete agreement with the sequence deduced from the maize HMGa cDNA (29Grasser K.D. Feix G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2573-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequence of the maize HMGc protein (MKGKAD/NT/ASKKDEG/ARLRA) is ~75% identical to the amino-terminal sequence determined for HMGc purified from wheat embryos (27Spiker S. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 74: 200-213Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To gain more sequence information of maize HMGc to facilitate cloning of the corresponding cDNA, the protein was tryptically digested, the resulting peptides separated by reversed phase HPLC, and some of the peptides sequenced (Fig. 1B). Similarly, a subtilisin digest was performed, resulting in an additional HMGc peptide sequence (KAAGEKWRA/SM). The ambiguities within the amino-terminal sequence of HMGc at positions 5, 6, and 13 suggested that maize HMGc might be composed of two very similar proteins that were copurified by the ion exchange chromatography. Therefore, HMGc was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC resolving it into two prominent peaks (Fig. 2). MALDI-TOF/MS and amino-terminal sequencing of the proteins corresponding to both peaks demonstrated that HMGc could be separated into two distinct proteins of similar mass. In agreement with the amino acid sequence determined from the “pre-HPLC” HMGc protein preparation, the amino-terminal sequences of both proteins differ only at positions 5, 6, and 13 (Fig. 2). Accordingly, we termed the two proteins HMGc1 and HMGc2.Fig. 2Separation of maize HMGc into two proteins by reversed phase HPLC. After ion exchange chromatography (post-ResourceQ), HMGc could be resolved into two protein peaks by reversed phase chromatography. The results of the characterization of the two proteins (HMGc1 and HMGc2) by amino-terminal amino acid sequencing and MALDI-TOF/MS are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Searching of the EMBL and GenBank data bases using the determined HMGc peptide sequences did not show significant similarities to known sequences, although the sequences of the subtilisin peptide (KAAGEKWRA/SM) and one of the tryptic peptides (VFMSEFR) exhibit similarities to HMG box DNA binding domains. A search of the EST data base, however, revealed a partial rice cDNA sequence of unknown function (accession number D22537) which was compatible with the HMGc peptide sequences. Four out of the five maize HMGc peptide sequences displayed striking similarity to the rice EST sequence. Therefore, we used reverse transcribed rice RNA and primers matching the rice HMGc-like EST sequence to amplify a 230-bp fragment by PCR. DNA sequencing of the fragment demonstrated that it represented as expected the 5′ part of the coding region of the putative rice HMGc sequence. This fragment was used as a hybridization probe to screen a maize cDNA library for clones encoding maize HMGc. The DNA sequences of the inserts of two cDNA clones we isolated in the first screen were compatible with all five HMGc peptide sequences. Since the amino acid sequences deduced from these cDNAs were in full agreement with the amino-terminal HMGc1 peptide sequence we had determined, the two isolated cDNAs encoded maize HMGc1 (Fig. 3). To isolate cDNAs encoding HMGc2, we screened the maize cDNA library again, this time using the coding region of the maize HMGc1 cDNA as a hybridization probe. Two of the isolated cDNAs were compatible with the HMGc2 amino-terminal peptide sequence and the internal peptides, thus encoding maize HMGc2 (Fig. 3). In addition to the coding region, the longest isolated HMGc1 cDNA of 797 bp contained 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, whereas in the longest HMGc2 cDNA of 816 bp the coding region started with the guanine residue of the start codon and also contained the 3′-flanking region. The HMGc1 cDNA encodes a 139-amino acid protein with a theoretical mass of 15,316 Da, and the HMGc2 cDNA a 138-amino acid protein with a theoretical mass of 15,007 Da. Since the experimentally determined masses of HMGc1 and HMGc2 purified from maize kernels (and a black Mexican sweet cell suspension culture) were >300 Da higher than the theoretical values (see Fig. 2), both HMGc proteins might be post-translationally modified, which is a common feature of HMG proteins (40Einck L. Bustin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 156: 296-310Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Both proteins are rich in basic (~20%) and acidic (~20%) amino acid residues, typical for HMG proteins (1Johns E.W. The HMG Chromosomal Proteins. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar, 2Bustin M. Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of HMGc1 and HMGc2 share ~89% identical residues. The conservation of a number of critical amino acid residues (primarily basic and hydrophobic) between amino acids Lys-32 (Lys-33 in HMGc2) and Phe-101 (Ile-102 in HMGc2) of HMGc1/2 and HMG box proteins strongly suggests that HMGc1 and HMGc2 are members of the protein family containing a HMG box DNA binding domain (4Landsman D. Bustin M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 5Bianchi M.E. Lilley D.M.J. DNA-Protein: Structural Interactions.

In addition, HMGc1 and HMGc2 have a highly acidic carboxyl-terminal region, typical of (animal and plant) HMG1/2-like proteins. Accordingly, a search of the EMBL data base with the complete cDNA-derived protein sequences of HMGc1/2 revealed significant similarities to proteins containing HMG box DNA binding domains, such as the chromosomal HMG1/2-like proteins of various organisms, whereas no similarity to HMG14/17 and HMGI/Y proteins was detected. The most similar proteins are the previously reported plant HMG box proteins such as maize HMGa. For example, HMGc1 and HMGc2 are, in 50 and 54% of their amino acid residues, respectively, identical to maize HMGa (vertebrate HMG1 and HMG2 are ~80% identical). An alignment of mai"
https://openalex.org/W1984498106,"The DNA junction-resolving enzyme endonuclease VII of bacteriophage T4 contains a zinc-binding region toward the N-terminal end of the primary sequence. In the center of this 39-amino acid section (between residues 38 and 44) lies the sequence HLDHDHE, termed the His-acid cluster. Closely related sequences are found in three other proteins that have similar zinc-binding motifs. We have analyzed the function of these residues by a site-directed mutagenesis approach, modifying single amino acids and studying the properties of the resulting N-terminal protein A fusions. No sequence changes within the His-acid cluster led to a change in zinc content of the protein, indicating that these residues are not involved in the coordination of zinc. We found that the N-terminal aspartate residue (Asp-40) and the two histidine residues (His-41 and His-43) within the cluster are essential for junction-cleavage activity of the proteins. However, all sequence variations within this region generate proteins that retain their ability to bind to four-way DNA junctions (with minor changes in binding affinity in some cases) and to distort their global structure in the same manner as active enzymes. We conclude that the process of cleavage can be uncoupled from those of binding to and distortion of the junction. It is probable that some amino acid side chains of the His-acid cluster participate in the phosphodiester cleavage mechanism of endonuclease VII. The essential aspartate residue might be required for coordination of catalytic metal ions."
https://openalex.org/W1986257464,"The heme-thiolate (cytochrome P450) enzyme which catalyzes the 14α-demethylation of obtusifoliol has been isolated from microsomes prepared from etiolated seedlings of Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. The obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase is a key enzyme in plant sterol biosynthesis and a target for the design of phyla-specific sterol 14α-demethylase inhibitors. Microsomal cytochrome P450s were solubilized by using the detergents Renex 690 and reduced Triton X-100, and the obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase was isolated by DEAE ion exchange and dye affinity column chromatography. The isolated enzyme has an absorption spectrum characteristic for low spin cytochrome P450s and produces a Type I binding spectrum with obtusifoliol as substrate. Binding spectra were not obtained with lanosterol, campesterol, sitosterol, or stigmasterol. Obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase has an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa and is estimated to constitute ≈20% of the total cytochrome P450 content of the microsomal membranes and about 0.2% of the total microsomal protein. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of reconstitution experiments with dilauroylphosphatidylcholine micelles containing isolated obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase and sorghum NADPHcytochrome P450 oxidoreductase demonstrated the conversion of obtusifoliol (4α,14α-dimethyl-5α-ergosta-8,24(28)-dien-3β-ol) to 4α-methyl-5α-ergosta-8,14,24(28)-trien3β-ol, the 14α-demethylated product of obtusifoliol with a double bond introduced at the Δ14 position. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein is MDLADIPQ/KQQRLMAGXALVV. Five internal sequences were obtained after endoproteinase Lys-C and Glu-C digestion. The fragment AAGAFSYISFGGGRH aligns with the unique heme binding domain of mammalian and yeast sterol 14α-demethylases which belong to the CYP51 family. Therefore it is conceivable that the obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase from plants also belongs to the CYP51 family, the only P450 family so far known to be conserved across the phyla. The heme-thiolate (cytochrome P450) enzyme which catalyzes the 14α-demethylation of obtusifoliol has been isolated from microsomes prepared from etiolated seedlings of Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of reconstitution experiments with dilauroylphosphatidylcholine micelles containing isolated obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase and sorghum NADPHcytochrome P450 oxidoreductase demonstrated the conversion of obtusifoliol (4α,14α-dimethyl-5α-ergosta-8,24(28)-dien-3β-ol) to 4α-methyl-5α-ergosta-8,14,24(28)-trien3β-ol, the 14α-demethylated product of obtusifoliol with a double bond introduced at the Δ14 position. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein is MDLADIPQ/KQQRLMAGXALVV. Five internal sequences were obtained after endoproteinase Lys-C and Glu-C digestion. The fragment AAGAFSYISFGGGRH aligns with the unique heme binding domain of mammalian and yeast sterol 14α-demethylases which belong to the CYP51 family. Therefore it is conceivable that the obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase from plants also belongs to the CYP51 family, the only P450 family so far known to be conserved across the phyla."

The lectin consists of identical single-chain polypeptide subunits composed of 134 amino acids (calculated mass, 14,797 daltons), and its N-terminal residue, alanine, is N-acetylated. When compared to the sequences of known galectins, the B. arenarum galectin exhibited the highest identity (48% for the whole molecule and 77% for the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)) with the bovine spleen galectin-1, but surprisingly less identity (38% for the whole molecule and 47% for the CRD) with a galectin from Xenopus laevis skin (Marschal, P., Herrmann, J., Leffler, H., Barondes, S. H., and Cooper, D. N. W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12942-12949). Unlike the X. laevis galectin, the binding activity of the B. arenarum galectin for N-acetyllactosamine, the human blood group A tetrasaccharide and Galβ1,3GalNAc relative to lactose, was in agreement with that observed for the galectin-1 subgroup and those galectins having “conserved” (type I) CRDs (Ahmed, H., and Vasta, G. R. (1994) Glycobiology 4, 545-549). Moreover, the toad galectin shares three of the six cysteine residues that are conserved in all mammalian galectins-1, but not in the galectins from X. laevis, fish, and invertebrates described so far. Based on the homologies of the B. arenarum galectin with the bovine spleen galectin-1 and X. laevis skin galectin, it should be concluded that within the galectin family the correlation between conservation of primary structure and phylogenetic distances among the source species may not be a direct one as proposed elsewhere (Hirabayashi, J., and Kasai, K. (1993) Glycobiology 3, 297-304). Furthermore, galectins with conserved (type I) CRDs, represented by the B. arenarum ovary galectin, and those with “variable” (type II) CRDs, represented by the X. laevis 16-kDa galectin, clearly constitute distinct subgroups in the extant amphibian taxa and may have diverged early in the evolution of chordate lineages."

A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction strategy was used to determine the molecular identity of voltage-sensitive calcium channels present in ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells.

We found that 1,25(OH)2D3 and analog BT reduced steady state levels of α1C mRNA. Conversely, the Ca2+-mobilizing analog AT did not alter steady state levels of voltage-sensitive calcium channel mRNA.

Paradoxically, 1,25(OH)2D3 has anabolic effects on osteoblasts, stimulating production of the noncollagenous matrix proteins, osteopontin and osteocalcin (2Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pike J.W. Proc.

The exact mechanism by which the bone-forming and -resorbing aspects of the remodeling process are regulated and coupled remains unclear.1,25(OH)2D3 produces a number of rapid, membrane-initiated events such as alteration of calcium currents (5Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), activation of protein kinases (6Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Larkin J.D.

Norman A.W. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Along with the rapid effects, 1,25(OH)2D3 influences the transcription of many genes through binding to the nuclear receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 (nVDR) (8Haussler M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1986; 6: 527-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the genes the expression of which is influenced by 1,25(OH)2D3 are up-regulated after hours to days of hormone treatment, with fewer demonstrations of negative regulation (reviewed by Hannah and Norman (9Hannah S.S. Norman A.W. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)).The development of 1,25(OH)2D3 analogs with selective activities on target cells has allowed the dual activities of 1,25(OH)2D3 to be dissected. We previously reported the use of analogs that preferentially stimulate either nVDR-mediated or membrane-initiated pathways and showed that Ca2+ influx is not required for the up-regulation of osteopontin and osteocalcin mRNA levels (10Khoury R. Ridall A.L. Norman A.W. Farach-Carson M.C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Analogs that bind to the nVDR but fail to activate Ca2+ influx have potential clinical importance because they stimulate bone formation with reduced hypercalcemic potential relative to 1,25(OH)2D3.L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) on the plasma membranes of diverse cell types play a critical role in calcium signaling and cellular function. Excitable tissues such as skeletal muscle (11Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), cardiac muscle (12Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

L-type VSCCs also have been identified in other tissues including kidney (14Yu A.S. Hebert S.C. Lytton J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10494-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), pancreas (15Seino S. Chen L. Seino M. Blondel O. Takeda J. Johnson J.H. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17786-17791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, these highly conserved channels consist of five distinct subunits (α1, α2, β, γ, and δ) encoded by four genes (reviewed by Catterall (17Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 242: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar)). The α1 subunit contains the pore through which Ca2+ ions enter cells, and it can function in the absence of the other subunits (18Perez-Reyes E. Kim H.S. Lacerda A.E. Horne W. Wei X. Rampe D. Campbell K.P. Brown A.M. Birnbaumer L. Nature. 1989; 340: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Potential phosphorylation sites on the α1 subunit exist for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, casein kinase, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (17Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 242: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Skeletal and cardiac muscle VSCCs share high sequence similarity (66%), while two of the four classes of brain Ca2+ channels share ~75% amino acid identity with skeletal muscle (19Snutch T.P. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Further diversity is generated by alternative splicing, as is the case for the cardiac muscle α1 subunit (20Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Castellano A. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20430-20436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Clonal ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells possess functional L-type VSCCs assessed using whole cell and single channel electrophysiological recording techniques (5Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that these L-type VSCCs in osteoblasts were stimulated within milliseconds by 1,25(OH)2D3, a membrane-initiated event that does not require the nVDR. Activation of VSCCs was characterized by a shift in the threshold of activation toward the resting membrane potential and a prolonged open time (5Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular identity of the VSCCs present in ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic cells has not been previously investigated. Additionally, because the extent and ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to rapidly increase plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability is directly related to the density of functional VSCCs, we investigated the long term ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to modulate transcript levels encoding the α1 subunit of the VSCC.In this report, partial cDNA cloning of the L-type VSCC α1 subunit in ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic cells is presented. Nondegenerate reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers were designed to amplify and sequence the IV S3-IV S4 region of the channel, an isoform-specific region. Amplimer sequencing demonstrated that the deduced amino acid sequence of the α1 subunit is homologous to two VSCC isoforms, α1C-a and α1C-d. Furthermore, quantitative PCR was used to study the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and analogs on the levels of L-type VSCC mRNA. It was found that 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates the α1C transcript levels at a physiological dose (1 nM), and vitamin D analog studies suggest that this down-regulation involves the nVDR.DISCUSSIONWe cloned a portion of the cDNA encoding the ROS 17/2.8 L-type VSCC α1 subunit and found it to encode a protein product identical with two isoforms of the cardiac VSCC, α1C-a and α1C-d in the fourth transmembrane region. The α1C isoform was also identified in primary rat calvarial osteoblasts. It is not surprising that both of these isoforms exist in osteoblastic cells, given that they are found in a variety of tissues and cells such as lung (25Biel M. Hullin R. Freundner S. Singer D. Dascal N. Flockerzi V. Hofman F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), aorta (16Koch W.J. Ellinor P.T. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17786-17791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), brain (19Snutch T.P. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and fibroblasts (26Soldatov N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4628-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). While it has been known for some time that various cells of the osteoblastic lineage contain functional Ca2+ channels, the molecular nature of these channels has only recently been studied in ROS 17/2.8 cells using an RT-PCR experimental strategy (27Meszaros J.G. Franceschi R.T. Karin N.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abst.): 1830Google Scholar). Barry et al. (28Barry E.L. Gesek F.A. Froehner S.C. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10914-10918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) extended these studies to show that UMR-106 osteosarcoma cells contain skeletal (α1S), cardiac (α1C), and neuroendocrine (α1D) isoforms of the L-type Ca2+ channel in a small region of the α1 cDNA. With regard to α1C, we find evidence for two cardiac isoforms, α1C-a and α1C-d, in ROS 17/2.8 cells. Interestingly, it has been reported that when UMR-106 cells are subjected to chronic mechanical strain, they acquire a calcium conductance that responds to hypotonic swelling and can be blocked by antisense RNA to α1C (29Duncan R.L. Kizer N. Barry E.L. Friedman P.A. Hruska K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of Ca2+ channel expression in osteoblasts may be complex, being affected by hormonal and mechanical interactions as well as the stage of cell differentiation (30Meszaros J.G. Franceschi R.T. Karin N.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).Osteoblasts are generally considered to be nonexcitable cells that share few characteristics with excitable cells in skeletal and cardiac muscle. With regard to plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability, an obvious difference between osteoblasts and the excitable tissues is the total number of the functional VSCCs expressed. ROS 17/2.8 cells express between 1000 and 2000 functional L-type Ca2+ channels per cell (5Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while differentiated myocytes contain at least 10 times this level (31Caffrey J.M. Brown A.M. Schneider M.D. Science. 1987; 236: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This difference in VSCC levels is also apparent at the mRNA level, in which standard Northern blotting techniques used routinely for excitable tissues are frequently incapable of detecting low levels of VSCC mRNA in cells such as ROS 17/2.8. Given our findings that osteoblasts express VSCC isoforms common to cardiac tissues, osteoblasts may represent a “hybrid” between excitable and nonexcitable cells that may possess unique characteristics that relate to function. One such function of osteoblasts in their bone microenvironment is the ability to regulate the secretion of various matrix proteins in response to hormonal and mechanical stimuli.Over the past decade, 1,25(OH)2D3 has emerged as an important hormone in the physiology of many tissues. While generally considered a resorptive hormone in bone, it has anabolic effects on the expression of many extracellular matrix proteins that contribute to bone mass. In fact, the majority of the bone/extracellular matrix genes under regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3 are up-regulated by the seco-steroid-including genes encoding alkaline phosphatase (32Kyeyune-Nyombi E. Lau K.-H.W. Baylink D.J. Strong D.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), osteocalcin (4Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9995-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and osteopontin (2Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6119-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the α1C Ca2+ channel expressed by osteoblastic cells is down-regulated at the mRNA level following exposure to 1 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 for 48 h. This finding is one of a handful of genes negatively regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 which include aggrecan proteoglycan (33Horton Jr., W.E. Balakir R. Precht P. Liang C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24804-24808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Id (34Kawaguchi N. DeLuca H.F. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4569-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), atrial natriuretic peptide (35Li Q. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4934-4939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and collagen type I (36Lichtler A. Stover M.L. Angilly J. Kream B. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3072-3077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, it was shown that UMR-106 cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 8-24 h lost responsiveness to parathyroid hormone-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ (37Green J. Kleeman C.R. Schotland S. Ye L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1070-E1076PubMed Google Scholar). Although the contribution of L-type Ca2+ channels was not directly tested in their study using dihydropyridine channel blockers, it can be inferred that the channel down-regulation seen here after long term exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 may contribute to the diminished response. The data presented in this article clearly indicate that Ca2+ influx is unlikely to serve as the triggering signal for Ca2+ channel down-regulation, since exposure to 1 nM analog AT, which induces maximal Ca2+ influx in ROS 17/2.8 cells, does not alter α1C mRNA levels. It is therefore doubtful that the Ca2+-mobilizing effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 alone are responsible for the decreased levels of VSCC mRNA. The finding that analog BT alone can negatively regulate the steady state levels of the Ca2+ channel transcript strongly suggests that the genomic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 mediated through the nVDR may be responsible for our observations. The question remaining is whether or not the down-regulation is a transcriptional one caused by direct interaction of the hormone-receptor complex with regulatory regions of the VSCC gene or whether a distinct mechanism exists. For example, our laboratory has noted in ion transport assays that VSCCs are maximally active in growth phase cells (50-80% confluent), suggesting that VSCC expression and/or activity can be linked to growth and proliferation, which in turn may be influenced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Experiments are under way to determine definitively whether the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on VSCC mRNA levels require a functional nVDR.In summary, this study provides evidence for the identity of L-type Ca2+ channel isoforms (α1C) in osteoblastic cells. Furthermore, the demonstration that 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates the steady state levels of mRNA encoding VSCCs points out the interdependence of the rapid, membrane-initiated, and genomic effects of this hormone. By affecting the biosynthesis of the VSCCs at a genomic level, 1,25(OH)2D3 can alter membrane permeability to Ca2+ and thus the capacity of the osteoblast to respond to a variety of hormones unique to bone physiology.

We previously found that these L-type VSCCs in osteoblasts were stimulated within milliseconds by 1,25(OH)2D3, a membrane-initiated event that does not require the nVDR.

Additionally, because the extent and ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to rapidly increase plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability is directly related to the density of functional VSCCs, we investigated the long term ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to modulate transcript levels encoding the α1 subunit of the VSCC.In this report, partial cDNA cloning of the L-type VSCC α1 subunit in ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic cells is presented. Nondegenerate reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers were designed to amplify and sequence the IV S3-IV S4 region of the channel, an isoform-specific region. Amplimer sequencing demonstrated that the deduced amino acid sequence of the α1 subunit is homologous to two VSCC isoforms, α1C-a and α1C-d. Furthermore, quantitative PCR was used to study the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and analogs on the levels of L-type VSCC mRNA. It was found that 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates the α1C transcript levels at a physiological dose (1 nM), and vitamin D analog studies suggest that this down-regulation involves the nVDR.

Nutr. 1986; 6: 527-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

DISCUSSIONWe cloned a portion of the cDNA encoding the ROS 17/2.8 L-type VSCC α1 subunit and found it to encode a protein product identical with two isoforms of the cardiac VSCC, α1C-a and α1C-d in the fourth transmembrane region. The α1C isoform was also identified in primary rat calvarial osteoblasts. It is not surprising that both of these isoforms exist in osteoblastic cells, given that they are found in a variety of tissues and cells such as lung (25Biel M. Hullin R. Freundner S. Singer D.

While it has been known for some time that various cells of the osteoblastic lineage contain functional Ca2+ channels, the molecular nature of these channels has only recently been studied in ROS 17/2.8 cells using an RT-PCR experimental strategy (27Meszaros J.G. Franceschi R.T. Karin N.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abst.): 1830Google Scholar). Barry et al. (28Barry E.L. Gesek F.A. Froehner S.C. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10914-10918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) extended these studies to show that UMR-106 osteosarcoma cells contain skeletal (α1S), cardiac (α1C), and neuroendocrine (α1D) isoforms of the L-type Ca2+ channel in a small region of the α1 cDNA. With regard to α1C, we find evidence for two cardiac isoforms, α1C-a and α1C-d, in ROS 17/2.8 cells. Interestingly, it has been reported that when UMR-106 cells are subjected to chronic mechanical strain, they acquire a calcium conductance that responds to hypotonic swelling and can be blocked by antisense RNA to α1C (29Duncan R.L. Kizer N. Barry E.L. Friedman P.A. Hruska K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of Ca2+ channel expression in osteoblasts may be complex, being affected by hormonal and mechanical interactions as well as the stage of cell differentiation (30Meszaros J.G. Franceschi R.T. Karin N.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).Osteoblasts are generally considered to be nonexcitable cells that share few characteristics with excitable cells in skeletal and cardiac muscle. With regard to plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability, an obvious difference between osteoblasts and the excitable tissues is the total number of the functional VSCCs expressed. ROS 17/2.8 cells express between 1000 and 2000 functional L-type Ca2+ channels per cell (5Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while differentiated myocytes contain at least 10 times this level (31Caffrey J.M. Brown A.M. Schneider M.D. Science. 1987; 236: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This difference in VSCC levels is also apparent at the mRNA level, in which standard Northern blotting techniques used routinely for excitable tissues are frequently incapable of detecting low levels of VSCC mRNA in cells such as ROS 17/2.8. Given our findings that osteoblasts express VSCC isoforms common to cardiac tissues, osteoblasts may represent a “hybrid” between excitable and nonexcitable cells that may possess unique characteristics that relate to function. One such function of osteoblasts in their bone microenvironment is the ability to regulate the secretion of various matrix proteins in response to hormonal and mechanical stimuli.Over the past decade, 1,25(OH)2D3 has emerged as an important hormone in the physiology of many tissues. While generally considered a resorptive hormone in bone, it has anabolic effects on the expression of many extracellular matrix proteins that contribute to bone mass. In fact, the majority of the bone/extracellular matrix genes under regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3 are up-regulated by the seco-steroid-including genes encoding alkaline phosphatase (32Kyeyune-Nyombi E. Lau K.-H.W. Baylink D.J. Strong D.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), osteocalcin (4Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F.

In this study, we report that the α1C Ca2+ channel expressed by osteoblastic cells is down-regulated at the mRNA level following exposure to 1 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 for 48 h. This finding is one of a handful of genes negatively regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 which include aggrecan proteoglycan (33Horton Jr., W.E. Balakir R. Precht P. Liang C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24804-24808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Id (34Kawaguchi N. DeLuca H.F. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4569-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), atrial natriuretic peptide (35Li Q. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4934-4939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and collagen type I (36Lichtler A. Stover M.L. Angilly J. Kream B. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3072-3077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, it was shown that UMR-106 cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 8-24 h lost responsiveness to parathyroid hormone-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ (37Green J. Kleeman C.R. Schotland S. Ye L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1070-E1076PubMed Google Scholar). Although the contribution of L-type Ca2+ channels was not directly tested in their study using dihydropyridine channel blockers, it can be inferred that the channel down-regulation seen here after long term exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 may contribute to the diminished response. The data presented in this article clearly indicate that Ca2+ influx is unlikely to serve as the triggering signal for Ca2+ channel down-regulation, since exposure to 1 nM analog AT, which induces maximal Ca2+ influx in ROS 17/2.8 cells, does not alter α1C mRNA levels. It is therefore doubtful that the Ca2+-mobilizing effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 alone are responsible for the decreased levels of VSCC mRNA. The finding that analog BT alone can negatively regulate the steady state levels of the Ca2+ channel transcript strongly suggests that the genomic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 mediated through the nVDR may be responsible for our observations. The question remaining is whether or not the down-regulation is a transcriptional one caused by direct interaction of the hormone-receptor complex with regulatory regions of the VSCC gene or whether a distinct mechanism exists. For example, our laboratory has noted in ion transport assays that VSCCs are maximally active in growth phase cells (50-80% confluent), suggesting that VSCC expression and/or activity can be linked to growth and proliferation, which in turn may be influenced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Experiments are under way to determine definitively whether the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on VSCC mRNA levels require a functional nVDR.In summary, this study provides evidence for the identity of L-type Ca2+ channel isoforms (α1C) in osteoblastic cells. Furthermore, the demonstration that 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates the steady state levels of mRNA encoding VSCCs points out the interdependence of the rapid, membrane-initiated, and genomic effects of this hormone. By affecting the biosynthesis of the VSCCs at a genomic level, 1,25(OH)2D3 can alter membrane permeability to Ca2+ and thus the capacity of the osteoblast to respond to a variety of hormones unique to bone physiology.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while differentiated myocytes contain at least 10 times this level (31Caffrey J.M. Brown A.M. Schneider M.D. Science. 1987; 236: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This difference in VSCC levels is also apparent at the mRNA level, in which standard Northern blotting techniques used routinely for excitable tissues are frequently incapable of detecting low levels of VSCC mRNA in cells such as ROS 17/2.8. Given our findings that osteoblasts express VSCC isoforms common to cardiac tissues, osteoblasts may represent a “hybrid” between excitable and nonexcitable cells that may possess unique characteristics that relate to function. One such function of osteoblasts in their bone microenvironment is the ability to regulate the secretion of various matrix proteins in response to hormonal and mechanical stimuli. Over the past decade, 1,25(OH)2D3 has emerged as an important hormone in the physiology of many tissues. While generally considered a resorptive hormone in bone, it has anabolic effects on the expression of many extracellular matrix proteins that contribute to bone mass. In fact, the majority of the bone/extracellular matrix genes under regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3 are up-regulated by the seco-steroid-including genes encoding alkaline phosphatase (32Kyeyune-Nyombi E. Lau K.-H.W. Baylink D.J. Strong D.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), osteocalcin (4Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F.

In this study, we report that the α1C Ca2+ channel expressed by osteoblastic cells is down-regulated at the mRNA level following exposure to 1 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 for 48 h. This finding is one of a handful of genes negatively regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 which include aggrecan proteoglycan (33Horton Jr., W.E. Balakir R. Precht P. Liang C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24804-24808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Id (34Kawaguchi N. DeLuca H.F. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4934-4939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and collagen type I (36Lichtler A. Stover M.L. Angilly J. Kream B. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3072-3077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, it was shown that UMR-106 cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 8-24 h lost responsiveness to parathyroid hormone-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ (37Green J. Kleeman C.R. Schotland S. Ye L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1070-E1076PubMed Google Scholar). Although the contribution of L-type Ca2+ channels was not directly tested in their study using dihydropyridine channel blockers, it can be inferred that the channel down-regulation seen here after long term exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 may contribute to the diminished response. The data presented in this article clearly indicate that Ca2+ influx is unlikely to serve as the triggering signal for Ca2+ channel down-regulation, since exposure to 1 nM analog AT, which induces maximal Ca2+ influx in ROS 17/2.8 cells, does not alter α1C mRNA levels. It is therefore doubtful that the Ca2+-mobilizing effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 alone are responsible for the decreased levels of VSCC mRNA. The finding that analog BT alone can negatively regulate the steady state levels of the Ca2+ channel transcript strongly suggests that the genomic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 mediated through the nVDR may be responsible for our observations. The question remaining is whether or not the down-regulation is a transcriptional one caused by direct interaction of the hormone-receptor complex with regulatory regions of the VSCC gene or whether a distinct mechanism exists. For example, our laboratory has noted in ion transport assays that VSCCs are maximally active in growth phase cells (50-80% confluent), suggesting that VSCC expression and/or activity can be linked to growth and proliferation, which in turn may be influenced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Experiments are under way to determine definitively whether the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on VSCC mRNA levels require a functional nVDR. In summary, this study provides evidence for the identity of L-type Ca2+ channel isoforms (α1C) in osteoblastic cells. Furthermore, the demonstration that 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates the steady state levels of mRNA encoding VSCCs points out the interdependence of the rapid, membrane-initiated, and genomic effects of this hormone. By affecting the biosynthesis of the VSCCs at a genomic level, 1,25(OH)2D3 can alter membrane permeability to Ca2+ and thus the capacity of the osteoblast to respond to a variety of hormones unique to bone physiology.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) is a large (150 kDa) tetrameric (α2β2) protein at the periphery of the assembled PDC (1Reed L.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 7: 40-46Crossref Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 2Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). E1 is a highly regulated enzyme responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvic acid and the reductive acetylation of lipoic acid within the dihydrolipoamide acetyl transferase complex (E2). Phosphorylation of E1 by E1-kinase (bound to E2) and dephosphorylation by phospho-E1-phosphatase appears to be important in the regulatory process (3Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 227-234Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Hucho F. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 227-234Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). E2 is a macromolecular assembly of 60 identical (52 kDa) but highly segmented (four “domain”) proteins. A homodimer (51 kDa) known as dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) completes the PDC complex (5Pons G. Raefsky-Estrin C. Carothers D.J. Pepin R.A. Joved A.A. Jesse B.W. Ganapathi M.K. Samols D. Patel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1422-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ability to evaluate more closely the molecular basis of PDC function and its regulation improves continuously as subunit molecular recognition events are clarified and specific binding domains identified. E2 is thought by many to hold the key to understanding the PDC self-assembly process, its final quaternary structure, and its function (6Lessard I.A.D. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several aspects of PDC-E2 structure remain elusive. Monoclonal antibodies are becoming increasingly important in the process of defining subunit composition, alterations in subunit composition, and conformational epitopes associated with functional capacity (7McNally A.J. Motter K. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19736-19743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8McNally A.J. Mattsson L. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recently, due to a growing awareness of the role of PDC in a number of clinical disorders, there has been a concerted effort to identify and define new antibodies to PDC. It is especially important to identify antibodies capable of inhibiting PDC function and, hopefully, antibodies capable of identifying the dysfunctional PDC assembly. Thus, new approaches to the generation and characterization of useful antibodies have been explored. Most recently, these included the use of surface plasmon resonance to conduct competitive (i.e. indirect) epitope mapping studies with libraries of monoclonal antibodies (7McNally A.J. Motter K. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19736-19743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8McNally A.J. Mattsson L. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Structural information is needed beyond general knowledge of operational molecular specificity. In the case of complex multimeric protein antigens, it has not always been possible, even with monoclonal antibodies, to verify by indirect means the identity of individual target antigens or specific epitopes. This is particularly true in situations where antibodies must be used to investigate antigenic determinants that are limited in quantity. This issue is exacerbated in cases where the antigenicity of target proteins must be evaluated in situ to determine possible contributions of local environment on conformational epitopes and the differential presentation of otherwise occluded (i.e. cryptic) epitopes. In this study, we have addressed an opportunity to compare more closely the biochemistry and structural biology of normal PDC with that of an abnormal, extracellular form of PDC (or molecular mimic). Specifically, the structural diversity of PDC-E2 was investigated in human liver collected from normal individuals and individuals with diseased livers, including those with an autoimmune disease known as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). PBC results from autoimmune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts with progressive inflammatory scarring (9MacSween R.N. Sumithran E. Semin. Liver Dis. 1981; 1: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The association of PBC with high titer autoantibodies to mitochondrial antigens (AMA) has long been recognized and the possible significance discussed (9MacSween R.N. Sumithran E. Semin. Liver Dis. 1981; 1: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Surh C.D. Ahmed-Ansari A. Gershwin M.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2647-2652PubMed Google Scholar, 11Coppel R.L. Gershwin M.E. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 144: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is of considerable interest that the major AMA activity is directed against PDC-E2. We have previously reported the development and characterization of several different murine monoclonal antibodies specific for PDC-E2 (10Surh C.D. Ahmed-Ansari A. Gershwin M.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2647-2652PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies were found to recognize four different regions of PDC-E2 when evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with overlapping recombinant fragments (10Surh C.D. Ahmed-Ansari A. Gershwin M.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2647-2652PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the monoclonal antibodies showed typical mitochondrial immunofluorescence on biliary epithelium and on hepatocytes from patients with PBC, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or hepatocarcinoma (12Van de Water J. Turchany J. Leung P.S. Lake J. Munoz S. Surh C.D. Coppel R. Ansari A. Nakanuma Y. Gershwin M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, one of the eight antibodies (C355.1) showed greater intensity and specificity for the apical region of biliary epithelial cells only from patients with PBC. Similar results have also been obtained with affinity-purified anti-PDC-E2 and combinatorial (13Cha S. Leung P.S. Gershwin M.E. Fletcher M.P. Ansari A.A. Coppel R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2527-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Cha S. Leung P.S. Coppel R.L. Van de Water J. Ansari A.A. Ger M.E.

Pathol. 1995; 176: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Attempts to characterize this antigen have failed for a variety of reasons, including the small number and low viability of biliary epithelial cells in diseased livers. There is a clear need for both enabling new technologies and the implementation of alternative strategies to identify structural variations in PDC-E2. We have previously outlined new strategies for the enhanced detection and structural characterization of biopolymers by laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (e.g. Ref. 16Hutchens T.W. Yip T.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 576-580Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that laser desorption probe elements and the necessary energy absorbing molecules can be much more defined and independent of the empirical process imposed on them previously. Indeed, inert probe element “platforms” have been chemically and physically transformed (i.e. redesigned) at the molecular level to become active participants in both the process of analyte docking and the subsequent laser-induced desorption/ionization process (16Hutchens T.W. Yip T.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 576-580Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Because of the unique involvement of the probe element surfaces in both the analyte adsorption and desorption process, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) has been referred to simply as affinity mass spectrometry (AMS). Affinity mass spectrometry may be considered simply a solid phase mass spectrometric approach to molecular detection, the evaluation of molecular recognition, and a wide variety of in situ chemical and enzymatic reactions necessary for structural analyses. We present here our use of SELDI in the AMS mode to detect and help identify epitopes that distinguish normal PDC-E2 from what is apparently an abnormal form of PDC-E2 or a mimeotope (17Doig P. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Trust T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 753-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We demonstrate the ability to detect and map two important epitopes with very low levels of purified PDC-E2. One of these epitopes, or a highly reactive mimeotope, has also been detected at very low levels directly within target tissues and cells. The apparent structural diversity of “PDC-E2” observed in livers from patients with PBC is discussed in the context of three competing hypotheses, including the existence of conformation-dependent PDC-E2 epitopes, altered presentation (i.e. cryptic) of PDC-E2 epitopes after translocation to an extracellular location, and molecular mimicry. The SELDI technology provides a very high level of sensitivity and an opportunity to directly evaluate tissue sections, cells, or crude cell lysates. We believe the strategy and capabilities demonstrated here will find wide application in the study of other biomolecules present in trace quantities, especially those associated with disease states. Liver specimens were obtained from 9 patients with PBC, 3 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1 patient with α-trypsin deficiency, and 2 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The diagnosis of all patients was based on established disease criteria and confirmed by histologic review by an independent observer (18Van de Water J. Fregeau D. Davis P. Ansari A. Danner D. Leung P. Coppel R. Gershwin M.E. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2321-2324PubMed Google Scholar). Biliary epithelial cells were prepared as described (19Joplin R.E. Johnson G.D. Matthews J.B. Hambruger J. Lindsay J.G. Hubscher S.G. Strain A.J. Neuburger J.M. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We used the region of liver most likely to contain small intrahepatic ducts and ductules, which are the primary target of disease, rather than the larger interhepatic ducts. Approximately 30 g of liver was minced and incubated with 1 mg/ml type 1A collagenase with agitation for 4 h at 37°C. The resulting mixture was washed four times with PBS, the cells resuspended in 30 ml of PBS, layered onto 15 ml of Lymphoprep for density gradient separation, and centrifuged at 2400 rpm for 25 min. The cells at the differential density interphase were harvested and washed three times with PBS. The washed cells were then incubated with 5 mg/ml HEA125 (epithelial cell-specific monoclonal antibody) for 30 min at 37°C. After washing three times with PBS, 1 ml of washed sheep anti-mouse IgG-Dynabeads (Dynal) in 7 ml of PBS were added to the cells and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, followed by magnetic separation (20Joplin R. Strain A.J. Neuberger J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We utilized a mouse monoclonal antibody, termed C355.1, that is specific to PDC-E2 but produces a distinctive staining pattern of biliary epithelial cells of patients with PBC as well as a non-disease-specific PDC-E2 mAb, C150, as a control. As an additional control, we used an irrelevant mAb (SAG-1) throughout (10Surh C.D. Ahmed-Ansari A. Gershwin M.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2647-2652PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van de Water J. Turchany J.

The characteristics of these mAbs have been described in detail previously (10Surh C.D. Ahmed-Ansari A. Gershwin M.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2647-2652PubMed Google Scholar). The generic use of this methodology has been previously published in detail (16Hutchens T.W. Yip T.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 576-580Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 21Yip, T.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 81Google Scholar, 23Hutchens T.W. Yip T.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 92Google Scholar). Energy absorbing molecules such as sinapinic acid or α-cyano-4-OH-cinnamic acid were prepared in 60% acetonitrile/0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot of 1-2 μl was deposited on the sample affinity captured on the probe (SEAC) device and allowed to air dry. The resulting sample preparations were analyzed with either a modified Hewlett Packard 1700XP laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight or a Molecular Analytical System SELDI mass spectrometer. The instruments were supplied with three-stage ion optic assembly with a variable high voltage source (up to 30 kV potential) and a 1.5-2.0-m flight pathlength. Laser pulses were generated from either a nitrogen laser or a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. The nitrogen laser (model VSL 377 ND from Laser Science, Inc., Boston, MA) generates up to 300 mJ/pulse maximum output with a 3-ns pulse width at a variable repetition rate of 0.2-5 Hz. The spot size is an ellipse with a long axis width of 180 mm and a short axis width of 80 mm. The Nd:YAG laser (Lumonics, Livonia, MI or Continuum, Santa Clara, CA) generates several (up to 90) mJ/pulse as output with a 3-ns pulse (at a 0.03-3-mm2 spot size) width at a repetition rate of 10-20 Hz. The spot size is an ellipse with a long axis width of about 100 mm and a short axis width of about 50 mm. The laser irradiance was adjusted real-time, while monitoring the process on an oscilloscope or computer, in order to achieve optimum ion signal (significant signal versus maximum resolution). Ion signals were detected on the Hewlett Packard 1700XP using a secondary ion generator with an array of microchannel plates; one N-type microchannel plate followed by a high output technology (HOT) microchannel plate manufactured by Galileo Electro-Optics Corp. (Sturbridge, MA). The microchannel plates are held at a constant −1000 V and the secondary ion generator was set for post acceleration with a potential of −5 kV. The SELDI instrument from MAS uses a discrete dynode electron multiplier (Hamamatsu Corp, Bridgewater, NJ) with microchannel plates, and the signals were amplified using a fast pre-amplifier prior to being recorded by transient recorder capable of fast signal averaging. Data was captured with a 400-500 megasample/s digital oscilloscope with a 350 MHz bandwidth and analyzed on PC-based software. Spectra presented typically represent the average of 50-250 shots unless otherwise stated. The antigen specificity of the monoclonal antibodies C355.1 and C150 and the sensitivity of the AMS technique with PDC was performed as follows. C150 or C355.1 monoclonal antibodies were immobilized on Protein G-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The pure PDC antigen was prepared as described previously (18Van de Water J. Fregeau D. Davis P. Ansari A. Danner D. Leung P. Coppel R. Gershwin M.E. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2321-2324PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of PDC was incubated with a slurry of beads bound to either C355.1 or C150 at 4°C for 30-60 min. The beads were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, then with 50 mM ammonium citrate, and, finally, with water. An aliquot of 0.5 μl of the beads was added to the mass spectrometer probe element, followed by an aliquot of 1 μl of sinapinic acid, and the mixture was allowed to air-dry. The samples were analyzed with a mass spectrometer, and averages from 250 laser shots were obtained from multiple spots on each sample. The sample of PDC affinity captured on monoclonal antibodies immobilized on Protein G-agarose beads were further washed with 3 M urea in phosphate-buffered saline, then with 50 mM ammonium citrate, and, finally, with water. An aliquot of 0.5 μl of the beads was added to the mass spectrometer probe element, an aliquot of 1 μl of sinapinic acid was added, and the mixture was allowed to air-dry. The samples were analyzed with a mass spectrometer, and averages from 250 laser shots were obtained from multiple spots on each sample. Various amounts (from 0.5-50 fmol) of PDC-E2, prepared as described (24Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S. Andrews P.C. Chang C.L. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

Each well was probed with C150 or C355.1 monoclonal antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, by incubating with shaking at 25°C for 1-2 h. In another series of wells, 10 fmol of PDC-E2 was immobilized and then probed with serial dilutions (100-18,000-fold) of C150 or C355.1 mAb under the same conditions. The unbound antibodies were washed away with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7. Each well was then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Calbiochem, 1 mg/ml, diluted 5000-fold in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7). The wells were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, then with 50 mM ammonium citrate, and finally with water. A synthetic phosphopeptide, Gly-Leu-phosphoSer-Pro-Ala-Arg (680 Da, prepared in TWH laboratory), in 50 mM ammonium carbonate, 0.05 mM MgCl2, pH 9.5, was added to monitor the activity of bound alkaline phosphatase. The amount of dephosphorylated peptide (600 Da) produced indicates the amount of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies bound to the immobilized enzyme sample. Nitrogen laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to detect both the substrate and product peptide with α-cyano-4-OH-cinnamic acid as the energy absorbing molecule. This was performed on both frozen liver sections and isolated bile duct epithelial cells. Frozen liver sections (8 μm thick) on glass coverslips were cut up into approximately four 4-mm pieces. They were used either directly without treatment or fixed with 95% methanol, 5% acetic acid to facilitate handling. The purified bile duct epithelial (BDE) cells and the liver tissue were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7. An aliquot of 5 μl of C150 or C355.1 monoclonal antibodies was added and allowed to incubate at 25°C in a moist chamber for 30-60 min. For the controls, the cells or tissue were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline only. The cells or tissue were washed with 3 M urea in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, then with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, an aliquot of 5 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Calbiochem, 1 mg/ml, diluted 5000-fold in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7) was added and allowed to incubate at 25°C in a moist chamber for 30-60 min. The cells or tissue were washed with 3 M urea in phosphate-buffered saline, then with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, with 50 mM ammonium citrate, and finally with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. An aliquot of 5 μl of synthetic phosphopeptide (Gly-Leu-phosphoSer-Pro-Ala-Arg) in 50 mM ammonium carbonate, 0.05 mM MgCl2, pH 9.5, was added and allowed to incubate at 25°C in a moist chamber for various periods of time. For the liver sections on glass coverslips, an aliquot of 2 μl of α-cyano-4-OH-cinnamic acid was added and allowed to air-dry. For the BDE cells, after brief centrifugation to remove the cells, an aliquot of 0.5 μl of the supernatant was mixed with an aliquot of 1 μl of α-cyano-4-OH-cinnamic acid on the mass spectrometer probe and allowed to air-dry. The samples were analyzed with a mass spectrometer, and averages from 250 laser shots were obtained from multiple spots on each sample. C150 and C355.1 mAbs were immobilized separately on Affi-Prep 10 polymer beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The PBC liver homogenate was prepared by homogenization in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. An aliquot of PBC liver homogenate was incubated with a slurry of either C355.1- or C150-bound beads at 4°C for 18 h. The beads were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7, then with 50 mM ammonium citrate, and, finally, with water. An aliquot of 0.5 μl of the beads was added to the mass spectrometer probe element, followed by an aliquot of 1 μl of sinapinic acid, and the mixture was allowed to air-dry. The samples were analyzed with a mass spectrometer, and averages from 250 laser shots were obtained from multiple spots on each sample. The mass spectra were analyzed by IBM-compatible computers using the softwares HP MALDITOF (Hewlett Packard) and GRAMS/386 (Galactic Industries Corp). The software evaluates the noise of the base line relative to the peaks and automatically set peak detection factors such as data smoothing (noise filter or data bunching), minimum area and height reject thresholds, minimum detectable slope, fused/shoulder peaks detection, and grouped peaks detection. Peak area was estimated by Gaussian fit. Normal statistical protocols such as standard deviation and linear regression were used to analyze the data. Fig. 1 shows the design and architecture of the laser desorption SEAC probe of the biomolecular reagents necessary for the detection of PBC antigenic determinants. The presence of specific marker analyte, in this case either PDC-E2 or the PDC-E2-like PBC antigen, is amplified by the coupled enzymatic conversion of substrate to product directly in situ (i.e. on the probe surface). SEAC probes of this type were used to demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of the C355.1 and control C150 mAbs. Fig. 2A shows the use of SEAC probes with surface-immobilized PDC-E2 (three different PDC-E2 ligand densities) used with SELDI in the AMS mode to model the recognition of membrane bound PDC-E2 antigens with the C355.1 (PBC-specific) monoclonal antibodies. Fig. 2B shows the use of these same SEAC probes to compare the recognition affinity and specificity of C355.1 mAbs (PBC-specific) and C150 mAbs (control) for the surface-immobilized PDC-E2. The utility of AMS for quantitation of surface-immobilized PDC-E2 with C355.1 and C150 mAbs was determined to be significant over the background signal at 0.5 fmol of surface-immobilized antigen. The product peak increased in intensity, with a corresponding decrease of substrate peak intensity when increasing amounts of surface-immobilized antigens were probed with the mAbs. Since the efficiency of immobilization of femtomole quantities of PDC-E2 on a 96-well plate is difficult to estimate, this represents only a semiquantitative estimation of the detection sensitivity and response. Serial dilutions of C150 or C355.1 monoclonal antibodies were also used to detect 10 fmol of immobilized PDC-E2. A significant difference in efficacy was detected for the two mAbs. An 18,000-fold dilution of C150 could still generate a strong product peptide signal, whereas a 600-fold dilution of C355.1 reduced the signal to just over background (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Detection sensitivity of surface immobilized antigen by AMS with enzyme-linked signal amplification. A, 0.5-50 fmol of PDC-E2 were immobilized on a 96-well plate. Each well was probed with C150 or C355.1 monoclonal antibodies. The amount of dephosphorylated peptide (600 Da, Product) produced indicates the amount of marker-specific monoclonal antibodies bound to the immobilized PDC-E2 sample. The x-axis delineates the peptide mass/charge values, and the y-axis represents the intensity of the peptide ion signal detected. Blank wells as well as an irrelevant monoclonal antibody (SAG-1) were used as controls and showed a small amount of background product peak formation. A significant increment over the background signal was detected for 0.5 fmol of surface immobilized antigen when probed with C355.1 mAb. This product peak increased in intensity with a corresponding decrease of substrate peak intensity when increasing amounts of surface immobilized PDC-E2 were probed with the mAbs. B, serial dilutions of the mAbs C150 or C355.1 were used to detect 10 fmol of PDC-E2 immobilized on a 96-well plate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether a macromolecule specific to PBC could be detected in frozen liver sections using C355.1 and the control mAb C150, specimens from 9 patients with PBC and 6 control livers (1 normal and 5 disease controls) were analyzed by SELDI in the AMS mode with SEAC probes using the enzyme-linked amplification system. Our results indicate that an intense C355.1 specific product signal is present at 600 Da (mass/charge) in 9/9 of the PBC samples, but was found in much lower intensities in the 5 disease controls or the normal control liver (Fig. 3A). There were variations in avidity among the PBC patients as expected. However, the specificity and intensity of the si"

Previous work in our laboratory has established that BCR is a substrate for c-FES, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase linked to myeloid growth and differentiation. Tyrosine phosphorylation led to the association of BCR with the RAS guanine nucleotide exchange complex GRB2-SOS in vivo via the GRB2 SH2 domain, linking BCR to RAS signaling (Maru, Y., Peters, K. L., Afar, D. E. H., Shibuya, M., Witte, O. N., and Smithgall, T. E. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 835-842). In the present study, we demonstrate that BCR Tyr-246 and at least one of the closely spaced tyrosine residues, Tyr-279, Tyr-283, and Tyr-289 (3Y cluster), are phosphorylated by FES both in vitro and in 32Pi-labeled cells. Mutagenesis of BCR Tyr-177 to Phe completely abolished FES-induced BCR binding to the GRB2 SH2 domain, identifying Tyr-177 as an additional phosphorylation site for FES. Co-expression of BCR and FES in human 293T cells stimulated the tyrosine autophosphorylation of FES. By contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR by FES suppressed BCR serine/threonine kinase activity toward the 14-3-3 protein and BCR substrate, BAP-1. These data show that tyrosine phosphorylation by FES affects the interaction of BCR with multiple signaling partners and suggest a general role for BCR in non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase regulation and signal transduction.

These data show that tyrosine phosphorylation by FES affects the interaction of BCR with multiple signaling partners and suggest a general role for BCR in non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase regulation and signal transduction. The human BCR gene encodes a 160-kDa protein (BCR) with multiple biochemical functions. The N-terminal portion of BCR is a structurally distinct protein kinase capable of autophosphorylation on serine and threonine residues (1Timmons M.S. Witte O.N. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar, 2Maru Y. Witte O.N. Cell. 1991; 67: 459-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This region of BCR also binds and phosphorylates BAP-1, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family that has been implicated in BCR and BCR-ABL function (3Reuther G.W. Fu H. Cripe L.D. Collier R.J. Pendergast A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The central domain of BCR is homologous to guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for RHO-related GTPases (4Chuang T.H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), while the C-terminal region exhibits GTPase-activating protein activity toward these small G-proteins (5Diekmann D. Brill S.

Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, BCR may regulate multiple small GTPases involved in mitogenic signaling, cytoskeletal organization, and regulation of NADPH oxidase activity in phagocytes (7Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 8Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A.

BCR was first discovered in the context of BCR-ABL, the transforming tyrosine kinase associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (11Sawyers C.L. Cancer Surv. 1992; 15: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal, BCR-derived sequences are essential for BCR-ABL transforming activity and serve several functions. The extreme N-terminal portion of BCR-ABL encodes a coiled-coil oligomerization domain that may promote BCR-ABL activation and is indirectly required for BCR-ABL cytoskeletal localization (12McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of the BCR kinase domain binds to the ABL SH2 domain in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner (13Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Maru Y. Witte O.N. Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This interaction has been proposed to release the ABL tyrosine kinase from negative regulation within BCR-ABL. BCR-derived sequences are also involved in BCR-ABL signal transduction. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR Tyr-177 within BCR-ABL leads to direct interaction with the RAS guanine nucleotide exchange complex GRB2-SOS via the GRB2 SH2 domain (14Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). BCR-ABL has also been linked to the SHC adaptor protein (15Puil L. Liu J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Bowtell D. Pelicci P.G. Arlinghaus R. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 16Goga A. McLaughlin J. Afar D.E.H. Saffran D.C. Witte O.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 981-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), although the specific mechanism of BCR-ABL/SHC interaction is unknown. Both pathways may contribute to the activation of RAS, which is required for transformation by BCR-ABL (17Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Witte O.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence implicates normal BCR as a tyrosine kinase substrate and possible signaling intermediate. For example, BCR forms heteromeric complexes with BCR-ABL and is phosphorylated by BCR-ABL on multiple tyrosine residues including Tyr-177, the GRB2 binding site (18Lu D. Liu J. Campbell M. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Canaani E. Arlinghaus R. Blood. 1993; 82: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liu J. Campbell M. Guo J.Q. Lu D. Xian Y.M. Andersson B.S. Arlinghaus R.B.

Biol. 1996; 16: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory has shown that BCR is a major transformation-related substrate for the v-FPS tyrosine kinase and its normal human homolog, c-FES (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation led to the association of BCR with GRB2-SOS in v-FPS-transformed fibroblasts via the GRB2 SH2 domain. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR by c-FES strongly enhanced the binding of BCR to multiple SH2 domains in vitro, including those from GRB2, RAS GTPase-activating protein, phospholipase C-γ, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1K. L. Peters, Y. Maru, D. E. H. Afar, and T. E. Smithgall, unpublished data.These data strongly suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR induces interaction with downstream effectors that contain SH2 domains and implicate BCR as a key intermediate in signaling pathways regulated by BCR-ABL, FPS/FES, and possibly other non-receptor tyrosine kinases. In the present study, we have mapped the specific tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by c-FES within the BCR N-terminal region both in vitro and in vivo. We observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR creates specific binding sites for the GRB2 and SHC SH2 domains, suggesting that BCR may couple FES to RAS signaling in a manner analogous to BCR-ABL. Unexpectedly, we observed that co-expression of FES and BCR in human cells stimulated FES tyrosine kinase activity while inhibiting BCR serine/threonine kinase activity toward the 14-3-3 protein, BAP-1. By contrast, co-expression of FES with a BCR mutant lacking the FES tyrosine phosphorylation sites completely blocked FES autophosphorylation in human cells. These data provide new evidence for BCR as an effector and regulatory protein for tyrosine kinases of the FPS/FES family and show that BCR is subject to regulation by tyrosine kinases in vivo. glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA encoding BCR N-terminal amino acids 162-413 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Tyr to Phe point mutants Y177F, Y231F, Y246F, Y316F, Y328F, Y360F, and deletion mutant Δ3Y (deletion of amino acids 276-283 containing Tyr-276, Tyr-279, and Tyr-Y283) were introduced into the pGEX-2T/BCR 162-413 construct using standard polymerase chain reaction-based techniques (23Briggs S.D.

Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GST-BCR 162-413 fusion proteins by recombinant FES was conducted in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 mM MgCl2) containing 1 μg of GST-BCR fusion protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN). Phosphorylation reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30°C and stopped by heating at 95°C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by storage phosphor technology (Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager). Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis are described elsewhere (24Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E.

The cDNA encoding full-length BCR was subcloned into pSP70 (Promega). A unique SacI-StuI BCR fragment was cut from pSP70/BCR and subcloned into pLSMA4 (a gift of Dr. Solon Rhode, Eppley Institute, University of Nebraska Medical Center). A unique BamHI-BglII BCR fragment was cut from pLSMA4/BCR and subcloned into pSP72 (Promega). BCR sequences encoding Tyr mutations in the 162-413 region were cut from the pGEX-2T constructs described above with NcoI and BglII and swapped with the corresponding wild-type BCR fragment in the pSP72/BCR construct. The resulting mutant fragments were cloned back through pLSMA4/BCR and pSP70/BCR to generate the full-length mutants. Full-length BCR wild-type or single Tyr to Phe mutants were then subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen) and the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The combination mutant Y177F/Y246F was made by replacing the StuI/RsrII fragment of full-length BCR Y246F with the corresponding fragment of BCR Y177F. BCR Y177F/Δ3Y, Y246F/Δ3Y, and Y177F/Y246F/Δ3Y were made by replacing the Δ3Y BssHII/SfiI fragment with the corresponding Y177F, Y246F, or Y177F/Y246F fragment.

Briefly, subconfluent monolayers of Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant BCR wild-type or mutant baculoviruses either alone or with a FES baculovirus. Forty-eight hours postinfection, the cells were sonicated in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mM Na3VO4, 0.05 mM Na2MoO4, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were clarified by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4°C, and 0.1 ml aliquots were diluted with 0.9 ml incubation buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.0 mM Na3VO4, 0.05 mM Na2MoO4, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin) and mixed with 100 nM immobilized GST-SH2 fusion protein. After 2 h of incubation at 4°C and then washing, the SH2-BCR protein complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with the anti-BCR antibody Rb-1. BCR wild-type or mutant proteins were transiently expressed either alone or with FES in 293T cells and then labeled with 32Pi as described elsewhere (26Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L.

BCR proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with an anti-BCR monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by storage phosphor technology.

FES autophosphorylation in the M2 immunoprecipitates and in the crude cell lysates was assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20; Transduction Laboratories). BCR was expressed either alone or with FES in human 293T cells and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the BCR monoclonal antibody. Phosphorylation of GST-BAP-1 was conducted in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of a GST-BAP-1 fusion protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30°C and stopped by heating at 95°C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by storage phosphor technology. A pGEX vector for expression of GST-BAP-1 was generously provided by Dr. Yoshiro Maru.

Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation by these kinases occurs within a region of the BCR N-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain defined by amino acids 162-413 (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N.

To determine which of these Tyr residues are targeted by FES, we created a family of GST-BCR 162-413 fusion proteins with individual mutations of tyrosines 177, 231, 246, 316, 328, and 360 as well as a deletion of the closely spaced tyrosines 276, 279, and 283 (3Y cluster; see Fig. 1). The GST-BCR 162-413 fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vitro with recombinant FES and [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 2, the wild-type GST-BCR 162-413 fusion protein was readily phosphorylated by FES as observed previously with the FES homolog, v-FPS (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M.

On the other hand, the Y246F and Δ3Y mutants were phosphorylated to a lesser extent than the wild-type fusion protein, suggesting that Tyr-246 and the 3Y cluster (Tyr-276, Tyr-279, and Tyr-283) may represent potential phosphorylation sites for FES. This result was confirmed by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping (see below). All of the other mutant fusion proteins were phosphorylated to approximately the same extent as the wild-type. GST itself was not phosphorylated by FES in vitro (data not shown), indicating that all of the phosphorylation sites are located within the BCR-derived sequence. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the fusion proteins were phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine by FES (data not shown).Fig. 2Phosphorylation of GST-BCR 162-413 fusion proteins in vitro. Wild-type (WT) and mutant GST-BCR 162-413 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using glutathione-agarose. GST-BCR 162-413 proteins were phosphorylated with recombinant FES and [γ-32P]ATP and separated by SDS-PAGE. A, phosphorylated GST-BCR 162-413 proteins were detected by storage phosphor imaging. Autophosphorylated FES is also visible. B, Coomassie Blue stain of gel in A.

As shown in Fig. 3, FES-phosphorylated GST-BCR 162-413 wild type gave rise to two phosphopeptides. By contrast, the Y246F and Δ3Y mutants each yielded only one phosphopeptide, consistent with the prediction from Fig. 2 that these are phosphorylation sites for FES. The positions of the individual phosphopeptides observed with the mutants correspond to those observed in the wild-type tryptic map as determined by phosphopeptide mixing experiments (data not shown). All other point mutants resulted in a two-dimensional tryptic map identical to the wild type. These data indicate that Tyr-246 and one or more tyrosines in the 3Y cluster (Tyr-276, Tyr-279, and Tyr-283) are phosphorylated by FES in vitro. Phosphorylation of BCR by v-FPS and c-FES induces GRB2 binding via the GRB2 SH2 domain (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is predicted to occur via Tyr-177 as demonstrated previously with BCR-ABL (14Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 15Puil L. Liu J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Bowtell D. Pelicci P.G. Arlinghaus R. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To our surprise, FES did not detectably phosphorylate the GST-BCR fusion protein on Tyr-177 in vitro (Fig. 3). To determine whether the lack of GST-BCR Tyr-177 phosphorylation was unique to FES, we phosphorylated the wild-type and Y177F mutant fusion proteins with the p185 form of BCR-ABL and performed two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis. The resulting phosphopeptide maps were identical, indicating that BCR-ABL also failed to phosphorylate GST-BCR on Tyr-177 in vitro (data not shown). These results suggest that Tyr-177 is only phosphorylated to a minor extent or may not be accessible for phosphorylation in the context of the fusion protein. However, GRB2 SH2 domain binding experiments with full-length BCR clearly indicate that Tyr-177 is phosphorylated by FES in living cells (see below). To verify that the same BCR sites phosphorylated by FES in vitro are also utilized in living cells, full-length BCR was expressed either alone or with FES in human 293T cells and labeled with 32Pi. Labeled BCR was immunoprecipitated and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis and two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. As shown in Fig. 4A, BCR was phosphorylated primarily on Ser when expressed alone but was additionally phosphorylated on tyrosine when co-expressed with FES. Fig. 4B shows that BCR alone gives rise to nine Ser/Thr phosphopeptides, which are likely to arise from BCR autophosphorylation. Co-expression of BCR with FES gave rise to three additional phosphopeptides (Fig. 4B, peptides a, b, and c). Phosphoamino acid analysis of these three new phosphopeptides showed that they contain phosphotyrosine (data not shown). To identify the BCR tyrosines phosphorylated by FES in vivo, FES was co-expressed with full-length BCR proteins containing the same series of tyrosine mutations shown in Fig. 1. The co-transfected cells were labeled with 32Pi, and BCR was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by two-dimensional tryptic mapping. As shown in Fig. 4B, mutation of Tyr-246 caused the loss of peptide b, while deletion of the 3Y cluster (Tyr-276, Tyr-279, and Tyr-283) caused the loss of peptide a. None of the point mutants in the BCR 162-413 region affected the phosphorylation of peptide c, indicating that this phosphorylation site falls outside of the 162-413 region (data not shown). Two-dimensional tryptic mapping also showed that co-expression of BCR with FES caused the loss of serine phosphopeptide 9 from BCR (Fig. 4B). This observation suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR by FES may affect BCR autophosphorylation in vivo. As described in more detail below, Tyr phosphorylation of BCR by FES also reduced the Ser/Thr kinase activity of BCR toward the 14-3-3 protein, BAP-1. Alternatively, phosphorylation of this peptide on tyrosine may affect its position in the two-dimensional map. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that transformation of 3Y1 cells with the FES homolog v-FPS led to BCR/GRB2-SOS interaction via the GRB2 SH2 domain (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR by FES strongly enhanced BCR binding to the SH2 domains of GRB2, ABL, p85, and other signaling proteins in vitro (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).1 To identify the tyrosine residues responsible for recruitment of specific SH2 domains, SH2 binding assays were conducted with wild-type and tyrosine phosphorylation site mutants of BCR. Recombinant SH2 domains from ABL, GRB2, p85 (C-terminal), and SHC were incubated with Sf9 cell lysates expressing full-length BCR or the Y177F, Y246F, and Δ3Y mutants either alone or with FES. Following incubation and washing, bound BCR proteins were visualized by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, tyrosine phosphorylation induced strong association of BCR with all of these GST-SH2 fusion proteins. Note that the concentrations of the SH2 fusion proteins used in these experiments was 100 nM, which is within the range of binding constants for physiological SH2-target protein interactions (27Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Tyr-177 to Phe completely abolished the FES-induced binding of BCR to the SH2 domain of GRB2 but did not affect binding to the other SH2 domains (Fig. 5). This result clearly identifies BCR Tyr-177 as the FES-induced site of BCR-GRB2 interaction and indicates that Tyr-177 is an in vivo phosphorylation site for FES. Deletion of the 3Y cluster specifically abolished binding of BCR to the SHC SH2 domain, suggesting that phosphorylation of this BCR region by FES creates a binding site for the SHC SH2 domain. By contrast, all of the single tyrosine mutants as well as Δ3Y bound to the ABL and p85 SH2 domains following FES-mediated phosphorylation, indicating that more than one phosphotyrosine residue or a phosphotyrosine residue outside of the BCR 162-413 region mediates these binding interactions. Data shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR by FES greatly enhanced ABL and p85 SH2 domain binding, possibly by creating multiple phosphotyrosine-dependent sites. To test this hypothesis, SH2 binding assays were conducted using BCR proteins with all possible combinations of mutations of the FES phosphorylation sites (Y177F/Y246F, Y177F/Δ3Y, Y246F/Δ3Y, and Y177F/Y246F/Δ3Y mutants). As shown in Fig. 6, all of the BCR double mutants exhibited diminished binding to the ABL and p85 SH2 domains while the triple mutant (Y177F/Y246F/Δ3Y) did not bind to either of these SH2 domains. These results demonstrate that FES-mediated phosphorylation of multiple BCR tyrosine residues in the 162-413 region is required for maximal ABL and p85 SH2 domain binding. During the analysis of BCR phosphorylation in 32Pi-labeled 293T cells, we observed that co-expression of BCR with FES enhanced the phosphotyrosine content of FES. This finding suggested that FES-BCR interaction may activate FES in vivo. To test this idea directly, FES was expressed alone or with BCR in 293T cells, and tyrosine autophosphorylation was assessed both in anti-FES immunoprecipitates and clarifed cell lysates by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7, autophosphorylation of FES is very weak in vivo when expressed alone, consistent with published findings from other systems (28MacDonald I. Levy J. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Greer P.A. Meckling-Hansen K. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, co-expression of FES with BCR strongly activated FES autophosphorylation, leading to extensive BCR phosphorylation. The BCR mutants Y177F, Y246F, Δ3Y, Y177F/Y246F, and Y177F/Δ3Y, all of which are phosphorylated by FES, activated FES autophosphorylation to almost the same extent as wild-type BCR. However, co-expression with Y246F/Δ3Y, which is weakly phosphorylated by FES, did not activate FES. Co-expression with Y177F/Y246F/Δ3Y mutant, which lacks all known Tyr phosphorylation sites for FES, completely suppressed FES autophosphorylation. These results suggest that BCR can stimulate FES tyrosine kinase activity in vivo and that tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR is required for this effect. To determine if the effect of BCR on FES is unique to mammalian cells, the same experiment was conducted in Sf9 insect cells. As shown in Fig. 8, FES autokinase activity was very strong when expressed alone, and co-expression with wild-type and mutant forms of BCR had no additional activating effect. These findings suggest that FES kinase activity may be suppressed by a factor present in mammalian cells and that interaction with BCR overcomes this inhibitory effect, leading to activation (see “Discussion”). To verify that the effect of BCR on FES tyrosine phosphorylation was direct and not mediated by activation of another tyrosine kinase, we co-expressed BCR and a kinase-defective mutant of FES (K590E mutant) (24Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar) in 293T cells. No autophosphorylation of this FES mutant was observed in the presence or absence of BCR, indicating that stimulation of FES autophosphorylation by BCR requires the kinase activity of FES (data not shown). However, our data cannot rule out the possibility that BCR could inhibit a phosphotyrosine phosphatase unique to mammalian cells. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis shows that tyrosine phosphorylation may affect BCR autophosphorylation (Fig. 4). To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR affects its Ser/Thr kinase activity toward a substrate, BCR was expressed either alone or with FES in 293T cells followed by in vitro kinase assay with the 14-3-3 protein and BCR substrate, BAP-1 (3Reuther G.W. Fu H. Cripe L.D. Collier R.J. Pendergast A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9, co-expression with FES suppressed BAP-1 phosphorylation by BCR by more than 60%. Control experiments showed that equal amounts of BCR are present in each immunoprecipitate and that the end point of the reaction shown falls on the linear portion of the progress curve for the phosphorylation reaction (data not shown). We also verified that BAP-1 is not a substrate for FES and does not bind to FES (data not shown). These results indicate that Tyr phosphorylation of BCR by FES leads to suppression of BCR Ser/Thr kinase activity. Using a combination of tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and SH2 domain binding assays, we have identified BCR Tyr-177, Tyr-246, and one or more of three closely spaced tyrosine residues (Tyr-276, Tyr-279, Tyr-283, the 3Y cluster) as phosphorylation sites for FES in living cells. Phosphorylation of Tyr-177 and the 3Y cluster creates specific binding sites for the SH2 domains of GRB2 and SHC, suggesting that BCR may serve as an intermediate linking FES to the RAS signal transduction pathway. These results are consistent with our previous finding that tyrosine-phosphorylated BCR complexes with GRB2-SOS in fibroblasts transformed with the FES homolog, v-FPS (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BCR also possesses regulatory domains for small G-proteins of the RHO family, including RAC and CDC42 (5Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 6Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that activation of these GTPases is required for transformation by RAS and for normal and oncogenic signal transduction by tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 8Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In this regard, BCR may serve to integrate tyrosine kinase signaling through the RAS and RHO signaling pathways. A recent study has mapped several BCR tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated within BCR-ABL (20Liu J. Wu Y. Ma G.Z. Lu D. Haataja L. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Arlinghaus R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although FES shares some of these phosphorylation sites (Tyr-177 and possibly Tyr-283), both kinases phosphorylate unique BCR sites as well. For example, BCR-ABL but not FES phosphorylates BCR Tyr-360 (20Liu J. Wu Y. Ma G.Z. Lu D. Haataja L. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Arlinghaus R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), while FES uniquely phosphorylates BCR Tyr-246. Although the result of specific phosphorylation of BCR Tyr-246 by FES is unclear at present, it may create an additional site for the recruitment of SH2 domain effectors to the BCR N-terminal domain. Alternatively, phosphorylation of this site could affect SH2 domain binding indirectly by altering the conformation of the BCR N-terminal domain or influence BCR Ser/Thr kinase activity (see below). Data presented here suggest that BCR may serve as a positive regulator of FES tyrosine kinase activity in vivo. Like other cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases, FES has tyrosine autokinase activity that is readily detectable in an in vitro immune complex kinase assay. Autophosphorylation is also observed in vivo when FES is expressed in non-mammalian systems, such as Sf9 cells (Fig. 7). However, Tyr autophosphorylation of FES is strongly inhibited in mammalian cells (26Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28MacDonald I. Levy J. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Greer P.A. Meckling-Hansen K. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is regulated in trans by a factor unique to mammalian cells. Our results show that co-expression of FES with BCR strongly stimulated FES tyrosine kinase activity in human cells, suggesting that BCR is a positive regulatory factor for FES. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that the FES unique N-terminal and SH2 domains bind to BCR (21Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FES-BCR interaction may lead to displacement of a negative regulatory protein and release of FES tyrosine kinase activity. The ability of BCR to activate FES is in some ways analogous to the activation of the ABL tyrosine kinase within BCR-ABL. Like FES, the c-ABL tyrosine kinase may be negatively regulated by non-covalent association with a cellular factor, such as the recently described ABL binding protein, Abi-2 (30Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Fusion to BCR releases the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL, an effect that may be dependent upon direct interaction of the ABL SH2 domain with BCR-derived sequences (13Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Maru Y. Witte O.N. Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Such an interaction may prevent interaction with the ABL regulatory factor. Tyrosine phosphorylation is also likely to influence the serine/threonine kinase activity of BCR in vivo. Results shown in Fig. 9 demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR by FES suppresses BCR serine/threonine kinase activity toward the 14-3-3 protein BAP-1 (3Reuther G.W. Fu H. Cripe L.D. Collier R.J. Pendergast A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this suppression may involve decreased affinity of BCR for BAP-1 as a result of tyrosine phosphorylation. A recent study has shown that 14-3-3 proteins bind to serine-phosphorylated sequences within target proteins with high affinity and specificity but show no affinity for the unphosphorylated sequence (31Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of BCR by FES may inhibit the serine autophosphorylation of BCR in vivo (Fig. 4), resulting in the loss of a binding site for BAP-1 and other 14-3-3 proteins. The 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to link BCR and RAF in vivo, which may alter the subcellular localization and function of these kinases (22Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Decreased phosphorylation of BAP-1 as a result of FES-induced tyrosine phosphorylation may influence signal transduction by both BCR and BCR-ABL and affect their ability to interact with RAF or other signaling partners via 14-3-3 in vivo.

Some studies aimed to identify nucleotides at the PTF center. The nucleotides G2252 and G2253, which are at the helix-loop 80, were protected against kethoxal by the 3′-terminal CCA of P-site bound tRNA (19Moazed D. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A double mutant having both Gs altered was lethal and showed a reduced activity of peptide bond formation by approximately 50% (22Lieberman K.R. Dahlberg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16163-16169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent analysis presented evidence that G2252 is involved in canonical base pairing with C74 at the acceptor end of tRNA, thus obviously playing a role in the binding of the donor substrate at the P site region of the PTF center (23Samaha R.R. Green R. Noller H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Another study applied a random mutagenesis of the “Southern half” of the PTF ring (residues 2493-2606). With an elegant screening procedure, 21 mutations of 18 positions were found. Mutations at three positions blocked growth, one of which was universally conserved (Ψ2580). The observation that a mutation of Ψ2580 caused a 90% inhibition of the PTF activity led the authors to suggest that the sequence ΨGG2582 might be involved in the binding of the CCA-3′-end of tRNAs at the P site (24Porse B.T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we pursue a different strategy. Base pairing of the tRNA CCA-3′-end with a complementary UGG sequence of 23 S rRNA is the most likely explanation for experimental data gained with minimal substrates (25Krayevsky A.A. Kukhanova M.K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1979; 23: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Chladek S. Sprinzl M. Angew. Chem. 1985; 97: 377-398Crossref Google Scholar) and with tRNAs mutated in the CCA-3′-end (27Tamura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as substrates of the P-site region of the PTF center. The 23 S rRNA contains 55 UGG sequences, only two of which are universally conserved in non-mitochondrial 23 S-type rRNA, and are therefore candidates for binding the universal CCA-3′-end of tRNAs, possibly via canonical base pairing. One of these UGG sequences is U2249 to G2251 at the helix-loop 80, and the other is Ψ2580 to G2582 at helix 90, adjacent to the PTF ring. The U (Ψ) and the middle G were mutated in both sequences, and the effects on growth, expression, ribosomal assembly, and functions were studied in this and the accompanying paper (28Spahn C.M.T. Schäfer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The plasmid pNO2680 contains the E. coli rrnB operon under the control of the λ leftward promoter (29Gourse R.L. Stark M.J.R. Dahlberg A.E. Cell. 1983; 32: 1347-1354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This plasmid with the single point mutation A1067U in the 23 S rRNA gene (30Thompson J. Cundliff E. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) is called pNOt. Plasmids ptac-1 and ptac-2 carry the rrnB operon or the 23 rRNA gene, respectively, under the control of the tac-promoter (31Lewicki B.T.U. Margus T. Remme J. Nierhaus K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Plasmids ptac-1 and ptac-2 also contain the A1067U mutation that confers thiostrepton resistance. E. coli CJ236 (dut1, ung1, thi-1, relA1) was used for the preparation of uracil containing single-stranded DNA template for site-directed mutagenesis, and strain XL-1 Blue was used for propagating the M13 derivatives as well as the plasmids ptac-1 and ptac-2. XL-1 transformed with pCI857, which encodes the temperature-sensitive λ repressor and a neomycin resistance marker, was the host of the pNO2680 derivatives. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment, containing the 3′ part of the rrnB 23 S rRNA gene, was cloned into M13mp18 and used for oligo-directed construction (32Kunkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) of the mutations U2249C, G2250A, C2254U, C2507U, Ψ2580C, G2581A, and G2250A/C2254U. The double mutation C2507U/G2581A was constructed taking advantage of an M13mp18 derivative already carrying the mutation G2581A as a template for the introduction of the second mutation, C2507U. The EspI-PvuII fragments containing the base changes G2581A and G2250A were cloned into ptac-1 by performing a partial restriction of the vector with PvuII. The other mutants were cloned into ptac-2 using BamHI and EclXI. The EspI-XbaI fragment of the mutated ptac-1 or ptac-2 vectors was cloned into pNO2680, yielding a pNO2680 derivative carrying the A1067U mutation as well as the mutation in domain V of the 23 S rRNA gene. All base changes were verified by DNA sequencing (33Sanger F. Nickelsen F. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) of the M13 inserts and the reconstructed expression vectors. The DNA manipulations followed standard procedures (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidmann J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY1991Google Scholar), and competent cells for plasmid transfection were prepared according to the SEM protocol (36Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). 100 ml of 2 × YT (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.05 mg/ml neomycin was inoculated with XL-1/pCI857 transformed with the pNO derivatives. Cultures were grown until A560 = 0.1 and then shifted to 42°C. After 90 min at 42°C, the cultures were poured over crushed ice. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 0°C), 6 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl) containing 16% (w/v) sucrose and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml), and broken by freezing and thawing. Lysates were applied onto a 10-40% sucrose gradient in binding buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 6 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NH4Cl, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM spermidine, and 0.05 mM spermine) and centrifuged in a Beckman SW-40 rotor for 7.5 h at 80,000 × g. Fractions of polysomes, 70 S ribosomes, and 50 S subunits were collected, and rRNA was isolated by phenol extraction. The relative amount of mutant 23 S rRNA was determined by the primer extension method (37Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Borden A. Morgan E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) using the 1067U as a common marker for all constructs. The 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide used as primer was complementary to bases 1069-1087 of 23 S rRNA. Extension products were quantified by densitometry using a laser scanner (Epson GT-8000) and the WinCAM 2.0 software (Cybertech, Berlin). E. coli XL-1/pCI857 transformed with the pNO plasmids were grown at 30°C in 2 × YT (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml ampicillin to A560 = 0.2. Neomycin was omitted in the preparative culture because it interferes with the thiostrepton resistance of the isolated A1067U ribosomes, 2C. M. T. Spahn and K. H. Nierhaus, unpublished result. but it was added to 0.05 mg/ml in all stages before. The culture was shifted to 42°C to induce synthesis of the plasmid-born rRNA. After 2 h, cells were collected and lysed by lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml) in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl) containing 16% (w/v) sucrose by three freeze-thaw cycles. S-30 lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min in an SA600 rotor (Sorvall). The volume of the lysate was enlarged four-fold, and the final concentrations were 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 6 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NH4Cl, and 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The sample was loaded onto a 5-ml sucrose cushion (20% sucrose in 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 6 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NH4Cl, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol) in a Beckman SW-40 rotor, and the ribosomal particles were pelleted by centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 20 h. The crude ribosomes were redissolved in standard buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 6 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NH4Cl, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol), loaded onto a 10-30% (w/v) sucrose gradient in standard buffer, and centrifuged in a Beckman SW-27 rotor for 17 h at 40,000 × g. The fractions containing 70 S ribosomes were combined, and the ribosomes were pelleted in a Beckman SW-40 rotor by centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 20 h. Pellets were redissolved in standard buffer, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at −80°C. The protocol essentially followed Bartetzko and Nierhaus (38Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with the modifications of Rheinberger and Nierhaus (39Rheinberger H.J. Nierhaus K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The ionic conditions in all steps were 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 3 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NH4Cl, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM spermidine, and 0.05 mM spermine. Long poly(U) chains used in this system were isolated over a Sephacryl S-400 gel filtration column. In a volume of 225 μl, 45 pmol of 70 S ribosomes were incubated with 67.5 pmol of [14C]AcPhe-tRNAPhe (1,030 dpm/pmol) and 55 μg of poly(U) for 30 min at 37°C. Where indicated, thiostrepton was added to a final concentration of 1.6 μM. Two aliquots of 25 μl containing 5 pmol of 70 S were withdrawn and filtered over nitrocellulose to determine the amount of AcPhe-tRNAPhe bound to ribosomes. Poly(Phe) synthesis was started by mixing the rest of the binding mix (35 pmol of 70 S ribosomes) with 105 μl of charging mix (preincubated for 2 min, 37°C) containing 31.5 μl of 100,000 × g supernatant enzymes freed from tRNA, 0.2 mM GTP, 2 mM ATP, 4 mM phosphenolpyruvate, 10.5 μg of pyruvate kinase, 350 pmol of tRNAPhe, and 70,000 pmol of [3H]Phe (22 dpm/pmol). Aliquots of 25 μl were withdrawn at the indicated times, and the reaction was stopped by hot trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The two highly conserved UGG sequences in 23 S rRNA, UGG2582 and UGG2251, are shown in Fig. 1. The mutations C2507U, Ψ2580C, G2581A, and C2507U/G2581A are located in helix 90, and U2249C, G2250A, C2254U, and C2250A/G2254U are in helix-loop 80. C2507Δ/G2581A was obtained by chance and was included in the further analysis. The plasmids pNO2680 (29Gourse R.L. Stark M.J.R. Dahlberg A.E. Cell. 1983; 32: 1347-1354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and ptac-1 or ptac-2 (31Lewicki B.T.U. Margus T. Remme J. Nierhaus K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were used as expression vectors. ptac-1 contains the rrnB operon and, ptac-2 contains the 3′ part of the rrnB operon, including the gene for 23 S rRNA. Both genes are under the control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-inducible tac promoter and contain the mutation A1067U of 23 S rRNA, which confers resistance to thiostrepton. pNO2680 contains the rrnB operon under the control of the λ leftward promoter λPL. The promoter was blocked by the heat-labile CI857 repressor that was supplied by the plasmid pCI857. For the sake of clarity, we call the pNO2680 plasmid pNO(wt), where wt stands for wild type. The derivative pNOt carries the A1067U mutation in the 23 S rRNA gene (pNOt, where t stands for thiostrepton resistance) (30Thompson J. Cundliff E. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The effects of mutations under the control of the tac promoter (ptac derivatives) were tested by streaking the cells on plates in the absence or presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, whereas the plates with the mutations under the λPL promoter (pNOt derivatives) were incubated at 30 or 42°C. Cells containing the mutation C2507U, G2581A, C2507U/G2581A, and C2507Δ/G2581A were not able to form colonies when expressed, i.e. the mutations were dominant lethal. Ψ2580C showed a reduced size of the colonies when expressed from ptac-2 but grew well when expressed from pNOt. All the mutations within helix-loop 80 grew normal. The type of induction had no effect on the expression with the exception of Ψ2580C. The constructs C2507U, G2581A, C2507U/G2581A, and C2507Δ/G2581A in pNOt also showed a reduced growth in liquid cultures. When expression was induced at a cell density of A560 = 0.2 by shifting the temperature from 30 to 42°C, the growth was severely reduced after one dilution of the culture, and the doubling time was enlarged by a factor of two to three as compared with that of the wild type or the 1067U control. However, after prolonged incubation at 42°C, we observed that the cells resumed a normal growth rate, and after streaking them onto plates, they were also able to form single colonies at 42°C. We pursued this effect a little further with the mutant G2581A. A second site mutation in the plasmid was responsible for the observed effect.2 The severe growth effects seen with some of the mutants must not necessarily be due to ribosomes defective in a distinct essential function but rather due to assembly effects preventing the formation of active ribosomes. A sensitive measure for assembly defects are sucrose-density profiles of S30 extracts. Assembly defects will lead to accumulation of precursor particles and distort in a characteristic way the profile derived from wild-type cells (31Lewicki B.T.U. Margus T. Remme J. Nierhaus K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). S30 extracts were prepared from all pNOt constructs; the profiles of all the mutants were indistinguishable from that of the wild type. An example is shown in Fig. 2. None of the mutants, therefore, affected the assembly of 50 S ribosomal subunits. 50 S particles, 70 S ribosomes, and polysomes were isolated from sucrose gradients as indicated in Fig. 2. The 23 S rRNA was isolated from all fractions, and the relative amount of plasmid-born 23 S rRNA was determined using the A1067U mutation as a general marker (primer extension method, see Ref. 37Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Borden A. Morgan E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); this mutation, as mentioned above, mediates thiostrepton resistance. Generally, the fraction of plasmid-born 23 S rRNA was around 45% in all three ribosomal populations. The double mutations C2507U/G2581A and C2507Δ/G2581A were reduced in polysomes (27 and 33%, respectively). The fact that the same fraction of plasmid-born 23 S rRNA was found in the 50 S subunits and the 70 S ribosomes of all mutants indicate that the mutant 50 S subunits flow as easy into the pool of the 70 S ribosomes as the wild-type 50 S subunits and that they associate with 30 S subunits as well as wild-type 50 S subunits. This is another indication that the ribosomes containing mutant 23 S rRNA have achieved the same level of assembly maturation as the wild-type 50 S subunits. A reduced relative amount of the mutant 23 S rRNA in the polysomal fraction indicates that the functional turnover of mutant 50 S subunits in the ribosomal cycle is impaired. Possible reasons are a hampered capability to form initiation complexes, a reduced processivity, and/or an increased tendency toward frameshifts, which will cause a premature termination at out-of-frame stop codons. A summary of the growth effects and the relative amounts of the various mutant 23 S rRNAs in the 50 S subunits, 70 S ribosomes, and the polysomes is given in Table I.Table IGrowth on plates and distribution of mutant 23 S rRNA in polysomes, 70 S ribosomes, and 50 S subunitsGrowth on platesfraction of mutant rRNAtac promoterλPL promoterPolysomes70 S50 S%Wild type++NDNDND1067U++444546C2507U−−463949Ψ2580C±+494651G2581A−−474543C2507U/G2581A−−274850C2507Δ/G2581A−−334748U2249C++434540G2250A++494045C2254U++485532G2250A/C2254U++485736 Open table in a new tab One can anticipate that a mutation that exclusively affects the PTF center should not impair tRNA binding since only a small fraction of the A and P sites belong to the PTF center. Therefore, a normal tRNA binding to the A and P sites and a block in the PTF activity would be important indications for the specificity of the provoked ribosomal defect. Various functional tests were performed in this and the accompanying study (28Spahn C.M.T. Schäfer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that require a tRNA at a specific site but differ in their ionic conditions. Therefore, 70 S ribosomes were isolated from all mutants and analyzed for binding of AcPhe-tRNA under the various conditions. Poly(U) and the heteropolymeric MF-mRNA, which is 46 nucleotides long and contains the codons AUG-UUC only once in the middle (40Triana-Alonso F.J. Dabrowski M. Wadzack J. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6298-6307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), were used as templates (Table II). It is clear that in all cases mutant and wild-type ribosomes bound the tRNA to the same extent and that, therefore, none of the mutations alters the basic interactions between the sites (A and P) and tRNAs.Table IIBinding of AcPhe-tRNA to mutant ribosomes given as AcPhe-tRNA bound per 70 S ribosomePoly(U) 3 mM Mg2+Poly(U) 6 mM Mg2+MF-mRNA−thio+thio−EF-G+EF-G+EF-G−thio−thio+thioWild type1.060.861.110.550.580.491067U0.960.841.080.560.570.53C2507U0.920.751.090.540.580.50Ψ2580C0.950.761.030.510.540.52G2581A1.010.771.070.490.530.48C2507U/G2581A0.870.791.060.510.560.49C2507Δ/G2581A0.700.671.100.500.510.46U2249C0.800.681.040.490.500.47G2250A0.880.741.080.500.480.47C2254U1.100.881.030.520.510.47 Open table in a new tab The next step was to check whether the mutations influence the overall elongation cycle that can be tested with the poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis. An in vitro system with near in vivo characteristics concerning speed and accuracy was used to look at the influence of the mutations (38Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Rheinberger H.J. Nierhaus K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). [14C]AcPhe-tRNA was bound to poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosomes, and the incorporation of [3H]Phe was followed kinetically. In order to distinguish between chromosomal- and plasmid-born 23 S rRNA, the assays were performed in the presence or absence of thiostrepton (41Saarma U. Remme J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3147-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The effect of the addition of thiostrepton can be studied by comparing thiostrepton-sensitive ribosomes (wild-type ribosomes derived from pNO(wt)) with thiostrepton-resistant ribosomes (A1067U, derived from pNOt). The overall incorporation of Phe per ribosome is comparable for both ribosome preparations (Fig. 3, A and B). Addition of thiostrepton abolishes completely the activity of wild-type ribosomes (first panel), whereas the A1067U mutant still shows half of the activity in good agreement with the 46% fraction of plasmid-born ribosomes (Table I). Similar results are obtained when the hot TCA precipitable AcPhe residues are considered (second panel). Under this condition, AcPhe precipitates only if it heads a chain of oligo(Phe) with a minimal length of three Phe residues (42Pestka S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 136: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The number of precipitable AcPhe residues directly gives the number of ribosomes active in poly(Phe) synthesis since ribosomes do not recycle on poly(U) but translate as far as possible toward the 3′-end. Furthermore, under the conditions used, ribosomes with AcPhe-tRNA initiate poly(Phe) synthesis much faster than ribosomes without (38Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 43Wagner E.G.H. Jelenc P.C. Ehrenberg M. Kurland C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The statistical length of the poly(Phe) chains can thus be simply calculated from both the total Phe incorporation and the number of precipitable AcPhe residues (third panel), since practically all poly(Phe) chains carry an AcPhe residue at their N-termini. Fig. 3 shows that in the presence of thiostrepton, the chain growth of poly(Phe) occurs nearly as fast as that of the total ribosome population in the absence of thiostrepton, i.e. the A1067U mutation has practically no consequence for the ribosomal elongation cycle in our test systems. Results obtained with the mutants G2581A and C2507U/G2581A are demonstrated in Fig. 3, C and D. In the presence of thiostrepton, the total Phe incorporation per 70 S ribosome (first panel) is strongly reduced for the G2581A ribosomes compared with the control ribosomes A1067U. The overall Phe incorporation is the product of the active ribosomes (second panel) and the chain length (Phe/AcPhe; third panel). Both factors are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the average speed of elongation within the first 20 s is reduced by a factor of two for the mutant ribosomes (Fig. 4C). It follows that these mutant ribosomes are strongly affected in peptide synthesis and that the processivity is significantly impaired. The double mutant shows no significant activity in this assay. Fig. 4 shows a summary of the relative Phe incorporation per 70 S ribosome in the presence of thiostrepton compared with the corresponding activity without the drug (Fig. 4A), the active fraction of ribosomes in the presence and absence of the drug (Fig. 4B), and the average velocity of the ribosomes with plasmid-encoded 23 S rRNA compared with that of the control ribosomes A1067U (Fig. 4C). Note that the thiostrepton-sensitive part of the active fraction of ribosomes (Fig. 4B) is hardly affected by all ribosomes derived from pNOt derivatives. These thiostrepton-sensitive signals correspond to the wild-type fraction within the mixed population of ribosomes and represent a good internal control that only the mutated ribosomes are affected. All mutations in the helix 90 severely affect poly(Phe) synthesis. The G2581A and Ψ2580C ribosomes show a three-fold reduced Phe incorporation (Fig. 4A) caused by a reduction of the active fraction (Fig. 4B), and the elongation rate was retarded by a factor of two (Fig. 4C). As already mentioned, the C2507U/G2581A and also the C2507Δ/G2581A double mutants are practically inactive in the poly(U) translation system. The effects seen with the mutations in the helix-loop 80 are less pronounced but still significant. All mutations show a slightly reduced speed of elongation (Fig. 4C). The relatively strongest effect is seen with the G2250A mutation concerning the overall Phe incorporation (Fig. 4A). This effect is mainly due to a reduction of the active fraction of ribosomes (Fig. 4B). In this study and in the following paper (28Spahn C.M.T. Schäfer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), regions of helices 80 and 90 of the 23 S rRNA have been investigated for their possible involvement in the PTF reaction. Both regions contain a UGG sequence that is universally conserved among non-mitochondrial 23 S-type rRNA and has, therefore, the potential to bind the universal conserved CCA-3′-end of tRNAs via base pairing. Only a few mitochondrial 23 S-type rRNA from animals contain only two out of the three otherwise universally conserved UGG sequences (44Gutell R.R. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3055-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar); the corresponding ribosomes synthesize proteins with low efficiency and translate only a few mRNAs (45Takemoto C. Koike T. Yokogawa T. Benkowski L. Spremulli L.L. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Watanabe K. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In agreement with the high evolutionary conservation of both sequences, all mutations tested show some defect in the in vitro poly(Phe) translation system. However, none of the mutations introduced in helix 80 (U2249C, G2250A, C2254U, and G2250A/C2254U) affects the growth of the bacteria. This is not necessarily a contradiction. For example, the G2661C mutation of 23 S rRNA has no effect on bacterial growth until expressed in a mutant S12 background (46Tapprich W.E. Dahlberg A.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2649-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but the 23 S rRNA mutation alone significantly reduces the translational efficiency (47Bilgin N. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in the following paper (28Spahn C.M.T. Schäfer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the mutations introduced in helix 80 only slightly reduce the puromycin reaction. Therefore, none of the changed bases is essential for peptide bond formation. The effects of these mutations on the poly(Phe) synthesis is not caused by a specific block of a single elongation step, but rather the kinetic efficiency of A site binding, the translocation reaction, or the processivity might be affected. Among the altered bases is C2254, a base protected by an A site-bound tRNA (18Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that this protection is either an indirect effect or, alternatively, the interaction between tRNA and 23 S rRNA at this position is not essential. Furthermore, weakening or destruction of the base pair G2250-C2254 (i. e. the mutations C2254U and G2250A, respectively) have no disastrous effect on any of the ribosomal activities tested. It follows that this base pair does not seem to be required for functions of the ribosomal elongation cycle and might not even exist within the ribosome. In contrast, most of the mutations within helix 90 (C2507U, G2581A, C2507U/G2581A, and C2507Δ/G2581A) have a dominant lethal phenotype. At least the single mutations do not affect the assembly of the 50 S subunits and the flow of the assembled subunit into the polysome fraction. Poly(Phe) synthesis is severely impaired. In the following paper, we were able to demonstrate that the helix 90 mutations G2581A, C2507U/G2581A, and C2507Δ/G2581A completely block the puromycin reaction, and the mutation Ψ2580C drastically impairs this reaction (28Spahn C.M.T. Schäfer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Also C2507U reduces the AcPhe-puromycin formation by approximately 50%. Comparison of the poly(Phe) translation data with the results of the puromycin reactions (28Spahn C.M.T. Schäfer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) raises the following question. How is it possible that a ribosomal activity essential for protein synthesis such as peptide-bond formation is completely blocked in assay systems specifically testing this activity, whereas in systems testing the overall elongation such as poly(Phe) synthesis a significant although residual activity can be detected? Let us consider the G2581A mutation. In contrast to the total inhibition of the puromycin reaction, there is a strongly decreased but still significant activity of this mutant 70 S in the poly(U) translation system (~30% compared with the 70 S derived from pNOt). Various factors have to be considered for an explanation of this apparent discrepancy. First of all, one has to consider that the PTF activity is not the rate-limiting step of elongation and is much faster than A site occupation or translocation. It follows that even a severe effect on the rate of the PTF activity is not necessarily detected in a complete translation system. Second, the puromycin reaction takes place at 0°C and the poly(U) translation at 37°C. The higher temperature might cause a higher flexibility of the PTF center, thus partially overcoming the negative effect of the mutation. And third, the reactants in the poly(U) translation system, peptidyl-tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA, are bound to the ribosome mainly outside of the PTF center and are tightly fixed. If the mutation weakens the binding of the P site-bound CCA-3′-end but does not affect the stably fixed aminoacyl-tRNA at the A site, peptidyl transfer will occur when the loosely bound peptidyl residue has accidentally reached the correct position. In contrast, puromycin has only a low binding affinity to the A site (1.35 × 103 M−1) (48Welch M. Chastang J. Yarus M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, the sticking time is very short and most of the encounters of puromycin with the ribosome should be unproductive if the peptidyl residue is not tightly fixed at the PTF center. This feature of the puromycin reaction explains why a mutant can affect the puromycin reaction much more severely than an overall protein synthesis system such as poly(Phe) synthesis. Furthermore, a binding analysis of ligands for the A and P site regions of the PTF center revealed a positive cooperativity between these sites (49Ulbrich B. Mertens G. Nierhaus K.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 50Bourd S.B. Kukhanova M.K. Gottikh B.P. Krayevsky A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This cooperativity might be destroyed by a mutation that weakens the binding of the P site bound CCA-3′-end, therefore further reducing the low affinity of puromycin or a fragment that only binds to the A site region of the PTF center. Effects of this kind were also observed with other mutants, i.e. a strong or even complete inhibition in an assay system testing a partial but essential reaction for protein synthesis in contrast to an almost normal growth or activity in a complete translation system,. The G2583A, G2583C, and G2505A mutations are active in a poly(U) translation system but are inactive in AcPhe-puromycin formation. 3U. Saarma, C. M. T. Spahn, K. H. Nierhaus, and J. Remme, unpublished result. The A2503G mutation did not affect growth unless erythromycin was added, but the derived ribosomes were inactive or nearly inactive in a fragment assay (24Porse B.T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similar observations also have been reported with peptidyl-tRNA mutations. A mutated CCA-3′-end at position 74 abolished the activity as a PTF donor in a fragment reaction (27Tamura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but the corresponding tRNAs are active in vivo (51O'Connor M. Willis N.M. Bossi L. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutations at position A-76 also affect the fragment reaction more (27Tamura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) than an in vitro translation system (52Liu M. Horowitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10389-10393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the effects of the helix 90 mutations on poly(Phe) synthesis are caused by a severe distortion of the active center of the ribosomal PTF (28Spahn C.M.T. Schäfer M.A. Krayevsky A.A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32857-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The data clearly indicate that not only the single-stranded 23 S rRNA regions in the central loop of domain V are of high importance for ribosomal function but also the nucleotides at the top of helix 90.

Once TFIIIB is bound to DNA it binds extremely tightly as evident by it being insensitive to high salt concentrations or polyanions, and alone is responsible for the binding of Pol III to the start site.

The photoreactive DNA was used to radioactively tag protein(s) associated near specific sites on DNA using either highly purified proteins or crude protein extracts. The Brf subunit of TFIIIB has been shown to interact extensively with the central and 3′ end of the TFIIIB binding region or UBR and the B″ subunit (Mr≈ 90 kDa) to be associated with the 5′ end of the UBR by DNA photoaffinity labeling and DNase I footprinting (21Bartholomew B.

We have expanded the information garnered from DNA photoaffinity labeling by redesigning the photoreactive deoxyuridine nucleotide to have different linker arms connecting the photoreactive aryl azide to the nucleotide base to probe at various distances from the major groove of DNA. In this report we show that this series of deoxyuridine analogs could be effectively incorporated into DNA at specific sites using the exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and that these DNA probes were able to reveal additional details of the topography of the Pol III transcription complex. The 27-kDa subunit (or the TATA box binding protein) of TFIIIB was mapped to bps −26/−21 and ~19 to ~23 Å from the major groove of DNA. The proximity of the other two subunits of TFIIIB and several subunits of Pol III were examined at bps −26/−21, −17, and −3/−2, with +1 being the start site of transcription. Chemicals unless otherwise specified were obtained from Aldrich Chemical. All reactions were done under limited and indirect lighting using a 60 watt incadescent lamp. Para-azidobenzoic acid (4-ABA, Molecular Probes, Inc.) was esterified with N- hydroxysuccinimide using the coupling reagent dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and the product was recrystalized from anhydrous dioxane and ethyl ether (1:1) (25Chong P.C.S.

The N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of ABA (NHS-ABA) was coupled to glycine or glycylglycine or (glycyl)2 glycine (Sigma) to make ABA derivatives with 1-3 glycine(s) attached to the carboxylic group of 4-ABA (27Ji T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7167-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A typical reaction starts with all solutions on ice and contained 2 mmol of glycine (or glycylglycine or (glycyl)2 glycine) and 4 mmol of sodium bicarbonate in 4 ml of deionized water which was added to 2 mmol of NHS-ABA in 8 ml of dioxane with constant stirring. After 10-15 min, the reaction was transferred to room temperature and continued stirring for 24 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the product precipitated by adjustment of the pH to 2 with concentrated HCl. Products were recrystalized from deionized water. The azidobenzoyl-(gly)1-3 compounds were esterified with N-hydroxysuccinimide as described for ABA; except that dimethyl sulfoxide was used instead of dioxane because of the limited solubility of NHS-ABG3. Me2SO or dioxane was removed by vacuum centrifugation and the product was either recrystalized from dioxane/isopropyl alcohol (1:1) or impurities removed by extractions with hot petroleum ether. Residual solvent was evaporated off the final product by vacuum centrifugation. ABG-NHS was also obtained from Tae Ji at the University of Wyoming. The N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of azidobenzoyl-(gly)1-3 or the sulfosuccinimide ester of 4-(p-azidophenyl)butyric acid (ABU, Pierce Chemical Co.) were coupled to 5-[N-(3-aminoallyl)]-deoxyuridine triphosphate (5-aa-dUTP, Sigma) in a manner similar to that previously reported for the synthesis of 5-[N-(4-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]-deoxyuridine triphosphate (AB-dUTP) (20Bartholomew B.

A standard reaction had 100 μl of a 100 mM solution of the appropriate N-hydroxysuccinimide or sulfosuccinimide ester in dimethylformamide or Me2SO added to 100 μl of 10 mM 5-aa-dUTP in 100 mM sodium borate, pH 8.0, and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The nucleotide analogs were purified as described by DEAE A-25 chromatography and characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using polyethyleneimine cellulose-coated plates. The purification of ABG3-dUTP by DEAE A-25 chromatography used ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, rather than triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. Single products were detected by TLC analysis and RF values for AB-dUTP, ABG-dUTP, ABG2-dUTP, ABG3-dUTP, and ABU-dUTP of 0.010, 0.18, 0.29, 0.31, and 0.12, respectively, were observed. An estimated extinction coefficient for each nucleotide analog was obtained by adding the extinction coefficient for the aryl azide to that of 5-aa-dUTP at a specified wavelength. The maximum absorbance of azidophenylbutyrate is at a wavelength lower than that of azidobenzoate and azidobenzoyl-(gly)1-3 at pH 8.0 and is reflected in the UV spectra of ABU-dUTP, AB-dUTP, and ABG-dUTP. The extinction coefficients are 22 mM−1 cm−1 for AB-dUTP at 270 nm, 29 mM−1 cm−1 for ABU-dUTP at 250 nm, and 26 mM−1 cm−1 for ABG-dUTP, ABG2-dUTP, and ABG3-dUTP at 270 nm. The incorporation of these nucleotides into DNA were tested at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 50 μM by primer extension with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The photoreactive deoxyuridine nucleotide analogs were enzymatically incorporated at bps −26, −24, −22, −21 (−26/−21) or −17 or −3, −2 (−3/−2) on the nontranscribed strand of the SUP4 tRNA gene using immobilized single-stranded DNA (19Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DNA photoaffinity probes containing photoreactive deoxyuridine analogs at bps −26/−21 were synthesized in reactions containing 1 pmol of immobilized DNA of the transcribed strand of the SUP4 tRNATyr gene, 4 pmol of the specific oligonucleotide, ~6 pmol of [α-32P]dGTP (2000-3000 Ci/mmol), photoreactive dUTP (10 μM AB-dUTP or ABG3-dUTP, 5 μM ABG2-dUTP, 0.5 μM ABU-dUTP or ABG-dUTP), and 0.25 units of exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Amersham/U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in a final volume of 20 μl. After incubation at 37°C for 5 min, 2.5 μl of 5 mM unlabeled dNTPs were added and incubated for an additional 5 min. The region upstream of the specific oligonucleotide was synthesized and the 280-bp DNA fragment containing the SUP4 tRNATyr gene was isolated as described previously, except for the omission of washing the DNA beads with buffer D (1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). In the same manner DNA photoaffinity probes containing photoreactive deoxyuridine analogs were made at bps −17 and −3/−2, except that the modified nucleotide was incorporated first and unincorporated nucleotide removed by washing the immobilized DNA before the incorporation of [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]dCTP. The concentrations of photoreactive deoxyuridine nucleotides were the same for the DNA probes at bp −17 as that for bps −26/−21, but for the synthesis of DNA probes at bps −3/−2 the final concentration was 0.8 μM for all five nucleotides. RNA polymerase III transcription complexes were formed and photoaffinity labeled as described using protein extracts made from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains BJ926 or NZ9 (19Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NZ9 strain was kindly provided by Nick Zecherle and Benjamin Hall (University of Washington) and has the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase III epitope tagged at the N terminus with four copies of the octapeptide FLAG sequence (IBI/Kodak). Unless otherwise indicated all experiments were done using proteins derived from the BJ926 strain. After photocross-linking, the samples were treated with DNase I and S1 nuclease, and analyzed on a 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was exposed to XAR-5 film. In some experiments highly purified TFIIIB and TFIIIC were used instead of the 500 mM KCl fraction from Bio-Rex 70 chromatography of the S-100 extract and, in addition to photoaffinity labeling, were examined by gel-shift assay as performed previously (22Bartholomew B. Durkovich D. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Highly purified Pol III was obtained using a strain with the second largest subunit of Pol III histidine tagged and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (19Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The appropriate amount of Pol III to be added was determined by gel shift assay using a fixed amount of TFIIIB and TFIIIC. Transcription assays with the modified DNAs were conducted to examine the effect of the modification on the ability of the DNA to form competent transcription complexes and has been described previously (19Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A 200-μl photoaffinity labeling reaction was incubated at 25°C for 30 min, divided into 4-50-μl aliquots, and irradiated for 2 min. The samples were pooled together and digested with DNase I and S1 nuclease as described. After adjusting the pH to ~7 by the addition of 0.5 M Tris base, the concentration of NaCl was adjusted to 0.3 M, and then 3 volumes (750 μl) of buffer A (20 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet Nonidet P-40, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin) was added. Affinity purified rabbit anti-TBP antibody (1.64 μg) was added and the reaction incubated at 4°C overnight. The antibody-antigen complex was precipitated by the addition of 5 μl of fast flow protein-A/Sepharose 4B (6 mg/ml) equilibrated in buffer A and gently mixed for 1 h at 4°C. The Sepharose 4B resin was washed 3 times with 500 μl of buffer A, making sure to leave 20-30 μl of buffer behind each time. Eluted immunoprecipitated proteins from resin by the addition of one-fourth of the volume of the resin suspension of buffer B (10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 350 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and heating at 90°C for 3 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Molecular modeling of the photoreactive deoxyuridine analogs incorporated into B-DNA was performed using the TOM/FRODO program on a Silicon Graphics System. Possible conformations of the modified nucleotide were examined by adjusting the dihedral angles of the bonds from the methylene carbon atoms. The amide and allyl bonds were fixed in their planar conformation. The atomic coordinates of the DNA were taken from the crystal structure of the dodecamer CGCGAATTCGCG (Protein Data Bank code 1BNA) originally characterized by Dickerson and colleagues (30Drew H.R. Wing R.M. Takano T. Broka C. Tanaka S. Itakura K. Dickerson R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Deoxyuridine analogs having a photoreactive aryl azide attached by variable chain lengths were synthesized and incorporated into DNA to cross-link protein bound to DNA at different distances from the major groove of DNA in order to probe the structure of yeast RNA polymerase III transcription complexes. The nucleotide analogs all contained the initial linker consisting of an amino allyl group attached to the C-5 carbon of deoxyuridine. The amino group was used to attach on several aryl azido compounds containing one, two, three, or no glycine residues to create a ~4.3-Å incremental increase in the tether length used to attach the photoreactive moiety to deoxyuridine (Fig. 1). A more hydrophobic linker was also tested by making a nucleotide analog with a butyl group (ABU-dUTP) instead of glycine (ABG-dUTP), both with about the same overall chain length. The modified nucleotides were purified by anion exchange chromatography and analyzed by PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC). The relative purity and uniformity of the deoxyuridine analogs were indicated by the detection of a single UV quenching spot from TLC analysis and the detection of single primer extension product (results not shown and Fig. 2B). The photoreactive deoxyuridine nucleotides were efficiently incorporated into DNA at a wide range of concentrations using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (exonuclease-free). At higher concentrations the modified nucleotide read-through in the primer extension assay was detected, but this was also observed for fast protein liquid chromatography purified deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) at equivalent concentrations. The addition of glycine to the chain causes a progressive reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of the primer extension products (Fig. 2B). Primer extension products containing one AB-dUMP, ABG-dUMP, ABG2-dUMP, or ABG3-dUMP incorporated have an increasingly reduced mobility as determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis, as can be seen in the synthesis of DNA photoaffinity probes at bp −17 (Fig. 2B, lanes F-I). If two or four modified nucleotides are incorporated into an oligonucleotide primer, the difference in electrophoretic mobility of the primer extension products due to the particular modified nucleotide incorporated was increased (see Fig. 2B, lanes K-N, for two modified nucleotides and lanes A-D for four modified nucleotides at bps −3/−2 and −26/−21, respectively). The shift in electrophoretic mobility was therefore characteristic of the particular modified deoxyuridine incorporated into the oligonucleotide primer. Photoaffinity labeling of the SUP4 tRNATyr transcription complexes was performed using DNA photoaffinity probes modified at bps −26/−21 and the 500 mM KCl step fraction from Bio-Rex 70 chromatography of a S-100 extract (BR500). The DNA probe with the shortest chain length (AB-dUMP, Fig. 3A, lane 1) cross-linked two polypeptides corresponding in apparent molecular masses to the Brf subunit of TFIIIB (67 kDa) and the second largest subunit of TFIIIC (120 kDa) or of Pol III (128 kDa). Photoaffinity labeling of these two polypeptides was shown to be TFIIIC-dependent by DNA competition with plasmid DNA containing an up mutant of the SUP4 gene (result not shown). The 67-kDa protein was labeled in the presence of heparin (100 μg/ml); whereas labeling of the 120/128-kDa protein was eliminated, consistent with the 67-kDa protein being a subunit of TFIIIB (lane 6). The Brf subunit of TFIIIB was more efficiently cross-linked with photoreactive nucleotides containing longer chain lengths ≥~14 Å and a new protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 27 kDa was detected with analogs that have chain lengths of ~19 and ~23 Å (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-5). Photoaffinity labeling of the 27-kDa protein was not eliminated by the addition of heparin (100 μg/ml) or ATP, CTP, and UTP (100 μM) (Fig. 3A, lanes 8, 9, 13, and 14) and was shown to be TFIIIC-dependent (results not shown). The heparin-resistant photoaffinity labeling of the 27-kDa polypeptide suggested that this is a subunit of TFIIIB and by apparent electrophoretic mobility to be the TATA box binding protein (TBP) subunit of TFIIIB. The photoaffinity labeled 27-kDa protein was shown to be TBP by the highly selective immunoprecipitation of the 27-kDa protein using rabbit anti-TBP antibody (Fig. 3B). A 90-kDa protein was photoaffinity labeled in transcription complexes by photoreactive deoxyuridine analogs with ~14-Å chain length at bps −26/−21 that have heparin or ATP, CTP, and UTP added and photoaffinity labeled consistently less in the initiation complex (Fig. 3A, lane 2 compared to lanes 7 and 12). Photoaffinity labeling of the 90-kDa subunit has a specific tether or chain requirement, as it is not readily labeled by analogs containing chain lengths of ~10 or ~19-23 Å (compare lanes 7 and 12 with lanes 8, 9, 13, and 14), nor by analogs containing approximately the same chain length but a more hydrophobic chain, i.e. ABU-dUMP (compare lanes 7 and 12 with lanes 10 and 15). The conditions under which the 90-kDa subunit of TFIIIB was cross-linked suggested that when Pol III initially binds to the TFIIIB-DNA complex, it causes a conformational change or displacement of the 90-kDa subunit at a position ~14 Å from base pairs −26/−21. The dislocation of the 90-kDa subunit by Pol III appears to be reversed by either stripping Pol III from the complex by the addition of heparin or by initiating transcription resulting in the downstream transposition of Pol III. Highly purified TFIIIC, TFIIIB, and Pol III were used in photoaffinity labeling experiments with probes containing ABG-dUMP (~14 Å chain length) at bps −26/−21 in order to monitor the extent of complex formation of Pol III-TFIIIC-TFIIIB-DNA by gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 4). No significant protein cross-linking was detected with TFIIIC alone, but upon addition of TFIIIB, 90- and 67-kDa subunits of TFIIIB could readily be detected (lanes 2 and 3). If Pol III was added the photoaffinity labeling efficiency of the 90-kDa protein was reduced, whereas the labeling efficiency of the 67-kDa subunit remained constant (lane 4). Gel shift analysis showed that the majority of complexes formed in the presence of TFIIIC, TFIIIB, and Pol III were the fully assembled initiation complexes, but that some TFIIIC-TFIIIB-DNA complexes were still present (result not shown). It might be that the residual amount of photoaffinity labeling of the 90-kDa subunit observed after the addition of Pol III or that in the BR500 extract is due to a fraction of the complexes containing TFIIIC and TFIIIB only. The 34-, 67-, and 120/128-kDa polypeptides were more efficiently photoaffinity labeled at bp −17 by DNAs containing ABG-dUMP and ABG2-dUMP with ~14- and ~19-Å chain lengths than with DNAs containing AB-dUMP and ABG3-dUMP with ~10- and ~23-Å chain lengths (Fig. 5, lanes 1-4). Photoaffinity labeling of the 34-kDa protein was eliminated by the addition of ATP, UTP, and CTP (lanes 5-8), consistent with this protein being the 34-kDa subunit of Pol III and therefore translocated on DNA upon elongation. The 34- and 120/128-kDa proteins were not photoaffinity labeled with the addition of heparin to the initiation complex (lanes 9-12) or to the elongation complex (lanes 13-16). The persistent labeling of the 67-kDa protein in initiation or elongation complexes and in the presence of heparin is consistent with it corresponding to the Brf subunit of TFIIIB. The greatly enhanced labeling efficiency of both the 34-kDa subunit of Pol III and the 67-kDa subunit of TFIIIB with ~14-19 Å chain length indicates that these proteins do not make close contact with the major groove of DNA at bp −17 and therefore requires a slightly longer chain to be efficiently contacted or cross-linked. Based on the relative mobility of the photoaffinity labeled polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 120/128 kDa, this labeled protein could be either the second largest subunit of TFIIIC (120 kDa) or Pol III (128 kDa) or a mixture of the two. Prior to the addition of ATP, CTP, and UTP, the 120/128-kDa protein was most efficiently labeled with chains lengths ~14-19 Å, although not as large an increase in cross-linking yield as observed for the 34- and 67-kDa proteins. After the addition of the nucleotides, the labeling intensity of the 120/128-kDa polypeptide was reduced only with those chain lengths ≥14 Å to make cross-linking of almost equal efficiency at all chain lengths. The difference in photoaffinity labeling before and after nucleotide addi"

INTRODUCTIONThe Epstein-Barr virus latent origin of replication, oriP, was originally identified as a genetic element that conferred the ability to replicate autonomously upon small plasmids in EBV 1The abbreviations used are: EBVEpstein-Barr virusRTPreplication terminator proteinIRinverted repeatFRfamily of repeatskbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)DSdyad symmetry.-transformed cells (1Yates J. Warren N. Reisman D. Sugden B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3806-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that oriP is composed of two essential elements separated by approximately 1 kb (2Reisman D. Yates J. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). One of these, the family of repeats (FR), contains 20 tandemly repeated copies of a 30-bp sequence, each containing a binding site for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), the only viral protein required for latent replication. The FR is important for nuclear retention of the viral genome (3Krysan P.J. Haase S.B. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4Middleton T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4067-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is also a transcriptional enhancer (5Reisman D. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3838-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The second essential region is termed the dyad symmetry (DS) region and contains a 65-bp sequence of dyad symmetry and four binding sites for EBNA-1. The EBNA-1 protein binds as a dimer to its sites in the FR and the DS region (6Rawlins D.R. Milman G. Hayward S.D. Hayward G.S. Cell. 1985; 42: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7Ambinder R.F. Mullen M.A. Chang Y-N. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1466-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); moreover, EBNA-1 binds in a highly cooperative manner to the DS region (8Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EBNA-1 binding to oriP induces bending of DNA resulting in distortion of the helical structure (10Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hearing J. Mulhaupt Y. Harper S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 694-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hsieh D-J. Camiolo S.M. Yates J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). EBNA-1 is also involved in the formation of a looped DNA structure in which the FR and DS region are bound together through an EBNA-1 complex (13Frappier L. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10875-10879Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Su W. Middleton T. Sugden B. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10870-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The role of EBNA-1 in initiation of EBV replication and in the maintenance of the EBV genome still remains unknown.Our laboratory has previously shown that replication of a plasmid (p174), containing oriP, initiates within or near the DS region and proceeds bidirectionally. Replication forks that proceed leftward are arrested within the FR; the other forks travel the remainder of the circular plasmid until they encounter the arrested forks at the FR. Thus, the plasmid p174 replicates predominantly in an asymmetric bidirectional manner in human cells since oriP contains both the sites for initiation and termination of replication (15Gahn T.A. Schildkraut C.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We have also analyzed replication intermediates from intact EBV genomes in four EBV-positive cell lines (721, 8866, Daudi, and Raji). We showed that replication initiates near or within the DS region as seen in the p174 plasmid; however, initiation events were also detected external to oriP. Replication forks also stall at the FR in all four EBV genomes, but the levels of termination at the FR vary among cell lines suggesting differences in the regulation of termination events in different EBV strains (16Little R.D. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2893-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Since EBNA-1 binds to multiple sites within the FR, we have begun to investigate its role in the pausing of replication forks. Toward this aim, we have used an in vitro replication system in which replication of plasmids containing the FR is initiated from the SV40 origin in the presence of T antigen and a soluble HeLa cell extract. When EBNA-1 is present in these reactions, we found that accumulation of replication forks stalled at the FR is enhanced (17Dhar V. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6268-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also found that reducing the number of the repeats from 20 to 6 still resulted in replication pausing, but pausing was not detected with two repeats. The substitution of three tandem copies of the DS region (12 EBNA-1 binding sites) for the FR also results in pausing of replication forks, suggesting that multiple EBNA-1 binding sites are important irrespective of spacer DNA sequences (18Platt T.H.K. Tcherepanova I. Schildkraut C.L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1739-1745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been found that two cellular proteins from the BJAB cell line activated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate can compete with EBNA-1 for binding to oriP (19Wen L-T. Tanaka A. Nonoyama M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang S. Nonoyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The possible role of these proteins in initiation of EBV replication or in the pausing of replication forks remains unknown.Our previous studies used an EBNA-1 derivative that lacks a region with repeated glycine alanine residues (these have been shown not to be essential for replication). In this study, we show that the full-length EBNA-1 protein also enhances the stalling of replication forks at the FR in vitro. We also examined a series of truncated EBNA-1 proteins to map the amino acids that are important for pausing of replication forks. We show that the complete DNA binding and dimerization region of EBNA-1 is sufficient to elicit the pausing of replication forks and that deletion of a portion of the DNA binding domain abrogates the ability of EBNA-1 to elicit pausing. We have also tested the EBNA-1 protein for its ability to inhibit DNA unwinding by T antigen and dnaB, two replicative helicases. EBNA-1 can inhibit DNA unwinding by T antigen and dnaB in an orientation-independent manner.DISCUSSIONThere are several similarities between pausing of replication forks at the FR and replication pause sites that have been observed in prokaryotes. Both types of pausing have been shown to be associated with a protein that binds specifically to a DNA sequence. Also, it has been shown that DNA helicase activity is inhibited at these sites. One difference between the termination pause sites in prokaryotes and the FR of the EBV site is that the pause sites in prokaryotes are polar and relatively efficient, whereas EBNA-1-mediated pausing at the FR occurs in both directions and is less efficient.Termination of replication in the E. coli chromosome is confined to a zone approximately 180° opposite the origin. A mechanism has evolved to ensure that replication terminates specifically in this region by the strategic location of replication pause sites (for review, see Ref. 44Hill T.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 603-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two elements are involved in this mechanism: multiple DNA sequences of approximately 20 bp, termed Ter sites, and the Tus protein, which is a DNA binding protein that recognizes and binds specifically to the Ter sequences. The Ter sequences are present in six copies spread over a large region that generates a replication fork trap, i.e. replication forks can enter the termination zone but rarely exit from this region (45Hill T.M. Pelletier A.J. Tecklenburg M.L. Kuempel P.L. Cell. 1988; 55: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ter sequences do not contain a dyad symmetry region, indicating that the Tus protein probably binds as a monomer. The absence of a dyad symmetry region and monomeric binding of the Tus protein to the Ter sites may be responsible for the replication fork pausing in only one orientation with respect to the origin (28Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18612-18622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46MacAllister T. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2828-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, the replication arrest system consists of an inverted repeat (IR) region containing two inverted repeats (IR I and IR II) and the replication terminator protein (RTP), which associates as a dimer with IR I and IR II. The IR sequences contain core and auxiliary elements, each of which binds an RTP dimer and results in a polar barrier to replication fork movement (47Lewis P.J. Smith M.T. Wake R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3564-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Carrigan C.M. Pack R.A. Smith M.T. Wake R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Pausing of replication forks in vitro occurs only when RTP binds to the core and auxiliary elements cooperatively (49Langley D.B. Smith M.T. Lewis P.J. Wake R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 50Smith M.T. Langley D.B. Young P.A. Wake R.G. J. Mol.

The terminus regions of B. subtilis and E. coli share no apparent homology, nor do the RTP and Tus proteins. The mechanisms involved in replication fork pausing that are utilized in these organisms have not been fully elucidated and may, in fact, be different. Nevertheless, it has been shown that both proteins inhibit DNA unwinding by replicative helicases in vitro in an orientation-dependent manner (28Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18612-18622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Lee E.H. Kornbert A. Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 11143-11147Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In both cases, pausing is not absolute, and replication forks are eventually able to proceed through the terminator sites. Moreover, it has been shown recently that RTP and Tus proteins have the ability to block transcription in a polar manner (55Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The passage of an RNA transcript can inactivate the replication termination site (55Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Several sites at which replication forks stall have been observed in eukaryotic systems. Thus far, however, a protein that is responsible for this effect has not been identified. Replication forks pause in the direction opposite to transcription at the 3′-ends of the rRNA transcription units for every organism that has been studied including human (56Little R.D. Platt T.H.K. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6600-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), murine, 2P. Galgano and C. L. Schildkraut, manuscript in preparation. Xenopus borealis, Xenopus laevis (57Weisendanger B. Lucchini R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 22: 5038-5046Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (58Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1988; 55: 637-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In yeast, it has been shown that transcription itself is not responsible for the pausing of replication forks in this region (59Brewer B.J. Lockshon D. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but the possibility remains that some protein(s) from the transcription machinery are bound to this region and result in pausing of replication forks.The other pause sites that are responsible for replication fork stalling in yeast have been mapped to the tRNA genes of S. cerevisiae in vivo (60Deshpande A.M. Newlon C.S. Science. 1996; 272: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These sites exhibit polarity and are similar to the pause sites of rDNA genes described earlier. They are able to stall replication fork movement when replication machinery moves in the direction opposite to transcription. However, for tRNA pause sites, it has been shown that transcription per se is required for pausing of replication forks to occur (60Deshpande A.M. Newlon C.S. Science. 1996; 272: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).One type of replication fork pause site in yeast that has been well characterized is a transient arrest of replication forks that occurs at the centromeres of chromosomes I, III, and IV (61Greenfeder S.A. Newlon C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Replication fork movement pauses at the centromeres when approached from either direction; the efficiency of fork arrest is similar between chromosomes and plasmids. The pausing is clearly a result of the interaction between the centromere binding protein and centromeric DNA, since point mutations that abolish binding of centromere binding protein abolish replication fork pausing (61Greenfeder S.A. Newlon C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).In this study, we have shown that replication forks pause at or near the FR in the presence of the EBNA-1 protein. Pausing can also occur in the absence of EBNA-1 but to a significantly lower degree. We consider two possible mechanisms that may be involved in pausing of replication forks in this region in the absence of EBNA-1. Replication forks may pause at the FR sequence because of some unusual secondary structure in the absence of bound protein. Alternatively, a protein or proteins present in the HeLa cytosol may bind to the FR fragment and result in pausing. It has been shown that three cellular proteins can bind to the FR (19Wen L-T. Tanaka A. Nonoyama M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang S. Nonoyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 62Oh S.-J. Chittenden T. Levine A.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 514-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear that pausing at the FR in the absence of the EBNA-1 protein is inefficient, and forks eventually proceed through the region.A different mechanism for pausing at the FR is probably involved when EBNA-1 protein is present. In the presence of the FR-EBNA-1 complex, it is clear that relatively few forks can proceed through the pause site, although pausing is not absolute since some termination occurs in the region opposite the SV40 origin. It is possible that the interaction of EBNA-1 with one or more components of the replication machinery may elicit stalling of forks. Indeed, it has been shown that EBNA-1 is able to interact with DNA pol α-primase and human SSB. 3K. Weisshart, L. Frappier, and E. Fanning, manuscript in preparation. 4D. Zhang, L. Frappier, and M. O'Donnell, manuscript in preparation.However, EBNA459-607 does not appear to interact with pol α-primase or human SSB,3 even though it can inhibit replication fork movement.It has been shown previously that EBNA-1 produced in the baculovirus expression system is a phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated on several serine residues (21Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7819-7826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that phosphorylation of EBNA-1 occurs in vivo (36Hearing J. Levine A. Virology. 1985; 145: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The role of the phosphorylation of the EBNA-1 protein is unknown. It has been suggested that the phosphorylation on serines may exert a negative control over EBNA-1 function. 5T. Middleton and B. Sugden, personal communication. Here, we have shown that phosphorylation is not required for EBNA-1 or EBNA-1 derivatives to produce a pause site for replication fork movement. Using the in vitro replication reaction we examined EBNA-1 and EBNA-1 derivatives that have been produced using a baculovirus expression system and were presumably phosphorylated (21Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7819-7826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also assayed EBNA-1 derivatives that have been produced in E. coli and were not phosphorylated (see “Materials and Methods”). The fact that we did not detect any differences between the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated EBNA-1 derivatives in the ability to stall replication forks movement suggests that the phosphorylation is not important for the replication fork pausing induced by EBNA-1.To begin to understand the mechanism by which the EBNA-1-FR complex arrests replication fork movement, we examined the ability of the EBNA-1 protein bound to the FR site to inhibit helicase activity. In our assays, we used two different helicases, T antigen and dnaB. Both helicases were inhibited by the EBNA-1 protein bound to the FR (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). When additional copies of the FR were added in trans, the inhibition of helicase activity was not detected (data not shown). This observation provides strong evidence that the mechanism by which EBNA-1 inhibits helicase activity requires EBNA-1 binding to its recognition sites in our helicase substrates. It is possible that the binding of the EBNA-1 protein to DNA is sufficient to inhibit helicase movement and that there is no protein-protein interaction between EBNA-1 and the helicase, as was shown for the Lac repressor (63Yancey-Wrona J.E. Matson S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6713-6721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Lac repressor, when bound to its DNA binding site, can inhibit some, but not all helicases (63Yancey-Wrona J.E. Matson S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6713-6721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, a preliminary study suggests that the inhibition of helicase movement alone is not sufficient to result in pausing of replication fork movement at the FR. For example, replication fork pausing was not detected in vitro at the FR in the presence of EBNA470-607, although helicase activity was inhibited in assays similar to those shown in Fig. 6. Experiments are in progress to determine whether pausing of replication forks at the FR is related to the ability of EBNA protein to inhibit helicase activity.OriP has several features that are similar to some bacterial plasmid origins such as replication protein-mediated looping between short repeated sequences and a defined replication origin. These features may control EBV copy number, as has been proposed for some bacterial plasmids (for reviews see Refs. 64Miron A. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6438-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 65Nordstrom K. Cell. 1990; 63: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 66Filutowicz M. Dellis S. Levchenko I. Urh M. Wu F. York D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 48: 239-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the EBNA-1 protein can mediate the formation of a loop in the DNA of the EBV oriP region in vitro. EBNA-1 binds to both the DS region and the FR, and the resulting EBNA-1 complexes interact resulting in the looping out of the intervening 1 kb of DNA (13Frappier L. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10875-10879Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Su W. Middleton T. Sugden B. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10870-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, using an in vitro replication reaction, we assayed the plasmid pEco3′Δ that contains the FR but not the DS region. Our results indicate that the formation of a loop between the FR and DS region is not required for the pausing of replication forks that emanate from the SV40 origin of replication.Another type of interaction between EBNA-1 molecules is termed cooperative binding, in which the binding of an EBNA-1 molecule at one site in the DS element positively affects the binding of EBNA-1 at its adjacent site (8Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cooperative binding interaction is mediated by EBNA-1 sequences between amino acids 470 and 607 (8Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bochkarev A. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Furey Jr., W. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Cell. 1995; 83: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and therefore all of the EBNA-1 proteins used in this study can interact cooperatively. We have not yet determined whether cooperative interactions between EBNA-1 dimers on adjacent binding sites in the FR element are required to cause replication fork pausing.We have shown in the present study that the portion of the EBNA-1 DNA binding region between amino acids 459 and 470 affects the ability of EBNA-1 to cause replication forks to pause in vitro. It has previously been shown, using a series of in vitro translated EBNA mutants, that the region between Gly-462 and Lys-477 contains residues important for DNA recognition (67Chen M.R. Middeldorp J.M. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4875-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding activity is extremely sensitive to mutations in this region, and a dimer form of a synthetic peptide containing EBNA-1 amino acids 458-478 is capable of binding DNA, but only nonspecifically (40Chen M-R. Zong J. Hayward S.D. Virology. 1994; 205: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the EBNA-1 DNA binding and dimerization domains bound to DNA has revealed that amino acids 461-470 form an extended chain that makes extensive contacts with the minor groove of the EBNA-1 recognition site (33Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Loss of these contacts (as occurs in EBNA470-607) results in decreased affinity for EBNA-1 recognition sites and likely in decreased DNA binding stability (7Ambinder R.F. Mullen M.A. Chang Y-N. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1466-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of the ability to cause replication forks to pause, which accompanied the deletion of amino acids 459-469, suggests either that replication fork movement is blocked by the EBNA-1 extended chain in the minor groove of the DNA or that the resulting reduction in affinity and/or stability of EBNA-1 on DNA enables the passage of replication forks.It is intriguing that the replication pause sites we have detected are all localized within a 2-3-kb region (although we have not screened the entire EBV genome for replication fork pause sites) (15Gahn T.A. Schildkraut C.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16Little R.D. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2893-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Dhar V. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6268-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This may reflect the need for controlling the rate of replication in this region of the genome. It may also ensure that termination of replication occurs predominantly in this region because this region has the potential role of contributing to the fidelity of partitioning the EBV genome once replication has been completed. Furthermore, the proximity of these sites to oriP suggests that fork pausing may be involved in preventing the progression of forks proceeding from origins of replication that have reinitiated. This would indicate that pausing of forks may have a role in limiting duplication of the viral genome to once per cell cycle. A more detailed understanding of the mechanism underlying replication fork pausing will allow us to understand how evolutionary mechanisms have adapted these critical elements in prokaryotes to the regulation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. INTRODUCTIONThe Epstein-Barr virus latent origin of replication, oriP, was originally identified as a genetic element that conferred the ability to replicate autonomously upon small plasmids in EBV 1The abbreviations used are: EBVEpstein-Barr virusRTPreplication terminator proteinIRinverted repeatFRfamily of repeatskbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)DSdyad symmetry.-transformed cells (1Yates J. Warren N. Reisman D. Sugden B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3806-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that oriP is composed of two essential elements separated by approximately 1 kb (2Reisman D. Yates J. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). One of these, the family of repeats (FR), contains 20 tandemly repeated copies of a 30-bp sequence, each containing a binding site for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), the only viral protein required for latent replication. The FR is important for nuclear retention of the viral genome (3Krysan P.J. Haase S.B. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4Middleton T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4067-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is also a transcriptional enhancer (5Reisman D. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3838-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The second essential region is termed the dyad symmetry (DS) region and contains a 65-bp sequence of dyad symmetry and four binding sites for EBNA-1. The EBNA-1 protein binds as a dimer to its sites in the FR and the DS region (6Rawlins D.R. Milman G. Hayward S.D. Hayward G.S.

Previously, it was shown that ribosomal assembly was indistinguishable from that in wild-type cells, that the flow of the corresponding 50 S subunit into the polysome fraction was not restricted, but that the ribosomes were strongly impaired in poly(Phe) synthesis (C.

https://openalex.org/W2007200003,"Genetic and biochemical analyses were performed on the cytoplasmic cap-binding complex (eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F) of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Genomic and cDNA sequencing of the S. pombe gene (tif1) encoding the cap-binding component eIF4E revealed the presence of two introns in a reading frame of 219 codons. The encoded sequence of 218 amino acids shows a greater degree of identity to the mammalian eIF4E sequence than does its counterpart from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, unlike its S. cerevisiae counterpart, S.pombe eIF4E has a C-terminal Ser209 within the motif KSGST that is a site of phosphorylation in hamster and rabbit eIF4E. Of relevance to its potential regulatory role, eIF4E was found to be encoded by an mRNA with a six-nucleotide leader and to be of low abundance in vivo. Cross-linking experiments identified S. pombe eIF4E as the major cap-binding protein while a further protein, p36, also showed cap-dependent binding. eIF4A was not associated with the cap-binding complex. While S. pombe eIF4E was shown capable of binding S. cerevisiae p20, an equivalent protein was absent from the eIF4F complex isolated from S. pombe cells. S. pombe 4F therefore shows a remarkable combination of structural and functional properties, some of which it shares with its higher and its lower eukaryotic counterparts."

Cheung et al. (Cheung, P. H., Luo, W., Qiu, Y., Zhang, K. E., Millron, P., Lin, S. H. (1993) J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis within this ATPase consensus sequence completely eliminates the ecto-ATPase activity of CBATP (Sippel, C. J., McCollum, M., Perlmutter, D. H. (1994) J. Biol.

In this study we examined the possibility that it is this ATPase consensus sequence which is required for the cell aggregating properties of CBATP and CEA and whether there is a relationship between ATPase, aggregating, and bile acid efflux activities. For this we used a baculovirus vector to express in Sf9 cells wild type as well as mutant and chimeric CBATP and CEA molecules. The results indicate that Arg-98 in the ATPase consensus sequence of CBATP and the corresponding residue of CEA are essential for the aggregating properties of these molecules. Moreover Arg-98 is essential for CBATP to interact with itself, CEA to interact with itself, and CBATP to interact with CEA. However, the role of Arg-98 in aggregation is distinct from its role in ecto-ATPase activity and the aggregating properties cannot be attributed to a change in ATP metabolism in the pericellular milieu.

INTRODUCTIONTransfection of cDNA for a hepatocyte canalicular phosphoprotein, the rat liver canalicular bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase/cell CAM 105, confers bile acid efflux and ecto-ATPase activities on COS cells (1Sippel C.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6139-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies using site-directed and deletion mutagenesis have led to the elucidation of some of the structural characteristics that determine the basis of these functional activities. For instance, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail is associated with abrogation of bile acid efflux and ecto-ATPase activities (1Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis within an ectoplasmic ATPase consensus sequence, R98A, shows that this sequence is necessary for ecto-ATPase activity but is not involved in bile acid efflux activity (2Sippel C.J. McCollum M.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2820-2826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis within the cytoplasmic tail shows that phosphorylation of serine 503 is required for bile acid efflux activity, that phosphorylation of tyrosine 488 regulates bile acid efflux activity but phosphorylation is not necessary for ecto-ATPase activity (4Sippel C.J. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19539-19545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In a recent study by Cheung et al. (5Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millron P. Lin S.-H. J. Biol.

Deletion mutants of CBATP were expressed in Sf9 insect cells because such cells do not ordinarily aggregate and because the cells can be relatively easily infected using baculovirus-derived expression vectors. The results showed that deletion of the first Ig(V)-like domain within the amino-terminal extracellular tail of CBATP resulted in loss of cell aggregating activity. Cell aggregating activity remained intact when any one of the three internal Ig-like domains in the extracellular tail of CBATP was deleted. These results were entirely consistent with results of deletional studies of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a molecule which shares a number of structural characteristics with CBATP. Deletion of the amino-terminal Ig(V)-like domain of CEA abrogates its intracellular adhesion properties (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In fact, this deletion has been shown to prevent the homophilic interaction between CEA molecules on opposing cell surfaces. Having recently shown that an ATPase consensus sequence within the amino-terminal IgV-like domain of CBATP was responsible for its ecto-ATPase activity and noting that this consensus sequence is conserved in the amino-terminal domain of CEA, we examined in this current study the possibility that this ATPase activity is specifically involved in the cell-aggregating properties of CBATP and CEA.DISCUSSIONUsing Sf9 insect cells, which do not ordinarily adhere to each other, and a baculovirus expression system to confer expression of the multifunctional protein CBATP on these cells, we have shown that the ectoplasmic ATPase consensus sequence, and specifically Arg-98, is essential for both cell adhesion activity and ecto-ATPase activity. The wild type CBATP construct conferred both ecto-ATPase activity and adhesion properties on the Sf9 cells but the R98A mutant CBATP did not confer either property on infected Sf9 cells. The truncated CBATP in which deletion of the cytoplasmic tail is associated with loss of ecto-ATPase activity is also unable to confer aggregating properties on infected Sf9 cells. This last result is also consistent with results published by Cheung et al. (5Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millron P. Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24303-24310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that two short isoforms of CBATP, which have only 5 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail, lacked aggregating properties.Our data also show that the ectoplasmic ATPase consensus sequence and corresponding Arg residue in CEA is essential for its cell adhesion activity. Previous studies of CEA have shown that its homophilic aggregation properties are mediated by double-reciprocal interactions between the amino-terminal Ig V-like domain and internal Ig C-like domains of antiparallel CEA molecules on apposing cell surfaces (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We were struck by the sequence at residues 92-100 within this domain, GQAYSGRET, which is almost identical to the ATPase consensus sequence of CBATP, GPAYSGRET, and retains the arginine at residues 98 which is critical for the ecto-ATPase activity of CBATP (7Barnett T. Goebel S.J. Nothdurft M.A. Elting J.J. Genomics. 1988; 3: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Kamarck M.E. Elting J.J. Hart J.T. Goebel S.J. Rae P.M.M. Nothdurft M.A. Nedwin J.J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to show that the N domain was essential for the aggregation activity of CEA and a related molecule NCA. Indeed, our studies show that site-directed mutagenesis of Arg-98 within the ATPase consensus sequence in CEA or in the CBATP-CEA chimeric molecules disrupted the cell aggregating activities conferred on infected Sf9 insect cells. There is, however, one important difference in the mechanisms by which CBATP and CEA mediate cell adhesion. CBATP requires its cytoplasmic tail to mediate cell adhesion through the ectoplasmic Arg-98-containing domain but CEA, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane, lacks a cytoplasmic tail and yet mediates cell adhesion through the corresponding ectoplasmic domain.The comparison of CBATP and CEA in terms of both ecto-ATPase and adhesion activity provides clear evidence that the role of Arg-98 and the ectoplasmic ATPase consensus sequence in adhesion is not a result of its ecto-ATPase activity, i.e. the adhesion activity is distinct from the ATPase activity. First, we could not induce cell aggregation in untransfected Sf9 cells with exogenous ATP, ADP, AMP, or ATPase. Second, and most important, CEA could mediate cell adhesion through Arg-98 within the ATPase consensus sequence in the absence of ATPase activity. This makes it more likely that ATPase domain is directly involved in intercellular aggregation as the binding site for heterophilic and homophilic interactions, or by inducing a conformational change that permits heterophilic and homophilic interactions through another site in the N domain.The results of homotypic and heterotypic assays with wild type, mutant, and chimeric CBATP and CEA molecules have at least one, if not several, implications. These studies show that CBATP can interact with itself as well as with CEA. It is relatively easy to explain the interaction of CBATP with CEA. Based on what is known about CEA (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), one would predict that the N domain of CBATP interacts with the A3 Ig C-like domain of CEA. It is more difficult to explain the interaction of CBATP with itself. The Arg-98 residue and the N domain of CBATP are required for this interaction, but it is not clear whether Arg-98 or the N domain interacts with another part of the N domain or the other Ig C-like domains in the extracellular tail of CBATP. As mentioned above, the adhesion activity of CEA involves the interaction of its N domain with its A3 Ig C-like domain (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CBATP does not have an A3 Ig C-like domain, but does have A2, B1, and A1 Ig C-like domains. Studies of Zhou et al. (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) provide evidence that the N domain of CEA will interact with its A1 or A2 domains, albeit to a lesser extent and with weaker affinity than with its A3 domain (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Studies of Cheung et al. (5Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millron P. Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24303-24310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that CBATP still mediated adhesion in Sf9 cells if its A2 domain alone, B1 domain alone, or A1 domain alone were deleted. Adhesion mediated by CBATP decreased 50% if both the A2 and B1 domains were deleted and was eliminated if the A2, B1, and A1 domains were all deleted. It is, therefore, possible that the N domain of CBATP can interact with regions in all three of these Ig C-like domains. Interaction with another part of the N domain cannot be excluded as a possibility.The current study also provides further evidence that the cytoplasmic tail of CBATP is essential for its ecto-ATPase activity and that it can confer ecto-ATPase activity on CEA. The mechanism of this effect is not known but phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail is not required. Previous studies of COS cells transfected with wild type CBATP and treated with staurosporine (1Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and COS cells transfected with phosphorylation mutants of CBATP (4Sippel C.J. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19539-19545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had shown that phosphorylation was not required for ecto-ATPase activity even though it was required for another activity, bile acid efflux. Our recent studies in transfected COS cells have shown that CEA can bind [35S]ATPγS even though it cannot hydrolyze ATP.2 The chimeric CBATP-CEA molecule can bind [35S]ATPγS and hydrolyze ATP. This indicates that the cytoplasmic tail of CBATP transmits very specific information to the function of the ectoplasmic domain.One interesting series of experimental results for which we do not yet have any substantive explanation shows that ATP analogs, ADP and AMP inhibit aggregation mediated by CBATP and CEA. Perhaps the binding of these analogs to the critical ATPase consensus sequence affects its presentation to adjacent CBATP or CEA molecules.Taken together, these studies in infected Sf9 cells provide further information about the structural basis for the aggregating properties of CEA family members. Perhaps, it will now be possible to use this system to examine the relationship between the multiple activities of one member, CBATP, including aggregation, ecto-ATPase activity, and bile acid efflux activity. Our studies in mammalian cells indicate, however, that bile acid efflux activity will require high levels of expression, phosphorylation at 2 sites in the cytoplasmic tail, and the ability of the host cell to respond to extracellular ATP, presumably through a purinergic receptor. INTRODUCTIONTransfection of cDNA for a hepatocyte canalicular phosphoprotein, the rat liver canalicular bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase/cell CAM 105, confers bile acid efflux and ecto-ATPase activities on COS cells (1Sippel C.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6139-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies using site-directed and deletion mutagenesis have led to the elucidation of some of the structural characteristics that determine the basis of these functional activities. For instance, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail is associated with abrogation of bile acid efflux and ecto-ATPase activities (1Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis within an ectoplasmic ATPase consensus sequence, R98A, shows that this sequence is necessary for ecto-ATPase activity but is not involved in bile acid efflux activity (2Sippel C.J. McCollum M.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2820-2826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis within the cytoplasmic tail shows that phosphorylation of serine 503 is required for bile acid efflux activity, that phosphorylation of tyrosine 488 regulates bile acid efflux activity but phosphorylation is not necessary for ecto-ATPase activity (4Sippel C.J.

Deletion mutants of CBATP were expressed in Sf9 insect cells because such cells do not ordinarily aggregate and because the cells can be relatively easily infected using baculovirus-derived expression vectors. The results showed that deletion of the first Ig(V)-like domain within the amino-terminal extracellular tail of CBATP resulted in loss of cell aggregating activity. Cell aggregating activity remained intact when any one of the three internal Ig-like domains in the extracellular tail of CBATP was deleted. These results were entirely consistent with results of deletional studies of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a molecule which shares a number of structural characteristics with CBATP. Deletion of the amino-terminal Ig(V)-like domain of CEA abrogates its intracellular adhesion properties (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J.

This makes it more likely that ATPase domain is directly involved in intercellular aggregation as the binding site for heterophilic and homophilic interactions, or by inducing a conformational change that permits heterophilic and homophilic interactions through another site in the N domain. The results of homotypic and heterotypic assays with wild type, mutant, and chimeric CBATP and CEA molecules have at least one, if not several, implications. These studies show that CBATP can interact with itself as well as with CEA. It is relatively easy to explain the interaction of CBATP with CEA. Based on what is known about CEA (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), one would predict that the N domain of CBATP interacts with the A3 Ig C-like domain of CEA. It is more difficult to explain the interaction of CBATP with itself. The Arg-98 residue and the N domain of CBATP are required for this interaction, but it is not clear whether Arg-98 or the N domain interacts with another part of the N domain or the other Ig C-like domains in the extracellular tail of CBATP. As mentioned above, the adhesion activity of CEA involves the interaction of its N domain with its A3 Ig C-like domain (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CBATP does not have an A3 Ig C-like domain, but does have A2, B1, and A1 Ig C-like domains. Studies of Zhou et al. (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) provide evidence that the N domain of CEA will interact with its A1 or A2 domains, albeit to a lesser extent and with weaker affinity than with its A3 domain (6Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Studies of Cheung et al. (5Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millron P. Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24303-24310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that CBATP still mediated adhesion in Sf9 cells if its A2 domain alone, B1 domain alone, or A1 domain alone were deleted. Adhesion mediated by CBATP decreased 50% if both the A2 and B1 domains were deleted and was eliminated if the A2, B1, and A1 domains were all deleted. It is, therefore, possible that the N domain of CBATP can interact with regions in all three of these Ig C-like domains. Interaction with another part of the N domain cannot be excluded as a possibility. The current study also provides further evidence that the cytoplasmic tail of CBATP is essential for its ecto-ATPase activity and that it can confer ecto-ATPase activity on CEA. The mechanism of this effect is not known but phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail is not required. Previous studies of COS cells transfected with wild type CBATP and treated with staurosporine (1Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and COS cells transfected with phosphorylation mutants of CBATP (4Sippel C.J. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19539-19545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had shown that phosphorylation was not required for ecto-ATPase activity even though it was required for another activity, bile acid efflux. Our recent studies in transfected COS cells have shown that CEA can bind [35S]ATPγS even though it cannot hydrolyze ATP.2 The chimeric CBATP-CEA molecule can bind [35S]ATPγS and hydrolyze ATP. This indicates that the cytoplasmic tail of CBATP transmits very specific information to the function of the ectoplasmic domain. One interesting series of experimental results for which we do not yet have any substantive explanation shows that ATP analogs, ADP and AMP inhibit aggregation mediated by CBATP and CEA. Perhaps the binding of these analogs to the critical ATPase consensus sequence affects its presentation to adjacent CBATP or CEA molecules. Taken together, these studies in infected Sf9 cells provide further information about the structural basis for the aggregating properties of CEA family members. Perhaps, it will now be possible to use this system to examine the relationship between the multiple activities of one member, CBATP, including aggregation, ecto-ATPase activity, and bile acid efflux activity. Our studies in mammalian cells indicate, however, that bile acid efflux activity will require high levels of expression, phosphorylation at 2 sites in the cytoplasmic tail, and the ability of the host cell to respond to extracellular ATP, presumably through a purinergic receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2091527902,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt1p) is an essential 455-residue, monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of myristate from myristoyl-CoA to the NH2-terminal Gly residue of cellular proteins. Nmt1p has an ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism with binding of myristoyl-CoA occurring before binding of peptide substrates. To define residues important for function, the polymerase chain reaction was used to generate random mutations in the NMT1 gene. A colony color sectoring assay was used to screen a library of 52,000 transformants for nmt1 alleles encoding enzymes with reduced activity. nmt1 alleles were identified that produced temperature-sensitive (ts) growth arrest due to substitutions affecting eight residues conserved in orthologous Nmts: Asn102, Ala202, Cys217, Ser328, Val395, Asn404, Leu420, and Asn426. Ala202→ Thr, Cys217→ Arg, Ser328→ Pro, Asn404→ Tyr, and Asn426→ Ile produced the most severe ts phenotype. Their effects on the functional properties of the enzyme's myristoyl-CoA and peptide binding sites were defined by purifying each mutant from Escherichia coli and conducting in vitro kinetic analyses with acyl-CoA and peptide substrates and with two competitive inhibitors: S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA, a nonhydrolyzable myristoyl-CoA analog, and SC-58272, a peptidomimetic derived from the NH2-terminal sequence of an Nmt1p substrate (ADP-ribosylation factor-2, Arf2p). None of the substitutions affect the enzyme's acyl chain length selectivity. When compared with wild type Nmt1p, Cys217→ Arg produces 3- and 6-fold increases in Ki for SC-58272 at 24 and 37°C but no change in Ki for S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA, indicating that the substitution selectively affects Nmt1p's peptide binding site. Asn426→ Ile selectively perturbs the myristoyl-CoA binding site, resulting in the most pronounced reduction in affinity for S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA (12- and 20-fold). Ala202→ Thr, which confers the most severe ts phenotype, provides an example of a substitution that affects both sites, producing 3- and 6-fold increases in the Ki for S-(2-oxo)pentadecyl-CoA and 6- and 9-fold increases in the Ki for SC-58272 at 24 and 37°C. An N-myristoylation-dependent change in the electrophoretic mobility of Arf1p was used to assay the effects of the mutants on cellular levels of protein N-myristoylation under a variety of growth conditions. The ts growth arrest produced by nmt1 alleles correlates with a reduction in myristoyl-Arf1p to ≤50% of total cellular Arf1p."

https://openalex.org/W2059982322,"The tyrosine kinase receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src play critical roles in osteoclast differentiation and function. Since the ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein Grb2 plays an important role in several tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways, we used a filter binding assay to identify osteoclast proteins that bind to Grb2. In osteoclasts, there were three major Grb2-binding proteins, two of which, mSos and c-Cbl (p120), have been previously identified as Grb2-binding proteins in many cell types. The third protein, p135, had a restricted pattern of expression and was present at high levels in authentic osteoclasts and osteoclast-like cells formed in an in vitro co-culture system. In addition to binding Grb2 in the filter binding assay, p135 was isolated in complexes with endogenous Grb2 from osteoclast cell extracts. The association of p135 and Grb2 was dependent on an intact Src homology 3 domain and furthermore, was shown to preferentially interact with the N-terminal Src homology 3 domain of Grb2, which is similar to the interaction of mSos and Grb2 in other cell types. p135 was not recognized by antibodies against several known Grb2-binding proteins and thus may be a novel Grb2-binding protein."
