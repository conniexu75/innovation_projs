https://openalex.org/W2103761010,"Many of the immune and metabolic changes occurring during normal pregnancy also describe metabolic syndrome. Gut microbiota can cause symptoms of metabolic syndrome in nonpregnant hosts. Here, to explore their role in pregnancy, we characterized fecal bacteria of 91 pregnant women of varying prepregnancy BMIs and gestational diabetes status and their infants. Similarities between infant-mother microbiotas increased with children’s age, and the infant microbiota was unaffected by mother’s health status. Gut microbiota changed dramatically from first (T1) to third (T3) trimesters, with vast expansion of diversity between mothers, an overall increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and reduced richness. T3 stool showed strongest signs of inflammation and energy loss; however, microbiome gene repertoires were constant between trimesters. When transferred to germ-free mice, T3 microbiota induced greater adiposity and insulin insensitivity compared to T1. Our findings indicate that host-microbial interactions that impact host metabolism can occur and may be beneficial in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2109838283,"The Hippo pathway is crucial in organ size control, and its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. However, upstream signals that regulate the mammalian Hippo pathway have remained elusive. Here, we report that the Hippo pathway is regulated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Serum-borne lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphophate (S1P) act through G12/13-coupled receptors to inhibit the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2, thereby activating YAP and TAZ transcription coactivators, which are oncoproteins repressed by Lats1/2. YAP and TAZ are involved in LPA-induced gene expression, cell migration, and proliferation. In contrast, stimulation of Gs-coupled receptors by glucagon or epinephrine activates Lats1/2 kinase activity, thereby inhibiting YAP function. Thus, GPCR signaling can either activate or inhibit the Hippo-YAP pathway depending on the coupled G protein. Our study identifies extracellular diffusible signals that modulate the Hippo pathway and also establishes the Hippo-YAP pathway as a critical signaling branch downstream of GPCR."
https://openalex.org/W2053142936,"Chronic low-grade adipose tissue and liver inflammation is a major cause of systemic insulin resistance and is a key component of the low degree of insulin sensitivity that exists in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Immune cells, such as macrophages, T cells, B cells, mast cells and eosinophils, have all been implicated as having a role in this process. Neutrophils are typically the first immune cells to respond to inflammation and can exacerbate the chronic inflammatory state by helping to recruit macrophages and by interacting with antigen-presenting cells. Neutrophils secrete several proteases, one of which is neutrophil elastase, which can promote inflammatory responses in several disease models. Here we show that treatment of hepatocytes with neutrophil elastase causes cellular insulin resistance and that deletion of neutrophil elastase in high-fat-diet–induced obese (DIO) mice leads to less tissue inflammation that is associated with lower adipose tissue neutrophil and macrophage content. These changes are accompanied by improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity. Taken together, we show that neutrophils can be added to the extensive repertoire of immune cells that participate in inflammation-induced metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2065168340,"A guinea-pig model of cardiac injury is used to show that human embryonic stem-cell-derived cardiomyocyte grafts can electrically integrate into the injured heart, improving mechanical function and reducing spontaneous and induced ventricular tachycardia; this is a major step towards clinical adoption of cell replacement therapies for cardiovascular diseases using human cardiomyocytes. This study extends previous findings that transplantation of fetal cardiomyocytes can improve the function of infarcted hearts, despite having only a modest effect on the organ's mechanical properties. The investigators developed a guinea pig model of cardiac injury, because the heart rate of these animals is at the upper end of what is tolerable to human cardiomyocytes, and much lower than that of the mice and rats often used as models. The authors show that cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells can integrate electrically into the guinea pig heart and protect against arrhythmias. This is the first convincing evidence that cardiomyocytes generated from cultured human embryonic stem cells can integrate into the adult heart, and is therefore a major step towards the clinical adoption of cell-replacement therapies for cardiovascular disease. Transplantation studies in mice and rats have shown that human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) can improve the function of infarcted hearts1,2,3, but two critical issues related to their electrophysiological behaviour in vivo remain unresolved. First, the risk of arrhythmias following hESC-CM transplantation in injured hearts has not been determined. Second, the electromechanical integration of hESC-CMs in injured hearts has not been demonstrated, so it is unclear whether these cells improve contractile function directly through addition of new force-generating units. Here we use a guinea-pig model to show that hESC-CM grafts in injured hearts protect against arrhythmias and can contract synchronously with host muscle. Injured hearts with hESC-CM grafts show improved mechanical function and a significantly reduced incidence of both spontaneous and induced ventricular tachycardia. To assess the activity of hESC-CM grafts in vivo, we transplanted hESC-CMs expressing the genetically encoded calcium sensor, GCaMP3 (refs 4, 5). By correlating the GCaMP3 fluorescent signal with the host ECG, we found that grafts in uninjured hearts have consistent 1:1 host–graft coupling. Grafts in injured hearts are more heterogeneous and typically include both coupled and uncoupled regions. Thus, human myocardial grafts meet physiological criteria for true heart regeneration, providing support for the continued development of hESC-based cardiac therapies for both mechanical and electrical repair."
https://openalex.org/W1985549756,"Acquired resistance to anticancer treatments is a substantial barrier to reducing the morbidity and mortality that is attributable to malignant tumors. Components of tissue microenvironments are recognized to profoundly influence cellular phenotypes, including susceptibilities to toxic insults. Using a genome-wide analysis of transcriptional responses to genotoxic stress induced by cancer therapeutics, we identified a spectrum of secreted proteins derived from the tumor microenvironment that includes the Wnt family member wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 16B (WNT16B). We determined that WNT16B expression is regulated by nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NF-κB) after DNA damage and subsequently signals in a paracrine manner to activate the canonical Wnt program in tumor cells. The expression of WNT16B in the prostate tumor microenvironment attenuated the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in vivo, promoting tumor cell survival and disease progression. These results delineate a mechanism by which genotoxic therapies given in a cyclical manner can enhance subsequent treatment resistance through cell nonautonomous effects that are contributed by the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2112936536,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) can disperse stored energy as heat. Promoting BAT-like features in white adipose (WAT) is an attractive, if elusive, therapeutic approach to staunch the current obesity epidemic. Here we report that gain of function of the NAD-dependent deacetylase SirT1 or loss of function of its endogenous inhibitor Deleted in breast cancer-1 (Dbc1) promote ""browning"" of WAT by deacetylating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (Ppar)-γ on Lys268 and Lys293. SirT1-dependent deacetylation of Lys268 and Lys293 is required to recruit the BAT program coactivator Prdm16 to Pparγ, leading to selective induction of BAT genes and repression of visceral WAT genes associated with insulin resistance. An acetylation-defective Pparγ mutant induces a brown phenotype in white adipocytes, whereas an acetylated mimetic fails to induce ""brown"" genes but retains the ability to activate ""white"" genes. We propose that SirT1-dependent Pparγ deacetylation is a form of selective Pparγ modulation of potential therapeutic import."
https://openalex.org/W2036796078,"N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are located in neuronal cell membranes at synaptic and extrasynaptic locations, where they are believed to mediate distinct physiological and pathological processes. Activation of NMDARs requires glutamate and a coagonist whose nature and impact on NMDAR physiology remain elusive. We report that synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs are gated by different endogenous coagonists, d-serine and glycine, respectively. The regionalized availability of the coagonists matches the preferential affinity of synaptic NMDARs for d-serine and extrasynaptic NMDARs for glycine. Furthermore, glycine and d-serine inhibit NMDAR surface trafficking in a subunit-dependent manner, which is likely to influence NMDARs subcellular location. Taking advantage of this coagonist segregation, we demonstrate that long-term potentiation and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity rely on synaptic NMDARs only. Conversely, long-term depression requires both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. Our observations provide key insights into the operating mode of NMDARs, emphasizing functional distinctions between synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs in brain physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2153475997,"Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), master regulator of the heat-shock response, facilitates malignant transformation, cancer cell survival, and proliferation in model systems. The common assumption is that these effects are mediated through regulation of heat-shock protein (HSP) expression. However, the transcriptional network that HSF1 coordinates directly in malignancy and its relationship to the heat-shock response have never been defined. By comparing cells with high and low malignant potential alongside their nontransformed counterparts, we identify an HSF1-regulated transcriptional program specific to highly malignant cells and distinct from heat shock. Cancer-specific genes in this program support oncogenic processes: cell-cycle regulation, signaling, metabolism, adhesion and translation. HSP genes are integral to this program, however, many are uniquely regulated in malignancy. This HSF1 cancer program is active in breast, colon and lung tumors isolated directly from human patients and is strongly associated with metastasis and death. Thus, HSF1 rewires the transcriptome in tumorigenesis, with prognostic and therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2028326666,"The mammary epithelium undergoes extensive growth and remodeling during pregnancy, suggesting a role for stem cells. Yet their origin, identity, and behavior in the intact tissue remain unknown. Using an Axin2CreERT2 allele, we labeled and traced Wnt/β-catenin-responsive cells throughout mammary gland development. This reveals a switch in Wnt/β-catenin signaling around birth and shows that, depending on the developmental stage, Axin2+ cells contribute differently to basal and luminal epithelial cell lineages of the mammary epithelium. Moreover, an important difference exists between the developmental potential tested in transplantation assays and that displayed by the same cell population in situ. Finally, Axin2+ cells in the adult build alveolar structures during multiple pregnancies, demonstrating the existence of a Wnt/β-catenin-responsive adult stem cell. Our study uncovers dynamic changes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the mammary epithelium and offers insights into the developmental fate of mammary gland stem and progenitor cells."

NPHP-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) are single-gene recessive disorders that affect kidney, retina, brain, and liver by prenatal-onset dysplasia or by organ degeneration and fibrosis in early adulthood. Identification of recessive mutations in more than ten different genes (NPHP1-NPHP13) revealed that their gene products share localization at the primary cilia-centrosomes complex and mitotic spindle poles in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, characterizing them as retinal-renal “ciliopathies” (Ansley et al., 2003Ansley S.J.

Multiple signaling pathways downstream of cilia have been implicated in the disease mechanisms of NPHP-RC, including Wnt signaling (Germino, 2005Germino G.G. Linking cilia to Wnts.Nat.

However, despite convergence of ciliopathy pathogenesis at cilia and centrosomes it remains largely unknown what signaling pathways downstream of cilia and centrosome function operate in the disease mechanisms that generate the NPHP-RC phenotypes. Centrosomal proteins have been recently implicated in DNA damage response (DDR). Both pericentrin (PCNT), a core centrosomal protein (Doxsey et al., 1994Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D.

PCNT- and CEP152 mutant cells are also defective in ATR-dependent DDR signaling, consistent with the fact that the first mutation identified in Seckel syndrome was in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR), a key phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase involved in DDR signaling (O’Driscoll et al., 2003O’Driscoll M. Ruiz-Perez V.L. Woods C.G. Jeggo P.A. Goodship J.A. A splicing mutation affecting expression of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) results in Seckel syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of the signaling defect is not fully understood. The known NPHP genes explain less than 50% of all cases with NPHP-RC, and many of the single-gene causes of NPHP-RC are still unknown (Otto et al., 2011Otto E.A. Ramaswami G. Janssen S. Chaki M. Allen S.J. Zhou W. Airik R. Hurd T.W. Ghosh A.K. Wolf M.T. et al.GPN Study GroupMutation analysis of 18 nephronophthisis associated ciliopathy disease genes using a DNA pooling and next generation sequencing strategy.J. Med. Genet. 2011; 48: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The finding that some of the recently identified genetic causes of NPHP-RC are exceedingly rare (Attanasio et al., 2007Attanasio M. Uhlenhaut N.H. Sousa V.H. O’Toole J.F. Otto E. Anlag K. Klugmann C. Treier A.C. Helou J. Sayer J.A. et al.Loss of GLIS2 causes nephronophthisis in humans and mice by increased apoptosis and fibrosis.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) necessitates the ability to identify novel single-gene causes of NPHP-RC in single affected families. To achieve this goal, we developed a strategy that combines homozygosity mapping (HM) with whole-exome resequencing (WER) (Otto et al., 2010Otto E.A. Hurd T.W. Airik R. Chaki M. Zhou W. Stoetzel C. Patil S.B. Levy S. Ghosh A.K. Murga-Zamalloa C.A. et al.Candidate exome capture identifies mutation of SDCCAG8 as the cause of a retinal-renal ciliopathy.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 840-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because this approach allows identification of multiple different causes of NPHP-RC within a short time frame, it has the potential of delineating pathogenic pathways. Using this approach, we identify here mutations in three NPHP-RC genes, MRE11, ZNF423, and CEP164, which together suggest involvement of a DDR signaling pathway in NPHP-RC pathogenesis. Identification of monogenic causes of ciliopathies is limited by their rarity (Attanasio et al., 2007Attanasio M. Uhlenhaut N.H. Sousa V.H. O’Toole J.F. Otto E. Anlag K. Klugmann C. Treier A.C. Helou J. Sayer J.A. et al.Loss of GLIS2 causes nephronophthisis in humans and mice by increased apoptosis and fibrosis.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), necessitating methods to identify ciliopathy-causing genes in single families by using WER. However, WER typically yields hundreds of variants from normal reference sequence (Ng et al., 2009Ng S.B. Turner E.H. Robertson P.D. Flygare S.D. Bigham A.W. Lee C. Shaffer T. Wong M.

Eichler E.E. et al.Targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing of 12 human exomes.Nature. 2009; 461: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar), whereas only a single-gene mutation will represent the disease cause. To overcome this limitation, we here combined WER with HM (Hildebrandt et al., 2009aHildebrandt F. Heeringa S.F. Rüschendorf F. Attanasio M. Nürnberg G. Becker C. Seelow D. Huebner N. Chernin G. Vlangos C.N. et al.A systematic approach to mapping recessive disease genes in individuals from outbred populations.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000353Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in sib pairs affected with NPHP-RC and performed functional analysis of the identified genes (Otto et al., 2010Otto E.A.

HM yielded positional candidate regions of homozygosity by descent (Hildebrandt et al., 2009aHildebrandt F. Heeringa S.F. Rüschendorf F. Attanasio M. Nürnberg G. Becker C. Seelow D. Huebner N.

We then performed WER in one affected individual of each of the three NPHP-RC families (Ng et al., 2009Ng S.B. Turner E.H. Robertson P.D. Flygare S.D. Bigham A.W. Lee C. Shaffer T. Wong M.

Remarkably, each of three NPHP-RC genes consecutively identified by this approach, MRE11, ZNF423, and CEP164, suggested a functional connection to the DDR pathway (Figure 1; Table 1).Table 1Mutations of MRE11, ZNF423 and CEP164 in families with NPHP-RCFamilyIndividualsEthnic OriginNucleotide AlterationaAll mutations were absent from >270 healthy control individuals and from the ESP Exome Variant Server data base, except the CEP164 variant p.R576X (allele frequency in European Americans 1/7,019)., bcDNA mutation numbering is based on human reference sequences NM_014956.4 for MRE11, NM_015069.2 for ZNF423, and NP_055771 for CEP164, where +1 corresponds to the A of ATG start translation codon.

In family A3471, two siblings had cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (CVH), a central feature of NPHP-RC (Table 1). Homozygosity mapping yielded two candidate loci (Figure 1A). WER detected a homozygous truncation mutation (p.R633X) of MRE11 (Figure 1B; Table 1) previously described for CVH in another Pakistani family (Stewart et al., 1999Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M.

MRE11 is an essential component of the ATM-Chk2 pathway of DDR (Figure S1 available online), where it recruits ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (Figure S1A). Rediscovery of this MRE11 mutation in family A3471 thus generated an unexpected link between NPHP-RC phenotype and the ATM pathway of DDR signaling (Figure S1A). Another link of NPHP-RC to the ATM pathway of DDR signaling emerged from HM and WER in two siblings (F874) with infantile onset NPHP, CVH, and situs inversus (Table 1). SNP mapping yielded nine candidate regions of homozygosity by descent (Figure 1C). We identified in both affected individuals a homozygous missense mutation (p.P913L; conserved in vertebrates) of ZNF423 (Figure 1D). In addition, when examining 96 additional Joubert syndrome (JS) subjects, we detected two heterozygous-only mutations of ZNF423: p.P506fsX43 in family A106 and p.H1277Y in individual A111-21 (Table 1). Mutations of the mouse ortholog Zfp423 cause reduced proliferation and abnormal development of midline neural progenitors resulting in a loss of the cerebellar vermis (Alcaraz et al., 2006Alcaraz W.A. Gold D.A. Raponi E. Gent P.M. Concepcion D. Hamilton B.A. Zfp423 controls proliferation and differentiation of neural precursors in cerebellar vermis formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The transcription factor Zfp423/OAZ is required for cerebellar development and CNS midline patterning.Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) similar to that seen in JS patients with CVH. ZNF423 encodes a protein with 30 zinc fingers (Figure 2A). Mouse models display phenotypic variability that is subject to modifier genes, environment, and stochastic effects (Alcaraz et al., 2011Alcaraz W.A. Chen E. Valdes P. Kim E. Lo Y.H. Vo J. Hamilton B.A. Modifier genes and non-genetic factors reshape anatomical deficits in Zfp423-deficient mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar; Alcaraz et al., 2006Alcaraz W.A. Gold D.A. Raponi E. Gent P.M. Concepcion D.

USA. 2006; 103: 19424-19429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), consistent with the variable presentations of NPHP-RC patients. The homozygous mutation p.P913L, located between zinc fingers 21 and 22 (Figure 2A), most likely exerts recessive loss-of-function, analogous to the Zfp423 mouse models. We next examined whether the heterozygous-only mutations (Table 1) lead to loss of function via a dominant mechanism, using a proliferation assay in P19 cells (Figures 2B–2D). Mutations were engineered into a FLAG-tagged ZNF423 cDNA and assayed by a S-phase index, defined as the proportion of transfected cells that incorporate BrdU in 1 hr, 48 hr after transfection. Simple loss-of-function alleles should not interfere with endogenous Zfp423 activity in this assay. Indeed, overexpression of either wild-type or the homozygous p.P913L allele had no effect (Figure 2D). However, transfection with either the p.P506fsX43 frame-shifting allele, which removes the zinc fingers required for SMAD (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) and EBF (early B cell factor) interactions, and the H1277Y substitution allele, which destroys the terminal zinc finger required for EBF interaction, reduced the mitotic index to little more than half that of cells transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) control vector or other alleles of ZNF423 (Figures 2B–2D). A dominant mechanism is plausible for the two heterozygous mutations, as each is predicted to interfere selectively with a subset of interaction domains (Figure 2A). Neither subject had siblings, and DNA from parents was not available to determine whether the mutations occurred de novo. We detected five additional putative mutations in highly conserved (including histidine knuckle) residues of ZNF423 among JS families (Table S1). Although these mutations have not been confirmed functionally, the high incidence of predicted deleterious mutations found in patients but absent from 270 healthy control individuals, dbSNP, and 1000 Genomes Project data further support identification of ZNF423 as a causal gene in NPHP-RC and JS. ZNF423/OAZ was recently shown to interact with the DNA ds-damage sensor PARP1 (poly-ADP ribosyl polymerase 1) (Ku et al., 2003Ku M.C. Stewart S. Hata A. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 interacts with OAZ and regulates BMP-target genes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which recruits MRE11 and ATM to sites of DNA damage (Figure S1A). This indirectly linked ZNF423 to the ATM pathway of DNA damage signaling (Figure S1A). We therefore tested whether ZNF423 mutations affect interaction between ZNF423 and PARP1. Coimmunoprecipitation verified the association of ZNF423 and PARP1 in reciprocal assays (Figure 2E). More importantly, the truncating mutation P506fsX43, which we detected in a JS patient (Table 1), abrogates this interaction (Figure 2E), whereas H1277Y inhibits multimerization of ZNF423 (Figure 2E). In addition, depletion of ZNF423 mRNA caused sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (see below). Furthermore, we identified ZNF423 as a direct interaction partner of CEP290/NPHP6, which is mutated in NPHP-RC (Sayer et al., 2006Sayer J.A. Otto E.A. O’Toole J.F. Nurnberg G. Kennedy M.A. Becker C. Hennies H.C. Helou J. Attanasio M. Fausett B.V. et al.The centrosomal protein nephrocystin-6 is mutated in Joubert syndrome and activates transcription factor ATF4.Nat.

In a yeast two-hybrid screen of human fetal brain library with a CEP290 (JAS2; amino acids 1917–2479) “bait” we found three in-frame “prey” sequences corresponding to ZNF423 (amino acids 178-406). This interaction was confirmed (Figures 2F and 2G). CEP290/NPHP6 is known to interact with the NPHP-RC protein NPHP5 (Schäfer et al., 2008Schäfer T. Pütz M. Lienkamp S. Ganner A. Bergbreiter A. Ramachandran H. Gieloff V. Gerner M. Mattonet C. Czarnecki P.G. et al.Genetic and physical interaction between the NPHP5 and NPHP6 gene products.Hum. Mol.

Baye L.M. Wen X. Scales S.J.

We obtained 14 candidate regions by HM in a Saudi family (KKESH001) of first-cousin parents with a child who had LCA (which can be allelic with NPHP-RC) with nystagmus, hyperopic discs, vascular attenuation, diffuse retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, and nonrecordable ERG (Table 1) (Figure 1E). Using WER we detected a homozygous point mutation in CEP164 (centrosomal protein 164 kDa) that abolished the termination codon, adding 57 amino acid residues to the open reading frame (p.X1460WextX57) (Figure 1F, Table 1). The mutation was absent from 96 Saudi healthy controls and from 224 North American LCA patients who lack mutations in other known LCA genes. We performed exon-PCR and Sanger sequencing of all 31 coding exons for one affected individual in each of 856 different NPHP-RC families (see Extended Experimental Procedures). We detected both mutated CEP164 alleles in each of three additional families with NPHP-RC (Table 1; Figure S2). We thereby identified recessive mutations of CEP164 as an additional cause of NPHP-RC. Because of the significant overlap of phenotypic features with other forms of NPHP-RC we introduce the alias “NPHP14” for ZNF423 and “NPHP15” for the CEP164 protein. Although the number of families with CEP164 mutation is small, our findings support a gradient of genotype-phenotype correlations characteristic of NPHP-RC (Table 1), in which null mutations cause the severe dysplastic phenotypes of Meckel syndrome and JS, whereas hypomorphic alleles cause the milder degenerative phenotypes of NPHP and SLSN (Hildebrandt et al., 2011Hildebrandt F. Benzing T. Katsanis N. Ciliopathies.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 364: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). CEP164 is transcribed into three common isoforms (Figures S2A–S2C) and is part of the photoreceptor sensory cilium proteome (Liu et al., 2007Liu Q. Tan G. Levenkova N. Li T. Pugh Jr., E.N. Rux J.J. Speicher D.W. Pierce E.A. The proteome of the mouse photoreceptor sensory cilium complex.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1299-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To study subcellular localization of the CEP164 protein, we utilized antibodies against human CEP164 for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence (Figure S3). By confocal microscopy of GFP-labeled CEP164 protein with other labels, we show that CEP164 colocalizes in hTERT-RPE cells with the mother centriole, with the mitotic spindle poles, and with the abscission structure in a cell-cycle-dependent way (Figure S4), a feature characteristic of proteins involved in single-gene ciliopathies (Otto et al., 2010Otto E.A.

We thus demonstrated lack of centrosomal localization for the truncating mutation p.Q525X and for an equivalent of the p.X1460WextX57 mutation. Loss of function of several genes that cause nephronophthisis in NPHP-RC cause disruption of 3D architecture of renal epithelial cell culture (Otto et al., 2010Otto E.A. Hurd T.W. Airik R. Chaki M.

To evaluate CEP164 by this criterion, we transfected murine kidney IMCD3 cells with siRNA oligonucleotides against murine Cep164, or random sequences (Ctrl) in 3D spheroid growth assays. Cells transfected with siCep164 developed spheroids with overall normal architecture and size, but with markedly reduced frequency of cilia (Figures 3E–3H). We conclude that Cep164 affects ciliogenesis or maintenance but that the overall architecture of renal 3D growths is not as grossly affected as we have previously seen for knockdown of other NPHP-RC genes (Sang et al., 2011Sang L.

A noncentrosomal localization for CEP164 was described by demonstrating its translocation to nuclear foci in response to DNA damage (Pan and Lee, 2009Pan Y.R. Lee E.Y.

CEP164 plays a role in DDR signaling where it interacts with the DDR protein ATRIP (Figure S2C), is activated by the DDR proteins ATM and ATR, and is necessary for checkpoint-1 (Chk1) activation. Abrogation of CEP164 function leads to loss of G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint and aberrant nuclear divisions (Sivasubramaniam et al., 2008Sivasubramaniam S. Sun X. Pan Y.R. Wang S. Lee E.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2040207361,"Coated pits assemble by growth of a clathrin lattice, which is linked by adaptors to the underlying membrane. How does this process start? We used live-cell TIRF imaging with single-molecule EGFP sensitivity and high temporal resolution to detect arrival of the clathrin triskelions and AP2 adaptors that initiate coat assembly. Unbiased object identification and trajectory tracking, together with a statistical model, yield the arrival times and numbers of individual proteins, as well as experimentally confirmed estimates of the extent of substitution of endogenous by expressed, fluorescently tagged proteins. Pits initiate by coordinated arrival of clathrin and AP2, which is usually detected as two sequential steps, each of one triskelion with two adaptors. PI-4,5-P2 is essential for initiation. The accessory proteins FCHo1/2 are not; instead, they are required for sustained growth. This objective picture of coated pit initiation also shows that methods outlined here will be broadly useful for studies of dynamic assemblies in living cells."

https://openalex.org/W2011844788,"Endocytosis, like many dynamic cellular processes, requires precise temporal and spatial orchestration of complex protein machinery to mediate membrane budding. To understand how this machinery works, we directly correlated fluorescence microscopy of key protein pairs with electron tomography. We systematically located 211 endocytic intermediates, assigned each to a specific time window in endocytosis, and reconstructed their ultrastructure in 3D. The resulting virtual ultrastructural movie defines the protein-mediated membrane shape changes during endocytosis in budding yeast. It reveals that clathrin is recruited to flat membranes and does not initiate curvature. Instead, membrane invagination begins upon actin network assembly followed by amphiphysin binding to parallel membrane segments, which promotes elongation of the invagination into a tubule. Scission occurs on average 9 s after initial bending when invaginations are ∼100 nm deep, releasing nonspherical vesicles with 6,400 nm2 mean surface area. Direct correlation of protein dynamics with ultrastructure provides a quantitative 4D resource."

A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward understanding eukaryotic transcription regulation. Yet, there is still much to be learned about how the molecular properties of TFs give rise to the complex behavior of transcriptional networks. A synthetic approach, whereby minimal and insulated components and circuitry can be constructed to recapitulate eukaryotic transcription function, would be valuable for studying how transcriptional regulatory complexes are assembled and how TFs wire together transcriptional networks. A framework for eukaryotic transcription regulation would also be broadly valuable to synthetic biology efforts, which seek to uncover the design principles of gene regulatory networks and program novel biological functions for a range of biotechnological and industrial applications (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006Andrianantoandro E.

Gene regulation at the single-cell level.Science. 2005; 307: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In these and virtually all other studies of synthetic transcriptional networks, circuitry has been constructed using a handful of well-studied prokaryotic TFs; these “off-the-shelf parts” represent the extent of well-understood and reliable transcriptional components. Indeed, the synthetic construction of transcriptional networks in eukaryotes has relied heavily upon importing these same bacterial TF-promoter pairs (Lu et al., 2009Lu T.K. Khalil A.S. Collins J.J. Next-generation synthetic gene networks.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar; Weber and Fussenegger, 2009Weber W. Fussenegger M. Engineering of synthetic mammalian gene networks.Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This approach has advantages, as bacterial TFs are largely orthogonal to eukaryotic transcriptional machinery. Additionally, because bacterial TFs perform relatively simple molecular tasks (as compared with eukaryotic TFs), assembling and programming simple circuitry with them can be straightforward. Yet, for this reason, and because they regulate transcription in fundamentally different ways than their eukaryotic counterparts, bacterial TFs are a poor starting point for engineering many of the complex transcriptional functions enumerated above. Furthermore, bacterial TFs are severely limiting with respect to extensibility—they bind to specific target sequences and often oligomerize cooperatively when bound. Typically, these functions are integrated and coupled, making the tuning of any one property difficult. Laborious re-engineering schemes, such as directed evolution, may be required to generate an expanded set of components. As a result, the use of bacterial TFs is unlikely to scale to the more sophisticated circuitry needed for engineering transcriptional regulatory function in eukaryotic systems. Here, we present an alternative approach to engineering transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes using synthetic transcription factors (sTFs) constructed from Cys2-His2 zinc finger (ZF) domains (Figure 1). The sTFs feature a modular design in which separate protein domains carry out individual molecular functions: ZF domains enable binding to DNA at user-specified sequences embedded within an engineered promoter, the transcriptional output for that promoter is driven by an activation domain that recruits basal transcription machinery, and a protein-protein interaction domain allows cooperative interactions with adjacent TFs. This decomposed design permits the facile tuning of individual sTF component properties. ZF domains were selected to carry out sTF DNA binding function because of their potential for engineered sequence specificity. ZFs are small (∼30 amino acid) domains that bind to ∼3 bps of DNA (Elrod-Erickson et al., 1998Elrod-Erickson M. Benson T.E. Pabo C.O.

ZFs are utilized in natural transcriptional networks in virtually all eukaryotic taxa to solve the combinatorial problem of DNA recognition by binding to promoter sequences in tandem arrays (Pabo et al., 2001Pabo C.O.

Using the OPEN platform, we construct a library of specific and orthogonal sTF-promoter pairs, and demonstrate that these pairs can be used to wire synthetic transcriptional cascades in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then use these circuits as a testbed system for exploring the relationship between circuit output and sTF function. We find that a few, key properties, e.g., DNA specificity, DNA affinity, promoter-operator design, and protein interactions, can be rationally and independently adjusted to tune transcriptional behavior. For example, we demonstrate the tuning of transcriptional output through the perturbation of ZF binding affinity and operator number. Additionally, we engineer cooperative transcriptional systems by multimerizing weakly-activating sTF monomers using modular protein-protein interaction domains. Finally, in order to synthetically explore transcriptional signal integration, we construct a set of simple two-input promoters that recruit two individual sTFs. By systematically altering the architecture of the complex through subtle changes to the component properties of the sTFs, we can assign entirely different transcriptional roles to an individual sTF and thus dramatically alter the signal processing of the system. Transcriptional networks, natural and synthetic, are wired together with sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions. We sought to program DNA-binding specificity, via artificial ZF proteins, in order to wire specific and orthogonal transcriptional connections in the eukaryote, S. cerevisiae. To do so, we first devised a platform by which ZF-based sTFs could be readily constructed and customized. The platform consists of a cassette, into which artificial three-finger arrays with engineered specificities are inserted to generate sTF species. The sTF cassette is paired with a synthetic promoter bearing ZF binding sequences that act as operators for the sTFs (Figure 2A). Transcriptional activation is one of the most common mechanisms for the control of gene regulation and appears to be a universally conserved process in all eukaryotes, from fungi to metazoans (Fischer et al., 1988Fischer J.A.

We utilized the principle of activation by recruitment (Ptashne, 1988Ptashne M. How eukaryotic transcriptional activators work.Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar; Ptashne and Gann, 1997Ptashne M. Gann A. Transcriptional activation by recruitment.Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) to test our sTFs as minimal transcriptional activators. In our design, the engineered ZF array recapitulates the TF function of binding to a specific DNA site, in this case, to its cognate 9 bp operator in a synthetic promoter. The ZF protein is fused to a VP16 minimal activation domain (AD), which autonomously facilitates recruitment of the RNA polymerase II machinery for mRNA initiation (Ptashne, 1988Ptashne M. How eukaryotic transcriptional activators work.Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). This scheme provides a decoupled, modular approach to transcriptional activation, whereby TFs and the initiation machinery can be synthetically recruited in combinatorial fashion. From these components, we constructed a synthetic transcriptional cascade and used it as a test bed for rationally customizing the properties of our transcriptional components to program in vivo behaviors (Figure 2A). Within the circuit, sTF activators are first transcribed from a previously described TetR-controlled GAL1 promoter (Ellis et al., 2009Ellis T. Wang X. Collins J.J. Diversity-based, model-guided construction of synthetic gene networks with predicted functions.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar; Murphy et al., 2007Murphy K.F. Balázsi G. Collins J.J. Combinatorial promoter design for engineering noisy gene expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12726-12731Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which is induced by anhydrotetracycline (ATc). Addition of ATc activates flux through the circuit to produce sTF activators, which in turn activate downstream transcription from cognate synthetic promoters to produce yEGFP expression (Figure 2B; Figure S1 available online). The resulting gene regulatory transfer function, which combines the effects of the TetR expression system and the operation of sTFs on their synthetic promoters, exhibits monotonic, dose-dependent production of yEGFP (Figure 2B). These results suggest that desired synthetic transcriptional connections can be made based on the specificity of engineered ZF proteins to their target sites. With the OPEN selection system, we have the ability to rapidly alter the ZF-DNA interaction specificity to create a large library of interaction partners (i.e., engineered ZF proteins and corresponding target sites). We used artificial ZF arrays constructed by OPEN to generate a library of sTF-promoter pairs. In particular, we identified 19 three-finger arrays with binding specificities predicted to be orthogonal to one another (we predominately chose OPEN ZF arrays that had been engineered to bind sequences in orthologous genes found in plants, insects, and metazoans) (Figure 3A). The artificial arrays and cognate binding sequences were inserted into our framework, and the resulting library of sTF-promoter pairs were tested for activation by triggering our synthetic circuits. We found that the sTFs activated yEGFP expression from cognate promoters by factors of 1.3–6.6 (compared to uninduced cells) (Figure 3B), showing that we could indeed make sequence-specific transcriptional connections with artificially designed ZF arrays. Notably, yEGFP expression levels in uninduced cells were mostly found to be similar to the basal expression levels of cells harboring only synthetic promoters (Figure S2). Thus, in general, a signal was produced only when we induced expression of an sTF in the presence of a cognate promoter.Figure S2Flow Cytometry Data of Transcriptional Activation by a Library of Synthetic Transcription Factor-Promoter Pairs, Related to Figure 3Show full captionyEGFP expression for cells harboring only synthetic promoters, uninduced (light red) and induced (red), and for cells harboring full synthetic transcription factor (sTF) circuits, uninduced (light blue) and induced (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) yEGFP expression for cells harboring only synthetic promoters, uninduced (light red) and induced (red), and for cells harboring full synthetic transcription factor (sTF) circuits, uninduced (light blue) and induced (blue). We next investigated whether the transcriptional connections made within our library of sTFs were indeed specific only to their cognate synthetic promoters. We selected a subset of six sTFs from our library that exhibited robust activation (>2.5-fold) (Figure 3B, red stars), and crossed them with each of the other noncognate promoters. Upon triggering the circuit, we observed no cross-activation in the subset of tested sTFs (Figure 3C) with one notable exception: the effect of sTF43-8 on Promoter21-16. Examination of the sequence just downstream of the ZF operator for Promoter21-16 revealed the fortuitous creation of a sequence possessing significant similarity to the binding sequence of 43-8 (at 8 out of 9 bps) (Figure 3A, blue boxes). Thus, we attribute the observed cross-activation to the presence of this binding sequence within the noncognate promoter. Overall, these results show that synthetic transcriptional connections can be designed to be orthogonal to one another by using the OPEN method to engineer the DNA-binding specificities of ZF arrays. In the design of synthetic elements and gene circuitry, a further “orthogonality” criterion is the degree to which the synthetic system interacts with pathways and machinery native to the cellular host. Ideally, insulated networks would interact with host pathways only at desired nodes and otherwise function independently. Using our synthetic yeast platform, we investigated one potential and rapid method for assessing sTF-host interactions. Specifically, we measured the growth of cells with and without the induction of sTFs, under the assumption that unwanted interactions with the host genome would impose a fitness cost on the cells. We observed no adverse or modest effects on growth in the great majority of sTFs from our library (Figure 3D and Figure S3). Our scheme may thus represent a starting point for designing and screening sTFs with optimal functionality and orthogonality within a desired host. These results show that engineered ZF arrays are effective building blocks for minimal sTF activators, and that DNA interaction specificity is a component property that can be programmed to mediate the construction of specific and orthogonal synthetic transcriptional connections in yeast. Moreover, largely through this ability to engineer DNA specificity for many interaction partners, our platform is able to make meaningful predictions about orthogonality (among synthetic components and with host machinery), which remains a major unaddressed issue in synthetic biology. ZFs are well-studied structural motifs with crystallographic information providing blueprints for harnessing their structure-function relationship to program more complex transcriptional behaviors. We investigated how we could rationally engineer various component properties pertaining to the ZF-DNA interaction to tune transcriptional outputs in our synthetic eukaryotic system. For these studies, we focused on the sTF pair 42-10 and 43-8 (sTF42-10 and sTF43-8) because they activate transcription robustly to similar levels but show orthogonal activities to one another. In addition, these two activators show some distinct properties, e.g., 42-10 seemed to impose a fitness cost on the yeast host, whereas 43-8 did not (Figure 3D). To tune up the level of transcriptional activation, we focused on alterations to the promoter architecture. We multimerized ZF binding sequences to create promoters with repeat operators that would correspondingly recruit greater numbers of sTF interactions and thus ADs. With promoters harboring one, two, and eight tandem operators, we observed a corresponding increase in the transcriptional output of the system, confirming that we could tune up the level of activation (Figure 4A). Importantly, no cross-activation was observed between these sTFs and any of the tandem synthetic promoters (Figure S4).Figure S4sTFs Constructed from OPEN ZFs Operate Orthogonally to One Another, Related to Figure 4Show full captionTranscriptional activation by sTF43-8 on cognate synthetic promoters with one, two, and eight tandem operators, and on orthogonal synthetic promoters with one, two, and eight tandem operators for ZF 42-10.

Error bars represent SD of three experiments. Eukaryotic promoters are known to integrate multiple inputs by binding to distinct TFs. In fact, transcriptional networks may even act as logic gates through such regulation schemes. Our synthetic promoters can similarly be designed to recruit distinct sTFs through architectures that include distinct operators. We constructed a two-input promoter with operators specific for sTF43-8 and sTF42-10. We then directed the expression of sTF43-8 and sTF42-10 under the independent and respective control of TetR- and LacI-controlled GAL1 promoters, which could in turn be induced by the chemical inputs, ATc and isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Upon induction of either or both of the sTF species, we observed transcriptional activation over the uninduced case (Figure 4B), confirming that our promoter design can indeed integrate distinct transcriptional signals in Boolean OR-like fashion. Promoter architecture can be designed to alter the number of sTFs recruited and thus tune transcriptional output strength. An alternative approach is to regulate the ZF-DNA interaction through structure-guided mutation of the ZF backbone to alter nonspecific DNA affinity. Along these lines, we targeted four arginine residues outside of the DNA recognition helices that are known, based on structural studies, to mediate nonspecific interactions of a three-finger array with the DNA phosphate backbone (Elrod-Erickson et al., 1996Elrod-Erickson M.

By contrast, Tim-3 expression and function are defective in multiple human autoimmune diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms modulating Tim-3 function are not well understood. Here we show that human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B)-associated transcript 3 (Bat3) binds to, and represses the function of, Tim-3. Bat3 protects T helper type 1 (TH1) cells from galectin-9–mediated cell death and promotes both proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Bat3-deficient T cells have elevated expression of exhaustion-associated molecules such as Tim-3, Lag3, Prdm1 and Pbx3, and Bat3 knockdown in myelin-antigen–specific CD4+ T cells markedly inhibits the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis while promoting the expansion of a dysfunctional Tim-3hi, interferon-γ (IFN-γ)loCD4+ cell population. Furthermore, expression of Bat3 is reduced in exhausted Tim-3+ T cells from mouse tumors and HIV-1–infected individuals. These data indicate that Bat3 acts as an inhibitor of Tim-3–dependent exhaustion and cell death. Bat3 may thus represent a viable therapeutic target in autoimmune disorders, chronic infections and cancers."

Classical approaches have shown that S. sonnei is genetically conserved and clonal(7). We report here whole-genome sequencing of 132 globally distributed isolates. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the current S. sonnei population descends from a common ancestor that existed less than 500 years ago and that diversified into several distinct lineages with unique characteristics. Our analysis suggests that the majority of this diversification occurred in Europe and was followed by more recent establishment of local pathogen populations on other continents, predominantly due to the pandemic spread of a single, rapidly evolving, multidrug-resistant lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2092226916,"Telomere synthesis in cancer cells and stem cells involves trafficking of telomerase to Cajal bodies, and telomerase is thought to be recruited to telomeres through interactions with telomere-binding proteins. Here, we show that the OB-fold domain of the telomere-binding protein TPP1 recruits telomerase to telomeres through an association with the telomerase reverse transcriptase TERT. When tethered away from telomeres and other telomere-binding proteins, the TPP1 OB-fold domain is sufficient to recruit telomerase to a heterologous chromatin locus. Expression of a minimal TPP1 OB-fold inhibits telomere maintenance by blocking access of telomerase to its cognate binding site at telomeres. We identify amino acids required for the TPP1-telomerase interaction, including specific loop residues within the TPP1 OB-fold domain and individual residues within TERT, some of which are mutated in a subset of pulmonary fibrosis patients. These data define a potential interface for telomerase-TPP1 interaction required for telomere maintenance and implicate defective telomerase recruitment in telomerase-related disease."
https://openalex.org/W2134946659,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) compact chromatin structure and repress gene transcription. In schizophrenia, clinical studies demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors are efficacious when given in combination with atypical antipsychotics. However, the molecular mechanism that integrates a better response to antipsychotics with changes in chromatin structure remains unknown. Here we found that chronic atypical antipsychotics downregulated the transcription of metabotropic glutamate 2 receptor (mGlu2, also known as Grm2), an effect that was associated with decreased histone acetylation at its promoter in mouse and human frontal cortex. This epigenetic change occurred in concert with a serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor-dependent upregulation and increased binding of HDAC2 to the mGlu2 promoter. Virally mediated overexpression of HDAC2 in frontal cortex decreased mGlu2 transcription and its electrophysiological properties, thereby increasing psychosis-like behavior. Conversely, HDAC inhibitors prevented the repressive histone modifications induced at the mGlu2 promoter by atypical antipsychotics, and augmented their therapeutic-like effects. These observations support the view of HDAC2 as a promising new target for schizophrenia treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2090689798,Intact cholesterol homeostasis helps to maintain hematopoietic stem and multipotential progenitor cell (HSPC) quiescence. Mice with defects in cholesterol efflux pathways due to deficiencies of the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 displayed a dramatic increase in HSPC mobilization and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Increased extramedullary hematopoiesis was associated with elevated serum levels of G-CSF due to generation of IL-23 by splenic macrophages and dendritic cells. This favored hematopoietic lineage decisions toward granulocytes rather than macrophages in the bone marrow leading to impaired support for osteoblasts and decreased Cxcl12/SDF-1 production by mesenchymal progenitors. Greater HSPC mobilization and extramedullary hematopoiesis were reversed by raising HDL levels in Abca1(-/-)Abcg1(-/-) and Apoe(-/-) mice or in a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasm mediated by Flt3-ITD mutation. Our data identify a role of cholesterol efflux pathways in the control of HSPC mobilization. This may translate into therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis and hematologic malignancies.
https://openalex.org/W2144406855,"Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) maintain self-renewal and the potential for rapid response to differentiation cues. Both ESC features are subject to epigenetic regulation. Here we show that the histone acetyltransferase Mof plays an essential role in the maintenance of ESC self-renewal and pluripotency. ESCs with Mof deletion lose characteristic morphology, alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, and differentiation potential. They also have aberrant expression of the core transcription factors Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2. Importantly, the phenotypes of Mof null ESCs can be partially suppressed by Nanog overexpression, supporting the idea that Mof functions as an upstream regulator of Nanog in ESCs. Genome-wide ChIP-sequencing and transcriptome analyses further demonstrate that Mof is an integral component of the ESC core transcriptional network and that Mof primes genes for diverse developmental programs. Mof is also required for Wdr5 recruitment and H3K4 methylation at key regulatory loci, highlighting the complexity and interconnectivity of various chromatin regulators in ESCs."

The apical processes are typically in groups, arising from a cluster of Type B cells, and the adjacent ependymal cells form a pinwheel around this center, like petals around the central stigma in an inflorescence; these pinwheels are specific to the striatal germinal zone (Mirzadeh et al., 2008Mirzadeh Z.

Thus, by interacting with the ependymal layer, the apical processes of Type B cells could serve as anchors to provide structural integrity to the niche, and they are positioned perfectly to sense changes in signals in the adjacent humoral compartment, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9647-9651Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). VCAM1 expression is upregulated in response to cytokines, increasing adhesion of HSCs in the bone marrow niche (Simmons et al., 1992Simmons P.J. Masinovsky B. Longenecker B.M. Berenson R. Torok-Storb B. Gallatin W.M. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expressed by bone marrow stromal cells mediates the binding of hematopoietic progenitor cells.Blood. 1992; 80: 388-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the importance of SDF1/CXCR4 for stem cell homing is conserved between blood and brain, we investigated whether VCAM1 function is similarly conserved in the brain niche. Strikingly, we found that bright anti-VCAM1 staining is located on the endfeet of Type B cells in the center of pinwheels. Blocking VCAM1 function severely disrupted the niche structure, with loss of the pinwheels, massive activation of the quiescent Type B cells, and consequent depletion of the NSC population. Hence, we identify VCAM1 as a key molecule responsible for maintaining the integrity of the neurogenic niche and the NSC state. VCAM1, also known as CD106, is a member of the immunoglobin (Ig) superfamily. It is a cell surface sialoglycoprotein first identified on cytokine-activated endothelium (Osborn et al., 1989Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R. Vassallo C. Luhowskyj S. Chi-Rosso G. Lobb R. Direct expression cloning of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, a cytokine-induced endothelial protein that binds to lymphocytes.Cell. 1989; 59: 1203-1211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). By immunohistochemistry of coronal sections, confirmed by in situ hybridizations (Figure S1 available online), we observed strong punctate staining of VCAM1 along the striatal side of the ventricular wall and the dorso-lateral edge of the SVZ, which contains many aligned neuroblast chains flowing into the RMS, but not on the septal side of the ventricular wall (Figure 1A), indicating specific expression in the neurogenic niche. Double immunolabeling showed that all of the VCAM1+ punctate structures near the ventricular surface were associated with GFAP+ cells (n = 134 cells), and high magnification revealed that these structures were the apical endfeet of GFAP+ Type B cells, which penetrate into the ependymal layer and protrude (to varying extents) into the lateral ventricle (Figure 1B). These VCAM1+ GFAP+ cells typically extended radial processes basally into the SVZ toward the SVZ plexus layer (Figure 1B, arrows). In order to understand better the VCAM1+ endfeet structures in relation to the SVZ cytoarchitecture, we immunostained SVZ wholemounts, an organotypic preparation of the SVZ in which the normal 3D cell-cell relationships are preserved (Doetsch et al., 1999aDoetsch F. Caillé I. Lim D.A. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Subventricular zone astrocytes are neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain.Cell. 1999; 97: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). When viewed en face from the ventricular side, a distinctive pattern of staining emerged that was visible with different VCAM1 antibodies. Using anti-β-catenin to reveal the ependymal junctions in the SVZ wholemounts, we saw that the VCAM1+ endfeet were intermingled in the ependymal layer, singly or in groups, sometimes of more than 10 (Figure 1C). Interestingly, polarized VCAM1+ staining was visible on the membrane of cultured, elongated GFAP+ adult SVZ cells, (Figure 1D), indicating that asymmetric localization of VCAM1 can be preserved in vitro. In wholemounts immunostained for GFAP, the VCAM1+ endfeet typically overlapped or abutted GFAP+ elements in the center of the pinwheels (Figures 1E and 1F). Advancing from this surface layer down into the SVZ tissue, most of the VCAM1 staining disappeared rapidly, and the vast majority of Type C cells, revealed by Tomato fluorescence in a Mash1-Cre-Tomato mouse (Ascl1tm1.1(cre/ERT2); B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)) (Kim et al., 2011Kim E.J. Ables J.L. Dickel L.K. Eisch A.J. Johnson J.E. Ascl1 (Mash1) defines cells with long-term neurogenic potential in subgranular and subventricular zones in adult mouse brain.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e18472Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (Figure S1), or staining for the oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), were negative, as were doublecortin (DCX)+ Type A cells (not shown). Thus, VCAM1 expression is rapidly downregulated with lineage progression. The specific expression pattern of VCAM1, which has known adhesion properties, suggested it could be important in maintaining Type B cell position, with their apical processes intercalated in the ependymal layer. To test whether inhibiting VCAM1 function would disrupt the niche architecture, we used an osmotic minipump to continuously deliver VCAM1 blocking antibody or isotype control antibody into the lateral ventricle of hGFAP-GFP mice for 6 days, then examined the resulting SVZ wholemounts. Inspection of the ependymal layer showed a dramatic effect of blocking VCAM1. In the SVZs from animals treated with isotype control antibodies, β-catenin staining revealed the normal honeycomb-like pattern and a recognizable pinwheel arrangement of ependymal cells around concentrations of GFAP+ processes (Figure 2A). In contrast, the SVZs from animals treated with VCAM1 blocking antibodies showed pockets of severe disruption in the ependymal layer, revealed by abnormal knots of β-catenin staining and bundles of GFAP+ processes, with loss of many of the basic pinwheel structures (Figure 2B). Interestingly, in addition to an increase in β-catenin, which could indicate an increase in adherens junctions, we observed upregulation of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in VCAM1-blocking-antibody-treated mice (Figure S2). This suggests that perturbations in SVZ cell-cell interactions could contribute to the observed increase in Type B cell division. Disruption was also seen in the GFAP+ apical Type B cell population located just beneath the ependymal layer (Figures 2B and 2C). The number of GFAP-GFP+ cell bodies was dramatically reduced, to 44.8% of control (control, 1,915 ± 292.6 versus 858.2 ± 237.2 after VCAM1 block, p < 0.03) (Figures 2B and 2F), and their processes, normally beautifully aligned, especially in the dorsal aspect of the SVZ, were disarrayed and shorter (Figure 2C). Blocking VCAM1 did not increase apoptotic cell death, so that is unlikely to be the cause of the GFAP+ cell loss (caspase 3 staining, not shown). Type B cells situated at the apical surface rarely divide (Doetsch et al., 1997Doetsch F. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A.

Notably, VCAM1 inhibition stimulated apical GFAP+ Type B cell proliferation, so that there were significantly more GFAP/Ki67-double positive cells within 9 μm of the ependymal layer where the majority of Type B cells reside (Doetsch et al., 1997Doetsch F.

The number of MASH1+ Type C cells in the SVZ after 6 days of blocking VCAM1 was reduced, although not significantly (44.51 ± 12.60 for control versus 28.65 ± 5.34 for anti-VCAM1, average cells per stack, p = 0.28) (Figure S2). We labeled cells in S phase by injecting mice with EdU on days 4, 5, and 6 after insertion of pumps with VCAM1 or control antibody, and we let the mice survive for 3 more weeks as a chase period. The EdU label is retained by newborn neurons that migrate to the olfactory bulb and by slowly dividing progenitor cells that remain in the SVZ, which are thought to represent dormant stem cells (Johansson et al., 1999Johansson C.B. Momma S. Clarke D.L. Risling M. Lendahl U. Frisén J. Identification of a neural stem cell in the adult mammalian central nervous system.Cell. 1999; 96: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Blocking VCAM1 resulted in more cells leaving the SVZ and migrating to the olfactory bulb (VCAM1 block, 146.8 ± 25.16 EdU+ cells/field in the olfactory bulb; control, 82.48 ± 5.55, p < 0.05). In contrast there were significantly fewer label-retaining cells left in the SVZ (VCAM1 block, 5.05 ± 0.87 EdU+ cells in the SVZ; VCAM1 block, 12.85 ± 0.78, p < 0.0006 Figures 2G and 2H). These results show that VCAM1 is critical for the organization of Type B cells and ependymal cells at the ventricular surface and suggest that blocking VCAM1 results in loss of the more quiescent ependymal niche, with activation of Type B cells to a proliferative state. The trend toward fewer transit amplifying Type C cells after 1 week and more olfactory neurons indicates rapid depletion of the early stages of the lineage and increased migration out of the SVZ. In several wholemount preparations we found that neuroblast chains in the SVZ were severely disrupted after VCAM1 function was blocked, with abnormal clumps of DCX+ neuroblasts visible even at low magnification, and denuded areas where chains were severely reduced (Figure 3A). Confocal imaging revealed that DCX+ cells were bunched together, wrapped by disorganized Type B cells (Figures 3B and 3C). Interestingly, in sagittal sections we also observed several patches of neuroblast chains outside the SVZ in the striatal parenchyma (Figure 3D, arrow). As we did not see expression of VCAM1 on neuroblasts in vivo (Figure S1), disruption of neuroblast chains is most likely indirect. Neuroblast disruption could be due to disorganization of the associated GFAP+ processes, or to disruption of the ependymal cilia that normally direct neuroblast chain migration (Sawamoto et al., 2006Sawamoto K. Wichterle H. Gonzalez-Perez O. Cholfin J.A. Yamada M. Spassky N. Murcia N.S. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Marin O. Rubenstein J.L. et al.New neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain.Science. 2006; 311: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar); indeed, after treatment with VCAM1-blocking antibody, there were patches in the SVZ where cilia were disorganized or absent (Figure S3). Given that Type B NSCs rather specifically express VCAM1, and given its ability to act as a signaling molecule in other systems, we investigated whether VCAM1 function impacted cardinal features of NSC behavior, including self-renewal and the ability to produce differentiated progeny. We generated a lentiviral vector expressing Vcam1 shRNA that gave over 90% transduction and reduced the Vcam1 level in adult SVZ cells to 59.61% ± .02% of empty vector (EV) control (Figure 4A). We tested the impact of reducing Vcam1 levels on neurosphere formation under conditions that enable a measure of NSC self-renewal (Pastrana et al., 2011Pastrana E. Silva-Vargas V. Doetsch F. Eyes wide open: a critical review of sphere-formation as an assay for stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 486-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), and on cells plated in adherent conditions to assess an impact on differentiation. As in vivo, the vast majority of VCAM1+ cells in vitro, in neurosphere, or in adherent cultures are GFAP+ (>95%), and we rarely observed (<1%) VCAM1 expression on neuroblasts. shRNA knockdown of Vcam1 had no effect on primary neurosphere formation, but it dramatically reduced secondary neurosphere formation to 44.70% ± 4.47% of control and tertiary neurosphere formation to 29.84% ± 2.39% of control (∗∗∗p < 0.001) (Figures 4B and 4C). Similarly, blocking with VCAM1 antibody did not significantly affect primary neurosphere generation, but reduced secondary neurosphere formation to just 38.07% ± 6.61% of control (p < 0.01) (Figure 4D). These findings are consistent with Vcam1 being important for maintaining the NSC state, and the rapid loss of Type B and Type C cells seen after blocking VCAM1 in vivo would be expected to result in fewer neurosphere-generating cells, as observed here. Dissociated cultures of SVZ cells treated with shRNA Vcam1 lentivirus or EV control lentivirus for 4 DIV showed reduced Nestin+ progenitor cells and fewer cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67, but increased numbers of EGFR+ cells, a marker of activated Type B and Type C cells, and DCX+ Type A neuroblasts. These observations are consistent with in vivo results showing that blocking VCAM1 stimulates lineage progression (Figure 4E). Conversely, addition of exogenous VCAM1 increased expression of NSC markers and decreased expression of lineage progression markers (Figure S4). Consistent with this, knockdown of Vcam1 reduced expression of genes associated with stem cell maintenance (Aguirre et al., 2010Aguirre A. Rubio M.E. Gallo V.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) (Figures 4F and 4G). These data show that VCAM1 function is critical for SVZ NSC maintenance, and without it, the NSC population rapidly depletes and differentiates. VCAM1 can signal through activation of the NADPH oxidase enzyme NOX2 and production of ROS in endothelial cells, upregulating molecules that alter cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion (Cook-Mills, 2002Cook-Mills J.M.

Signal. 2011; 15: 1607-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that proliferative NSCs in the SVZ have high levels of ROS generated by the NOX2 enzyme (Le Belle et al., 2011Le Belle J.E. Orozco N.M. Paucar A.A. Saxe J.P. Mottahedeh J. Pyle A.D. Wu H. Kornblum H.I.

By immunostaining, we found that NOX2 and VCAM1 were expressed with a high degree of overlap, suggesting that apical processes rich in VCAM1 are also rich in this enzyme (Figure 5A). To examine a functional association, we knocked down Vcam1 in neurosphere-expanded adult SVZ cells and saw significantly reduced Nox2 expression by qPCR (Figure 5B). If VCAM1 functions via NOX2, then we would expect that activation of VCAM1 would result in increased ROS. To test this, we generated beads coated with the anti-VCAM1 antibody, a configuration that has been shown to bind, dimerize, and activate VCAM1 (Deem et al., 2007Deem T.L. Abdala-Valencia H.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These VCAM1-antibody-activating beads, or beads coated with IgG antibodies as control, were overlaid on 4 DIV adherent adult SVZ cultures in the presence of a ROS sensor dihydroethidine, which when oxidized binds to DNA and produces a fluorescent signal (Figure 5D) (Cook-Mills, 2002Cook-Mills J.M.

Treatment of NSCs with VCAM1-activating beads resulted in a 9.1% increase in ROS sensor fluorescence compared to control beads (Figures 5C and 5E), indicating that this signaling pathway is downstream of VCAM1. Thus signaling through VCAM1 increases ROS activity, which is consistent with VCAM1 helping to maintain the appropriate ROS status beneficial for NSC maintenance and function (Le Belle et al., 2011Le Belle J.E. Orozco N.M. Paucar A.A. Saxe J.P. Mottahedeh J. Pyle A.D. Wu H. Kornblum H.I.

In endothelial cells and the bone marrow stem cell niche, VCAM1 is upregulated by the cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and SDF1, an effect that plays an important role in the immune response (Cook-Mills et al., 2011Cook-Mills J.M.

We identified the arginine methyltransferase Carm1 as a Pax7 interacting protein and found that Carm1 specifically methylates multiple arginines in the N terminus of Pax7. Methylated Pax7 directly binds the C-terminal cleavage forms of the trithorax proteins MLL1/2 resulting in the recruitment of the ASH2L:MLL1/2:WDR5:RBBP5 histone H3K4 methyltransferase complex to regulatory enhancers and the proximal promoter of Myf5. Finally, Carm1 is required for the induction of de novo Myf5 transcription following asymmetric satellite stem cell divisions. We defined the C-terminal MLL region as a reader domain for the recognition of arginine methylated proteins such as Pax7. Thus, arginine methylation of Pax7 by Carm1 functions as a molecular switch controlling the epigenetic induction of Myf5 during satellite stem cell asymmetric division and entry into the myogenic program."

https://openalex.org/W1982641197,"Endothelium in embryonic hematopoietic tissues generates hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells; however, it is unknown how its unique potential is specified. We show that transcription factor Scl/Tal1 is essential for both establishing the hematopoietic transcriptional program in hemogenic endothelium and preventing its misspecification to a cardiomyogenic fate. Scl(-/-) embryos activated a cardiac transcriptional program in yolk sac endothelium, leading to the emergence of CD31+Pdgfrα+ cardiogenic precursors that generated spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes. Ectopic cardiogenesis was also observed in Scl(-/-) hearts, where the disorganized endocardium precociously differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Induction of mosaic deletion of Scl in Scl(fl/fl)Rosa26Cre-ER(T2) embryos revealed a cell-intrinsic, temporal requirement for Scl to prevent cardiomyogenesis from endothelium. Scl(-/-) endothelium also upregulated the expression of Wnt antagonists, which promoted rapid cardiomyocyte differentiation of ectopic cardiogenic cells. These results reveal unexpected plasticity in embryonic endothelium such that loss of a single master regulator can induce ectopic cardiomyogenesis from endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2107023512,"Many signals must be integrated to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to enable induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming. However, the exact molecular regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. To unravel the essential internal and external signals required for sustaining the ESC state, we conducted a short hairpin (sh) RNA screen of 104 ESC-associated phosphoregulators. Depletion of one such molecule, aurora kinase A (Aurka), resulted in compromised self-renewal and consequent differentiation. By integrating global gene expression and computational analyses, we discovered that loss of Aurka leads to upregulated p53 activity that triggers ESC differentiation. Specifically, Aurka regulates pluripotency through phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of p53-directed ectodermal and mesodermal gene expression. Phosphorylation of p53 not only impairs p53-induced ESC differentiation but also p53-mediated suppression of iPSC reprogramming. Our studies demonstrate an essential role for Aurka-p53 signaling in the regulation of self-renewal, differentiation, and somatic cell reprogramming."

Murine and human megakaryocytes commonly reach modal ploidy states of 32N and 16N, respectively, and can sometimes achieve DNA contents as high as 128N. Although the mechanism of polyploidization is still not well understood, altered expression of genes including D and E type cyclins, spindle checkpoint proteins, and chromosome passenger proteins has been implicated (Wen et al., 2011Wen Q. Goldenson B. Crispino J.D. Normal and malignant megakaryopoiesis.Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2011; 13: e32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), a rare and deadly form of acute myeloid leukemia, is characterized by expansion of immature megakaryocytes and profound bone marrow myelofibrosis that interferes with normal blood development (Malinge et al., 2009Malinge S. Izraeli S. Crispino J.D. Insights into the manifestations, outcomes, and mechanisms of leukemogenesis in Down syndrome.Blood. 2009; 113: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Pediatric AMKL is frequently associated with chromosomal abnormalities, including trisomy 21 in Down syndrome AMKL (DS-AMKL) and t(1;22), which leads to expression of the OTT-MAL fusion protein in non-DS-AMKL (Ma et al., 2001Ma Z.

USA. 2001; 98: 5776-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mutations in GATA1, a transcription factor that is essential for proper growth and differentiation of megakaryocytes, are present in nearly all cases of DS-AMKL, whereas mutations in JAK3, MPL, KIT, and FLT3 are associated with a smaller subset of AMKL patients (Malinge et al., 2009Malinge S.

Insights into the manifestations, outcomes, and mechanisms of leukemogenesis in Down syndrome.Blood. 2009; 113: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar; Wechsler et al., 2002Wechsler J. Greene M. McDevitt M.A. Anastasi J. Karp J.E. Le Beau M.M. Crispino J.D. Acquired mutations in GATA1 in the megakaryoblastic leukemia of Down syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Although many DS-AMKL patients respond to current therapies, including low-dose cytosine arabinoside chemotherapy, adults with non-DS-AMKL have a very poor prognosis, with the vast majority relapsing within 1 year of the primary treatment (Tallman et al., 2000Tallman M.S. Neuberg D. Bennett J.M. Francois C.J. Paietta E. Wiernik P.H. Dewald G. Cassileth P.A. Oken M.M. Rowe J.M. Acute megakaryocytic leukemia: the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group experience.Blood. 2000; 96: 2405-2411PubMed Google Scholar). New therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. Given that leukemic blasts from AMKL patients are hyperproliferative and fail to undergo differentiation or polyploidization, and that megakaryocytes are poised to undergo polyploidization in the normal course of development, we hypothesized that small-molecule inducers of polyploidization would drive these cells to exit the proliferative cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation. These small-molecule probes could also serve to help understand the mechanism(s) underlying polyploidization. Here we reveal that polyploidy inducers indeed show potent antileukemia activity in vitro and in vivo. We used an integrative approach to target identification that allowed intelligent prioritization and testing of candidate targets, and we show that AURKA kinase is an essential negative regulator of polyploidization in AMKL blasts and a potential therapeutic target for this subtype of leukemia. To identify compounds that induce megakaryocyte polyploidization, we developed an imaging assay capable of measuring DNA content in cultured AMKL cell lines (Figure 1). Small-molecule screening was performed with a human cell line derived from a patient with DS-AMKL (CMK) (Sato et al., 1989Sato T. Fuse A. Eguchi M. Hayashi Y. Ryo R. Adachi M. Kishimoto Y. Teramura M. Mizoguchi H. Shima Y. et al.Establishment of a human leukaemic cell line (CMK) with megakaryocytic characteristics from a Down's syndrome patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia.Br. J. Haematol. 1989; 72: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and a chemically diverse small-molecule library. Following a 3 day incubation, cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst dye, and individual wells were imaged by automated epifluorescence microscopy (ImageXpress Micro; Molecular Devices) and then analyzed for nuclear morphology and fluorescence intensity with CellProfiler (Carpenter et al., 2006Carpenter A.E. Jones T.R. Lamprecht M.R. Clarke C. Kang I.H. Friman O. Guertin D.A. Chang J.H. Lindquist R.A. Moffat J. et al.CellProfiler: image analysis software for identifying and quantifying cell phenotypes.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R100Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar). SU6656, a Src kinase inhibitor known to induce polyploidization of a wide spectrum of cells, was used as a positive control (Lannutti et al., 2005Lannutti B.J. Blake N. Gandhi M.J. Reems J.A. Drachman J.G. Induction of polyploidization in leukemic cell lines and primary bone marrow by Src kinase inhibitor SU6656.Blood. 2005; 105: 3875-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This assay had an average Z′ factor (Zhang et al., 1999Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5325) Google Scholar) > 0.7 over the study. Among approximately 9,000 compounds screened, we identified 206 positives that significantly increased the fraction of cells with DNA content beyond a cutoff (between 4N and 8N) as compared to DMSO (Figure 1C and Table S1). Among these compounds were the expected microtubule-disrupting and -stabilizing agents and actin-disrupting agents, including cytochalasin B and latrunculin B, which were predicted to cause alterations in spindle formation or cytokinesis and result in polyploidization. In addition, a number of compounds annotated as kinase inhibitors were identified, including dimethylfasudil (diMF, H1152P, BRD4911), reversine, K252a, and JAK3 inhibitor VI. Dose-ranging secondary studies of assay positives found 149 of the 206 compounds to exhibit an EC50 ≤ 100 μM (Table S1). Despite the temporal association between polyploidization and upregulation of megakaryocyte-specific genes, recent findings suggest that these two processes can be uncoupled (Muntean et al., 2007Muntean A.G. Pang L. Poncz M. Dowdy S.F. Blobel G.A. Crispino J.D. Cyclin D-Cdk4 is regulated by GATA-1 and required for megakaryocyte growth and polyploidization.Blood. 2007; 109: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In order to assess whether small-molecule inducers of polyploidization also induced megakaryocyte maturation, we selected several compounds for more detailed analysis. This list included diMF and K252a; latrunculin B, an actin polymerization inhibitor; JAK3 inhibitor VI; reversine, a molecule that induces dedifferentiation and polyploidization (D'Alise et al., 2008D'Alise A.M. Amabile G. Iovino M. Di Giorgio F.P. Bartiromo M. Sessa F. Villa F. Musacchio A. Cortese R. Reversine, a novel Aurora kinases inhibitor, inhibits colony formation of human acute myeloid leukemia cells.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); NP003964, a natural product; and SU6656. Compared to SU6656, diMF induced much higher polyploidization in CMK cells over a much wider dose range (Figure 2B and data not shown). Although each of these compounds inhibited proliferation while inducing polyploidization and apoptosis, only diMF and NP003964 also induced expression of the megakaryocyte-specific markers CD41 and CD42 (Figure 2 and data not shown). diMF was tested against a panel of megakaryocytic cell lines and found to induce robust polyploidization and expression of differentiation markers in every line tested, including CMS, CHRF, Meg01, K562, Y10, and G1ME cells (Stachura et al., 2006Stachura D.L. Chou S.T. Weiss M.J. Early block to erythromegakaryocytic development conferred by loss of transcription factor GATA-1.Blood. 2006; 107: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). diMF also induced polyploidization and CD41 expression in an AMKL cell line derived from Ets-related gene (ERG) transgenic mice (tg-ERG) (L.G., Y.B, and S.I., unpublished data), which express the ERG transcription factor under the control of the vav promoter (Figure S1B). Next, we examined the effect of diMF on primary murine hematopoietic progenitor cells cultured in the presence of thrombopoietin (THPO). Treatment with diMF led to a dose-dependent increase in polyploidization and upregulation of CD41 and CD42 expression in murine bone marrow-derived megakaryocytes (Figures S2A–S2C). At 5 μM, diMF upregulated CD41 and CD42 expression by 9- and 18-fold, respectively, while increasing the mean polyploidy of CD41+ cells from 5.8N to 10.7N. diMF also induced polyploidization and upregulation of CD41 and CD42 in GATA-1s-KI fetal liver megakaryocytes, which mimic DS-AMKL cells in that they express the shortened leukemic isoform of GATA-1 called GATA-1s (Li et al., 2005Li Z. Godinho F.J. Klusmann J.H. Garriga-Canut M. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Developmental stage-selective effect of somatically mutated leukemogenic transcription factor GATA1.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar; Wechsler et al., 2002Wechsler J. Greene M. McDevitt M.A. Anastasi J. Karp J.E. Le Beau M.M. Crispino J.D. Acquired mutations in GATA1 in the megakaryoblastic leukemia of Down syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) (Figure S2D and data not shown). Moreover, when human primary bone marrow mononuclear cells were cultured in the presence of THPO, diMF induced polyploidization of CD41+ cells but not the CD41− fraction (Figure S2E). Thus, diMF selectively induces polyploidization of the megakaryocyte lineage and can override the proliferative defect caused by mutations in GATA1. A subset of pediatric non-DS-AMKL patients harbors the (1;22)(p13;q13) chromosomal translocation, which results in expression of the OTT-MAL fusion protein. Transgenic mice that express OTT-MAL develop AMKL with a low penetrance and long latency, whereas recipients of OTT-MAL bone marrow expressing MPLW515L rapidly develop AMKL with high penetrance (Mercher et al., 2009Mercher T. Raffel G.D. Moore S.A. Cornejo M.G. Baudry-Bluteau D. Cagnard N. Jesneck J.L. Pikman Y. Cullen D. Williams I.R. et al.The OTT-MAL fusion oncogene activates RBPJ-mediated transcription and induces acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in a knockin mouse model.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 852-864PubMed Google Scholar). 6133/MPL cells, which were derived from OTT-MAL transgenic mice and engineered to express MPLW515L, are quite sensitive to diMF: treatment of 6133/MPL cells with 3 μM diMF led to strong upregulation of CD41 and CD42, polyploidy, and apoptosis (Figures 3A and 3B and data not shown). To assess whether diMF induces an irreversible proliferative arrest that would prevent development of leukemia in transplant recipients, we treated 6133/MPL cells with vehicle or 10 μM diMF for 24 hr and then transplanted 1 million viable cells into recipient mice. Transplantation of vehicle-treated 6133/MPL cells into sublethally irradiated C57Bl/6 mice led to a fulminant AMKL with a short latency, with all of the animals developing leukemia and dying within 3 weeks (Figures 3C and 3D). The disease was characterized by splenomegaly, disruption of splenic architecture, and a high proportion of GFP-labeled 6133/MPL cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, and liver (data not shown). Strikingly, none of the mice transplanted with diMF-pretreated 6133/MPL cells developed leukemia (Figure 3D). Thus, brief exposure of 6133/MPL cells to diMF is sufficient to block their leukemia-inducing activity. Next, we assessed the oral pharmacokinetics of diMF in vivo. C57Bl/6 mice were fed a single dose of 66 mg/kg diMF, and plasma concentrations were measured. The mean maximum concentration achieved was 5.8 μM (Cmax) at 5 min (Tmax) (Figure 3E), which is higher than the dose of diMF necessary to induce maximum polyploidization of 6133/MPL cells. Having shown that biologically active concentrations of diMF were achieved in vivo after oral administration, we fed healthy C57Bl/6 mice with vehicle or diMF by oral gavage twice a day for 7 days and evaluated their body weight and hematopoietic indices. diMF was well tolerated: we did not observe significant changes in body weight or peripheral blood indices, including platelet counts (Figures S3A–S3E). Having established that diMF is well tolerated in vivo, we transplanted sublethally irradiated recipient C57Bl/6 mice with 1 million 6133/MPL cells. Forty-eight hours after transplantation, we detected GFP-positive cells in the spleen and bone marrow of recipient mice, confirming engraftment of the 6133/MPL cells. Mice were then fed vehicle or diMF twice a day for 10 days. Whereas all the vehicle-treated mice died within 20 days, 43% of the mice treated with 66 mg/kg diMF and 29% of mice fed 33 mg/kg diMF survived at least 70 days post-transplantation (Figure 3F). diMF also significantly increased the survival of mice when treatment was initiated 7 days after transplantation, when the percentage of GFP-positive cells in the peripheral blood was near 20% (data not shown). Importantly, we observed a significant increase in DNA content, expression of CD41, and apoptosis of 6133/MPL cells in the bone marrows of recipient mice 72 hr after treatment with 66 mg/kg diMF (Figures 3G, S3F, and S3G). We also noted that diMF reduced the number of GFP-positive 6133/MPL cells in recipient animals (Figures S3H–S3K). These findings reveal that diMF promotes the survival of transplanted mice by inducing polyploidization of 6133/MPL cells in vivo. We next treated human non-DS-AMKL blasts isolated from primary immunodeficient (NOD/LtSz-scid IL2Rgc null; NSG) recipient mice with vehicle or diMF. In vitro, 5 μM diMF significantly increased polyploidization and inhibited proliferation of the AMKL blasts (Figure 3H). Secondary recipient NSG mice transplanted with non-DS-AMKL blasts showed decreased tumor burden of human CD41+ cells (Figures 3I and 3J) when treated with diMF at 30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg. diMF also significantly increased the polyploidization of human CD41+ cells in the spleens of recipient mice (Figure 3K). Finally, we cultured primary human DS-AMKL bone marrow specimens with DMSO or diMF and monitored the growth of the leukemic cells in colony assays. In all five patient samples studied, diMF significantly reduced the colony formation of AMKL blasts (Figure 3L). To address the challenge of determining the mode of action of small molecules identified from phenotypic screens (Terstappen et al., 2007Terstappen G.C. Schlüpen C. Raggiaschi R. Gaviraghi G. Target deconvolution strategies in drug discovery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we implemented an integrative approach for identifying the targets of diMF in megakaryoblasts (Figure 4A). diMF is an ATP competitive inhibitor of several kinases that include the Rho kinase family (Ikenoya et al., 2002Ikenoya M. Hidaka H. Hosoya T. Suzuki M. Yamamoto N. Sasaki Y. Inhibition of rho-kinase-induced myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) phosphorylation in human neuronal cells by H-1152, a novel and specific Rho-kinase inhibitor.J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but other Rho kinase inhibitors such as fasudil did not fully recapitulate the strong phenotype induced by diMF in AMKL-derived cells (data not shown). Thus we began with the hypothesis that diMF produced this phenotype by acting as a kinase inhibitor but perhaps not exclusively through Rho kinase family members. First, we performed an Ambit KinomeScan analysis and compared the kinase-binding profiles of diMF to those of the closely related compound fasudil (Fabian et al., 2005Fabian M.A. Biggs 3rd, W.H. Treiber D.K. Atteridge C.E. Azimioara M.D. Benedetti M.G. Carter T.A. Ciceri P. Edeen P.T. Floyd M. et al.A small molecule-kinase interaction map for clinical kinase inhibitors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar; Karaman et al., 2008Karaman M.W. Herrgard S. Treiber D.K. Gallant P. Atteridge C.E. Campbell B.T. Chan K.W. Ciceri P. Davis M.I. Edeen P.T. et al.A quantitative analysis of kinase inhibitor selectivity.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). From 402 purified kinases tested, we identified 117 kinases whose binding to the immobilized ligand was inhibited by more than 65% in the presence of 5 μM diMF relative to the control that contained no competing ligand (Table S2). In contrast, only 27 kinases were inhibited to a similar extent when fasudil was used as the competing ligand. Among the differentially affected kinases, the Aurora kinase family (A, B, and C) was notable for being strongly inhibited by diMF but not at all by fasudil. To identify protein binders of diMF in CMK cells, we used a modified version of our previously published method (Ong et al., 2009Ong S.E. Schenone M. Margolin A.A. Li X. Do K. Doud M.K. Mani D.R. Kuai L. Wang X. Wood J.L. et al.Identifying the proteins to which small-molecule probes and drugs bind in cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (Figure 4B). Using the broad specificity kinase ligand K252a (shown to induce polyploidization; Figure 2B), immobilized on beads as bait (Ong et al., 2009Ong S.E. Schenone M. Margolin A.A. Li X. Do K. Doud M.K. Mani D.R. Kuai L. Wang X. Wood J.L. et al.Identifying the proteins to which small-molecule probes and drugs bind in cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and preincubating CMK cell lysates with excess soluble diMF, we identified 68 proteins that were significantly and specifically competed away from K252a by diMF (Table S3; Figures 4B and 4C). The majority of these proteins are kinases or known to associate with kinases. To obtain an orthogonal data set to the proteomic and biochemical methods, we performed an RNAi screen to identify kinases whose knockdowns induced polyploidization in CMK cells, either on their own (phenocopy screen) or in conjunction with a dose of diMF that produces 5%–10% of its maximum polyploidization induction effect (1 μM; modifier screen) (Figures 4A and S4). The modifier screen complements the phenocopy screen in that combining a low dose of diMF with RNAi-based gene knockdown may provide selectivity for genes directly involved in the diMF mechanism of action. Large increases in high-ploidy cells were produced by hit small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs); in untreated control wells, 3%–5% of cells were high ploidy, whereas the top 2% of shRNAs produced wells with 30%–80% high-ploidy cells in both the DMSO and diMF screens. Genes were ranked for the effect on ploidy of their two top-scoring shRNAs (see Experimental Procedures for details). Knockdown of 54 kinases increased the fraction of high-ploidy cells in DMSO treatment. In cells treated with 1 μM diMF, knockdown of 43 kinases increased the fraction of high-ploidy cells versus diMF treatment alone. We also ranked shRNAs by their differential effect in the two screens; 47 genes showed significant increase in induction of polyploidy upon knockdown under diMF treatment versus vehicle alone (Table S4 and Figure 4D). Using these three criteria, a total of 95 distinct genes were selected for further analyses. We performed an integrated analysis of the results of the KinomeScan, the SILAC-based protein-binding assay, and the RNAi screen for polyploidization. We assigned combined p value scores based on the p values of each individual approach and evidence counts and identified 15 kinases with scores less than 0.05 (Table S5). The top five kinases that showed significant enrichment by this analysis include Aurora kinase B (AURKB), protein kinase C delta (PRKCD), feline sarcoma oncogene (FES), AURKA, and v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2; SRC). In contrast to AURKB, a well-studied component of the chromosome passenger complex that is known to control both normal and endomitotic cell cycles (Lordier et al., 2010Lordier L. Chang Y. Jalil A. Aurade F. Garçon L. Lécluse Y. Larbret F. Kawashima T. Kitamura T. Larghero J. et al.Aurora B is dispensable for megakaryocyte polyploidization, but contributes to the endomitotic process.Blood. 2010; 116: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), less is known about AURKA with respect to polyploidization. AURKA regulates microtubule-organizing center localization, chromosome dynamics, and histone H3 phosphorylation in oocytes (Ding et al., 2011Ding J. Swain J.E. Smith G.D. Aurora kinase-A regulates microtubule organizing center (MTOC) localization, chromosome dynamics, and histone-H3 phosphorylation in mouse oocytes.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2011; 78: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and is required for bipolar spindle formation and early development (Cowley et al., 2009Cowley D.O. Rivera-Pérez J.A. Schliekelman M. He Y.J. Oliver T.G. Lu L. O'Quinn R. Salmon E.D. Magnuson T. Van Dyke T. Aurora-A kinase is essential for bipolar spindle formation and early development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). AURKA is regarded as an important target of anticancer therapy, and several small-molecule inhibitors have been developed, including the highly selective compound MLN8237, which displays 200-fold selectivity for AURKA relative to AURKB in cells (Görgün et al., 2010Görgün G. Calabrese E. Hideshima T. Ecsedy J. Perrone G. Mani M. Ikeda H. Bianchi G. Hu Y. Cirstea D. et al.A novel Aurora-A kinase inhibitor MLN8237 induces cytotoxicity and cell-cycle arrest in multiple myeloma.Blood. 2010; 115: 5202-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar; Manfredi et al., 2011Manfredi M.G.

Cancer Res. 2011; 17: 7614-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Expression of MLN8237-resistant AURKA mutants has previously validated AURKA as the target of this molecule in cells (Sloane et al., 2010Sloane D.A. Trikic M.Z. Chu M.L. Lamers M.B. Mason C.S. Mueller I. Savory W.J. Williams D.H. Eyers P.A. Drug-resistant aurora A mutants for cellular target validation of the small molecule kinase inhibitors MLN8054 and MLN8237.ACS Chem. Biol. 2010; 5: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of Aurora kinases could phenocopy diMF, we treated CMK cells with their inhibitors and assayed proliferation, survival, and megakaryocyte cell-surface marker expression. Both MLN8237, a specific inhibitor of AURKA, and AZD1152-HQPA, a specific inhibitor of AURKB, restricted proliferation and induced robust polyploidization, differentiation as assessed by CD41 and CD42 expression, and apoptosis of CMK cells (Figures 5A–5E). In the 6133/MPL murine cell line, they increased polyploidization, CD41 and CD42 expression, and apoptosis (Figures S5A–S5D). Moreover, both compounds induced proliferation arrest and megakaryocyte lineage-specific surface marker expression of tg-ERG cells (data not shown). MLN8237 induced polyploidization and expression of CD41 and CD42 in primary mouse bone marrow cells cultured ex vivo (Figures S5E–S5G), and both MLN8237 and AZD1152-HQPA induced robust and selective polyploidization of primary human megakaryocytes expanded from human CD34+ cells (Figure S5H and data not shown).Figure S5Aurora Kinase Inhibitors Induce Polyploidization, Expression of Differentiation Markers, Proliferation Arrest, and Apoptosis of Mouse Megakaryocytic Cell Line and Primary Megakaryocytes, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A–D) MLN8237 and AZD1152-HQPA dose-dependently increased mean polyploidy (A), apoptosis (B), and expression of CD41 and CD42 (C and D) cell surface markers in murine 6133/MPL cells 48 hr after treatment.(E–G) Murine bone marrow cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml TPO for 72 hr to differentiate megakaryocytes.

To identify these signals, a mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based differentiation assay was screened against a small molecule library resulting in a 1,4-dihydropyridine inducer of type II TGF-β receptor (TGFBR2) degradation-1 (ITD-1). ITD analogs enhanced proteasomal degradation of TGFBR2, effectively clearing the receptor from the cell surface and selectively inhibiting intracellular signaling (IC50 ∼0.4–0.8 μM). ITD-1 was used to evaluate TGF-β involvement in mesoderm formation and cardiopoietic differentiation, which occur sequentially during early development, revealing an essential role in both processes in ESC cultures. ITD-1 selectively enhanced the differentiation of uncommitted mesoderm to cardiomyocytes, but not to vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. ITD-1 is a highly selective TGF-β inhibitor and reveals an unexpected role for TGF-β signaling in controlling cardiomyocyte differentiation from multipotent cardiovascular precursors. The cellular signals controlling the formation of cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle, and endothelial cells from stem cell-derived mesoderm are poorly understood. To identify these signals, a mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based differentiation assay was screened against a small molecule library resulting in a 1,4-dihydropyridine inducer of type II TGF-β receptor (TGFBR2) degradation-1 (ITD-1). ITD analogs enhanced proteasomal degradation of TGFBR2, effectively clearing the receptor from the cell surface and selectively inhibiting intracellular signaling (IC50 ∼0.4–0.8 μM). ITD-1 was used to evaluate TGF-β involvement in mesoderm formation and cardiopoietic differentiation, which occur sequentially during early development, revealing an essential role in both processes in ESC cultures. ITD-1 selectively enhanced the differentiation of uncommitted mesoderm to cardiomyocytes, but not to vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. ITD-1 is a highly selective TGF-β inhibitor and reveals an unexpected role for TGF-β signaling in controlling cardiomyocyte differentiation from multipotent cardiovascular precursors. Highly selective small molecule inhibitor of TGF-β degrades TGFBR2 specifically TGF-β signaling is essential for mesoderm establishment in mouse ESCs Degradation of TGFBR2 promotes cardiac fate specifically in mouse and human ESCs Chemical biology approach to correlate or separate biological activities The ability to control stem cell cardiogenesis is critical to realize the promise of pluripotent stem cells as a source of cells for replacement therapies. Moreover, an improved understanding of the signals that regulate replication and differentiation of cardiac progenitors might reveal mechanisms that underlie the limited potential of the adult heart to replace muscle cells after injury and ultimately could lead to strategies for in vivo regeneration therapies (Sturzu and Wu, 2011Sturzu A.C. Wu S.M. Developmental and regenerative biology of multipotent cardiovascular progenitor cells.Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An important approach to defining the signals that drive stem cell cardiogenesis has been to mimic embryological mechanisms for mesoderm induction and cardiogenic patterning (Burridge et al., 2012Burridge P.W. Keller G. Gold J.D. Wu J.C. Production of de novo cardiomyocytes: human pluripotent stem cell differentiation and direct reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 16-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Although successful in revealing the underlying mechanisms of early differentiation events, little is known about the signals that drive later steps of cardiogenesis that may be key to achieving therapeutic regeneration. Unbiased screening of small molecules in phenotypic assays can overcome some of the limitations of embryology studies and is thus an alternate approach to study gene, protein, or pathway function in complex biological systems (Willems et al., 2011Willems E. Lanier M. Forte E. Lo F. Cashman J. Mercola M. A chemical biology approach to myocardial regeneration.J. Cardiovasc. Transl. Res. 2011; 4: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a large-scale, image-based screen to identify novel small molecule probes that would stimulate the specification of cardiac cells from uncommitted mesoderm in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). One of the most active compounds was a 1,4-dihydropyridine, which we named inducer of TGF-β type II receptor degradation (ITD). ITD and its analogs promote cardiomyocyte differentiation specifically via degradation of the TGF-β type II receptor (TGFBR2), revealing a role for TGF-β itself as a repressor of cardiomyocyte fate. Moreover, ITDs comprise selective TGF-β inhibitors that do not block the closely related Activin A signaling pathway and represent reagents for exploring TGF-β function in various biological contexts such as embryonic development and models of disease. A mouse ESC (mESC) assay using an image-based Myh6-GFP reporter readout was screened between days 2 and 6 of differentiation, as uncommitted mesoderm (T/Bra+) cells become specified as cardiac. The assay identified a 1,4-dihydropyridine, which we named ITD-1 (inducer of TGF-β type II receptor degradation-1). ITD-1 optimally promoted cardiogenesis and beating cell clusters when added from day 3 to day 5 of differentiation (Figures 1A–1C and Movie S1 available online). In contrast, ITD-1 completely abolished cardiogenesis when added before mesoderm induction, i.e., days 1–3 of differentiation (Figures 1B and 1C), suggesting a biphasic effect of ITD-1 during differentiation of mESCs, inhibiting mesoderm early and inducing cardiac fate later. Dihydropyridines are well-known calcium channel blockers, so we asked whether this mechanism was responsible for any of the ITD-1 activities, but no evidence was found for a role through calcium inhibition (Figure S1). To facilitate target identification of ITD-1, a panel of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was screened in the day 3–5 cardiogenic window, revealing that blocking Activin A and/or TGF-β signaling upregulated cardiogenesis significantly (Table S1). HEK293T cells were transfected with a Smad4 response element driving luciferase (SBE4-Luc) to test whether ITD-1 blocked Activin A/Nodal and/or TGF-β signaling, which utilize the same intracellular signaling cascade through Smad4. ITD-1 strongly inhibited TGF-β2 signaling with similar efficacy (92% versus 99%, respectively) but with lower potency compared to SB-431542, a ACVR1B/TGFBR1 kinase inhibitor (IC50 = 850 nM versus 70 nM, respectively) and was a weak and partial inhibitor of Activin A signals (Figures 1D, 1E, and 1M). Toxicity was not responsible for the observed inhibitory activity of ITD-1, and other developmentally important pathways such as Wnt or BMP signaling were not inhibited by ITD-1 (Figure S2). To understand whether TGF-β2 and Activin A inhibition was through a shared target, we pursued a chemical biology approach asking whether or not we could generate ITD-1 analogs that would selectively target the TGF-β pathway and not the Activin A pathway. Optically pure (+)- and (−)-enantiomers of ITD-1 (chiral center at the 4-position) showed that the inhibitory effect was well separated stereochemically for TGF-β2, but not for Activin A, suggesting a highly selective mechanism for TGF-β2 inhibition, distinct from that of the weak Activin A inhibition (Figures 1F, 1G, and 1M). This finding prompted a screen of ITD-1 analogs to increase the selectivity for TGF-β2 relative to Activin A. From more than 200 analogs, one highly selective candidate, named ITDts (ITD TGF-β selective), retained TGF-β2 inhibition activity but lost Activin A inhibition activity even at 5 μM (Figures 1H–1K and 1M). Interestingly, a structural homolog of ITDts, ITD-2, where only the 4-CF3 group was replaced by a 4-CH3 group, retained the weak activity against Activin A (Figures 1H–1K and 1M). We next evaluated whether ITD-1 is functionally selective in a defined stem cell system. We used Cripto−/− mESCs, which lack the essential coreceptor needed to respond to Nodal, to remove any confounding effects that endogenous Nodal might have if stimulated in response to exogenous Activin A or TGF-β. ITD-1 (5 μM) effectively blocked induction of the Activin A/Nodal/TGF-β target gene Lefty1 in response to TGF-β2 but not to Activin A (Figure 1L). Because ITD-1 is functionally selective, we therefore used it in subsequent biological studies but confirmed key results with ITDts, which has poorer chemical stability in cell culture media. The TGF-β signaling pathway was then probed at multiple levels to determine the point of inhibition. ITD-1 did not block the kinase activity of either type I (TGFBR1) or type II (TGFBR2) TGF-β receptors (Figures S3A and S3B), but ITD-1 potently blocked phosphorylation of the effector SMAD2/3 proteins induced by TGF-β2 and only minimally in response to Activin A (Figures 1N and 1O), corroborating the findings that ITD-1 is selective for TGF-β. Consequently, ITD-1 reduced transcriptional levels of Lefty1 in Cripto−/− mESCs and needed ∼3 hr more to inhibit Lefty1 expression compared to SB-431542 (Figure 1P). These results demonstrate that ITD-1 targets the TGF-β pathway at the receptor level but uses a different and more selective mechanism compared to kinase inhibitors such as SB-431542 (Figure 1Q, Table S2). The above findings prompted us to investigate some of the dynamic processes of receptor internalization, degradation, and recycling that regulate the ability of the receptor to signal (Chen, 2009Chen Y.G. Endocytic regulation of TGF-beta signaling.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 58-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). After binding the TGF-β ligand, TGFBR2 associates with TGFBR1, and the resulting ligand-receptor complex is internalized, as a requisite for signaling. By using an overexpressed extracellularly HA-tagged TGFBR2-mCherry fusion protein (HA-TGFBR2-mCherry), which is internalized in the presence of TGF-β2 ligand, we found that ITD-1 did not block immediate internalization of TGFBR2, in contrast to SB-431542, which abolished internalization (Figure S3C). We then asked whether ITD-1 interfered with receptor recycling and/or degradation through the lysosome or proteasome (Di Guglielmo et al., 2003Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Distinct endocytic pathways regulate TGF-beta receptor signalling and turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). ITD-1 did not affect TGFBR1 when overexpressed in HEK293T (Figures 2A and 2B ), but strongly downregulated TGFBR2 protein levels (Figures 2C and 2D). ITD-1 similarly decreased endogenous TGFBR2 levels in several human cell lines, demonstrating that the ITD-1 effect was not an artifact of overexpression (Figures 2E, 2F, S4A, and S4B). To distinguish whether ITD-1 decreased cell surface or total TGFBR2 levels, we developed a flow cytometry assay with the HA-TGFBR2-mCherry vector that allowed the cell surface (extracellular HA-tag immunostaining) and total (mCherry fluorescence) TGFBR2 levels to be measured independently in the same experiment. Both HA-tag and mCherry levels declined in response to ITD-1, indicating that ITD-1 cleared TGFBR2 from the cell surface and targeted it for degradation (Figure 2G). The effect of ITD-1 was also observed on endogenous cell surface TGFBR2 and was selective, as shown by the fact that ITD-1 did not affect other tyrosine kinase receptors (Figures S4C–S4F). ITD-1 diminished both the number of cells with TGFBR2 receptor, and the number of receptors per cell in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 2H and 2I). ITD-1 downregulated HA-TGFBR2 and TGFBR2-mCherry with nearly the same potency (IC50 = 1.05 and 1.31 μM, respectively), suggesting a common mechanism, although the maximal depletion of HA-TGFBR2 was greater (Emax = ∼80% versus ∼50%), consistent with the fact that ITD-1 acts by enhancing degradation rather than by blocking synthesis, which would affect cell surface and intracellular receptor pools equally (Figure 2I). At least 6 hr were needed for ITD-1 to reduce TGFBR2 levels, with a maximum reduction by 24 hr of treatment (Figure 2J). To gain insight in the degradation mechanism of ITD-1, cells were treated with lysosome or proteasome inhibitors. ITD-1 reduced the levels of TGFBR2-mCherry fluorescence per cell, resulting in an increased number of TGFBR2-mCherrylo cells at the expense of TGFBR2-mCherryhi cells (Figure 2K, left), and this effect was rescued by the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and Bortezomib (Figure 2K, right) but not by the lysosome inhibitor Chloroquine (CQ) (Figure 2K, middle), as clearly demonstrated by the ratio of TGFBR2-mCherryhi to TGFBR2-mCherrylo cells (Figure 2L). Additional support for induced degradation as the mechanism of ITD-1 action was the robust structure activity relationship (SAR) between TGFBR2 degradation and inhibition of TGF-β2 SBE4-Luc activity (R2 > 0.8) (Figure 2M). Because TGFBR2 was targeted to the proteasome, we examined ubiquitination of TGFBR2 but found no evidence of mono- or polyubiquitination (Figure S5). Taken together, the ITD class of molecules comprises selective TGF-β inhibitors that function by diverting TGFBR2 to the proteasome through an ubiquitin-independent mechanism. Inhibition of mesoderm formation by ITD-1 (Figures 1B and 1C) indicated that TGF-β was essential for this process, which was unexpected because prior studies had implicated only the TGF-β family member Nodal, Wnt, and BMP (Burridge et al., 2012Burridge P.W. Keller G. Gold J.D. Wu J.C. Production of de novo cardiomyocytes: human pluripotent stem cell differentiation and direct reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 16-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Although TGF-β addition can mimic the native role of Nodal in generating mesoderm and heart cells in ESCs, it is not known to normally do so in either embryos or ESC cultures (Behfar et al., 2002Behfar A. Zingman L.V. Hodgson D.M. Rauzier J.M. Kane G.C. Terzic A. Pucéat M. Stem cell differentiation requires a paracrine pathway in the heart.FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). ITD-1 was therefore used to study the role of TGF-β in mesoderm induction. ESC cultures were exposed to ITD-1 from day 1 of differentiation and analyzed for germ layer segregation (Figures 3A–3C ). qRT-PCR analysis of mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm markers at day 5 of differentiation indicated that ITD-1 given at day 1 of differentiation induced ectoderm at the expense of mesoderm (Figure 3B). Consequently, on day 10 of differentiation, markers for mesoderm tissues such as heart, endothelium, smooth muscle, and blood were all downregulated, whereas neural markers were upregulated (Figure 3C). A T-GFP mESC reporter line was then used to quantify mesoderm inhibition by ITD-1 compared to small molecule inhibitors of TGF-β and Activin A/Nodal (SB-431542 and LY-364947), Wnt (IWP), and BMP signaling (Dorsomorphin, DM), which are known to drive mesoderm (Figures 3D and 3E). Inhibition of Wnt and Activin A/TGF-β pathways diminished the number of mesoderm cells, similarly to ITD-1 (Figures 3D and 3E), suggesting that all three factors are involved. However, BMP inhibition did not affect mesoderm as documented previously (Yuasa et al., 2005Yuasa S. Itabashi Y. Koshimizu U. Tanaka T. Sugimura K. Kinoshita M. Hattori F. Fukami S. Shimazaki T. Ogawa S. et al.Transient inhibition of BMP signaling by Noggin induces cardiomyocyte differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). ITD-1 did not inhibit Wnt signaling (Figures S2B–S2E), and because ITD-1 retained weak activity against Activin A/Nodal signaling, it was evaluated in the Cripto−/− mESC assay, revealing that ITD-1 selectively blocked mesoderm induced by TGF-β but not by Activin A (Figures 3F and 3G). To confirm the specific involvement of TGF-β, the chemical tools described above were applied to correlate mesoderm inhibition with TGF-β signaling inhibition. Enantiomeric separation in the T-GFP assay was similar to TGF-β2 signaling inhibition (Figure 3H) and ITDts also reduced the number of T-GFP-positive cells (Figure 3I). Moreover, the correlation between both activities was very strong as shown through SAR analysis (Figure 3J). The ITD class of molecules thus exposed an essential and specific role for TGF-β during mesoderm formation in ESCs. The procardiac effect of ITD-1 between days 3 and 5 of mESC differentiation suggested a specific and unappreciated role for TGF-β in regulating cardiac cell fate (Figures 1B, 1C, 4A, and 4B ). SAR analyses showed a strong correlation between TGF-β inhibition and cardiomyocyte differentiation (R2 = 0.78), comparable to that between cardiogenesis and mesoderm inhibition (Figures 4C and 4D). Moreover, analysis of Myh6-GFP expression in mESCs demonstrated that ITD-1, ITD-1(+), ITDts, and ITD-2 all drove cardiomyogenesis as well as SB-431542 and LY-364947, whereas ITD-1(−) did not (Figures 4E–4G), all consistent with an inhibitory effect of TGF-β on cardiomyocyte differentiation. Similarly, siRNA knockdown of Tgfbr1 or Tgfbr2 alone was sufficient to promote cardiac fate, whereas knockdown of Acvr1b and thus Activin signaling had no effect (Figure 4H), confirming a repressive role of TGF-β on cardiomyocyte development at this time. Conversely, addition of TGF-β2 and not Activin A inhibited cardiogenesis in the day 3–5 window of differentiation, bolstering the findings obtained with chemical- and siRNA-mediated knockdowns of TGFBR2 (Figure 4I). To determine the developmental stages when TGF-β affected cardiac differentiation and whether other cardiovascular lineages were also affected, markers of the different germ layers, progenitors, and lineages were examined at different time points by qRT-PCR. At day 5 of differentiation, mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm markers were unaltered, and only the cardiac progenitor-specific markers Kdr and Mesp1 were increased by ITD-1 (Figure 4J). Furthermore, only cardiac-specific markers were increased at day 10, whereas none of the vascular or hematopoietic markers were affected. TGF-β thus specifically repressed the formation of cardiomyocytes at this stage of differentiation (Figure 4K). To understand the true magnitude of ITD-1 treatment toward cardiac induction from ESCs, we asked whether TGF-β inhibition played a similarly specific role in promoting cardiomyocyte specification in a completely optimized cardiac differentiation protocol in human ESCs (hESCs). H9 cells were optimally differentiated to cardiomyocytes, with ITD-1 added during mesoderm patterning (day 1–5) and cultures were surveyed for cardiovascular markers by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR at day 6 of differentiation (Figures 4L and 4M). Whereas SB completely blocked cardiogenesis at this stage because of Activin A dependence (data not shown), ITD-1 potently enhanced TNNT2+ cardiomyocyte yield by ∼30% resulting in ∼60% cardiomyocytes and was also visible on the mRNA level (Figures 4L and 4M). A slight repression of vascular and hematopoietic markers was also observed (Figure 4M). These findings demonstrate that endogenous TGF-β regulates the yield of cardiomyocytes in hESCs, even under fully optimized and defined media conditions. In summary, ITD-1 and its analogs unraveled a conserved mechanism that exclusively directs cardiac fate in ESCs through temporal inhibition of TGF-β signaling. Screening of small molecules in a complex biological system through a phenotypic read-out can lead to the identification of novel probes of the biology of a cellular system. Such probes can then be linked to specific pathways or mechanisms and may lead to the identification of novel drug targets (Ao et al., 2011Ao A. Hao J. Hong C.C. Regenerative chemical biology: current challenges and future potential.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Willems et al., 2011Willems E. Lanier M. Forte E. Lo F. Cashman J. Mercola M. A chemical biology approach to myocardial regeneration.J. Cardiovasc. Transl. Res. 2011; 4: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed image-based screens in ESCs to discover new pathways and/or mechanisms in cardiogenesis, in particular as a means to gain insight into endogenous regeneration. The molecule described here acts when uncommitted mesoderm cells become specified to a cardiac fate. ITD-1 treatment at this stage in an optimal hESC assay indicates that manipulation of endogenous TGF-β signaling is an important step to refine protocols that enhance cardiomyocyte differentiation, which can be highly variable in different human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell lines (Kattman et al., 2011Kattman S.J. Witty A.D. Gagliardi M. Dubois N.C. Niapour M. Hotta A. Ellis J. Keller G. Stage-specific optimization of activin/nodal and BMP signaling promotes cardiac differentiation of mouse and human pluripotent stem cell lines.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 228-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). 1,4-dihydropyridines are well-known inhibitors of calcium channels (Edraki et al., 2009Edraki N. Mehdipour A.R. Khoshneviszadeh M. Miri R. Dihydropyridines: evaluation of their current and future pharmacological applications.Drug Discov. Today. 2009; 14: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but that mechanism was ruled out. By screening a panel of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that span a wide range of pathways, ITD-1 was found to inhibit the Activin A/TGF-β pathway specifically. Activin A and TGF-β act similarly in that they bind homologous receptors to form ligand-receptor complexes that activate an identical intracellular network of Smad2/3/4 proteins (Wharton and Derynck, 2009Wharton K. Derynck R. TGFbeta family signaling: novel insights in development and disease.Development. 2009; 136: 3691-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Clear stereochemical separation for the strong TGF-β and no separation for the weak Activin A inhibitory activities suggested that the molecular target responsible for effective TGF-β inhibition differs from that which accounts for the lower level of activity against Activin A. The identification of ITDts, which is highly selective for TGF-β, substantiates that idea. Pharmacological separation of the inhibitory effect on the two signaling pathways thus indicates that ITD-1 and analogs bind a molecular target that uniquely affects TGF-β signaling. Therefore, ITD-1 and ITDts are small molecule inhibitors that are highly selective for TGF-β relative to the Activin/Nodal signaling pathways. A key observation of this study is that ITD-1 blocks TGF-β signaling by promoting degradation of TGFBR2. TGF-β receptor levels on the cell surface are dynamically regulated by vesicle-mediated ligand-triggered trafficking, recycling, and lysosome degradation (Figure S6A, branch 1), as well as by direct proteasomal degradation (Figure S6A, branch 2; Chen, 2009Chen Y.G. Endocytic regulation of TGF-beta signaling.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 58-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, Di Guglielmo et al., 2003Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Distinct endocytic pathways regulate TGF-beta receptor signalling and turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). ITD-1 does not target the signaling/recycling/lysosome degradation loop. Instead, ITD-1 drives proteasomal degradation of TGF-β receptors as MG132 and Bortezomib rescued receptor degradation (Figure S6A, branch 2). However, previous studies described equal proteasomal degradation of both TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 through the ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 (Di Guglielmo et al., 2003Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Distinct endocytic pathways regulate TGF-beta receptor signalling and turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Our data on ITD-1 differ from this mechanism since TGFBR2 but not TGFBR1 levels are affected, and the process is ubiquitin independent. Therefore, we suggest that there may be a third mechanism for the specific degradation of TGFBR2 that is enhanced by ITD-1 (Figure S6A, branch 3). Although the direct target of ITD-1 remains to be elucidated, several groups have reported different half lives for TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, consistent with the idea that distinct degradation processes may exist to clear these receptors from the cell surface (Wells et al., 1997Wells R.G. Yankelev H. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Biosynthesis of the type I and type II TGF-beta receptors. Implications for complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11444-11451Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It remains possible that ITD-1 directly binds TGFBR2 to drive its internalization and degradation. Interestingly, TGFBR2 appears to be exclusively downregulated in several human cancers, and in renal carcinomas this reduction has been attributed to increased proteasomal degradation (Fukasawa et al., 2010Fukasawa H. Yamamoto T. Fujigaki Y. Misaki T. Ohashi N. Takayama T. Suzuki S. Mugiya S. Oda T. Uchida C. et al.Reduction of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor is caused by the enhanced ubiquitin-dependent degradation in human renal cell carcinoma.Int. J. Cancer. 2010; 127: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, Meng et al., 2011Meng W. Xia Q. Wu L. Chen S. He X. Zhang L. Gao Q. Zhou H. Downregulation of TGF-beta receptor types II and III in oral squamous cell carcinoma and oral carcinoma-associated fibroblasts.BMC Cancer. 2011; 11: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ITD-1 might therefore be useful as a probe to understand how the altered dynamics of TGFBR2 trafficking contributes to cancer. Through its high selectivity for TGF-β, ITD-1 revealed a biphasic role of TGF-β signaling in ESC cardiogenesis (Figure S6B). When applied early in the differentiation process, ITD-1 prevented mesoderm formation and enhanced neuroectodermal fates. A direct role for TGF-β in mesoderm induction was unanticipated because Nodal (and Activin A) and Wnt are thought to be the principal effectors of the mesoderm and neuroectoderm fate choice in ESCs and mouse embryos (Naito et al., 2006Naito A.T. Shiojima I. Akazawa H. Hidaka K. Morisaki T. Kikuchi A. Komuro I. Developmental stage-specific biphasic roles of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cardiomyogenesis and hematopoiesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19812-19817Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, Perea-Gomez et al., 2002Perea-Gomez A. Vella F.D. Shawlot W. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Chazaud C. Meno C. Pfister V. Chen L.

Cell. 2002; 3: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). TGF-β is expressed in differentiating ESCs and embryos and can induce mesoderm if provided exogenously, but Tgfbr1- and Tgfbr2-null embryos do form mesoderm (Larsson et al., 2001Larsson J. Goumans M.J. Sjöstrand L.J. van Rooijen M.A. Ward D. Levéen P. Xu X. ten Dijke P. Mummery C.L. Karlsson S.

Thus, our data provide evidence for the requirement of TGF-β in mesoderm/neuroectoderm induction in mESCs and potentially in embryos, although compensatory and/or other mechanisms may allow mesoderm formation in Tgfbr1 and Tgfbr2 mutant embryos. Additionally, ITD-1 stimulated cardiomyocyte differentiation from uncommitted mesodermal progenitors in mouse and human ESCs, indicating that TGF-β represses cardiac fate at this developmental stage. Interestingly, inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway at this time did not increase vascular smooth muscle or endothelial markers or cell number, further substantiating the idea that ITD-1 specifically stimulated cardiac differentiation from a cardiovascular progenitor (Figure S6B, light blue cell). In addition, TGF-β inhibition continues to enhance cardiogenesis at considerably later stages (>day 8) by enhancing proliferation of immature cardiomyocytes (Kitamura et al., 2007Kitamura R. Takahashi T. Nakajima N. Isodono K. Asada S. Ueno H. Ueyama T. Yoshikawa T. Matsubara H. Oh H. Stage-specific role of endogenous Smad2 activation in cardiomyogenesis of embryonic stem cells.Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In embryos, TGF-β ligands are expressed in the newly forming cardiac crescent where cardiomyocyte-committed cells arise and may thus naturally contribute to the proper apportioning of cardiomyocyte versus other cardiovascular lineages (Dickson et al., 1993Dickson M.C. Slager H.G. Duffie E. Mummery C.L. Akhurst R.J. RNA and protein localisations of TGF beta 2 in the early mouse embryo suggest an involvement in cardiac development.Development. 1993; 117: 625-639PubMed Google Scholar, Kitamura et al., 2007Kitamura R.

Res. 2007; 101: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In summary, a phenotypic screen of ESC cardiogenesis yielded ITD-1, which is a selective TGF-β inhibitor. ITD-1 acts by stimulating clearance of TGFBR2 from the cell surface and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The chemical biology approach revealed that TGF-β plays a critical, biphasic role in the formation of cardiovascular derivatives from ESCs, first by promoting mesoderm induction and subsequently by inhibiting cardiomyocyte differentiation specifically. Moreover, ITD-1 is a potentially valuable reagent, not only to study ESC differentiation, but also to probe the role of TGF-β signaling in pathological processes such as cancer, fibrosis, and adult cardiovascular disease. mESC lines CGR8 carrying a Myh6-GFP, J1 carrying a T-GFP reporter, and Cripto−/− ESCs were maintained as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. For screening, Myh6-GFP ESCs were seeded and differentiated in 384-well plates. About 17,000 compounds from the DIVERSet library (Chembridge) were added from day 2 to day 6 of differentiation. ITD-1, SB-431542 (Sigma), LY-364947 (Cayman Chemical), and tyrosine kinase inhibitor panel (EMD/Millipore) treatments were performed as indicated. Myh6-GFP-positive cells were imaged on an InCell 1000 System (GE Healthcare) and GFP levels from images were quantified with Cyteseer (Vala Sciences). Mesoderm inhibition assays with T-GFP and Myh6-GFP cells were performed as suspension cultures in serum-containing media. Embryoid bodies (EBs) formed in differentiation media were exposed to ITDs, SB-431542, LY-364947, Dorsomorphin (Tocris), or IWP (EMD/Millipore) at day 1 of differentiation. For the Cripto−/− mESC assay, cells were transferred to serum-free conditions and were treated at day 2 of EB formation with Wnt3a, 15 ng/ml TGF-β2 (EMD/Millipore), 10 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D Systems), or 15 ng/ml Activin A (R&D Systems) in the presence of indicated compounds. H9 hESC were differentiated as EBs in StemPro34 (GIBCO) in ultra-low attachment plates. EBs were optimally differentiated with BMP4, Activin A, bFGF (Sigma), VEGF (R&D Systems), and DKK1 (R&D Systems) as described (Kattman et al., 2011Kattman S.J. Witty A.D. Gagliardi M. Dubois N.C.

Primers are available at http://www.rtprimerdb.org/ and primer ID numbers are listed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. HEK293T cells, grown in DMEM-high glucose with 1% FBS, were transfected with SBE4-Luciferase plasmid and CMV-Renilla-Luciferase with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 12 hr of adhesion, cells were induced with either TGF-β2 (15 ng/ml) or Activin A (15 ng/ml) and inhibitors were added simultaneously. Luminescence was measured through the Dual-Glo kit (Promega). TGFBR1, extracellularly HA-tagged TGFBR2, HA-TGFBR2-mCherry fusions, pcDNA3.1, or PGK-GFP plasmids were transfected in HEK293T as above and treated >6 hr later with ITD-1 for the indicated time points. Chloroquine (Sigma), Bortezomib (Selleck Chemicals), or MG132 (Sigma) were added 3 hr after ITD-1 treatment. Cultures were dissociated with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (GIBCO) (or trypsin for cardiomyocytes) and analyzed on a FACSCanto or LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). For intracellular stains, cells were permeabilized with saponin (Sigma) before staining. Single cells were stained for 30 min with indicated antibodies, which are listed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. FlowJo (Treestar) was used for data analysis. Cells were washed in cold PBS, collected with enzyme-free dissociation buffer, and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Lysates were run on 10% SDS-tris glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to 45 μm PVDF membranes, which were blocked and stained in 5% w/v skim milk in TBST. Detection was performed with the ECL Plus detection kit (Abcam) or with an Odyssey system (LICOR). Antibodies are listed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. All data are represented as the mean with error bars indicating SEM for at least three biological replicates; p values were obtained by a Student's t test. Dose response curve fitting and EC50/IC50 calculation using the (log)agonist versus normalized response equation for induction and the (log)inhibitor versus normalized response equation for inhibition were done in Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Toxic doses were removed from EC50 or IC50 analysis, as judged by Renilla luciferase levels, Alamar Blue cell viability assays, or microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2074623163,"A multistate listeriosis outbreak associated with cantaloupe consumption was reported in the United States in September, 2011. The outbreak investigation recorded a total of 146 invasive illnesses, 30 deaths and one miscarriage. Subtyping of the outbreak associated clinical, food and environmental isolates revealed two serotypes (1/2a and 1/2b) and four pulsed-field gel electrophoresis two-enzyme pattern combinations I, II, III, and IV, including one rarely seen before this outbreak. A DNA-microarray, Listeria GeneChip®, developed by FDA from 24 Listeria monocytogenes genome sequences, was used to further characterize a representative sample of the outbreak isolates. The microarray data (in the form of present or absent calls of specific DNA sequences) separated the isolates into two distinct groups as per their serotypes. The gene content of the outbreak-associated isolates was distinct from that of the previously-reported outbreak strains belonging to the same serotypes. Although the 1/2b outbreak associated isolates are closely related to each other, the 1/2a isolates could be further divided into two distinct genomic groups, one represented by pattern combination I strains and the other represented by highly similar pattern combinations III and IV strains. Gene content analysis of these groups revealed unique genomic sequences associated with these two 1/2a genovars. This work underscores the utility of multiple approaches, such as serotyping, PFGE and DNA microarray analysis to characterize the composition of complex polyclonal listeriosis outbreaks."

Second messengers are small molecules that relay signals from receptors to the intended targets within a cell. Cyclic-di-GMP is a ubiquitous second messenger in bacteria — active in biofilm formation for instance — but until now had not been observed in eukaryotic cells. Zhi-hui Chen and Pauline Schaap now demonstrate a role for c-di-GMP in a eukaryote — Dictyostelium discoideum, an evolutionary ancient social amoeba that has become a model system for cell and developmental biology. The authors identify the long-sought signal that induces multicellular differentiation (stalk formation) in the amoeba as c-di-GMP. Its synthetic enzyme, diguanylate cyclase, is specifically expressed at the fruiting body tip, where stalk cells differentiate. Cyclic di-(3′:5′)-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a major prokaryote signalling intermediate that is synthesized by diguanylate cyclases and triggers sessility and biofilm formation1,2. We detected the first eukaryote diguanylate cyclases in all major groups of Dictyostelia. On food depletion, Dictyostelium discoideum amoebas collect into aggregates, which first transform into migrating slugs and then into sessile fruiting structures3. These structures consist of a spherical spore mass that is supported by a column of stalk cells and a basal disk. A polyketide, DIF-1, which induces stalk-like cells in vitro, was isolated earlier4. However, its role in vivo proved recently to be restricted to basal disk formation5. Here we show that the Dictyostelium diguanylate cyclase, DgcA, produces c-di-GMP as the morphogen responsible for stalk cell differentiation. Dictyostelium discoideum DgcA synthesized c-di-GMP in a GTP-dependent manner and was expressed at the slug tip, which is the site of stalk cell differentiation. Disruption of the DgcA gene blocked the transition from slug migration to fructification and the expression of stalk genes. Fructification and stalk formation were restored by exposing DgcA-null slugs to wild-type secretion products or to c-di-GMP. Moreover, c-di-GMP, but not cyclic di-(3′:5′)-adenosine monophosphate, induced stalk gene expression in dilute cell monolayers. Apart from identifying the long-elusive stalk-inducing morphogen, our work also identifies a role for c-di-GMP in eukaryotes."

Analyses of precancerous and malignant Myc-expressing B cells revealed that Myc regulates hundreds of ARE-containing (ARED) genes and select AUBPs. Notably, Myc directly suppresses transcription of Tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36), an mRNA-destabilizing AUBP, and this circuit is also operational during B lymphopoiesis and IL7 signaling.

Further, there is a selection for TTP loss in malignancy; thus, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor.

Penn L.Z. Reflecting on 25 years with MYC.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). c-Myc (hereafter Myc) expression is activated by MYC/Immunoglobulin (Ig) chromosomal translocations in human Burkitt lymphoma (BL) (Dalla-Favera et al., 1982Dalla-Favera R. Bregni M. Erikson J. Patterson D. Gallo R.C. Croce C.M. Human c-myc onc gene is located on the region of chromosome 8 that is translocated in Burkitt lymphoma cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 1982; 79: 7837-7841Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). This event is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis as Eμ-Myc transgenics, a mouse model of human BL where c-Myc is under the control of the Ig Eμ enhancer, develop aggressive B cell lymphoma (Adams et al., 1985Adams J.M. Harris A.W. Pinkert C.A. Corcoran L.M. Alexander W.S. Cory S. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. The c-myc oncogene driven by immunoglobulin enhancers induces lymphoid malignancy in transgenic mice.Nature. 1985; 318: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). The Eμ-Myc model has proven remarkably useful as a platform for discovery of pathways activated by Myc and for defining checkpoints bypassed during tumorigenesis, for example the Arf-p53 tumor suppressor apoptotic pathway (Eischen et al., 1999Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L. Disruption of the ARF-Mdm2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway in Myc-induced lymphomagenesis.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), the Myc-to-p27Kip1 proliferative circuit (Keller et al., 2007Keller U.B. Old J.B. Dorsey F.C. Nilsson J.A. Nilsson L. MacLean K.H. Chung L. Yang C. Spruck C. Boyd K. et al.Myc targets Cks1 to provoke the suppression of p27Kip1, proliferation and lymphomagenesis.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2562-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the DNA damage response (Gorrini et al., 2007Gorrini C. Squatrito M. Luise C. Syed N. Perna D. Wark L. Martinato F. Sardella D. Verrecchia A. Bennett S. et al.Tip60 is a haplo-insufficient tumour suppressor required for an oncogene-induced DNA damage response.Nature. 2007; 448: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Myc oncoproteins function as basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) transcription factors that control the expression of a large cast (>1,600) of genes (Zeller et al., 2003Zeller K.I. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. O'Donnell K.A. Dang C.V. An integrated database of genes responsive to the Myc oncogenic transcription factor: identification of direct genomic targets.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by binding to specific E-box sequences (CAC/AGTG). Binding of Myc to these elements requires dimerization with Max, a bHLH-Zip family member and binding of Myc:Max complexes recruits transcriptional coactivators to induce transcription (Dang et al., 2006Dang C.V. O'Donnell K.A. Zeller K.I. Nguyen T. Osthus R.C. Li F. The c-Myc target gene network.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Further, Myc:Max heterodimers repress transcription by binding to and inhibiting the functions of the Miz-1 transcription factor at Initiator (Inr) elements found at some transcription start sites (Seoane et al., 2001Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massagué J. TGFbeta influences Myc, Miz-1 and Smad to control the CDK inhibitor p15INK4b.Nat.

Eilers M. Repression of p15INK4b expression by Myc through association with Miz-1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, Myc binding does not always connote direct regulation of a target (Zeller et al., 2006Zeller K.I. Zhao X. Lee C.W. Chiu K.P. Yao F. Yustein J.T. Ooi H.S. Orlov Y.L. Shahab A. Yong H.C. et al.Global mapping of c-Myc binding sites and target gene networks in human B cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17834-17839Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and Myc can indirectly affect gene expression via its regulation of other mediators or by its effects on cell growth, survival or transformation (Dang, 1999Dang C.V. c-Myc target genes involved in cell growth, apoptosis, and metabolism.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The regulation of mRNA turnover is a critical node for controlling gene expression, and many short-lived transcripts harbor AU-rich elements (AREs), usually an AUUUA sequence, within their 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs). Indeed, using computational analysis an ARE database (ARED) has shown that at least 11% of human genes contain AREs (Halees et al., 2008Halees A.S. El-Badrawi R. Khabar K.S. ARED Organism: expansion of ARED reveals AU-rich element cluster variations between human and mouse.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D137-D140PubMed Google Scholar). A set of RNA-binding proteins coined AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) specifically bind to AREs, serving to either stabilize or promote destruction of mRNAs (Chen and Shyu, 1995Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. AU-rich elements: characterization and importance in mRNA degradation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). For example, the AUBPs HuR, HuB, HuC, HuD, Auf1, Auf2, and Nucleolin (Ncl), typically stabilize ARE-containing mRNAs (Brennan and Steitz, 2001Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. HuR and mRNA stability.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar; Dean et al., 2002Dean J.L. Sully G. Wait R. Rawlinson L. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10855-10863Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of others such as Tristetraprolin (TTP/Tis11/Zfp36) and its family members Tis11b (Brf1/Zfp36l1) and Tis11d (Brf2/Zfp36l2) mark ARE-containing mRNAs for delivery to processing bodies (P-bodies) where transcripts are deadenylated and degraded by mRNA decay enzymes (Blackshear, 2002Blackshear P.J. Tristetraprolin and other CCCH tandem zinc-finger proteins in the regulation of mRNA turnover.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar; Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2007Franks T.M. Lykke-Andersen J. TTP and BRF proteins nucleate processing body formation to silence mRNAs with AU-rich elements.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 719-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The ability of AUBPs to control gene expression through mRNA stability has been suggested to play roles in tumorigenesis. For example, HuR binds to the COX-2 mRNA ARE in colon cancer cells, increasing levels of this proinflammatory protein (Dixon et al., 2001Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Altered expression of the mRNA stability factor HuR promotes cyclooxygenase-2 expression in colon cancer cells.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Further, the NPM-ALK oncoprotein phosphorylates AUF1, augmenting its ability to stabilize some mRNAs (Fawal et al., 2006Fawal M. Armstrong F. Ollier S. Dupont H. Touriol C. Monsarrat B. Delsol G. Payrastre B. Morello D. A “liaison dangereuse” between AUF1/hnRNPD and the oncogenic tyrosine kinase NPM-ALK.Blood. 2006; 108: 2780-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, β-actin promoter-driven expression of the p37 isoform of AUF1 can trigger sarcoma in transgenic mice (Gouble et al., 2002Gouble A. Grazide S. Meggetto F. Mercier P. Delsol G. Morello D. A new player in oncogenesis: AUF1/hnRNPD overexpression leads to tumorigenesis in transgenic mice.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1489-1495PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, TTP levels are reduced in aggressive prostate and breast cancer and connote poor outcome (Brennan et al., 2009Brennan S.E. Kuwano Y. Alkharouf N. Blackshear P.J. Gorospe M. Wilson G.M. The mRNA-destabilizing protein tristetraprolin is suppressed in many cancers, altering tumorigenic phenotypes and patient prognosis.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5168-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and inactivation of both Tis11b and Tis11d in mouse T cells can lead to leukemia (Hodson et al., 2010Hodson D.J. Janas M.L. Galloway A. Bell S.E. Andrews S. Li C.M. Pannell R. Siebel C.W. MacDonald H.R. De Keersmaecker K. et al.Deletion of the RNA-binding proteins ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 leads to perturbed thymic development and T lymphoblastic leukemia.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, although largely anecdotal, these studies suggest that at least some AUBPs play roles in cancer. Because mRNA stability is a common mechanism for controlling transcript levels, we hypothesized that Myc indirectly regulates ARE-containing mRNAs via the agency of AUBPs and that this pathway is important for tumorigenesis. Here, we show that Myc regulates the expression of hundreds of ARED genes and several AUBPs. In particular, Myc directly suppresses the transcription of TTP, which regulates the levels of cancer-associated ARED genes, and this control is disabled during tumorigenesis. Notably, repression of TTP is a hallmark of malignancies with MYC involvement and enforced expression of TTP impairs lymphoma development and abolishes maintenance of the malignant state. Thus, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor. To assess effects of Myc on the expression of ARED genes (Halees et al., 2008Halees A.S. El-Badrawi R. Khabar K.S. ARED Organism: expansion of ARED reveals AU-rich element cluster variations between human and mouse.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D137-D140PubMed Google Scholar), we performed expression profiling analyses of B220+ B cells from 4- to 6-week-old wild-type versus Eμ-Myc littermates, and of lymphomas from several Eμ-Myc mice; 153 ARED genes, or 7.8% of ARED genes expressed, were significantly altered in precancerous Eμ-Myc B cells (74 induced and 79 repressed) (Figure 1A, Table S1). Most of these were similarly regulated in lymphomas, although the magnitude of this response was often greater in tumors (Figure S1A). Further, a comparison of precancerous and malignant Eμ-Myc B cells showed 344 ARED genes (16.5% of ARED genes expressed) were significantly altered by neoplastic conversion (Figure 1B, Table S2). Collectively, the expression of nearly 20% of all ARED genes expressed in B cells is altered during Myc-driven lymphomagenesis.Figure S1ARED Gene Expression in Myc-driven Eμ-Myc Lymphoma and MYCN-amplified Neuroblastoma, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Gene expression profiling of arrays showing those ARED genes that are induced or repressed in B220+ premalignant Eμ-Myc versus wild-type B cells (from Figure 1A), compared to their expression in malignant B cells of Eμ-Myc lymphomas.

Probe sets shown have a > 2.0-fold change and are significantly altered by unpaired t test analysis (p < 0.05). To assess whether MYC alters ARED gene expression in human B lymphoma, we queried expression data sets of primary human BL samples that bear MYC/Ig translocations versus other human B lymphoma subtypes (non-BL) (Hummel et al., 2006Hummel M. Bentink S. Berger H. Klapper W. Wessendorf S. Barth T.F. Bernd H.W. Cogliatti S.B. Dierlamm J. Feller A.C. et al.Molecular Mechanisms in Malignant Lymphomas Network Project of the Deutsche KrebshilfeA biologic definition of Burkitt's lymphoma from transcriptional and genomic profiling.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 2419-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Indeed, 366 ARED genes (15.2% of ARED genes expressed) are significantly different in human BL (Figure 1C, Table S3). Altered ARED gene regulation is also manifest in neuroblastoma, where analyses of expression data sets (Wang et al., 2006Wang Q. Diskin S. Rappaport E. Attiyeh E. Mosse Y. Shue D. Seiser E. Jagannathan J. Shusterman S. Bansal M. et al.Integrative genomics identifies distinct molecular classes of neuroblastoma and shows that multiple genes are targeted by regional alterations in DNA copy number.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6050-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) demonstrated 129 ARED genes significantly differ in MYCN-amplified versus non-MYCN-amplified tumors (Figure S1B). Finally, there is a significant (24%) overlap in the expression of ARED genes altered in BL and MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Thus, Myc affects expression of a large cast of ARED genes in different tumor types and in B cells. Given the effects of Myc on ARED genes, expression data sets were mined to determine whether Myc alters the expression of AUBPs. The expression of Ncl and Auf2 was significantly increased in premalignant Eμ-Myc versus wild-type B220+ B cells (Figure 2A). Further, levels of TTP, Tis11b, and Auf2 were significantly reduced in malignant versus precancerous Eμ-Myc B cells (Figure 2B). The differences in Auf2 expression are likely due to different probe sets, one recognizing both spliced variants, whereas the other only recognizes the shorter isoform. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses of wild-type and premalignant Eμ-Myc B cells, and of Eμ-Myc lymphomas, demonstrated that TTP and Tis11b transcripts were markedly reduced in precancerous and malignant Eμ-Myc B cells (Figure 2C). TTP protein levels were also drastically reduced in premalignant Eμ-Myc B cells (Figure 2D). In contrast, mRNAs encoding HuR, Auf1, Auf2, and Ncl were elevated in precancerous and malignant Eμ-Myc B cells (Figure 2C). Thus, the expression of select AUBPs is altered during Myc-driven lymphomagenesis. To assess AUBP gene expression in human tumors with MYC involvement, we determined their expression in human BL versus non-BL lymphomas. TTP and TIS11B expression is markedly repressed in human BL (Figures 2E and 2F). By contrast, levels of HUR, AUF1, AUF2, and NCL mRNA were not significantly altered. Notably, expression analyses of other cancers and tumor subtypes established that repression of TTP, or of its family member TIS11D, are hallmarks of Myc-expressing malignancies. Strikingly, TTP expression was the inverse of MYC in human tumors, where TTP levels were low in MYC-expressing breast, colorectal, and metastatic prostate cancer (Figures S2B–S2E). Further, TIS11D is repressed in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and in colorectal cancers with elevated MYC levels (Figures S2A and S2C). The finding that TTP levels inversely correlated with MYC in tumors versus normal tissues suggested that Myc and TTP expression might be coordinately controlled during development and by mitogenic signaling. In progenitor B cells Myc is regulated by IL7 (Morrow et al., 1992Morrow M.A. Lee G. Gillis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Alt F.W. Interleukin-7 induces N-myc and c-myc expression in normal precursor B lymphocytes.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To address control of TTP and Tis11b in this context, primary mouse progenitor B cells grown in IL7 medium were deprived and then restimulated with ligand. As expected Myc mRNA levels were dependent upon ligand (Figure 3A). Notably, control of TTP and to a lesser extent Tis11b, were the inverse of Myc, where TTP and Tis11b mRNA levels were high in ligand-deprived cells yet suppressed following IL7 stimulation. Further, analyses of both B and T lymphocyte developmental expression (Painter et al., 2011Painter M.W. Davis S. Hardy R.R. Mathis D. Benoist C. Immunological Genome Project ConsortiumTranscriptomes of the B and T lineages compared by multiplatform microarray profiling.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; Tabrizifard et al., 2004Tabrizifard S. Olaru A. Plotkin J. Fallahi-Sichani M. Livak F. Petrie H.T. Analysis of transcription factor expression during discrete stages of postnatal thymocyte differentiation.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1094-1102PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that TTP and Tis11b levels were the inverse of those of Myc, where they are induced when Myc is shut off in more mature, nonproliferating lymphocytes (Figure 3B). Thus, TTP and Tis11b expression is regulated by physiological signals that control Myc. P493-6 lymphoblastoid B cells harbor a tetracycline (Tet)-repressed c-Myc transgene that allows Myc to be turned on and off (Pajic et al., 2000Pajic A. Spitkovsky D. Christoph B. Kempkes B. Schuhmacher M. Staege M.S. Brielmeier M. Ellwart J. Kohlhuber F. Bornkamm G.W. et al.Cell cycle activation by c-myc in a burkitt lymphoma model cell line.Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To test whether Myc regulates the expression of AUBPs, these cells were treated with Tet to turn off Myc. Tet was then removed and cells harvested for expression analysis. As c-Myc mRNA and protein were induced (Figure 3C, black line, and data not shown), AUF2 and NCL mRNA levels also increased, whereas TTP and TIS11B mRNA levels dropped. In contrast, HUR and AUF1 mRNA levels do not increase until 24 hr after c-Myc induction, suggesting they are indirect targets of Myc. P493-6 cells also harbor an estrogen-regulated ER-EBNA2 fusion transgene that can drive cell proliferation in the presence of β-estradiol (β-E2) even when c-Myc is repressed by Tet, allowing one to discriminate direct versus proliferative effects of Myc. Notably, β-E2 had little effect on TTP and actually induced TIS11B in the presence of Tet (Figure 3C, red line), suggesting these are direct targets repressed by Myc. In contrast, β-E2 induced HUR, AUF1, AUF2, and NCL mRNA levels; thus, these AUBP genes may be induced via Myc's proliferative effects. Myc:Max complexes can repress transcription by binding to Inr elements. TTP harbors an Inr downstream of the TATA box (Lai et al., 1995Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. Promoter analysis of Zfp-36, the mitogen-inducible gene encoding the zinc finger protein tristetraprolin.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and a putative Inr is present in TIS11B near the TATA box. To test whether Myc bound to these Inr elements, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed by using c-Myc antibody in P493-6 cells ± Tet. There was an inducible enrichment (of ∼3.5-fold) of Myc binding to the Inr elements of TTP and TIS11B (Figure 3D and S3A). Further, genome-wide Myc ChIP analyses of the ENCODE project (Rosenbloom et al., 2010Rosenbloom K.R. Dreszer T.R. Pheasant M. Barber G.P. Meyer L.R. Pohl A. Raney B.J. Wang T. Hinrichs A.S. Zweig A.S. et al.ENCODE whole-genome data in the UCSC Genome Browser.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D620-D625Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) showed that Myc binds to the Inr regions of both TTP and TIS11B in several tumor and normal cell lines (Figure S3B). To assess if Myc-mediated repression of TTP and TIS11B was transcriptional, we performed primary transcript (i.e., unspliced) qRT-PCR analyses and RNA Pol II ChIP analyses in P493-6 cells ± Tet. Myc induction was associated with repression of nascent TTP transcripts (Figure S3C) and with a marked reduction in binding of RNA Pol II to the transcription start regions of both TTP and TIS11B (Figure 3E). Thus, Myc binding to the Inr elements of TTP and TIS11B is associated with their reduced transcription. Given the effects of Myc on TTP and TIS11B expression and their suppression in Myc-driven lymphoma, we hypothesized that Myc-directed repression of TTP and/or Tis11b contributes to lymphomagenesis. To test this, Eμ-TTP and Eμ-Tis11b transgene vectors were generated (Figure 4A) that contained complete coding regions for mouse TTP or Tis11b (but lacking their 5′ and 3′ UTRs) cloned into the pEμSR vector (Bodrug et al., 1994Bodrug S.E. Warner B.J. Bath M.L. Lindeman G.J. Harris A.W. Adams J.M. Cyclin D1 transgene impedes lymphocyte maturation and collaborates in lymphomagenesis with the myc gene.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These constructs were used to generate Eμ-TTP and Eμ-Tis11b transgenic mice coined Eμ-TTP-1, Eμ-TTP-2, and Eμ-Tis11b; all expressed elevated levels of TTP or Tis11b mRNA in B cells (Figure 4B) and the TTP transgenics had high levels of TTP protein in splenic and BM B220+ B cells (Figure 4C). Eμ-TTP and Eμ-Tis11b transgenics mice grow normally and have no apparent phenotype. Further, analyses of B cell development established that overexpression of TTP or Tis11b does not alter B cell numbers or immunophenotypes (Figure 5C and data not shown). Indeed, expression analysis showed only 16 genes were significantly altered by elevated TTP expression in Eμ-TTP B cells versus wild-type B cells that express endogenous TTP (and only six of these are ARED genes, Figure S4). Thus, TTP overexpression alone has very minor effects on B cell gene expression programs.Figure 5TTP Suppresses Myc-driven LymphomagenesisShow full caption(A) Survival curves of Eμ-Myc;Eμ-TTP-1 (n = 19), Eμ-Myc;Eμ-TTP-2 (n = 25), and Eμ-Myc;Eμ-Tis11b (n = 23) transgenic mice were compared to Eμ-Myc littermates (n = 16, 30 or 22, respectively).

To elucidate its in vivo functions, we initiated a yeast two-hybrid screening to look for Pax7-interacting proteins and identified a previously uncharacterized Pax7- and Pax3-binding protein (Pax3/7BP). Pax3/7BP is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein, enriched in Pax7+ muscle precursor cells (MPCs), and serves as an indispensable adaptor for Pax7 to recruit the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase (HMT) complex by bridging Pax7 and Wdr5. Knockdown of Pax3/7BP abolished the Pax3/7-associated H3K4 HMT activity and inhibited the proliferation of Pax7+ MPCs from young mice both in culture and in vivo. Id3 and Cdc20 were direct target genes of Pax7 and Pax3/7BP involved in the proliferation of Pax7+ MPCs. Collectively, our work establishes Pax3/7BP as an essential adaptor linking Pax3/7 with the H3K4 HMT to regulate the proliferation of MPCs."

Downstream targets of cooperating oncogenes are identified in leukemia cells Gene sets that regulate the in vivo behavior of leukemia stem cells are described Genes modulating in vivo biology of leukemia stem cells are used for drug discovery Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arises in hematopoietic tissues and manifests in the form of aberrant production and dissemination of immature white blood cells (Löwenberg et al., 1999Löwenberg B. Downing J.R. Burnett A. Acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Although many therapeutic strategies have been tested, AML is generally very difficult to treat and the majority of patients ultimately succumb to the disease (Burnett et al., 2011Burnett A.

Acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). While the reasons behind the failure of conventional therapy are multifaceted, one aspect of the problem appears to derive from the cellular and molecular heterogeneity that is intrinsic to leukemic disease. Indeed, primary leukemia specimens are clearly complex populations, which in at least some cases bear remnants of the developmental structure found in normal hematopoietic tissues (Bonnet and Dick, 1997Bonnet D. Dick J.E. Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (5460) Google Scholar; Hope et al., 2004Hope K.J. Jin L. Dick J.E. Acute myeloid leukemia originates from a hierarchy of leukemic stem cell classes that differ in self-renewal capacity.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Hence, leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to reside at the apex of a hierarchical development process in which the majority of tumor cells arise from a biologically distinct LSC population. This view of leukemia pathology suggests that targeting of the LSC compartment will be critical in order to achieve lasting elimination of the disease. Notably, empirical evidence clearly suggests that LSCs are relatively quiescent and resistant to conventional chemotherapy (Costello et al., 2000Costello R.T. Mallet F. Gaugler B. Sainty D. Arnoulet C. Gastaut J.A. Olive D. Human acute myeloid leukemia CD34+/CD38- progenitor cells have decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy and Fas-induced apoptosis, reduced immunogenicity, and impaired dendritic cell transformation capacities.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4403-4411PubMed Google Scholar; Guzman et al., 2001Guzman M.L.

Nuclear factor-kappaB is constitutively activated in primitive human acute myelogenous leukemia cells.Blood. 2001; 98: 2301-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), thereby supporting the concept that LSCs are biologically distinct from bulk tumor cells and indicating that eradication of the malignant stem cell compartment requires the development of new therapeutic strategies. Due to the clinical importance of targeting LSCs, investigation of the mechanisms that control their growth and survival has been an active area of research in recent years. Using mouse models of AML, several reports have described specific genes and pathways that are selectively utilized by LSCs. For example, in leukemias initiated by MLL translocations, dysregulation of β-catenin (Wang et al., 2010Wang Y. Krivtsov A.V. Sinha A.U. North T.E. Goessling W. Feng Z. Zon L.I. Armstrong S.A. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is required for the development of leukemia stem cells in AML.Science. 2010; 327: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), GSK3-β, and Meis1 (Wong et al., 2007Wong P. Iwasaki M. Somervaille T.C. So C.W. Cleary M.L. Meis1 is an essential and rate-limiting regulator of MLL leukemia stem cell potential.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2762-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) has been shown to be important for survival of LSCs. Similarly, Musashi-2 was recently shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of LSCs in BCR-ABL-mediated blast crisis (Ito et al., 2010Ito T. Kwon H.Y. Zimdahl B. Congdon K.L. Blum J. Lento W.E. Zhao C. Lagoo A. Gerrard G. Foroni L. et al.Regulation of myeloid leukaemia by the cell-fate determinant Musashi.Nature. 2010; 466: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and PML-RAR-alpha (Nasr et al., 2008Nasr R. Guillemin M.C. Ferhi O. Soilihi H. Peres L. Berthier C. Rousselot P. Robledo-Sarmiento M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Gourmel B. et al.Eradication of acute promyelocytic leukemia-initiating cells through PML-RARA degradation.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) was demonstrated to have a central function in a model of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Despite these findings, the overall gamut of pathways most central to the biology of LSCs, particularly as they relate to therapeutic targeting, remains largely unknown, not least because drivers of malignant cell transformation downstream of oncogenic mutations have been very difficult to identify. A general feature of cancers, including leukemia, is the requirement of multiple cooperating oncogenic mutations for malignant cell transformation, as for example the manifestation of acute malignancy as observed in blast crisis CML. Moreover, recent evidence from a variety of cell types shows that the process of oncogene cooperation requires synergistic regulation of downstream targets at multiple levels including gene regulation (Lloyd et al., 1997Lloyd A.C. Obermüller F. Staddon S. Barth C.F. McMahon M. Land H. Cooperating oncogenes converge to regulate cyclin/cdk complexes.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar; Sewing et al., 1997Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H.

Tumor suppressor p53 restricts Ras stimulation of RhoA and cancer cell motility.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Notably, such targets, i.e., their corresponding genes, have been demonstrated to be essential for the cancer phenotype with high frequency and have been termed “cooperation response genes” or CRGs (McMurray et al., 2008McMurray H.R. Sampson E.R. Compitello G. Kinsey C. Newman L. Smith B. Chen S.R. Klebanov L. Salzman P. Yakovlev A. Land H. Synergistic response to oncogenic mutations defines gene class critical to cancer phenotype.Nature. 2008; 453: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The approach of exploiting the consequences of the genetic interactions between oncogenes to identify CRGs thus appeared as an attractive rationale for discovery of critical pathways regulating LSC biology. In fact, McMurray et al. demonstrated in a colon cancer cell model, using activated Ras and mutant p53, that CRGs regulate a wide array of cellular processes, and included many genes not previously associated with malignancy. Thus, CRG analysis provides a powerful and relatively unbiased means by which to identify genes that contribute to oncogenic transformation. In the present studies, we employed the CRG strategy in the context of a mouse model of blast crisis CML, a very aggressive form of acute leukemia that is usually refractory to conventional drug therapy. The system employs coexpression of the BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9 translocation products, which yields a cooperative oncogenic transformation event and a well-characterized model of human blast crisis CML (Dash et al., 2002Dash A.B. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Tomasson M.H. Anastasiadou E. Lindahl K. Li S. Van Etten R.A. Borrow J. Housman D. et al.A murine model of CML blast crisis induced by cooperation between BCR/ABL and NUP98/HOXA9.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7622-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar; Neering et al., 2007Neering S.J. Bushnell T. Sozer S. Ashton J. Rossi R.M. Wang P.Y. Bell D.R. Heinrich D. Bottaro A. Jordan C.T. Leukemia stem cells in a genetically defined murine model of blast-crisis CML.Blood. 2007; 110: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our data show that CRGs are readily evident in this system and that many of these genes modulate the in vivo growth of primitive leukemia cells. In addition, we show that the expression signature of leukemia CRGs can be utilized as a drug discovery tool to identify pharmacological agents with selective antileukemia activity. Finally, we extend our findings to patient-derived specimens and demonstrate a similar role for CRGs in the biology of primary human leukemic cell types. Taken together, these findings indicate that analysis of oncogene cooperation provides important insights into the biology and potential treatment of leukemic disease. To identify leukemia CRGs, we employed a mouse model of blast crisis CML that has been shown to mimic human disease (Dash et al., 2002Dash A.B. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Tomasson M.H. Anastasiadou E. Lindahl K. Li S. Van Etten R.A. Borrow J. Housman D. et al.A murine model of CML blast crisis induced by cooperation between BCR/ABL and NUP98/HOXA9.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7622-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and in which we have previously identified and characterized a discrete leukemia stem cell (LSC) population (Neering et al., 2007Neering S.J. Bushnell T. Sozer S. Ashton J. Rossi R.M. Wang P.Y. Bell D.R. Heinrich D. Bottaro A. Jordan C.T. Leukemia stem cells in a genetically defined murine model of blast-crisis CML.Blood. 2007; 110: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To establish the model, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) enriched bone marrow cells were isolated from C57Bl/6-CD45.1 congenic mice and infected with two independent retroviral vectors encoding the human translocation products BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9 (Figure 1A ). Each retroviral vector also expressed a distinct fluorescent protein reporter (GFP or YFP) to delineate cells transduced with one or both vectors (Neering et al., 2007Neering S.J. Bushnell T. Sozer S. Ashton J. Rossi R.M. Wang P.Y. Bell D.R. Heinrich D. Bottaro A. Jordan C.T. Leukemia stem cells in a genetically defined murine model of blast-crisis CML.Blood. 2007; 110: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Upon transplantation into C57Bl/6-CD45.2 recipient animals, transduced cells rapidly engraft and proliferate with overt disease evident in 10–12 days. The use of two independent vectors for the initial infections results in cell populations expressing one or both vectors. These populations can be easily distinguished and isolated by flow cytometric sorting (Figure 1A). Cells representing each of the four possible genotypes (no oncogene, BCR-ABL alone, NUP98-HOXA9 alone, or both oncogenes) were sorted using a standard lineage marker panel (lin) to isolate the immature lin− compartment, as well as the CD45.1 congenic marker to ensure a pure population of donor cells. The generation and isolation of each population was repeated in six independent experiments. For the identification of synergistically regulated genes, genome-wide transcriptional profiling was performed on sorted cells using the Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 microarray platform. Genes were first filtered based on differential expression between fully transformed (i.e., BCR-ABL + NUP98-HOXA9) and normal cells using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction procedure with a p value cutoff of 0.01. This analysis yielded approximately 3,500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) representing the overall transcriptional dysregulation in primitive leukemia compared to normal cells. Next we applied a synergy filter to identify genes cooperatively regulated by BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9. This was accomplished by comparing the level of gene expression in the primitive leukemia cells (BCR-ABL + NUP98-HOXA9) to that of primitive hematopoietic cells expressing each translocation alone (Figure 1B). Synergy was defined as a greater than additive fold change in gene regulation upon expression of both oncogenes in the same cell (McMurray et al., 2008McMurray H.R. Sampson E.R. Compitello G. Kinsey C. Newman L. Smith B. Chen S.R. Klebanov L. Salzman P. Yakovlev A. Land H. Synergistic response to oncogenic mutations defines gene class critical to cancer phenotype.Nature. 2008; 453: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). By applying the synergy criteria to the 3,500 DEGs, a cooperativity response gene set was identified in primitive leukemia. After removal of Riken cDNA and ESTs, the gene set comprised 72 genes (Table S1 available online), termed the leukemia cooperation response genes or CRGs (Figure 1C). Moreover, the expression of each gene in the CRG signature was uniquely modulated in fully transformed cells (i.e., BCR-ABL + NUP98-HOXA9) compared to cells bearing the single translocations (Figure 1C). To corroborate the data obtained from microarray analyses, we validated the results by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), using freshly generated primitive (lin−) leukemic and normal bone marrow cells. Total RNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR using Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA), custom designed to detect expression of CRGs. A total of four independent biological replicates were evaluated. Relative gene expression was determined in primitive leukemia by comparison to paired normal controls. The analysis revealed that over 95% of CRGs identified by microarray showed a similar differential expression when assayed by TLDA (Figure S1). Given that most of the genes identified were not previously known to be associated with blast crisis leukemia, we performed a pathway analysis and gene ontology annotation of the 72 CRGs to characterize the various cellular processes implicated. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that the CRGs were present in a diverse set of biological functions such as signal transduction, metabolism, and cell adhesion (Figure 1D). A significant challenge in understanding the biology of leukemia cells is the well-known heterogeneity found in primary malignant populations (Hope et al., 2004Hope K.J. Jin L. Dick J.E. Acute myeloid leukemia originates from a hierarchy of leukemic stem cell classes that differ in self-renewal capacity.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Indeed, multiple discrete subpopulations are commonly evident, including the LSC compartment. While elucidating factors that control the most primitive cells is a high priority, understanding the biology of all leukemic cells is also important, since fundamental properties such as disease dissemination, growth control, drug resistance, etc. are likely to be shared among many cell types and are highly relevant to disease pathology. Thus, we sought to determine whether or not the CRG expression profile derived from lin− leukemia cells was conserved in more primitive as well as more mature cell types. As shown in Figure 2, we defined three distinct subpopulations based on the expression of lineage markers (lin) as well as the stem cell marker Sca-1. We have previously shown that Lin−/Sca+ leukemia cells are highly enriched for LSC content, while lin+ leukemia cells are completely devoid of LSCs (Neering et al., 2007Neering S.J. Bushnell T. Sozer S. Ashton J. Rossi R.M. Wang P.Y. Bell D.R. Heinrich D. Bottaro A. Jordan C.T. Leukemia stem cells in a genetically defined murine model of blast-crisis CML.Blood. 2007; 110: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, these two populations were isolated by flow cytometric sorting, along with the lin−/Sca1− compartment, which is enriched for leukemic progenitor cells. Total RNA was isolated from each sorted specimen and subsequently interrogated using custom-designed TLDA cards to evaluate the expression of the CRGs. A total of four independent biological replicates using paired leukemic and normal cell populations were analyzed. Intriguingly, there was a strong conservation in relative expression in the majority of leukemic populations tested (Figure 2). Over 85% of the CRG signature was maintained across all three cell populations (mature, progenitor, and LSC-enriched). The conservation of the signature across varying leukemic cell types suggests that despite readily evident cellular heterogeneity, many of the core properties that arise from oncogene cooperativity events may be conserved broadly in leukemic populations. This observation, along with the differential expression of CRGs in leukemia cells (versus normal), may have important ramifications for the development of improved therapies. To test the hypothesis that genes comprising the CRG signature may have a functional role in the growth of leukemic cells, we designed an RNAi-based approach as a means to investigate all upregulated genes in the signature. Of the 72 genes in the CRG set, 50 were shown to be aberrantly upregulated in leukemic cells and therefore represent potential targets for RNAi mediated knockdown (Figure S1). Primitive leukemia cells were purified from leukemic animals and transduced with a custom-designed lentiviral RNAi library in which five to ten individual shRNAs targeted each upregulated CRG. Twenty-four hours later, infected leukemia cells were separated into two fractions. The first fraction was transplanted into recipient animals to determine the outcome of individual shRNA perturbation on leukemia growth in vivo. Genomic DNA was immediately isolated from the remaining cells to determine the time zero shRNA repertoire (Figure 3A ). After 8 days, bone marrow and spleen cells were harvested from recipient mice and genomic DNA was isolated. To determine the relative abundance of each shRNA before and after in vivo expansion, we subjected the DNA from all specimens to PCR-based amplification with primers flanking the shRNA sequence followed by XhoI restriction enzyme digestion to remove the hairpin structure and subsequently analyzed by Illumina deep sequencing. The entire experiment was repeated five times to ensure the validity of each gene under investigation. The fold change for each shRNA in the screen was determined relative to time zero as well as control shRNAs (luciferase, LacZ, and RFP) for both bone marrow and spleen samples (Figure 3B). Depletion was scored as a 5-fold or greater decrease in shRNA abundance relative to time zero. To minimize any background from potential off-target effects of the RNAi, only genes with two or more independent shRNAs achieving a 5-fold depletion were considered to be true “drop-outs” from the screen and thereby important for leukemia growth in vivo. In applying these criteria, we observed that 35 of the 50 targeted CRGs (i.e., 70%) were depleted from both the bone marrow and spleen samples (Figure S2). These findings indicate that a majority of CRGs represent genes of functional relevance to in vivo growth of primitive leukemia cells. To corroborate the results from the RNAi screen, we further characterized six individual CRGs. The genes chosen—CP, Serinc2, GJB3, PMP22, EphA3, and SerpinB2—represent varying degrees of depletion observed from the drop-out screen with CP representing the least depleted in comparison to control shRNAs and SerpinB2 representing the most depleted (Figure 3C). For these experiments, primitive leukemia cells were isolated by flow cytometry from primary animals and infected with individual shRNA lentiviruses specific for each gene or a LacZ shRNA control. The lentiviral vector used for these studies was designed to also encode the crimson fluorescent protein (CrFP), which permits identification and quantification of leukemic cells bearing the shRNA constructs (for example, see Figure S2). Twenty-four hours later, each sample was evaluated by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of CrFP+ cells (time zero) and then transplanted into recipient animals. Bone marrow was harvested from recipient animals 10 days after transplant and the percentage of CrFP+ cells present in the leukemic graft was again determined by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3D, each of the six CRGs tested was targeted by two independent shRNA lentiviruses and knockdown of these genes led to reduced leukemia engraftment (Figure 3E). Thus, each of the genes evaluated contributes to some aspect of the in vivo behavior of primitive leukemia cells, e.g., engraftment, growth, survival, etc. To further investigate these genes, we performed parallel RNAi-mediated knockdown studies of all six CRGs in normal hematopoietic stem cells and characterized the in vivo consequences using long-term bone marrow reconstitution assays. The results show that in most cases, knockdown of the CRGs had less effect in long-term engraftment of normal hematopoietic cells than their leukemia counterparts (Figures S3 and S4G). Given that SerpinB2 shRNAs induced the greatest degree of depletion in the RNAi screen, we chose to more thoroughly investigate the role of this gene in leukemia. As SerpinB2-deficient animals are available on a C57Bl/6 genetic background, we obtained SerpinB2−/− hematopoietic cells for experimental analysis. HSC-enriched cells from either SerpinB2−/− CD45.2 or wild-type CD45.1 mice were infected with BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9 as outlined previously (Figure 4A ). Equal numbers of BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9 transduced wild-type or SerpinB2 KO LSK cells were transplanted into recipient animals and engraftment of wild-type versus SerpinB2 KO leukemia was determined at 9 days after transplant (Figure 4A). The analysis revealed a significant reduction of leukemia cells in bone marrow of mice transplanted with SerpinB2 KO leukemia cells compared to wild-type (Figure 4B). Interestingly, engraftment of LSK cells expressing BCR-ABL alone (a model of chronic myeloid leukemia) was largely unaffected by loss of SerpinB2, with similar levels of engraftment observed between wild-type and SerpinB2 KO leukemia cells (Figure 4C). This observation supports the role of SerpinB2 specifically in the cooperative gene interaction that leads to the blast crisis form of the disease. To rule out possible artifacts due to differential gene transfer efficiency, we performed a competitive transplantation analysis of SerpinB2 KO versus wild-type leukemia cells, where leukemic mice were first established with each genotype individually. Upon development of disease, primary leukemic bone marrow from each background was harvested, mixed together at equal ratios, and transplanted into secondary CD45.2 recipient mice. Nine days after transplant leukemic bone marrow was harvested from recipient animals and analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-CD45.1 and anti-CD45.2 antibodies. The relative engraftment of wild-type versus SerpinB2−/− leukemia was compared to the input cell ratio (T = 0). The data demonstrate that leukemia growth is significantly reduced is the absence of SerpinB2 expression (Figure 4D). We next performed limiting dilution transplantation experiments to determine the LSC frequency in the absence of SerpinB2. Those studies revealed that the LSC frequency in SerpinB2 knockout leukemia was reduced when compared to that of wild-type leukemia (Figures 4E and 4F). Since loss of SerpinB2 may also generally impair the function of normal hematopoietic cells, we also performed control experiments in which naive cells (i.e., nonleukemic) from wild-type versus SerpinB2−/− donors were evaluated by competitive repopulation. As shown in Figure S4, no significant changes in hematopoietic lineages, engraftment, or LSK cell frequency were evident for normal SerpinB2−/− cells, thereby further supporting a leukemia-specific function for this gene. As complete loss of SerpinB2 may represent too severe of a perturbation to evaluate its role in leukemia, the phenotype was validated using two independent shRNAs to suppress but not completely eliminate SerpinB2 expression (Figure S4). The results were virtually identical to the data obtained using SerpinB2−/− cells. Taken together, the findings above demonstrate that the role of SerpinB2 is specific to leukemic populations and that the gene plays a previously unrecognized role in growth of LSCs in vivo. To further explore the biology underlying SerpinB2-related phenotype, we performed a series of additional experiments. First, to examine progenitor activity, we analyzed the in vitro colony-forming ability of leukemia cells with or without SerpinB2 expression. Primary wild-type or SerpinB2 null leukemia cells were purified by flow cytometric cell sorting and seeded in methylcellulose cultures at varying cell doses. After 7 days of culture, colonies composed of > 50 cells were scored as colony-forming units (CFUs). As shown in Figure 4G, the colony-forming potential of SerpinB2−/− leukemia cells was significantly reduced compared to wild-type controls. Next, as previous reports have suggested an antiapoptotic role of SerpinB2 expression (Antalis et al., 1998Antalis T.M. La Linn M. Donnan K. Mateo L. Gardner J. Dickinson J.L. Buttigieg K.

As shown in Figure 4H, loss of SerpinB2 expression leads to an increase in Annexin V-positive cells compared to wild-type controls. Finally, cell cycle analysis showed no significant difference between wild-type and SerpinB2 KO leukemia cells (Figure 4I), indicating that the increased frequency of apoptotic cells was not related to overt changes in proliferative capacity. Taken together, these data suggest that SerpinB2 mediates an interaction with the in vivo microenvironment that promotes survival of leukemic stem and progenitor cells. Given that specific targeting of individual CRGs resulted in inhibition of leukemic cell growth, we reasoned that simultaneous suppression of multiple CRGs could be an effective means of approaching antileukemia therapy. To test this concept using pharmacological agents we utilized the Broad Institute’s Connectivity Map (CMAP) database (Lamb, 2007Lamb J. The Connectivity Map: a new tool for biomedical research.Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2029962825,"Most of the studies of microbial processes in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill focused on the deep water plume, and not on the surface communities. The effects of the crude oil and the application of dispersants on the coastal microbial food web in the northern Gulf of Mexico have not been well characterized even though these regions support much of the fisheries production in the Gulf. A mesocosm experiment was carried out to determine how the microbial community off the coast of Alabama may have responded to the influx of surface oil and dispersants. While the addition of glucose or oil alone resulted in an increase in the biomass of ciliates, suggesting transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels was likely; a different effect was seen in the presence of dispersant. The addition of dispersant or dispersed oil resulted in an increase in the biomass of heterotrophic prokaryotes, but a significant inhibition of ciliates, suggesting a reduction in grazing and decrease in transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels. Similar patterns were observed in two separate experiments with different starting nutrient regimes and microbial communities suggesting that the addition of dispersant and dispersed oil to the northern Gulf of Mexico waters in 2010 may have reduced the flow of carbon to higher trophic levels, leading to a decrease in the production of zooplankton and fish on the Alabama shelf."
https://openalex.org/W2038514844,"The heterotrimeric laminins are a defining component of basement membranes and essential for tissue formation and function in all animals. The three short arms of the cross-shaped laminin molecule are composed of one chain each and their tips mediate the formation of a polymeric network. The structural basis for laminin polymerisation is unknown. We have determined crystal structures of the short-arm tips of the mouse laminin β1 and γ1 chains, which are grossly similar to the previously determined structure of the corresponding α5 chain region. The short-arm tips consist of a laminin N-terminal (LN) domain that is attached like the head of a flower to a rod-like stem formed by tandem laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LE) domains. The LN domain is a β-sandwich with elaborate loop regions that differ between chains. The γ1 LN domain uniquely contains a calcium binding site. The LE domains have little regular structure and are stabilised by cysteines that are disulphide-linked 1–3, 2–4, 5–6 and 7–8 in all chains. The LN surface is not conserved across the α, β and γ chains, but within each chain subfamily there is a striking concentration of conserved residues on one face of the β-sandwich, while the opposite face invariably is shielded by glycans. We propose that the extensive conserved patches on the β and γ LN domains mediate the binding of these two chains to each other, and that the α chain LN domain subsequently binds to the composite β-γ surface. Mutations in the laminin β2 LN domain causing Pierson syndrome are likely to impair the folding of the β2 chain or its ability to form network interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2064445525,"To accommodate the large cells following zygote formation, early blastomeres employ modified cell divisions. Karyomeres are one such modification, mitotic intermediates wherein individual chromatin masses are surrounded by nuclear envelope; the karyomeres then fuse to form a single mononucleus. We identified brambleberry, a maternal-effect zebrafish mutant that disrupts karyomere fusion, resulting in formation of multiple micronuclei. As karyomeres form, Brambleberry protein localizes to the nuclear envelope, with prominent puncta evident near karyomere-karyomere interfaces corresponding to membrane fusion sites. brambleberry corresponds to an unannotated gene with similarity to Kar5p, a protein that participates in nuclear fusion in yeast. We also demonstrate that Brambleberry is required for pronuclear fusion following fertilization in zebrafish. Our studies provide insight into the machinery required for karyomere fusion and suggest that specialized proteins are necessary for proper nuclear division in large dividing blastomeres."

Down-regulated host genes included genes encoding antimicrobial peptides, namely three gloverin isoforms and an attacin, indicating that the viral infection actively repressed the expression of a portion of the host immune gene repertoire. Another interesting group of down-regulated host genes included genes encoding two juvenile hormone binding proteins and a hexamerin, all of which are involved in juvenile hormone regulation. The expression of these genes was enhanced by the topical application of Juvenile Hormone III (JHIII) in the insects challenged with heat-inactivated AcMNPV. However, infection with the active virus strongly suppresses the expression of these three genes, regardless of the absence or presence of JHIII.Using RNA-seq, we have identified groups of immune-regulated and juvenile hormone-regulated genes that are suppressed by infection with active AcMNPV. This information and further studies on the regulation of host gene expression by AcMNPV will provide the tools needed to enhance the utility of the virus as an effective protein expression system and as an insecticide."

Whereas GABPα is encoded by a single Gabpa gene, GABPβ exists in three different isoforms: GABPβ1L and GABPβ1S are splice variants from the Gabpb1 gene, and GABPβ2 is produced from the Gabpb2 gene (de la Brousse et al., 1994de la Brousse F.C.

All GABPβ isoforms contain an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain that mediates interactions with GABPα (Figure 1A). However, only GABPβ1L and GABPβ2 have highly homologous C-terminal leucine-zipper domains that mediate their homodimerization or heterodimerization (de la Brousse et al., 1994de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Molecular and genetic characterization of GABP beta.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These dimerizing GABPβ isoforms thus contribute to assembly of GABPα2β2 tetramer, when two or more consensus GABPα binding motifs are adjacent or brought into proximity via chromatin looping (Batchelor et al., 1998Batchelor A.H.

On the other hand, GABPβ1L and GABPβ1S share identical 332 amino acids in the N termini, but GABPβ1S does not contain the C-terminal leucine-zipper structure. Thus, GABPβ1S cannot form dimers with other GABPβ isoforms and does not contribute to tetramer assembly. It has been demonstrated that the GABP complex can interface with other transcription factors or cofactors via either the GABPα or GABPβ subunit. GABPα can physically interact with Sp1, HNF4a, and FOXA2 transcription factors or recruit the CBP/p300 coactivator (Bush et al., 2003Bush T.S. St Coeur M. Resendes K.K. Rosmarin A.G.

The novel coactivator C1 (HCF) coordinates multiprotein enhancer formation and mediates transcription activation by GABP.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 683-690Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All these GABPα- or GABPβ-interacting factors appear to act through the GABP complex, rather than functioning in lieu of the β or α subunit, respectively. Because GABPα is the sole DNA binding subunit, inactivation of GABPα disrupts the activity of the entire GABP complex and abrogates its interaction with other cooperating factors, accounting for early embryonic lethality in Gabpa-targeted animals (Ristevski et al., 2004Ristevski S. O'Leary D.A. Thornell A.P. Owen M.J. Kola I. Hertzog P.J. The ETS transcription factor GABPalpha is essential for early embryogenesis.Mol. Cell.

On the other hand, the GABPβ subunit has three coexpressed isoforms. Germline targeting of GABPβ1L or GABPβ2 individually did not cause apparent abnormalities in embryogenesis or lymphoid lineage development (Jing et al., 2008Jing X. Zhao D.M. Waldschmidt T.J.

Biol. 2008; 28: 4300-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that GABPβ isoforms have partly redundant functions and may confer fine-tuned regulatory activities of the GABP complex. Coupled with functional and transcriptomic analyses of GABPα-deficient HSCs, we previously mapped genome-wide GABPα occupancy and constructed a GABP-controlled gene regulatory module, which includes key molecules regulating HSC survival, quiescence, and self-renewal (Yu et al., 2011Yu S. Cui K. Jothi R. Zhao D.M. Jing X. Zhao K. Xue H.H. GABP controls a critical transcription regulatory module that is essential for maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.Blood. 2011; 117: 2166-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Due to a dominant role of GABPα in HSC survival, it was not feasible to use GABPα-targeted animals to assess other functional requirements of the GABP complex in HSCs inferred from GABP target genes. By crossing GABPβ1L- or GABPβ2-targeted strains, we have obtained double deficient (dKO) animals in which the capacity of GABPα2β2 tetramer formation is completely abrogated. Loss of the tetramer-forming GABPβ isoforms impaired HSC self-renewal and repopulation capacity, specifically perturbing survival and quiescence of HSCs without affecting more differentiated blood cells. We further demonstrated that the tetramer-forming GABPβ isoforms critically regulated self-renewal of LSCs in a CML model and that targeting these proteins synergized with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in treating CML. These data suggest that GABPα2β2 tetramer is an HSC-specific regulator and may be explored as a therapeutic target for eradication of LSCs. We have previously mapped genome-wide GABP occupancy in HSCs by ChIP-Seq and found that more than 85% of GABP binding locations contained the core consensus motif “(a/c)GGAA(g/a)” (Yu et al., 2011Yu S. Cui K. Jothi R. Zhao D.M. Jing X. Zhao K. Xue H.H. GABP controls a critical transcription regulatory module that is essential for maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.Blood. 2011; 117: 2166-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Figure S1 available online). Further motif analysis revealed that 64% of these GABP binding locations contained two or more GABP motifs (Figure 1B). In our previous studies, genes harboring GABP binding within 2 kb of their transcription initiation sites (TISs) were defined as “GABP-bound genes,” and among these, genes that are positively regulated by GABP were defined as “GABP-activated genes” (Yu et al., 2011Yu S. Cui K. Jothi R. Zhao D.M. Jing X. Zhao K. Xue H.H. GABP controls a critical transcription regulatory module that is essential for maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.Blood. 2011; 117: 2166-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We found that approximately three-fourths of both sets of genes harbored two or more GABP motifs (Figure 1C). It has been shown that GABPα and GABPβ subunits spontaneously form αβ heterodimers, but require the presence of at least two GABP motifs in DNA to assemble into GABPα2β2 tetramers (Chinenov et al., 2000Chinenov Y. Henzl M. Martin M.E. The alpha and beta subunits of the GA-binding protein form a stable heterodimer in solution. Revised model of heterotetrameric complex assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7749-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, ChIP-Seq with GABPα identifies all target genes for the GABP complex, and the number of GABP motifs in each target determines whether an αβ dimer of an α2β2 tetramer is assembled. Our motif analysis thus suggests that regulation of most if not all of the GABP target genes may involve assembly of GABPα2β2 tetramers. For the remaining one-fourth of GABP target genes that contain only one GABP motif within 2 kb of their TISs, tetramer formation may still occur when distal GABP motifs are brought into close proximity through chromatin looping. To specifically address a requirement of GABPα2β2 tetramer-forming capacity for regulating HSCs, we crossed germline GABPβ1L- and GABPβ2-targeted mice to obtain dKO animals in which tetramer assembly is abrogated. Inactivation of GABPβ1L or GABPβ2 alone did not compromise normal embryogenesis or lymphopoiesis (Jing et al., 2008Jing X. Zhao D.M. Waldschmidt T.J. Xue H.H. GABPbeta2 is dispensible for normal lymphocyte development but moderately affects B cell responses.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24326-24333Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar; Xue et al., 2008Xue H.H. Jing X. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Zhao D.M. Haring J.S. Yang B. Liu C. Bishop G.A. Harty J.T. Leonard W.J. Targeting the GA binding protein beta1L isoform does not perturb lymphocyte development and function.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4300-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the dKO mice remained viable, suggesting that targeting the tetramer-forming GABPβ isoforms did not drastically disrupt the activity of GABP complex. In contrast to massive cell death in HSCs upon induced inactivation of GABPα, the GABPβ1L/β2-targeted animals allowed detailed functional characterization of the GABP complex in regulating HSCs. By quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed that all GABP subunits/isoforms were abundantly expressed in bone marrow (BM) Lin−Sca1+c-Kit+Flt3− cells (Flt3− LSKs) that contained both long-term and short-term HSCs (LT- and ST-HSCs; Figure 1D). Similarly, all these transcripts were detected in more differentiated progenitors including Lin−Sca1+c-Kit+Flt3+ multipotential progenitors (MPPs), Lin−Sca1−c-Kit+ myeloid progenitors (MPs), and mature blood lineage cells, including BM Gr.1+ granulocytes, splenic CD3+ T cells, and B220+ B cells (Figure 1D). The dKO mice did not exhibit apparent defects in HSCs by the age of 6 weeks. When observed at 8 weeks or older, GABPβ1L−/− and dKO mice showed approximately 15% and 25% reductions in total BM cells, respectively (Table S1), and exhibited more pronounced decreases in LSK frequency and absolute counts (Figures 2A and 2B ). Flt3 and CD34-based immunophenotypic analysis of LSKs indicates that deficiency in GABPβ1L and/or GABPβ2 did not alter differentiation of LT-HSCs (CD34−Flt3− LSKs) to ST-HSCs (CD34+Flt3− LSKs) and MPPs (Figure 2C), whereas LT-HSCs were decreased in absolute counts in GABPβ1L−/− and dKO mice (Figure 2D). Similarly, LT-HSCs defined by SLAM family receptors (CD150+CD48− LSKs) were diminished in frequency in dKO Lin− BM cells (Figure S2A). On the other hand, the frequencies of SLAM LT-HSCs within the LSK subset were similar between dKO and control animals, further corroborating that HSC differentiation was not detectably affected based on SLAM markers (Figure S2B). Taken together, these observations indicate that tetramer-forming GABPβ isoforms have critical roles in maintaining a pool of HSCs and MPPs under a steady state without affecting HSC differentiation. In contrast to decreased LSK frequency in whole BM cells, the frequency of MPs (Figure 2A) and Lin−IL-7Rα+c-KitmedSca1med common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs, Figure S3A) was similar among animals of all genotypes (Table S1). Further differentiation of MPs in the BM, T cell development in the thymus, and B cell development in the BM was not detectably perturbed in either single knockout or dKO strains (Figures S3B–S3D). Moderate decreases in cell counts of MPs and some differentiated cells were observed in dKO mice (Table S1), which were likely secondary to diminished HSC and MPP pools. These data further support that tetramer-forming GABPβ isoforms are not required for HSC differentiation, but rather have a more specific role in HSC maintenance. In addition to immunophenotypic analysis, we measured functional HSCs by limiting dilution assays, which detected HSCs at >10-fold lower frequency in dKO mice than in controls (Figure 3A), indicating more severely impaired HSC functionality caused by GABPβ1L/β2 deficiency. We next performed a competitive repopulation assay by transplanting the test (CD45.2+) and competitor (CD45.1+) BM cells at an LSK ratio of 1:1 (Figure S4A). After ≥10 weeks, we found that control and GABPβ2−/− BM cells contributed similarly to the way the competitors did to peripheral blood nucleated cells (PBCs). However, GABPβ1L−/− and dKO BM cells were much less competitive, with dKO exhibiting the most diminished contribution (Figures 3B and 3C). The same trends were evident in thymocytes, splenic T and B cells, BM B cells, and granulocytes (Figures S4B–S4F). Importantly, GABPβ1L−/−-derived LSKs in recipient BM were greatly diminished, and dKO-derived LSKs were further reduced (Figures 3D and 3E), thus accounting for their decreased contributions to blood lineage reconstitution. We further measured HSC self-renewal by performing serial transplantations using sort-purified LSKs lacking GABPβ1L and/or β2. Whereas BM cells from each genotype can reconstitute all blood lineages both short- and long-term (8 weeks and ≥16 weeks, respectively), the contribution from GABPβ1L−/−, especially dKO LSKs, was moderately decreased in the primary recipients (Figure 3F). In secondary recipients, however, the multilineage contribution from GABPβ1L−/− and dKO LSKs was more markedly reduced, with dKO cells constituting <10% of blood nucleated cells (Figure 3F). Together, these results together revealed a critical requirement for tetramer-forming GABPβ isoforms in HSC self-renewal and blood lineage reconstitution capacity. We next investigated the underlying mechanisms accounting for the specific regulation of HSC activity by the tetramer-forming GABPβ isoforms. Our data indicate that, compared with GABPβ2, GABPβ1L exhibited a predominant role in HSC self-renewal and repopulation capacity. HSCs lacking both factors exhibited more severe defects than those deficient in GABPβ1L alone. This is analogous to the roles of Myc and Foxo transcription factors in HSCs. Whereas N-Myc is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, c-Myc deletion specifically impaired HSC differentiation without affecting HSC self-renewal (Wilson et al., 2004Wilson A. Murphy M.J. Oskarsson T. Kaloulis K. Bettess M.D. Oser G.M. Pasche A.C. Knabenhans C. Macdonald H.R. Trumpp A. c-Myc controls the balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2747-2763Crossref Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Targeting both N-Myc and c-Myc revealed an unexpected requirement of Myc proteins in maintaining HSC survival and proliferation (Laurenti et al., 2008Laurenti E. Varnum-Finney B. Wilson A. Ferrero I. Blanco-Bose W.E. Ehninger A. Knoepfler P.S. Cheng P.F. MacDonald H.R.

Among the Foxo transcription factors, Foxo3a appeared to have a more predominant effect, but triple deletion of Foxo1/3a/4 was necessary to uncover their roles in coping with oxidative stress in HSCs (Miyamoto et al., 2007Miyamoto K. Araki K.Y. Naka K. Arai F. Takubo K. Yamazaki S. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto T. Ito K.

Sears C. et al.FoxOs are critical mediators of hematopoietic stem cell resistance to physiologic oxidative stress.Cell. 2007; 128: 325-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). For the GABP complex, it is thus necessary to target both GABPβ1L and GABPβ2 to reveal the complete spectrum of regulatory activity of the GABPα2β2 tetramer in HSCs. We therefore focused on dKO mice in the following analyses. Consistent with an absolute requirement of GABPα in HSC survival (Yu et al., 2011Yu S. Cui K. Jothi R. Zhao D.M. Jing X. Zhao K. Xue H.H. GABP controls a critical transcription regulatory module that is essential for maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.Blood. 2011; 117: 2166-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the frequencies of AnnexinV+7-AAD− apoptotic cells in the LT-HSC pool and in other LSK subsets were increased approximately 3- to 4-fold in dKO mice (Figures 4A and 4B ), demonstrating a phenocopy between GABPα and GABPβ1L/β2 deficiencies. In contrast, the frequencies of apoptotic cells were not increased in dKO BM Gr.1+ cells or splenic T and B cells (Figure 4C), supporting a specific role of the tetramer-forming GABPβ isoforms in survival of HSCs and progenitor cells. Our previously defined GABP-controlled gene regulatory module in HSCs contained 2,224 GABP-activated direct target genes (Figure S1) (Yu et al., 2011Yu S. Cui K. Jothi R. Zhao D.M. Jing X. Zhao K.

GABP controls a critical transcription regulatory module that is essential for maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.Blood. 2011; 117: 2166-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These included prosurvival Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1) and transcription factors Zfx and Etv6, all of which are known to critically regulate HSC survival (Galan-Caridad et al., 2007Galan-Caridad J.M.

In sorted LT-/ST-HSCs, we observed consistent decreases in these transcripts in dKO mice, ranging from 15% to 34% (Table 1). In contrast, consistent expression decreases were only observed for Bcl-2 in dKO BM Gr.1+ cells, among all the transcripts tested in BM Gr.1+ cells and splenic T and B cells (Table 1). These observations thus lend molecular support to a specific role for GABPβ1L/β2 isoforms in HSC survival.Table 1Expression of GABP Target Genes in HSCs, Progenitors, and Differentiated Blood Cells Lacking GABPβ1L/GABPβ2Gene SymbolFlt3− LSKs (LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs)MPPsMyeloid ProgenitorsBM GranulocytesSplenic T CellsSplenic B CellsHSC survivalBcl20.66 ± 0.20∗∗∗0.74 ± 0.17∗∗1.32 ± 0.31∗0.75 ± 0.18∗1.88 ± 0.71∗1.25 ± 0.95N.S.Bcl2l10.85 ± 0.24∗0.65 ± 0.07∗∗∗0.91 ± 0.37N.S.1.13 ± 0.41N.S.0.92 ± 0.28N.S.1.30 ± 0.32N.S.Mcl10.76 ± 0.27∗0.87 ± 0.19N.S.0.95 ± 0.14N.S.1.36 ± 0.29∗1.01 ± 0.21N.S.0.88 ± 0.26N.S.Zfx0.72 ± 0.17∗∗0."
https://openalex.org/W1991600236,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded protein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is essential for EBV-mediated B cell transformation and plays a critical role in the development of post-transplant B cell lymphomas. LMP1 also contributes to the exacerbation of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LMP1 is a functional mimic of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily member CD40, and relies on TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) adaptor proteins to mediate signaling. However, LMP1 activation signals to the B cell are amplified and sustained compared to CD40 signals. We previously demonstrated that LMP1 and CD40 use TRAF molecules differently. Although associating with CD40 and LMP1 via separate mechanisms, TRAF6 plays a significant role in signal transduction by both. It is unknown whether TRAF6 mediates CD40 versus LMP1 functions via distinct or shared pathways. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TRAF6 uses the kinase TAK1 to trigger important signaling pathways following both CD40 and LMP1 stimulation. We determined that TAK1 was required for JNK activation and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production mediated by CD40 and LMP1, in both mouse and human B cells. Additionally, TRAF3 negatively regulated TRAF6-dependent, CD40-mediated TAK1 activation by limiting TRAF6 recruitment. This mode of regulation was not observed for LMP1 and may contribute to the dysregulation of LMP1 compared to CD40 signals."
https://openalex.org/W1973103395,"Glycogen-depleting exercise can lead to supercompensation of muscle glycogen stores, but the biochemical mechanisms of this phenomenon are still not completely understood.Using chronic low-frequency stimulation (CLFS) as an exercise model, the tibialis anterior muscle of rabbits was stimulated for either 1 or 24 hours, inducing a reduction in glycogen of 90% and 50% respectively. Glycogen recovery was subsequently monitored during 24 hours of rest.In muscles stimulated for 1 hour, glycogen recovered basal levels during the rest period. However, in those stimulated for 24 hours, glycogen was supercompensated and its levels remained 50% higher than basal levels after 6 hours of rest, although the newly synthesized glycogen had fewer branches. This increase in glycogen correlated with an increase in hexokinase-2 expression and activity, a reduction in the glycogen phosphorylase activity ratio and an increase in the glycogen synthase activity ratio, due to dephosphorylation of site 3a, even in the presence of elevated glycogen stores. During supercompensation there was also an increase in 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, correlating with a stable reduction in ATP and total purine nucleotide levels.Glycogen supercompensation requires a coordinated chain of events at two levels in the context of decreased cell energy balance: First, an increase in the glucose phosphorylation capacity of the muscle and secondly, control of the enzymes directly involved in the synthesis and degradation of the glycogen molecule. However, supercompensated glycogen has fewer branches."

If participants identify target letters or auditory tones while viewing a series of briefly presented natural and urban scenes, they demonstrate effective scene recognition only when a target, but not a behaviorally irrelevant distractor, appears together with the scene. Here, we show that individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), who witnessed the red sludge disaster in Hungary, show the opposite pattern of performance: enhanced recognition of scenes presented together with distractors and deficient recognition of scenes presented with targets. The recognition of trauma-related and neutral scenes was not different in individuals with PTSD. We found a positive correlation between memory for scenes presented with auditory distractors and re-experiencing symptoms (memory intrusions and flashbacks). These results suggest that abnormal encoding of visual scenes at behaviorally irrelevant events might be associated with intrusive experiences by disrupting the flow of time."
https://openalex.org/W2017893454,"Like humans, birds that exhibit vocal learning have relatively delayed telencephalon maturation, resulting in a disproportionately smaller brain prenatally but enlarged telencephalon in adulthood relative to vocal non-learning birds. To determine if this size difference results from evolutionary changes in cell-autonomous or cell-interdependent developmental processes, we transplanted telencephala from zebra finch donors (a vocal-learning species) into Japanese quail hosts (a vocal non-learning species) during the early neural tube stage (day 2 of incubation), and harvested the chimeras at later embryonic stages (between 9-12 days of incubation). The donor and host tissues fused well with each other, with known major fiber pathways connecting the zebra finch and quail parts of the brain. However, the overall sizes of chimeric finch telencephala were larger than non-transplanted finch telencephala at the same developmental stages, even though the proportional sizes of telencephalic subregions and fiber tracts were similar to normal finches. There were no significant changes in the size of chimeric quail host midbrains, even though they were innervated by the physically smaller zebra finch brain, including the smaller retinae of the finch eyes. Chimeric zebra finch telencephala had a decreased cell density relative to normal finches. However, cell nucleus size differences between each species were maintained as in normal birds. These results suggest that telencephalic size development is partially cell-interdependent, and that the mechanisms controlling the size of different brain regions may be functionally independent."
https://openalex.org/W1999455901,"Oscillating neuronal circuits, known as central pattern generators (CPGs), are responsible for generating rhythmic behaviours such as walking, breathing and chewing. The CPG model alone however does not account for the ability of animals to adapt their future behaviour to changes in the sensory environment that signal reward. Here, using multi-electrode array (MEA) recording in an established experimental model of centrally generated rhythmic behaviour we show that the feeding CPG of Lymnaea stagnalis is itself associated with another, and hitherto unidentified, oscillating neuronal population. This extra-CPG oscillator is characterised by high population-wide activity alternating with population-wide quiescence. During the quiescent periods the CPG is refractory to activation by food-associated stimuli. Furthermore, the duration of the refractory period predicts the timing of the next activation of the CPG, which may be minutes into the future. Rewarding food stimuli and dopamine accelerate the frequency of the extra-CPG oscillator and reduce the duration of its quiescent periods. These findings indicate that dopamine adapts future feeding behaviour to the availability of food by significantly reducing the refractory period of the brain's feeding circuitry."
