https://openalex.org/W2807828126,"Nocturnal refuge As the human population grows, there are fewer places for animals to live out their lives independently of our influence. Given our mostly diurnal tendencies, one domain that remains less affected by humans is the night. Gaynor et al. found that across the globe and across mammalian species—from deer to coyotes and from tigers to wild boar—animals are becoming more nocturnal (see the Perspective by Benítez-López). Human activities of all kinds, including nonlethal pastimes such as hiking, seem to drive animals to make use of hours when we are not around. Such changes may provide some relief, but they may also have ecosystem-level consequences. Science , this issue p. 1232 ; see also p. 1185"

Recent work has shown that neural networks excel at this task when provided with large, labeled datasets. However, removing the reliance on human labeling remains an important open problem. To this end, we introduce the Generative Query Network (GQN), a framework within which machines learn to represent scenes using only their own sensors. The GQN takes as input images of a scene taken from different viewpoints, constructs an internal representation, and uses this representation to predict the appearance of that scene from previously unobserved viewpoints. The GQN demonstrates representation learning without human labels or domain knowledge, paving the way toward machines that autonomously learn to understand the world around them."
https://openalex.org/W2808042204,Ultrafast isomerization of retinal is the primary step in photoresponsive biological functions including vision in humans and ion transport across bacterial membranes. We used an x-ray laser to study the subpicosecond structural dynamics of retinal isomerization in the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. A series of structural snapshots with near-atomic spatial resolution and temporal resolution in the femtosecond regime show how the excited all-trans retinal samples conformational states within the protein binding pocket before passing through a twisted geometry and emerging in the 13-cis conformation. Our findings suggest ultrafast collective motions of aspartic acid residues and functional water molecules in the proximity of the retinal Schiff base as a key facet of this stereoselective and efficient photochemical reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2808625130,"Cooler electrons for transistors The operating power of field-effect transistors is constrained in part by the minimum change in voltage needed to change the current output. This subthreshold swing (SS) limit is caused by hotter electrons from a thermal electron source leaking over the potential of the gate electrode. Qiu et al. show that graphene can act as a Dirac source that creates a narrower distribution of electron energies. When coupled to a carbon nanotube channel, the decrease in SS would allow the supply voltage to be decreased from 0.7 to 0.5 volts. Science , this issue p. 387"

Some organisms have developed adaptations to take advantage of longer-wavelength photons. Nürnberg et al. studied photosystem complexes from cyanobacteria grown in the presence of far-red light. The authors identified the primary donor chlorophyll as one of a few chlorophyll molecules in the far-red light–adapted enzymes that were chemically altered to shift their absorption spectrum. Kinetic measurements demonstrated that far-red light is capable of directly driving water oxidation, despite having less energy than the red light used by most photosynthetic organisms.

However, most of Earth's surface is under the oceans, where placing seismometers is difficult. Marra et al. now find that ordinary submarine telecommunication cables can be used to detect earthquakes. Small strain changes associated with the passage of seismic waves were detected with laser light sent through in-use fiber optic cables by ultrastable lasers. This strategy could turn intercontinental fiber optic cables into ocean-bottom strain sensors, dramatically improving our ability to record earthquakes. Science , this issue p. 486"

In vivo high-throughput chromatin accessibility techniques, transgenic assays, and genome editing revealed several novel gonadal regulatory elements in the 2-megabase gene desert upstream of Sox9 Although others are redundant, enhancer 13 (Enh13), a 557-base pair element located 565 kilobases 5' from the transcriptional start site, is essential to initiate mouse testis development; its deletion results in XY females with Sox9 transcript levels equivalent to those in XX gonads. Our data are consistent with the time-sensitive activity of SRY and indicate a strict order of enhancer usage. Enh13 is conserved and embedded within a 32.5-kilobase region whose deletion in humans is associated with XY sex reversal, suggesting that it is also critical in humans."

How does the brain store and define the identity of a specific memory when two memories interact and are encoded in a shared engram? Abdou et al. used optogenetic reactivation coupled with manipulations of long-term potentiation to analyze engrams that share neurons in the lateral amygdala (see the Perspective by Ramirez). Synapse-specific plasticity guaranteed the storage and the identity of individual memories in a shared engram. Moreover, synaptic plasticity between specific engram assemblies was necessary and sufficient for memory engram formation. Science , this issue p. 1227 ; see also p. 1182"

We have observed a transient source in the western nucleus of the merging galaxy pair Arp 299 that radiated >1.5x10^52 erg in the infrared and radio, but was not luminous at optical or X-ray wavelengths. We interpret this as a TDE with much of its emission re-radiated at infrared wavelengths by dust. Efficient reprocessing by dense gas and dust may explain the difference between theoretical predictions and observed luminosities of TDEs. The radio observations resolve an expanding and decelerating jet, probing the jet formation and evolution around a SMBH."
https://openalex.org/W2808416012,"In this paper, we propose a sentiment-based approach to investigate the temporal and spatiotemporal effects on tourists’ emotions when visiting a city’s tourist destinations. Our approach consists of four steps: data collection and preprocessing from social media; visitor origin identification; visit sentiment identification; and temporal and spatiotemporal analysis. The temporal and spatiotemporal dimensions include day of the year, season of the year, day of the week, location sentiment progression, enjoyment measure, and multi-location sentiment progression. We apply this approach to the city of Chicago using over eight million tweets. Results show that seasonal weather, as well as special days and activities like concerts, impact tourists’ emotions. In addition, our analysis suggests that tourists experience greater levels of enjoyment in places such as observatories rather than zoos. Finally, we find that local and international visitors tend to convey negative sentiment when visiting more than one attraction in a day whereas the opposite holds for out of state visitors."

During the dry winter monsoon, the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast pollution haze, but their fate during the wet summer monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the summer monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which contaminants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earth's surface. However, some pollutants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2807926843,"Modeling memory differentiation in T cells The balance between effector and central memory T cells shifts toward the latter as the number of T cells participating in immune responses increases. Polonsky et al. determined the mechanisms by which T cell quorum sensing affects memory differentiation by using live-cell imaging to track cell proliferation and differentiation. They found that the rate of memory CD4 + T cell differentiation is determined by cell number. This rate substantially increases above a threshold number of locally interacting cells. Mathematical modeling suggests that the number of initially seeded cells and the number of cell divisions are not critical. Instead, the instantaneous number of interacting cells continuously modulates the differentiation rate. This is partly fueled by increased sensitivity to the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6, independent of any effects on cell proliferation. Science , this issue p. eaaj1853"

Normally, this ratio is improved by creating resonators with higher quality factors that “ring” for longer times. Taking a cue from the approaches used in atomic force microscopy, Roy et al. show that if the thermomechanical noise of the resonator is well defined, the signal-to-noise ratio of the frequency shift can improve by lowering the quality factor. They used this approach to demonstrate temperature sensing with a double-clamped silicon beam resonator, which performed better at ambient pressures than in a vacuum.

https://openalex.org/W2808476706,"This paper is a response to the growing reference to archaeological evidence by linguists and geneticists interested in the spread of early farmers and pastoralists in southern Africa. It presents two databases. The first contains the archaeological evidence for pastoralism and farming in southern Africa, for the period 550 BC to AD 1050. This is the first time that the seven different types of archaeological evidence that have traditionally been used to identify both spread events are presented together at this scale. This was stimulated by our interest in investigating the antiquity of an early ‘Iron Age package’ relative to the spread of single archaeological traits. The analysis shows that the package appears approximately 700 years after sites containing pottery, cattle and sheep, without agriculture, appear in the drier parts of the sub-continent. It post-dates the appearance of earlier sites with pottery associated with farmers, metal-working and cultivation in the eastern half of the sub-continent. While poor preservation undoubtedly explains the absence of some parts of the package, the analysis suggests that other explanations should be considered. The second database is a quantitative, spatial study of archaeological publications on southern African farming and pastoralism for the period 1950 to 2016, covering the same geographical area and archaeological timeframe. This is presented as a proxy for research-intensive areas in attempt to show the gaps in archaeological fieldwork and knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2808067178,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multifactorial disease in which dysfunction of protease–antiprotease balance plays a key role. The current CF therapy relies on dornase α, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics and does not address the high neutrophil elastase (NE) activity observed in the lung and sputum of CF patients. Our hypothesis is that variants of heparin, which potently inhibit NE but are not anticoagulant, would help restore the protease–antiprotease balance in CF. To realize this concept, we studied molecular principles governing the effectiveness of different heparins, especially 2-O,3-O-desulfated heparin (ODSH), in the presence of sputum components and therapeutic agents. Using sputa from CF patients and an NE activity assay, we found that heparins are ineffective if used in the absence of dornase. This is true even when mucolytics, such as DTT or N-acetylcysteine, were used. Computational modeling suggested that ODSH and DNA compete for binding to an overlapping allosteric site on NE, which reduces the anti-NE potential of ODSH. NE inhibition of both DNA and ODSH is chain length–dependent, but ODSH chains exhibit higher potency per unit residue length. Likewise, ODSH chains exhibit higher NE inhibition potential compared with DNA chains in the presence of saline. These studies suggest fundamental differences in DNA and ODSH recognition and inhibition of NE despite engaging overlapping sites and offer unique insights into molecular principles that could be used in developing antiprotease agents in the presence of current treatments, such as dornase and hypertonic saline.

The CF therapy currently recommended by the United States Cystic Fibrosis Foundation includes inhaled dornase α to reduce sputum viscosity, antibiotics to kill bacteria, inhaled 7% saline to enhance sputum hydration, and immunomodulatory therapies (ibuprofen and azithromycin) to decrease lung injury (1.Ramsey B.W.

Other agents recommended for use include ivacaftor for patients with class 3 CFTR mutations and Orkambi for patients homozygous for phe508del to rescue CFTR function (2.Paranjape S.M.

It is instructive to note that for resolving cystic fibrosis, no agent has been approved for clinical use to inhibit neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), a major cause of airway injury in CF. Innate immunity in CF is mediated to a large extent by polymorphonuclear neutrophils. These are attracted to sites of bacterial infection in CF by IL-8 (CXCL8) and, following activation, release inflammatory mediators including NSPs, such as elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G, and release DNA and reactive oxygen species (3.Twigg M.S. Brockbank S. Lowry P. FitzGerald S.P. Taggart C. Weldon S. The role of serine proteases and antiproteases in the cystic fibrosis lung.Mediators Inflamm. 2015; 2015 (26185359): 293053Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, in the CF airway milieu, neutrophils release extracellular traps (NETs) (4.Gray R.D. McCullagh B.N. McCray P.B. NETs and CF lung disease: current status and future prospects.Antibiotics. 2015; 4 (27025615): 62-7510.3390/antibiotics4010062Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a primary source of extracellular DNA polymers and NE in the CF airway. The load of NE in the airway overwhelms the antiprotease activities provided by α1-proteinase inhibitor and serine leukoprotease inhibitor. An attractive, yet unrealized, pathway to control lung injury in CF is re-establishment of protease–antiprotease balance through inhibition of NE (5.Voynow J.A. Fischer B.M. Zheng S. Proteases and cystic fibrosis.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40 (18395488): 1238-124510.1016/j.biocel.2008.03.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). NE activates other proteases, such as matrix metalloprotease-9, degrades antiproteases, such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases, up-regulates neutrophilic chemokines, such as IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor α, and thereby augments inflammation (6.Taggart C.C.

Additionally, NE impairs ciliary motility; up-regulates mucin expression and secretion; causes epithelial injury, apoptosis, and senescence; and blocks epithelial repair (5.Voynow J.A. Fischer B.M. Zheng S. Proteases and cystic fibrosis.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40 (18395488): 1238-124510.1016/j.biocel.2008.03.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As such, NE is a well-established biomarker of lung disease progression in patients with CF (7.Sly P.D. Gangell C.L. Chen L. Ware R.S. Ranganathan S. Mott L.S. Murray C.P. Stick S.M. AREST CF InvestigatorsRisk factors for bronchiectasis in children with cystic fibrosis.N. Engl. J.

In addition to potently inhibiting NE (1–20 nm), heparin inhibits cathepsin G, another neutrophil serine protease present in high concentrations in the CF airway (10.Rao N.V. Argyle B. Xu X.

Additionally, heparin has other anti-inflammatory activities, including inhibiting activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products and blocking the release of its ligand, high mobility group box 1; inhibiting binding to L-selectin and P-selectin; and inhibiting NF-κB (10.Rao N.V.

Heparin also binds to pro-inflammatory chemokines, such as IL-8 and IL-6 (10.Rao N.V. Argyle B. Xu X. Reynolds P.R. Walenga J.M. Prechel M. Prestwich G.D. MacArthur R.B. Walters B.B. Hoidal J.R.

However, heparin's high anticoagulant activity may limit its value as a therapy.

To understand the molecular principles of ODSH action in CF-related samples, we studied its inhibition of NE activity in CF sputum. This work shows that NE is not inhibited by ODSH or heparin if only mucolytics are used, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Sputolysin (0.1% DTT), or hypertonic saline. More importantly, this work reveals that either ODSH or heparin inhibits NE in native CF sputum pretreated with dornase. The molecular basis for this favorable combinational outcome involves fundamental mechanistic biochemistry and leads to a putative therapy for treatment of CF that can be of value irrespective of the patient's genetic status. Heparin is a polysulfated polysaccharide that is clinically used as an anti-coagulant and also has potent antiprotease activity against serine proteases, including NE (13.Spencer J.L. Stone P.J. Nugent M.A. New insights into the inhibition of human neutrophil elastase by heparin.Biochemistry. 2006; 45 (16866356): 9104-912010.1021/bi060338rCrossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and cathepsin G, and furthermore, heparin is not degraded by exposure to proteases. However, heparin anticoagulant activity may potentially increase the risk for hemoptysis in CF. Therefore, we evaluated the anti-NE activity of a modified heparin, ODSH, that has minimal anti-coagulant activity. We first determined the potency of ODSH in inhibiting NE by the S1384 hydrolysis assay and measured an IC50 of 13.6 nm (Fig. 1A), which was consistent with its reported antiprotease activity (10.Rao N.V. Argyle B. Xu X. Reynolds P.R. Walenga J.M. Prechel M. Prestwich G.D. MacArthur R.B. Walters B.B. Hoidal J.R. Kennedy T.P. Low anticoagulant heparin targets multiple sites of inflammation, suppresses heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and inhibits interaction of RAGE with its ligands.Am. J. Physiol.

We then solubilized CF sputum with normal saline (1:1, w/v) to test whether ODSH could inhibit NE in the typical airway milieu of CF patients. Unexpectedly, we found that ODSH did not reduce NE activity at all in CF sputum at concentrations as high as 10 μm, which is ∼735-fold higher than its IC50 in pH 7.4 buffer (Fig. 1B). The observation that ODSH did not inhibit NE in solubilized CF sputum suggests that it is not able to effectively bind to NE, perhaps due to competition for binding sites. At least two major anionic polymers, DNA and mucin polymers, are present at high concentrations in CF sputum and potentially bind to and inhibit NE (14.Chernick W.S. Barbero G.J.

For all three agents, appropriate concentration ranges were chosen that matched either pharmacologic concentrations or research reports (8.Sagel S.D. Wagner B.D. Anthony M.M. Emmett P. Zemanick E.T. Sputum biomarkers of inflammation and lung function decline in children with cystic fibrosis.Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Following sputum supernatant preparation, NE activity was measured using the S1384 hydrolysis assay, as described under “Experimental procedures.” Interestingly, Sputolysin as well as DNase-I significantly increased NE activity of treated sputum supernatants (Fig. 2). However, although Sputolysin dose-dependently enhanced NE activity, its effect was much less than the nearly 300% increase in NE activity with DNase-I. We then studied whether ODSH could decrease NE activity, measured using a substrate hydrolysis assay, in mucolytic-pretreated CF sputum. We found that ODSH only inhibited NE activity following DNase-I treatment and had no effect on sputum degraded with NAC or Sputolysin (Fig. 3). These results imply that disulfide bond reduction does not help ODSH to bind to NE. On the contrary, enzymatic degradation of polymeric DNA, to presumably smaller strands, allowed ODSH to bind to NE and reduce its catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the concentration at which ODSH started to inhibit NE in sputum is much higher than in pH 7.4 buffer. A plausible explanation for this is the possibility of competition between ODSH and DNA, both negatively charged polymers, for binding to NE. This explanation is also in line with results with disulfide-reducing agents, which are not expected to significantly reduce electrostatically bound DNA from NE. The evidence that DNase I is needed for ODSH to exhibit its anti-NE activity suggested a critical point. Polymeric DNA chains impeded ODSH from binding to NE, whereas oligomeric DNA sequences appeared to do so less effectively. We then asked whether heparins exhibit chain length–dependent inhibition of NE. Fig. 4 shows NE activity in CF sputum with and without DNase-I pretreatment as well as with and without heparins of different chain lengths (Table S1) at a fixed concentration of 100 μm each. The best inhibitor was found to be unfractionated heparin (UFH; Mr 15,000), which was followed by ODSH (Mr 10,000) and low-molecular weight heparin (Mr 4,500). Fondaparinux (Mr 1,772) had no anti-NE activity in DNase-I–treated CF sputum. These results indicate that a minimum saccharide length is critical for heparins to bind to and inhibit NE. It is known that heparin and DNA each inhibit NE (18.Belorgey D. Bieth J.G. DNA binds neutrophil elastase and mucus proteinase inhibitor and impairs their functional activity.FEBS Lett. 1995; 361 (7698335): 265-26810.1016/0014-5793(95)00173-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20.Redini F.

Considering that heparin chains of different chain lengths inhibited NE differently, it is possible that DNA chains also exhibit a similar chain length dependence. Thus, we studied three DNA variants (6-, 12-, and 24-mer), which are homogeneous variants of unique chain lengths (Table S2). With regard to heparins, we studied three clinically used variants, including UFH (∼50-mer), ODSH (∼35-mer), and enoxaparin (low-molecular weight heparin; ∼15-mer), which are heterogeneous preparations containing ∼30% variation in chain length on either side of the mean. We also studied fondaparinux, a clinically used anticoagulant, which has a defined structure and chain length (5-mer). The dose dependence of NE inhibition by each inhibitor is shown in Fig. 5. Whereas corresponding longer chains of each class display almost equal IC50 and inhibition efficacy, significant differences were observed for smaller chains (Table 1). In fact, the 6-mer DNA displayed essentially no inhibition, whereas 5-mer fondaparinux displayed a reasonable IC50 of 1.2 μm and an efficacy of nearly 70%. Although the number of residues for corresponding DNA and heparin chains may be similar, the linear molecular sizes are not expected to be identical. For example, computational modeling shows that the molecular length of a 6-mer DNA in its extended conformation was ∼42 Å, whereas it was ∼22 Å for fondaparinux (not shown). This implies that the formal negative charge density of the two polymers is ∼0.25 and ∼0.40 negative charges per Å. Thus, a priori, the electrostatic interaction of NE with heparins is expected to be stronger than that with DNA of equal chain length.Table 1Inhibition of neutrophil elastase by DNA oligomers and heparinsCorresponding chain lengthsIC50InhibitionDNA chainHeparin chainDNA chainHeparin chainnm%%50 ± 10-merNA7.5 ± 0.4NA95 ± 224-mer or 35 ± 8-mer10.5 ± 1.213.6 ± 0.587 ± 291 ± 112-mer or 15 ± 5-mer22.3 ± 1.325.4 ± 2.2101 ± 588 ± 36-mer or 5-mer>10,0001,178 ± 260ND71 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Hypertonic saline (7% (w/v) NaCl) is clinically used to aid mucus clearance in CF patients. Considering that NE interactions are electrostatically mediated, we reasoned that DNA and heparin inhibition of NE might be adversely impacted in the presence of salt. To test the comparative inhibition potential of the two classes of inhibitors, we studied 24-mer DNA and 35-mer heparin (ODSH). Fig. 6 shows the dose dependence of DNA and ODSH inhibition of NE at varying Na+ levels (62.5–362.5 mm or 0.36–2.1% (w/v)). The results show that as Na+ concentration increased from 62.5 to 162.5 mm, the IC50 of 24-mer DNA increased ∼6-fold (Table 2). A more striking effect was noted with respect to inhibition efficacy (ΔY), which decreased from 87 to 35%. At 262.5 mm Na+, the 24-mer DNA was essentially noninhibitory. In contrast, ODSH displayed a significantly different profile. At 162.5 mm Na+, the 35-mer heparin was only 2-fold less active than its potency at 62.5 mm Na+. More importantly, ODSH retained almost full NE inhibition efficacy (85%) at this high Na+ level (0.94% (w/v)). This efficacy was reduced to 52% at 262.5 mm Na+ and almost negligible at 362.5 mm Na+ (Table 2).Table 2Salt dependence of NE inhibition by 24-mer DNA and 35-mer ODSH[Na+]IC50InhibitionDNA chainHeparin chainDNA chainHeparin chainmm (% w/v)nm%%62.5 (0.36)10.5 ± 1.214.1 ± 0.987 ± 291 ± 6112.5 (0.65)10.1 ± 2.013.5 ± 1.181 ± 690 ± 5162.5 (0.94)66.6 ± 24.926.7 ± 2.235 ± 585 ± 4262.5 (1.5)>5,000261 ± 33ND52 ± 4362.5 (2.1)ND>50,000NDND Open table in a new tab These results suggest an atomistic level difference in the nature of interactions of DNA and heparin with NE. Both depend on electrostatic forces as Na+ reduces DNA and ODSH inhibition potency. For comparable chain lengths, DNA lost its NE inhibition potential faster in salt-containing buffers compared with ODSH. This implies that ODSH is a better inhibitor of NE than DNA at comparable chain lengths. More importantly, ODSH appeared to exhibit reasonable NE inhibition at Na+ levels reaching 1.5% (w/v), which is likely to be reached in the lung of a CF patient when inhaling 7.0% (w/v) hypertonic saline. The above results show that heparin was effective only in the presence of DNase-I, which presumably depolymerizes polymeric DNA into smaller chains liberating bound NE for subsequent inhibition by heparins, including ODSH. A simple model that explains this phenomenon is that ODSH and DNA bind to an overlapping site on NE, thereby competing with each other. Because a huge amount of DNA, most probably in the form of NETs, was present in the sputum of CF patients, ODSH was unable to compete, resulting in its failure to inhibit NE in sputum. To assess whether DNA and heparins compete for an overlapping site of binding on NE, we used computational molecular modeling. We used combinatorial virtual library screening (CVLS) to identify sites of heparin binding on proteins (21.Zheng S. Kummarapurugu A.B. Afosah D.K. Sankaranarayanan N.V. Boothello R.S. Desai U.R.

The algorithm predicts the binding site residues as well as the most preferred heparin sequence for the target site. We built a library of 1,728 sequences, which represent the most common hexameric chains likely to be present in a sample of ODSH. Application of the CVLS algorithm showed that many sequences bound NE with high GOLD score and high consistency, suggesting a potentially high-affinity interaction (Table S3). Calculations using Chimera (23.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera: a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J.

Chem. 2004; 25 (15264254): 1605-161210.1002/jcc.20084Crossref PubMed Scopus (27922) Google Scholar) showed that three of these sequences were predicted to bind to NE at a site encompassed by Gln-34, Leu-35, Arg-36, Gly-38, His-40, Phe-41, Cys-42, and Arg-147 (Fig. 7). This implies that many of the 19 arginines on the NE surface are predicted to be uninvolved in binding to ODSH. More importantly, the site of ODSH binding did not include NE's active site residues (Fig. 7), which are located ∼6 Å away from the heparin chain. To assess whether longer ODSH sequences would bind to NE and interact, the most common octa- and decasaccharide sequences were studied using our CVLS approach. The results showed that the preferred binding orientations of both octa- and decasaccharide sequences were similar to that of the hexasaccharide sequences bound to NE (see Fig. S1). To assess the nature of DNA-NE interactions, we used a HADDOCK-based docking and scoring strategy (24.Karaca E. Melquiond A.S. de Vries S.J. Kastritis P.L. Bonvin A.M. Building macromolecular assemblies by information-driven docking: introducing the HADDOCK multibody docking server.Mol. Cell.

HADDOCK study of 6-, 12-, and 24-mer DNA showed that that the two latter oligomers bound avidly to NE (see Table S4), whereas the 6-mer was ineffective. Both 12- and 24-mer bound to NE with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of <2.5 Å from the overall lowest energy structure, which supports the inhibition results discussed above.

This study aimed to quantitatively simulate the treatment outcomes and mitral valve (MV) biomechanics following ring annulopalsty and papillary muscle relocation (PMR) procedures for a FMR patient. Methods We utilized a validated finite element model of the left heart for a patient with severe FMR and LV dilation from our previous study and simulated virtual ring annuloplasty procedures with various sizes of Edwards Classic and GeoForm annuloplasty rings. The model included detailed geometries of the left ventricle, mitral valve, and chordae tendineae, and incorporated age- and gender- matched nonlinear, anisotropic hyperelastic tissue material properties, and simulated chordal tethering at diastole due to LV dilation. Results Ring annuloplasty with either the Classic or GeoForm ring improved leaflet coaptation and increased the total leaflet closing force while increased posterior mitral leaflet (PML) stresses and strains. Classic rings resulted in larger coaptation forces and areas compared to GeoForm rings. The PMR procedure further improved the leaflet coaptation, decreased the PML stress and strain for both ring shapes and all sizes in this patient model. Conclusions This study demonstrated that a rigorously developed patient-specific computational model can provide useful insights into annuloplasty repair techniques for the treatment of FMR patients and could potentially serve as a tool to assist in pre-operative planning for MV repair surgical or interventional procedures."

Additionally, the recent emergence of FtsEX as a regulator of FtsA and amidases indicates multistep regulation of divisome assembly (20.Du S. Pichoff S. Lutkenhaus J.

Tight regulation of cell division is necessary for Mtb to sustain bouts of active infection, dormancy, and reactivation in the host. The heterogeneous cell population of Mtb during growth is thought to be one of the primary reasons for prolonged treatment (21.Aldridge B.B. Fernandez-Suarez M. Heller D. Ambravaneswaran V. Irimia D. Toner M. Fortune S.M. Asymmetry and aging of mycobacterial cells lead to variable growth and antibiotic susceptibility.Science. 2012; 335 (22174129): 100-10410.1126/science.1216166Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although the mycobacterium lacks specialized systems to ensure the accurate positioning of divisome, the combination of directional chromosome translocation and unequal bipolar growth has been suggested as a compensatory mechanism (22.Singh B.

Although homologs of FtsZ, FtsK, FtsB, FtsL FtsQ, FtsI, and FtsW are annotated in mycobacteria, homologs for FtsA, ZipA, and FtsN proteins found in E. coli are lacking (23.Hett E.C. Rubin E.J. Bacterial growth and cell division: a mycobacterial perspective.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72 (18322037): 126-15610.1128/MMBR.00028-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 24.Wu K.J.

The presence of these homologous proteins and a similar sequence of recruitment at the midcell suggest the partial preservation of elementary complexes and their functions in mycobacteria (24.Wu K.J.

In mycobacteria, FtsZ is the first protein to assemble at the midcell; it polymerizes and serves as an initiating site for recruitment of peptidoglycan (PG)-remodeling proteins (25.Dziadek J.

A ternary complex comprising FtsZ, FtsW (probable lipid II flippase), and FtsI (transpeptidase) is thought to stabilize the divisome assembly and regulate septal PG biosynthesis (26.Datta P.

A homolog of FtsK in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmeg) plays a role in translocation of chromosome prior to cytokinesis (22.Singh B. Nitharwal R.G. Ramesh M. Pettersson B.M. Kirsebom L.A. Dasgupta S.

In addition to the conserved proteins, other nonconserved proteins such as CrgA, Ssd, SepF, and SepIVA have been identified to be involved in division (24.Wu K.J. Zhang J. Baranowski C. Leung V.

CrgA has been shown to interact with various other divisome members like FtsZ, FtsI, PbpA, FtsQ, and CwsA, suggesting a complex and intertwined regulatory circuit (27.Plocinski P. Ziolkiewicz M.

FtsE serves as a linker between FtsZ and FtsX, which in turn act as an activator of the peptidoglycan hydrolase RipC (29.Mavrici D. Marakalala M.J. Holton J.M. Prigozhin D.M. Gee C.L. Zhang Y.J.

LamA was recently identified as an important divisome factor that can inhibit cell wall synthesis at newly formed poles (30.Rego E.H. Audette R.E. Rubin E.J.

Many other important enzymes/proteins involved in the cell division process require attentive inspection to comprehend the complexity of the heterogeneous cell population and their implications as drug targets. Rv2151c (FtsQ), belonging to the polypeptide transport–associated (POTRA) domain superfamily, is an essential protein, required for in vitro growth of Mtb (31.Griffin J.E. Pandey A.K. Gilmore S.A. Mizrahi V. McKinney J.D. Bertozzi C.R. Sassetti C.M. Cholesterol catabolism by Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires transcriptional and metabolic adaptations.Chem.

FtsQ, a 315-aa-long protein, is highly conserved among mycobacteria and is homologous to its namesake in E. coli. Similar to its homologs, DivIBin in B. subtilis and FtsQ in E. coli, FtsQ in Mtb contains a cytosolic N-terminal domain (100 aa) connected though a single transmembrane (23 aa) to a periplasmic domain. In B. subtilis, DivIB plays a role in the engulfment stage of sporulation and is thought to function as a hydrolase as its absence led to thickening of septa (32.Thompson L.S. Beech P.L. Real G. Henriques A.O. Harry E.J. Requirement for the cell division protein DivIB in polar cell division and engulfment during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188 (16936026): 7677-768510.1128/JB.01072-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, DivIB has been shown to function as a chaperone for FtsL protein (33.Daniel R.A. Errington J. Intrinsic instability of the essential cell division protein FtsL of Bacillus subtilis and a role for DivIB protein in FtsL turnover.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36 (10792716): 278-28910.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01857.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Initiation of ftsQ transcription at the end of DNA replication period in Caulobacter crescentus suggests its function as a sensor of completion of chromosome replication (34.Sackett M.J. Kelly A.J. Brun Y.V. Ordered expression of ftsQA and ftsZ during the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle.Mol.

Structural investigation with the extracellular domain of DivIB from Geobacillus stearothermophilus has suggested further subdomain organization of the periplasmic region into α, β, and γ domains (35.Robson S.A. King G.F. Domain architecture and structure of the bacterial cell division protein DivIB.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sequence alignment of FtsQ from G. stearothermophilus with its homologs showed preservation of this subdomain organization structure across bacterial kingdoms (35.Robson S.A. King G.F.

These periplasmic subdomains play a role in appropriate localization and interactions with other cell division members (36.Sánchez-Pulido L. Devos D. Genevrois S. Vicente M. Valencia A.

Although interaction of FtsQMtb with FtsZMtb through FipAMtb has been demonstrated in mycobacterium (38.Sureka K. Hossain T. Mukherjee P. Chatterjee P. Datta P. Kundu M. Basu J. Novel role of phosphorylation-dependent interaction between FtsZ and FipA in mycobacterial cell division.PLoS One. 2010; 5 (20066037): e859010.1371/journal.pone.0008590Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the characterization of FtsQ's role in cell division, shape maintenance, and viability has not been investigated. In this report, we investigated the functionality of FtsQ in mycobacteria by overexpressing and conditionally depleting FtsQ. The ftsQ gene in mycobacteria lies in a conserved division or cell wall cluster (dcw) operon and is coexpressed along with mur genes, allowing coordinated cell wall synthesis and division (Fig. 1a). FtsQ contains an N-terminal cytosolic domain connected through a transmembrane domain to the extracytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1b). Based on the sequence alignment of FtsQMtb with its homologs from E. coli, B. subtilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (data not shown), the periplasmic domain of FtsQ could be further divided into α, β, and γ domains (Fig. 1b). To delineate the function of FtsQMtb, first we sought to investigate the impact of FtsQ overexpression on mycobacterial growth and survival. Msmeg was electroporated with either pNit1 (vector) or pNit-FtsQ construct wherein ftsQ is cloned under the isovaleronitrile (IVN)-inducible promoter. Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from Msmeg::pN and Msmeg::pN-ftsQ cells grown in the presence or absence of 5 μm IVN showed significant expression of FtsQ in the presence of IVN (Fig. 1c). cfu enumerated at 0, 14, and 28 h showed ∼100-fold lower survival of the strain overexpressing FtsQ as compared with the WT at 14 h, which was reduced to ∼10-fold at 28 h (Fig. 1d). These results suggest an initial delay in the growth upon overexpression that eventually seems to converge with that of the WT strain. Such growth patterns are typically observed upon overexpression of proteins critical for cell division (39.Ramos A. Honrubia M.P. Valbuena N. Vaquera J. Mateos L.M. Gil J.A. Involvement of DivIVA in the morphology of the rod-shaped actinomycete Brevibacterium lactofermentum.Microbiology. 2003; 149 (14663085): 3531-354210.1099/mic.0.26653-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of cell length with scanning EM (SEM) showed a significant increase in the average mean cell length upon overexpression of FtsQ from 3.2 to 4.9 μm (Fig. 1, e and f). Next, we wanted to determine the minimum levels of FtsQ overexpression necessary and sufficient to induce an increase in the average mean cell length. Toward this, the expression of FtsQ in Msmeg harboring an episomal copy of the gene was induced with different concentrations of IVN, which led to differential levels of FtsQ expression as evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 2, a and b). With increasing concentrations of IVN (0.2, 1, to 5 μm), we observed ∼10-, 27-, and 37-fold induction of ftsQ expression, respectively, in comparison with no inducer (Fig. 2a). In agreement with this, we could detect FtsQ expression only in lysates from 1 and 5 μm IVN-induced cultures (Fig. 2b). SEM analysis showed a statistically significant increase in the cell length at all the concentrations, including in the absence of inducer (3.8 versus 3.0 μm), suggesting that the leaky overexpression from the episomal construct was sufficient to alter the average mean cell length (Fig. 2, c and d). To evaluate the impact of overexpression on septum formation, we performed transmission EM (TEM) analysis. Interestingly, we observed a multiseptum phenotype in cells overexpressing FtsQ. To quantitate the percentage of such cells, we evaluated the septation pattern for ∼60–65 cells/sample. We observed a significant increase from 4 to 14% in cells containing a bi- or multiseptum phenotype upon overexpression of FtsQ (Fig. 2, e and f). Taken together, our data indicate that overexpression of FtsQ results in elongated and multiseptate cells, implicating a crucial role of FtsQ in regulation of cell division. The N-terminal region of FtsQ including the transmembrane domain is 123 aa in length. The C-terminal domain of FtsQ in E. coli, B. subtilis, and other bacterial kingdoms contains crucial α, β, and γ domains thought to be important for its function (35.Robson S.A. King G.F. Domain architecture and structure of the bacterial cell division protein DivIB.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To evaluate the impact of overexpressing N- or C-terminal regions, we cloned the respective fragment along with the membrane-anchoring sequences into pNit1 vector. Although the full length and N-terminal domain showed significant overexpression, the C-terminal fragment displayed relatively minimal overexpression (Fig. 3a). The expression of the full length and N- and C-terminal fragments led to compromised growth (Fig. 3b), albeit to different extents. These observations were also reflected in the cellular morphology wherein their expression led to increased cell length (Fig. 3, c and d). We think the differences in the extent of growth defect or cell lengths upon N- or C-terminal fragment overexpression are most likely due to variations in the expressions of these fragments (Fig. 3a). Thus, results suggest a definitive role for both N- and C-terminal regions of FtsQ in regulating cell division. We sought to investigate the consequence of the absence of FtsQ on bacterial growth, morphology, and survival in the host. High-throughput transposon-based mutagenesis experiments suggested ftsQ to be an essential gene for the in vitro growth of the bacteria (42.Griffin J.E. Gawronski J.D. Dejesus M.A. Ioerger T.R. Akerley B.J. Sassetti C.M. High-resolution phenotypic profiling defines genes essential for mycobacterial growth and cholesterol catabolism.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7 (21980284): e100225110.1371/journal.ppat.1002251Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to alter the expression of ftsQ at its native locus into pristinamycin-inducible expression. Toward this, we cloned −20 to 680 bp of ftsQ gene under the pristinamycin-inducible pptr promoter in pAZ vector (43.Forti F. Crosta A. Ghisotti D. Pristinamycin-inducible gene regulation in mycobacteria.J.

Single homologous recombination of the construct at the native locus replaces the native ftsQ with a pristinamycin-inducible gene (Fig. 4a), which in the absence of any inducer would act as an FtsQ knockdown mutant, RvΔfQ. Recombination at the native locus was confirmed by PCR analysis using different primers sets (Fig. 4b). Streaking of Rv and RvΔfQ cultures on plates in the presence or absence of inducer clearly demonstrated the inability of RvΔfQ strain to sustain growth in the absence of inducer (Fig. 4c). cfu analysis (Fig. 4d) showed compromised survival of the mutant from day 6, eventually resulting in ∼1.5 log -fold decrease in survival on day 10 (Fig. 4d). Next we investigated the role of FtsQ in modulating the survival of pathogen in the host. Toward this, Rv or RvΔfQ grown in the presence or absence of pristinamycin was used for infecting differentiated THP1 cells. We enumerated cfu at 0, 96, and 120 h postinfection and found that at 120 h postinfection intracellular bacillary survival was compromised up to 10-fold in the FtsQ-depleted sample (Fig. 4e). Overexpression of FtsQ in Msmeg resulted in elongated cells, indicating a crucial role of FtsQ in regulating cell wall morphology (Fig. 1). This prompted us to investigate the effect of FtsQ depletion in Mtb on the maintenance of average mean cell length. We performed SEM and TEM analysis of samples on days 4 and 10 (early and late log-phase cultures; Fig. 5, a–c). Although the cells looked quite healthy on day 4, they looked more ruffled with indentations on day 10, and this change in morphology was much more palpable in FtsQ-depleted cells (Fig. 5a). Intriguingly, we observed two distinct cell length phenotypes with respect to time. At 4 days postdepletion, the cells appeared smaller when compared with the WT in FtsQ-depleted samples with the average cell l"
https://openalex.org/W2807841139,"Recent research has explored the nature of the theoretical concept of optimal best practice, which emphasizes the importance of personal resolve, inner strength, and the maximization of a person's development, whether it is mental, cognitive, social, or physical. In the context of academia, the study of optimal functioning places emphasis on a student's effort expenditure, positive outlook, and determination to strive for educational success and enriched subjective well-being. One major inquiry closely associated with optimal functioning is the process of optimization. Optimization, in brief, delves into the enactment of different psychological variables that could improve a person's internal state of functioning (e.g., cognitive functioning). From a social sciences point of view, very little empirical evidence exists to affirm and explain a person's achievement of optimal best practice. Over the past five years, we have made extensive progress in the area of optimal best practice by developing different quantitative measures to assess and evaluate the importance of this theoretical concept. The present study, which we collaborated with colleagues in Taiwan, involved the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze a cohort of Taiwanese university students' (N = 1010) responses to a series of Likert-scale measures that focused on three major entities: (i) the importance of optimal best practice, (ii) three major psychological variables (i.e., effective functioning, personal resolve, and emotional functioning) that could optimize student' optimal best levels in academic learning, and (iii) three comparable educational outcomes (i.e., motivation towards academic learning, interest in academic learning, and academic liking experience) that could positively associate with optimal best practice and the three mentioned psychological variables. Findings that we obtained, overall, fully supported our initial a priori model. This evidence, in its totality, has made substantive practical, theoretical, and methodological contributions. Foremost, from our point of view, is clarity into the psychological process of optimal best practice in the context of schooling. For example, in relation to subjective well-being experiences, how can educators optimize students' positive emotions? More importantly, aside from practical relevance, our affirmed research inquiry has produced insightful information for further advancement. One distinction, in this case, entails consideration of a more complex methodological design that could measure, assess, and evaluate the impact of optimization."

https://openalex.org/W2808664788,"Background Botulinum toxin injection chemodenervation is a well-established intervention for adult strabismus, and has also been recognised as an effective alternative to routine incisional surgery for paediatric disease. We aimed to investigate the temporal patterns of practice, indications and outcomes of chemodenervation for paediatric strabismus at national and tertiary centre level. Methods Retrospective study using routinely collected patient data: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data were used to identify children undergoing non-incisional strabismus procedures in England from 2007 to 2016. Single–centre retrospective data on children undergoing botulinum toxin injections (Dysport® 2.5 units/ 0.1ml) as an isolated intervention (not involving incisional procedures) was undertaken to identify indications and outcomes. Successful outcome was defined as deviation <11 prism dioptres (PD). Results Between 2007 and 2016, there was no increase in the proportion of childhood strabismus involving non-incisional procedures. Amongst 150 children undergoing chemodenervation for strabismus within the tertiary centre, the most common diagnoses were acute onset esotropia (n = 34), infantile esotropia (n = 16) and consecutive exotropia (n = 15). Median age at injection was 8.5 years (range 0.9–15 years), and median follow up 12 months (6 months—11 years). Success rates differed by diagnosis, from 66% (non or partially accommodative esotropia) to 0% (congenital cranial disorders). Adverse events were seen in 62/150, 41%, most commonly transient ptosis (39%, n = 58). Overcorrection was seen in 14/119, 13%. Mild subconjunctival haemorrhage (n = 2) was the only other adverse event. Conclusions Botulinum toxin for childhood strabismus has an acceptable safety profile, and considerable potential therapeutic benefit. However, nationally there has been no increased uptake of chemodenervation non-incisional procedures. Further prospective studies are necessary to understand the predictors of outcome within the separate clinical subgroups, to guide clinical decision making."

Wearable motion sensors or inertial measurement units (IMUs) have become common for human gait analysis. Canines are important large animal models for translational research of human diseases. Our objective is to develop a method for accurate and reliable determination of the timing of each stride in dogs using a wearable IMU. Methods We built a wireless IMU sensor using off-the-shelf components. We also developed a MATLAB algorithm for data acquisition and stride timing determination. Stride parameters from 1,259 steps of three adult mixed breed dogs were determined across a range of six height-normalized speeds using the IMU system. The IMU results were validated by frame-by-frame manual counting of high-speed video recordings. Results Comparing IMU derived results with video revealed that the mean error ± standard deviation for stride, stance, and swing duration was 0.001 ± 0.025, -0.001 ± 0.030, and 0.001 ± 0.019 s respectively. A mean error ± standard deviation of 0.000 ± 0.020 and -0.008 ± 0.027 s was obtained for determining toe-off and toe-touch events respectively. Only one step was missed by the algorithm in the video dataset of 1,259 steps. Conclusion We have developed and validated an IMU method for automatic canine gait analysis. Our method can be used for studying neuromuscular diseases in veterinary clinics and in translational research."

The ETS variant 6 (ETV6)–neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (NTRK3) (EN) chimeric tyrosine kinase is expressed in mesenchymal, epithelial, and hematopoietic cancers and requires the IGF1R axis for transformation. However, current models of IGF1R-mediated EN activation are lacking mechanistic detail. We demonstrate here that IGF-mediated IGF1R stimulation enhances EN tyrosine phosphorylation and that blocking IGF1R activity or decreasing protein levels of the adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate 1/2 (IRS1/2) results in rapid EN degradation. This was observed both in vitro and in vivo in fibroblast and breast epithelial cell line models and in MO91, an EN-expressing human leukemia cell line. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)–based MS analysis identified the E3 ligase RING-finger protein 123 (Rnf123, more commonly known as KPC1) as an EN interactor upon IGF1R/insulin receptor (INSR) inhibitor treatment. KPC1/Rnf123 ubiquitylated EN in vitro, and its overexpression decreased EN protein levels. In contrast, KPC1/Rnf123 knockdown rendered EN resistant to IGF1R inhibitor–mediated degradation. These results support a critical function for IGF1R in protecting EN from KPC1/Rnf123-mediated proteasomal degradation. Attempts to therapeutically target oncogenic chimeric tyrosine kinases have traditionally focused on blocking kinase activity to restrict downstream activation of essential signaling pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that IGF1R inhibition results in rapid ubiquitylation and degradation of the EN oncoprotein through a proteasome-dependent mechanism that is reversible, highlighting a potential strategy for targeting chimeric tyrosine kinases in cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2808539857,"Most members of the TransMEMbrane protein 16 (TMEM16) family are Ca2+-regulated scramblases that facilitate the bidirectional movement of phospholipids across membranes necessary for diverse physiological processes. The nhTMEM16 scramblase (from the fungus Nectria hematococca) is a homodimer with a large cytoplasmic region and a hydrophilic, membrane-exposed groove in each monomer. The groove provides the transbilayer conduit for lipids, but the mechanism by which Ca2+ regulates it is not clear. Because fusion of large protein tags at either the N or C terminus abolishes nhTMEM16 activity, we hypothesized that its cytoplasmic portion containing both termini may regulate lipid translocation via a Ca2+-dependent conformational change. To test this hypothesis, here we used fluorescence methods to map key distances within the nhTMEM16 homodimer and between its termini and the membrane. To this end, we developed functional nhTMEM16 variants bearing an acyl carrier protein (ACP) tag at one or both of the termini. These constructs were fluorescently labeled by ACP synthase–mediated insertion of CoA-conjugated fluorophores and reconstituted into vesicles containing fluorescent lipids to obtain the distance of closest approach between the labeled tag and the membrane via FRET. Fluorescence lifetime measurements with phasor analysis were used to determine the distance between the N and C termini of partnering monomers in the nhTMEM16 homodimer. We now report that the measured distances do not vary significantly between Ca2+-replete and EGTA-treated samples, indicating that whereas the cytoplasmic portion of the protein is important for function, it does not appear to regulate scramblase activity via a detectable conformational change.

Recent studies identified residues in the groove that are important for scrambling (11.Jiang T. Yu K. Hartzell H.C. Tajkhorshid E.

Despite these advances in understanding how TMEM16 scramblases facilitate phospholipid movement, the mechanism by which Ca2+ regulates their scrambling activity is less clear. It seems likely that Ca2+ binding produces a change in protein conformation and/or alters the electrostatic properties of the groove to enable scrambling (14.Brunner J.D. Schenck S. Dutzler R. Structural basis for phospholipid scrambling in the TMEM16 family.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 39 (27295354): 61-7010.1016/j.sbi.2016.05.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, previous work pointed to the functional importance of the cytoplasmic portion of the protein. Thus, both the scramblase and ion channel activities of afTMEM16 and nhTMEM16 are eliminated when the cytoplasmic portion of the proteins is modified by attachment of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag to either the N or C terminus (8.Lee B.C. Menon A.K. Accardi A. The nhTMEM16 scramblase is also a nonselective ion channel.Biophys.

We therefore considered the possibility that the cytoplasmic portion of the protein may play a role in regulating scramblase activity by blocking the lipid pathway in the inactive state and swinging out of the way in the Ca2+-bound active state to enable lipid passage (Fig. 1B). To test this model, we reconstituted nhTMEM16 into large unilamellar vesicles and used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the distance of closest approach between a donor fluorophore situated at the N or C terminus of the protein and fluorescent lipid acceptors in the plane of the membrane. We also measured the distance between the N terminus of one monomer and the C terminus of its partner within the nhTMEM16 homodimer. As GFP tagging eliminates scrambling activity (8.Lee B.C. Menon A.K. Accardi A. The nhTMEM16 scramblase is also a nonselective ion channel.Biophys.

A similar labeling strategy was used previously to study ligand-induced conformational changes of the epidermal growth factor receptor relative to the membrane (15.Ziomkiewicz I. Loman A. Klement R.

We found that the resulting fusion proteins retained their scramblase and channel functions and could be enzymatically labeled with high efficiency using fluorescent coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives. Using these novel fluorescent proteins, we now report that nhTMEM16 reconstitutes into vesicles asymmetrically, such that most molecules are oriented with their cytoplasmic portion in the extravesicular space. Steady-state and lifetime FRET-based structural mapping experiments reveal that the N and C termini of the protein appear to be locked relative to each other, and also with respect to the membrane, during Ca2+-mediated activation. acyl carrier protein n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside phosphatidylcholine Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging mutant ACP octadecylrhodamine B 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) rhodamine B 1,2 dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine nitrobenzoxadiazole-conjugated phosphatidylethanolamine enhanced GFP. The gating model shown in Fig. 1B posits a Ca2+-induced conformational change in the cytoplasmic portion of the protein. To test this model, we set out to use FRET to determine whether the distance between the membrane surface and the cytoplasmically disposed N or C terminus of the protein is affected by Ca2+. Because GFP tagging inactivates both afTMEM16 and nhTMEM16, whereas attachment of a small 48-amino acid sequence (tandem tag consisting of Myc (10 amino acids) followed by a streptavidin-binding peptide (38 amino acids)) to the C terminus of nhTMEM16 does not (8.Lee B.C.

ACP is a 77-amino acid tag that can be readily labeled by ACP synthase-mediated transfer of a fluorophore from fluorescent CoA derivatives. We engineered the constructs shown in Fig. 1C, which after expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, cleavage of the N-terminal His10-EGFP module, and gel filtration yielded well-behaved nhTMEM16 proteins with an N- or C-terminal ACP tag in similar yield as the nontagged protein (∼1 mg/liter of culture, prior to cleavage of the His10-EGFP module) (Fig. S1). We also generated a doubly-tagged protein (MCP–TMEM16–ACP) that will be discussed later. We tested the purified ACP-tagged proteins for scramblase and ion channel activity.

Thus, in protein-free liposomes, ∼50% of the fluorescence is predicted to be lost on adding dithionite, corresponding to bleaching of the outer-leaflet pool of NBD-PE. In the presence of a functional TMEM16 scramblase, dithionite is predicted to eliminate all fluorescence as NBD-PE molecules from the inner leaflet are scrambled to the outer leaflet.

All three tagged proteins (Fig. 1C) scrambled NBD-PE in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, similar to the activity of the nontagged protein (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table 1). Fluorescence reduction in the presence of Ca2+ was well-described in all cases by a single exponential function as reported previously, indicating that the rate of scrambling cannot be distinguished from that of the chemical reduction reaction (Table 1). In contrast, two kinetic components could be distinguished in the absence of Ca2+, corresponding to the expected fast rate of chemical reduction (τ1 ∼20 s (Table 1)) and a slower scrambling rate (τ2 ∼200–400 s (Table 1)) in the absence of Ca2+. We note that scrambling in the absence of Ca2+ appeared to be about 2-fold slower for the C-terminally tagged TMEM–ACP and MCP–TMEM–ACP proteins compared with ACP–TMEM16 and nontagged protein, suggesting mild interference by the C-terminal ACP tag that was not observed for the Myc-SBP tandem tag reported previously (8.Lee B.C.

The reasons for this are not clear, and as the effect is relatively small, it seems unlikely that C-terminal ACP tagging would affect our structural mapping experiments. Despite reconstituting five TMEM16 dimers per vesicle on average, we never observed complete fluorescence reduction (Fig. 1B). The fluorescence level reached after dithionite reduction of TMEM16-containing vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ was 0.13 ± 0.024 (mean ± S.D., n = 24, including measurements of all TMEM16 constructs) indicating that a significant fraction of the vesicles, ∼26%, is not reconstituted with protein. This phenomenon is well-known in reconstitution experiments, and the underlying reasons are not fully understood (6.Malvezzi M. Chalat M. Janjusevic R. Picollo A. Terashima H. Menon A.K. Accardi A.

Briefly, vesicles are reconstituted with TMEM16 in the presence of 300 mm KCl (±Ca2+). The extravesicular solution is rapidly replaced with 1 mm KCl (±Ca2+), 300 mm sodium glutamate by passage through a desalting column, and the Cl− content of the extravesicular solution is measured with a Cl− electrode. Trapped Cl− is discharged by disrupting the vesicle membrane with the detergent n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Because nhTMEM16 is a nonselective ion channel, vesicles containing functional protein are expected to lose their Cl− content (replaced with glutamate) during the desalting step, which takes ∼2 min to complete. In contrast, Cl− is expected to be trapped in protein-free vesicles or TMEM16-containing vesicles in the absence of Ca2+. The amount of trapped Cl− indicates the fraction of vesicles that do not contain a functional channel. Representative experimental traces (Fig. 2E) and calculated data (Fig. 2F) indicate that both ACP–TMEM16 and TMEM16–ACP have channel activity that is essentially identical to that of the nontagged protein. The presence of trapped Cl− in 24.9 ± 4.7% (mean ± S.D., n = 13, including measurements of all TMEM16 constructs) of the proteoliposome samples in Ca2+-replete conditions indicates that a significant fraction of vesicles is not reconstituted with protein, consistent with a similar observation from our scramblase data. We conclude that ACP tagging, unlike GFP tagging, does not interfere with the scramblase (Fig. 2, B and C) and channel (Fig. 2, E and F) activities of nhTMEM16. We fluorescently labeled ACP–TMEM16 and TMEM16–ACP using CoA-488 and reconstituted the labeled proteins into liposomes containing up to 2.0 mol % of R18 lipids to carry out FRET measurements as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3A. The fluorophores themselves are not sensitive to Ca2+ or EGTA (see “Experimental procedures”). Fluorescence emission spectra (λex = 480 nm) of samples prepared in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA revealed a progressive increase in the magnitude of R18 emission as a function of the amount of reconstituted R18 (Fig. 3, B and D). Although a portion of this signal may be due to sensitized emission resulting from FRET, we observed that R18 has significant absorbance at the wavelength chosen for donor excitation and that the majority of the observed increase in fluorescence as a function of R18 concentration results from direct excitation of R18 (Fig. S2). Therefore, we used the loss of donor fluorescence as a function of R18 concentration (Fig. 3, C and E) to measure FRET. We quantified donor fluorescence (value at 520 nm, Fig. 3, C and E) in the presence of acceptor (FDA) and also after dispersal of the acceptor by treating the vesicles with Triton X-100 (FD, donor fluorescence in the absence of acceptor). These data were corrected using an identically prepared liposome sample lacking fluorophores and used to compute the ratio of the quantum yield (Q) of the donor in the absence versus presence of the acceptor (QD/QDA). In parallel, the surface density of R18 molecules in the membrane was calculated by measuring bulk phospholipid with a colorimetric assay after hydrolysis to Pi and quantifying R18 spectroscopically. Representative plots of QD/QDA versus acceptor density are shown in Fig. 4. The slope of the plots is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the distance of closest approach (L) between the donor fluorophore on the protein and the plane of R18 acceptors in the membrane (see “Experimental procedures”) (22.Holowka D.

https://openalex.org/W2808341670,"Many disease-causing mutations impair protein stability. Here, we explore a thermodynamic strategy to correct the disease-causing F508del mutation in the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR). F508del destabilizes nucleotide-binding domain 1 (hNBD1) in hCFTR relative to an aggregation-prone intermediate. We developed a fluorescence self-quenching assay for compounds that prevent aggregation of hNBD1 by stabilizing its native conformation. Unexpectedly, we found that dTTP and nucleotide analogs with exocyclic methyl groups bind to hNBD1 more strongly than ATP and preserve electrophysiological function of full-length F508del-hCFTR channels at temperatures up to 37 °C. Furthermore, nucleotides that increase open-channel probability, which reflects stabilization of an interdomain interface to hNBD1, thermally protect full-length F508del-hCFTR even when they do not stabilize isolated hNBD1. Therefore, stabilization of hNBD1 itself or of one of its interdomain interfaces by a small molecule indirectly offsets the destabilizing effect of the F508del mutation on full-length hCFTR. These results indicate that high-affinity binding of a small molecule to a remote site can correct a disease-causing mutation. We propose that the strategies described here should be applicable to identifying small molecules to help manage other human diseases caused by mutations that destabilize native protein conformation."

These enzymes remove small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) from proteins and are conserved in all eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that Ulp1 deSUMOylates the bulk of intracellular SUMOylated proteins, whereas Ulp2 is a highly specific enzyme. However, the mechanism for Ulp2's substrate specificity has been insufficiently understood. Here we show that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Ulp2 contains three distinct, yet conserved, motifs that control its in vivo substrate specificity and cell growth. Among them, a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) was found to coordinate with the domain of Ulp2 that binds to the nucleolar protein Csm1 to ensure maximal deSUMOylation of Ulp2's nucleolar substrates. We found that whereas the Csm1-binding domain of Ulp2 recruits this enzyme to the nucleolus, Ulp2's C-terminal SIM promotes its SUMO protease activity and plays a key role in mediating the in vivo specificity of Ulp2. Thus, the substrate specificity of Ulp2 is controlled by both its subcellular localization and the SUMOylation status of its substrates.

SUMO is structurally similar to ubiquitin, despite being mostly different at the primary sequence level (3.Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J.

Like ubiquitin, the conjugation of SUMO to its substrates also occurs in an ATP-dependent manner that involves a cascade of three enzymes: a heterodimeric SUMO-activating E1 enzyme (Aos1 and Uba2 in yeast), a SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme (Ubc9 in yeast), and a number of SUMO E3 ligases that impart specificity for the conjugation of SUMO to its substrates (4.Johnson E.S.

Consistent with this idea, loss of Ulp1 in the siz1Δsiz2Δ mutant still resulted in a substantial increase in global SUMOylation even in the absence of Siz1 and Siz2 (21.de Albuquerque C.P. Liang J.

When combined with Ulp1's highly potent in vitro activity (9.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

Unlike Ulp1, Ulp2 is not essential for cell viability, although loss of Ulp2 leads to severe growth defects and interestingly, a rapid accumulation of survivors with aneuploidy (10.Li S.J.

The tendency of the ulp2Δ mutant to form survivors has complicated its analysis, although mutations affecting poly-SUMO chain formation appeared to rescue the growth defect of the ulp2Δ mutant (20.Bylebyl G.R.

Remarkably, Ulp2 was found to be a highly specific enzyme that targets specific protein complexes involved in distinct cellular processes such as ribosomal DNA (rDNA) maintenance, chromosome segregation, and DNA replication (21.de Albuquerque C.P.

With the knowledge of Ulp1 and Ulp2 substrates in hand, a major unsolved question is what dictates the in vivo substrate specificity of Ulp1 and Ulp2? One clue might be related to the distinct subcellular localizations of Ulp1 and Ulp2. Prior studies have shown that Ulp1 and Ulp2 are both localized to the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal; with Ulp1 localizing to the nuclear envelope and Ulp2 localizing throughout the nucleus (19.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. The Ulp1 SUMO isopeptidase: distinct domains required for viability, nuclear envelope localization, and substrate specificity.J.

Moreover, Ulp2 has a C-terminal SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) (10.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. The yeast ULP2 (SMT4) gene encodes a novel protease specific for the ubiquitin-like Smt3 protein.Mol. Cell.

Although not yet experimentally confirmed, this putative SIM of Ulp2 could promote it to specifically process poly-SUMO chains (20.Bylebyl G.R. Belichenko I. Johnson E.S.

This set the stage for our recent study to solve the structure of the Ulp2–Csm1 binding interface, and demonstrate that Ulp2's interaction with the Csm1 subunit, via a newly identified domain in Ulp2's C terminus, was important for rDNA silencing (29.Liang J.

Moreover, a relatively modest increase of SUMOylated Net1, Cdc14, and Tof2 is observed in the ulp2–781 mutant, relative to WT cells (29.Liang J. Singh N. Carlson C.R. Albuquerque C.P. Corbett K.D.

These findings indicated that the Csm1-mediated targeting of Ulp2 to the nucleolus is insufficient to account for the exquisite substrate selectivity of Ulp2 toward its nucleolar substrates; despite that eliminating the Csm1–Ulp2 binding is sufficient to cause a defect in rDNA silencing via aberrant degradation of Tof2 (29.Liang J.

To further understand the substrate specificity of Ulp2, we investigated the role of Ulp2's C-terminal non-catalytic domain, which is largely unstructured, and identified two conserved regions among Ulp2 fungal orthologs, aside from the Csm1-binding domain. We provide evidence supporting that one of these conserved regions contains a SIM between residues 725 and 728 of Ulp2, and further shows that the C-terminal Ulp2 SIM plays an unexpected and major role in contributing to its in vivo substrate specificity toward Ulp2's nucleolar substrates in conjunction with Csm1-mediated Ulp2 recruitment to the nucleolus. Our previous study identified a conserved binding interface (residues 821–847) in Ulp2's C terminus that binds to the Csm1 protein to direct Ulp2 to the rDNA region (29.Liang J. Singh N. Carlson C.R.

https://openalex.org/W2808475866,"Scientists have been interested in many topics driven by biological invasions, such as shifts in the area of distribution of plant species and rapid evolution. Invasiveness of exotic plant species depends on variations on morphological and reproductive traits potentially associated with reproductive fitness and dispersal ability, which are expected to undergo changes during the invasion process. Numerous Asteraceae are invasive and display dimorphic fruits, resulting in a bet-hedging dispersal strategy –wind-dispersed fruits versus animal-dispersed fruits–. We explored phenotypic differentiation in seed morphology and reproductive traits of exotic (Chilean) and native (Spanish) populations of Hypochaeris glabra. We collected flower heads from five Spanish and five Chilean populations along rainfall gradients in both countries. We planted seeds from the ten populations in a common garden trial within the exotic range to explore their performance depending on the country of origin (native or exotic) and the environmental conditions at population origin (precipitation and nutrient availability). We scored plant biomass, reproductive traits and fruit dimorphism patterns. We observed a combination of bet-hedging strategy together with phenotypic differentiation. Native populations relied more on bet-hedging while exotic populations always displayed greater proportion of wind-dispersed fruits than native ones. This pattern may reflect a strategy that might entail a more efficient long distance dispersal of H. glabra seeds in the exotic range, which in turn can enhance the invasiveness of this species."

Anti-tubulin-α-1c antibody levels were further determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in sera of patients with BD, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU), ANCA associated systemic vasculitis (AASV), Takayasu's arteritis (TA) and 59 healthy controls.A total of 17 potential antigens were identified in CICs from BD patients, but not in HC. The autoantibody to one of the identified antigens, tubulin-α-1c, was significantly increased in BD patients compared with that in healthy and disease controls. The sensitivity and specificity of tubulin-α-1c antibody in the diagnosis of BD in this study were 61.36% and 88.4%, respectively. Further analysis demonstrated that anti-tubulin-α-1c was associated with complications of deep venous thrombosis and erythema nodosum in BD. The levels of anti-tubulin-α-1c were also significantly correlated with the BD inflammation and disease activity markers ESR, CRP and BVAS.Anti-tubulin-α-1c antibody is a promising biomarker in diagnosis and severity evaluation of BD and in indicating the risk of deep venous thrombosis and erythema nodosum.

https://openalex.org/W2807984471,"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a severe autosomal recessive disease characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration, caused by disruptions of the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 (Smn1) gene. The main product of SMN1 is the full-length SMN protein (FL-SMN), that plays an established role in mRNA splicing. FL-SMN is also involved in neurite outgrowth and axonal transport. A shorter SMN isoform, axonal-SMN or a-SMN, displays a more specific axonal localization and has remarkable axonogenic properties in NSC-34. Introduction of known SMA mutations into the a-SMN transcript leads to impairment of axon growth and morphological defects similar to those observed in SMA patients and animal models. Although there is increasing evidence for the relevance of SMN axonal functions in SMA pathogenesis, the specific contributions of FL-SMN and a-SMN are not known yet. This work aimed to analyze the differential roles of FL-SMN and a-SMN in axon outgrowth and in neuronal homeostasis during differentiation of neurons into a mature phenotype. We employed primary cultures of hippocampal neurons as a well-defined model of polarization and differentiation. By analyzing subcellular localization, we showed that a-SMN is preferentially localized in the growing axonal compartment. By specifically silencing FL-SMN or a-SMN proteins, we demonstrated that both proteins play a role in axon growth, as their selective down-regulation reduces axon length without affecting dendritic arborization. a-SMN silencing, and in minor extent FL-SMN silencing, resulted in the growth of multi-neuritic neurons, impaired in the differentiation process of selecting a single axon out of multiple neurites. In these neurons, neurites often display mixed axonal and dendritic markers and abnormal distribution of the axonal initial segment protein Ankirin G, suggesting loss of neuronal polarity. Our results indicate that a-SMN and FL-SMN are needed for neuronal polarization and organization of axonal and dendritic compartments, processes that are fundamental for neuronal function and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2808120522,"The biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites is associated with morphological and metabolic differentiation. As a consequence, gene expression profiles can change drastically, and primary and secondary metabolites, including intermediate and end-products, move dynamically within and between cells. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying differentiation and transport mechanisms. In this study, we performed a transcriptome analysis of Petunia axillaris subsp. parodii, which produces various volatiles in its corolla limbs and emits metabolites to attract pollinators. RNA-sequencing from leaves, buds, and limbs identified 53,243 unigenes. Analysis of differentially expressed genes, combined with gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, showed that many biological processes were highly enriched in limbs. These included catabolic processes and signaling pathways of hormones, such as gibberellins, and metabolic pathways, including phenylpropanoids and fatty acids. Moreover, we identified five transporter genes that showed high expression in limbs, and we performed spatiotemporal expression analyses and homology searches to infer their putative functions. Our systematic analysis provides comprehensive transcriptomic information regarding morphological differentiation and metabolite transport in the Petunia flower and lays the foundation for establishing the specific mechanisms that control secondary metabolite biosynthesis in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2808328674,"The negative effects of high normal glucose on cognitive function were previously reported in euglycemic individuals of middle age and the elderly population. This study aimed at examining the effect of baseline blood glucose levels on spatial ability, specifically verticality perception on the computerized rod and frame test (CRFT) in young healthy adults. 63 healthy male medical students (age range from 18–23 years), of whom 30 were non-fasting outside the month of Ramadan and 33 fasting during Ramadan of the year 2016, were recruited in order to create varying degrees of glycemia during which verticality perception was carried out. Baseline blood glucose reading was obtained prior to commencing the CRFT test. Blood glucose levels at the time of testing decreased as the duration between the last meal and testing increased. A blood glucose range of 62–117 mg/dl was achieved among participants for this study. Linear regression analysis showed that blood glucose level at testing correlated positively with all alignment spatial error parameters, indicating a probable reduction of spatial perception ability with higher blood glucose levels. These results are consistent with other cognitive studies in older healthy humans and emphasize the critical impact of early glucose dys-homeostasis on cognitive function. They also indicate that elevated blood glucose may affect cognitive functioning outside of the usual complications of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2808234282,"RNA-binding proteins (RBP) are critical regulators of gene expression. Recent studies have uncovered hundreds of mRNA-binding proteins that do not contain annotated RNA-binding domains and have well-established roles in other cellular processes. Investigation of these nonconventional RBPs is critical for revealing novel RNA-binding domains and may disclose connections between RNA regulation and other aspects of cell biology. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport II (ESCRT-II) is a nonconventional RNA-binding complex that has a canonical role in multivesicular body formation. ESCRT-II was identified previously as an RNA-binding complex in Drosophila oocytes, but whether its RNA-binding properties extend beyond Drosophila is unknown. In this study, we found that the RNA-binding properties of ESCRT-II are conserved in Xenopus eggs, where ESCRT-II interacted with hundreds of mRNAs. Using a UV cross-linking approach, we demonstrated that ESCRT-II binds directly to RNA through its subunit, Vps25. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-Seq revealed that Vps25 specifically recognizes a polypurine (i.e. GA-rich) motif in RNA. Using purified components, we could reconstitute the selective Vps25-mediated binding of the polypurine motif in vitro. Our results provide insight into the mechanism by which ESCRT-II selectively binds to mRNA and also suggest an unexpected link between endosome biology and RNA regulation.

Although many RBPs involved in the subcellular localization of mRNAs are well-characterized, the mechanisms through which the majority of localized mRNAs are selectively positioned in the cell are poorly understood. In an effort to identify novel factors involved in RNA localization, work in Drosophila has identified a highly conserved protein complex, ESCRT-II, as being involved in the trafficking of the bicoid mRNA during oogenesis (19.Irion U. St Johnston D. bicoid RNA localization requires specific binding of an endosomal sorting complex.Nature. 2007; 445 (17268469): 554-55810.1038/nature05503Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, ESCRT-II lacks conventional RNA-binding domains and it is unclear how ESCRT-II interacts with mRNA. To date, no other mRNA partners of ESCRT-II have been identified, and whether the RNA-binding properties of ESCRT-II extend beyond Drosophila has not been explored. ESCRT-II is a highly conserved protein complex composed of two copies of Vps25 and one copy each of Vps36 and Vps22 (20.Hierro A. Sun J. Rusnak A.S. Kim J. Prag G. Emr S.D. Hurley J.H.

ESCRT-II is part of the protein machinery that sorts activated cell surface receptors into intraluminal vesicles within the endosome, thereby maturing endosomes into multivesicular bodies (MVB) (23.Hurley J.H. ESCRT complexes and the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20 (18222686): 4-1110.1016/j.ceb.2007.12.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by the sequential recruitment of ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III to the endosome. The role of ESCRT-II in this process is to deform the endosomal membrane through interactions between phospholipids and the Vps36-GLUE and Vps22-H0 domains (21.Im Y.J. Hurley J.H.

Interestingly, mutational analysis has revealed that of all the ESCRT complexes, ESCRT-II is uniquely required for bicoid localization, suggesting that ESCRT-II's role in bicoid RNA trafficking is independent of its role in MVB formation (19.Irion U. St Johnston D. bicoid RNA localization requires specific binding of an endosomal sorting complex.Nature. 2007; 445 (17268469): 554-55810.1038/nature05503Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To understand how the nonconventional RNA-binding complex, ESCRT-II, interacts with mRNA, we undertook a detailed characterization of the RNA-binding properties of ESCRT-II using both Xenopus laevis egg extract as well as purified components. We found that the RNA-binding properties of ESCRT-II are conserved across multiple species and that ESCRT-II has hundreds of mRNA binding partners. We determined that Vps25 is the RNA-binding subunit of ESCRT-II and identified a purine-rich RNA sequence motif recognized by Vps25. Furthermore, we established that the interaction between Vps25 and purine-rich sequences is direct using a UV cross-linking approach in egg extract and in vitro. Our results demonstrate that the RNA-binding functions of ESCRT-II are widespread and offer a mechanism for how a nonconventional RBP can selectively recognize and interact with RNA. To determine whether ESCRT-II associates with transcripts in X. laevis eggs, we performed an RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) from egg extract using antibodies specific to ESCRT-II. ESCRT-II immunoprecipitations consistently contained a complex mixture of RNA that differed subtly from total RNA, whereas a mock immunoprecipitation performed with nonspecific rabbit IgG co-immunoprecipitated very little RNA (Fig. 1A). We sequenced ESCRT-II-associated RNAs and identified 996 mRNAs that are significantly enriched in ESCRT-II immunoprecipitations (2-fold enriched over total RNA with a p value of <0.01 as determined by edgeR) (30.Robinson M.D. McCarthy D.J. Smyth G.K. edgeR: A bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 (19910308): 139-14010.1093/bioinformatics/btp616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21051) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C, and Table S1). Two biological replicates of ESCRT-II RNA immunoprecipitations showed a strong correlation in co-precipitating mRNAs, demonstrating that these data are highly reproducible (r = 0.92) (Fig. 1D). We validated the high-throughput sequencing results by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and found that ESCRT-II reproducibly interacts with top candidates identified by RIP-Seq but not with RNAs that are under-represented in the RIP-Seq library (Fig. 1E). Gene ontology analysis revealed that ESCRT-II–associated transcripts encode proteins involved with cell adhesion, membranes, the cytoskeleton/centrosome, and cell motility (31.Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat.

We concluded that mRNA binding by ESCRT-II is a conserved property of the complex and that ESCRT-II interacts with a wide variety of cellular mRNA.Table 1Gene ontology analysis of the ESCRT-II RIP-Seq libraryAnnotation clusterEnrichment scoreOver-represented clusters Cell adhesion6.85 Membranes3.86 Cytoskeleton/Centrosome3.63 Cell motility3.18Under-represented clusters Ribosomal/cytosolic proteins25.15 Mitochondria3.51 Glutathione S-transferase2.37 rRNA/ncRNA processing2.24 Open table in a new tab To determine whether ESCRT-II interacts directly with RNA targets and to determine which subunit of ESCRT-II is responsible for RNA binding, we performed UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) (33.Ule J. Jensen K. Mele A. Darnell R.B. CLIP: A method for identifying protein-RNA interaction sites in living cells.Methods. 2005; 37 (16314267): 376-38610.1016/j.ymeth.2005.07.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 34.Ule J.

In this assay, RNA–protein complexes were cross-linked by UV irradiation, and then ESCRT-II immunoprecipitations were performed under native conditions. The immunoprecipitations were subsequently treated with RNase A, and then any remaining cross-linked and protein-protected nucleic acids were radiolabeled. The isolated RNA–protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins bound directly to RNA were identified by the presence of the radiolabel. As a result, this assay not only reveals whether a protein of interest is directly bound to RNA, but in the case of an entire complex, may be used to identify the subunits of the complex that are responsible for RNA-binding. Our polyclonal ESCRT-II antibodies were raised against the entire ESCRT-II complex, but our ESCRT-II antibodies primarily recognize Vps25 and more weakly recognize Vps36 by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). However, immunoprecipitation for any ESCRT-II subunit co-immunoprecipitates the entire complex; therefore, any subunit of ESCRT-II that directly interacts with RNA will be detectable by this assay. Using this approach, we observed a radiolabeled band at 20 kDa, which is consistent with the molecular mass of Vps25 cross-linked to a short piece of RNA (3 kDa larger than Vps25 alone) (Fig. 2B). This band was absent in the mock immunoprecipitation as well as in a control performed without UV cross-linking. We did not observe any signals consistent with RNA binding to Vps22 or Vps36, although the presence of faint signals at molecular masses that are inconsistent with ESCRT-II subunits suggests that additional RNA-binding proteins associate with the complex. Together these results suggest that Vps25 is the RNA-binding subunit of ESCRT-II in Xenopus egg extract. To confirm that the radiolabeled 20-kDa band observed in the ESCRT-II immunoprecipitation was in fact Vps25 and not a co-immunoprecipitating protein of the same size, we repeated the UV cross-linking experiment under denaturing immunoprecipitation conditions. As our ESCRT-II antibodies preferentially recognize Vps25, under denaturing conditions only Vps25 was isolated (Fig. 2A). Consistently, the 20-kDa radiolabeled band remained when Vps25 was immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions, providing further evidence that Vps25 mediates RNA binding by ESCRT-II in Xenopus eggs (Fig. 2C). To determine whether ESCRT-II recognizes specific sequence motifs, we performed CLIP-Seq using the UV–cross-linked material that immunoprecipitated with Vps25 under denaturing conditions. Using the Illumina MiSeq platform, we obtained 11,167 unique, non-rRNA reads, which we aligned to a custom transcriptome derived from the Xenopus laevis 7.0 genome and our own sequencing data (35.Schweidenback C.T. Emerman A.B. Jambhekar A. Blower M.D. Evidence for multiple, distinct ADAR-containing complexes in Xenopus laevis.RNA. 2015; 21 (25519486): 279-29510.1261/rna.047787.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The unique reads aligned to 1640 transcripts (Table S1 and S3), of which 196 transcripts had more than one aligning read. In addition, 114 transcripts had multiple CLIP tags (uniquely aligned reads) that overlapped at a particular region of the transcript (pileups), suggesting a selective binding site of ESCRT-II on the mRNA (Fig. 3A). The presence of multiple CLIP tags correlated with greater enrichment in native ESCRT-II immunoprecipitations as revealed by high-throughput sequencing (Fig. 3B) and RT-qPCR (Fig. 3C), providing validation that Vps25 CLIP tags arise from RNAs that co-immunoprecipitate with the entire ESCRT-II complex. Our RIP-Seq data demonstrated that ESCRT-II selectively interacts with specific mRNA targets. This selective interaction could be achieved through the recognition of a sequence or structural element on the RNA target or through additional trans-acting factors associated with the transcripts, or it could be influenced by the local population of transcripts in the vicinity of ESCRT-II in vivo. To determine whether ESCRT-II exhibited sequence-specific RNA binding, we performed a motif analysis of the CLIP-Seq library using MEME (36.Bailey T.L. Boden M. Buske F.A. Frith M. Grant C.E. Clementi L. Ren J. Li W.W. Noble W.S. MEME suite: Tools for motif discovery and searching.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 (19458158): W202-W20810.1093/nar/gkp335Crossref PubMed Scopus (5949) Google Scholar). The top motif was a stretch of G and A nucleotides that appeared in 113 of 1640 of the CLIP-Seq transcripts and 14 of 114 of the CLIP-Seq transcripts that had multiple reads (Fig. 3D). Additionally, a poly-C motif was present in 96 of 1640 CLIP-Seq transcripts and 46 of 114 CLIP-Seq transcripts with multiple reads. In support of the possibility that the GA-rich motif promotes binding to ESCRT-II, we found that GA-rich sequences (having a 30-nucleotide stretch of at least 90% purines) were preferentially enriched in the ESCRT-II RIP-Seq library compared with other ESCRT-II–bound transcripts (Fig. 3E and Table 2) (p < 1 × 10−12 using a two-sided, unpaired t test). No other dinucleotide or single nucleotide motif displayed preferential enrichment in ESCRT-II immunoprecipitations, with the exception of stretches of cytosines, the second motif identified in the CLIP-Seq library (Table 2). We concluded that ESCRT-II binds preferentially to mRNAs containing specific sequence motifs in Xenopus egg extracts but that ESCRT-II is also likely to recognize multiple sequence motifs.Table 2Transcripts containing GA- or C-rich motifs are more enriched in ESCRT-II immunoprecipitations compared with the total RIP-Seq libraryTranscriptsMean enrichment valuep valueAll RIP-Seq transcripts1.59GA1.979.19 × 10−13AC1.780.06AU1.610.55CU1.60.88GU1.750.02CG1.670.2A1.650.24U1.680.21G1.60.88C1.837.76 × 10−5 Open table in a new tab Our results indicated that ESCRT-II interacts directly with RNA through the Vps25 subunit in Xenopus egg extracts and that the selective interaction between ESCRT-II and a portion of its RNA targets could be determined by recognition of a purine-rich motif. We next asked whether we could recapitulate sequence-specific RNA binding in vitro using purified components (Fig. 4A). We first determined whether recombinant ESCRT-II interacts selectively with purified RNAs through Vps25 in vitro. To address this question, we performed binding reactions between recombinant ESCRT-II and purified RNA from Xenopus egg extracts. We then performed in vitro UV cross-linking on the binding reactions using an approach similar to the CLIP protocol to identify the RNA-binding subunit of recombinant ESCRT-II. Surprisingly, we found that binding to total egg RNA in vitro occurred primarily through Vps22, with some detectable binding through Vps36 and Vps25 (Fig. 4B), which contrasts with our observation of RNA binding primarily through Vps25 in egg extract. Similar results were obtained using single in vitro transcribed RNAs corresponding to transcripts under-represented in an ESCRT-II immunoprecipitation, suggesting that this in vitro interaction is nonspecific (Fig. 4C). Vps22 and Vps36 both contain membrane-binding domains; Vps22 binds to membranes through its H0 domain (21.Im Y.J. Hurley J.H.

Here, the environmental consequences of a shift in prescription behavior from prednisolone to berberine was modeled using an environmental decision support system based on four consecutive steps: emission, fate, exposure and effect. This model estimates the relative aquatic and human health impacts of alternative pharmaceutical prescriptions throughout Europe. Since a Defined Daily Dose (DDD) of berberine has yet to be formulated, the environmental impacts of berberine and prednisolone were compared under the assumption of equal DDDs. Subsequently, the relative impact ratio indicates the extent to which the actual DDD of berberine might be higher to still be environmentally preferable over prednisolone. In fact, berberine can be administered at a six times higher dose throughout Europe before its impact on the aquatic environment exceeds that of one prescription of prednisolone. On average, the results for impacts on human health are similar, with the median impact ratio ranging between 5.87 and 22.8 depending on the level of drinking water purification. However, for some regions in Spain, Austria, Baltic States and Finland, berberine can only be considered an environmentally better alternative if it is administered at a lower dose than prednisolone. We conclude that for most regions in Europe it is, up until a certain dose of berberine, beneficial for the aquatic environment and therefore human health to prefer prescription of berberine over prednisolone."
https://openalex.org/W2807806065,"Modifications in surface glycans attached to proteins via N-acetylglucosamine-β1-N-asparagine linkage have been linked to tumor development and progression. These modifications include complex N-glycans with high levels of branching, fucose and sialic acid residues. Previously, we silenced Mgat2 in neuroblastoma (NB) cells, which halted the conversion of hybrid type N-glycans to complex type, to generate a novel cell line, NB_1(-Mgat2). By comparing the aberrant cell properties of the NB_1(-Mgat2) cell line to the parental cell line (NB_1), we investigated the impact of eliminating complex type N-glycans on NB cell behavior. Further, the N-glycosylation pathway in the NB_1(-Mgat2) cell line was rescued by transiently transfecting cells with Mgat2, thus creating the NB_1(-/+Mgat2) cell line. Changes in the N-glycosylation pathway were verified by enhanced binding of E-PHA and L-PHA to proteins in the rescued cell line relative to those of the NB_1(-Mgat2) cell line. Also, western blotting of total membranes from the rescued cell line ectopically expressing a voltage-gated K+ channel (Kv3.1b) revealed that N-glycans of Kv3.1b were processed to complex type. By employment of various cell lines, we demonstrated that reduction of the complex type N-glycans diminished anchorage-independent cell growth, and enhanced cell-cell interactions. Two independent cell invasion assays showed that cell invasiveness was markedly lessened by lowering the levels of complex type N-glycans while cell mobility was only slightly modified. Neurites of NB cells were shortened by the absence of complex type N-glycans. Cell proliferation was reduced in NB cells with lowered levels of complex type N-glycans which resulted from hindered progression through G1+Go phases of the cell cycle. Overall, our results illustrate that reducing the ratio of complex to hybrid types of N-glycans diminishes aberrant NB cell behavior and thereby has a suppressive effect in cell proliferation, and cell dissociation and invasion phases of NB."

https://openalex.org/W2808430170,"Epithelial cells form tissues with many functions, including secretion and environmental separation and protection. Glandular epithelial tissues comprise cysts and tubules that are formed from a polarized, single-epithelial cell layer surrounding a central, fluid-filled lumen. The pathways regulating key processes in epithelial tissue morphogenesis such as mitotic spindle formation are incompletely understood, but are important to investigate, as their dysregulation is a signature of epithelial tumors. Here, we describe a signaling axis that manifests in a defect in mitotic spindle orientation during epithelial growth and cystogenesis.

The spindle orientation defect arising from elevated levels of ARF6–GTP required an increase in cMet endocytosis, but was independent of E-cadherin internalization or elevated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity resulting from internalized receptor signaling on endosomes. Misorientation of the mitotic spindle resulted in the development of epithelial cysts with structural abnormalities, the most conspicuous of which was the presence of multiple intercellular lumens. Abnormal mitotic spindle orientation was necessary but insufficient to disrupt glandular development, as blocking the strong prosurvival signal resulting from ERK hyperactivation yielded structurally normal cysts despite continued manifestation of spindle orientation defects.

Our findings highlight a previously unknown link between ARF6 activation, cMet receptor internalization, and mitotic spindle orientation during epithelial glandular morphogenesis. The growth of multicellular organisms relies on the development of highly organized tissues with specialized functions. Within these organisms, epithelial cells form tissues which specialize in a host of functions including secretion, environmental segregation and protection, and sensation. These epithelial cells comprise the basic building blocks of glandular epithelial tissues wherein they form the polarized, single cell layer that surrounds a clear, fluid-filled lumen (1.Bryant D.M. Mostov K.E. From cells to organs: Building polarized tissue.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18946477): 887-90110.1038/nrm2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In vivo epithelial sheets organize to form spherical cysts and cylindrical tubules, the structural units of glandular tissue. Cysts and tubules are topologically equivalent, each cell within these units maintaining apical–basal polarity, with the apical surface facing the lumen, the basal domain adhering to underlying basement membrane, and the cell–cell interactions occurring through the lateral membrane (2.O'Brien L.E. Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Opinion. Building epithelial architecture: Insights from three-dimensional culture models.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Using this system we have previously reported on the development of aberrant glandular structures when epithelial cells are grown with sustained activation of ARF6. Constitutive and sustained ARF6 activation leads to the disassembly of cell–cell contacts followed by internalization of both E-cadherin and growth factor receptors that then accumulate in signaling endosomes. These signaling endosomes can then serve as platforms for hyperactive ERK signaling, which ultimately results in the formation of epithelial cysts with multiple lumens that contain surviving, matrix-deprived cells (4.Tushir J.S. Clancy J. Warren A. Wrobel C. Brugge J.S. D'Souza-Schorey C. Unregulated ARF6 activation in epithelial cysts generates hyperactive signaling endosomes and disrupts morphogenesis.Mol. Biol.

Proper development of glandular architecture is achieved through the combination of intercellular adhesion and tight control over mitotic spindle orientation to maintain tissue identity (5.Pease J.C. Tirnauer J.S. Mitotic spindle misorientation in cancer—out of alignment and into the fire.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124 (21402874): 1007-101610.1242/jcs.081406Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). During mitosis, spindle poles align such that the astral microtubules contact the lateral cortex allowing the cells to divide symmetrically within the plane of growth (5.Pease J.C. Tirnauer J.S. Mitotic spindle misorientation in cancer—out of alignment and into the fire.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124 (21402874): 1007-101610.1242/jcs.081406Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Dividing in this manner places the division plane between the cells and normal to the growth surface. Structurally, this ordered mitosis maintains the identity of both daughter cells and the tissue as a whole, allowing the daughter cells to inherit all three basic membrane domains (apical, lateral, and basal) and to remain adhered to the underlying substrate. In epithelial cells the loss of mitotic orientation has been coupled to perturbations in E-cadherin function (6.den Elzen N. Buttery C.V. Maddugoda M.P. Ren G. Yap A.S. Cadherin adhesion receptors orient the mitotic spindle during symmetric cell division in mammalian epithelia.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20 (19553471): 3740-375010.1091/mbc.e09-01-0023Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The loss of proper spindle orientation in simple planar epithelia results in cells dividing and growing out of the monolayer. In 3D basement membrane cultures of epithelial cysts, the loss of mitotic orientation can impact glandular morphogenesis. In cultures of intestinal epithelium, for example, the loss of Cdc42 led to unbiased cell divisions and the formation of cysts with multiple intercellular lumens-cysts bearing remarkable structural similarities to those found in MDCK cysts upon constitutive ARF6 activation (4.Tushir J.S.

Here we sought to investigate the cellular basis of multiple lumen formation in epithelial cysts downstream of ARF6 activation. We show that unregulated ARF6 activity leads to the loss of mitotic spindle orientation in MDCK cells and in 2D cultures; this results in the formation of abnormal glandular cysts with multiple lumens. Further, we have demonstrated that this shift in spindle orientation is independent of E-cadherin endocytosis or alterations in Cdc42–GTP, both known to promote the loss of normal spindle orientation (7.Jaffe A.B. Kaji N. Durgan J. Hall A. Cdc42 controls spindle orientation to position the apical surface during epithelial morphogenesis.J.

It is, however, dependent on the endocytosis of a cortical cue, as blocking dynamin-dependent endocytosis will restore the spindle angle and glandular morphology. Furthermore, activation of Rab35-regulated recycling restores normal mitotic spindle orientation together with a corresponding reduction in intracellular receptor levels. As the misorientation of spindle poles is a signature of some epithelial tumors, understanding the underlying cellular basis of this cellular abnormality is of high significance (5.Pease J.C. Tirnauer J.S. Mitotic spindle misorientation in cancer—out of alignment and into the fire.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124 (21402874): 1007-101610.1242/jcs.081406Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Given the multiple lumen phenotype induced by constitutive ARF6 activation in glandular cysts and the link between this phenotype and mitotic spindle orientation (4.Tushir J.S. Clancy J. Warren A. Wrobel C. Brugge J.S. D'Souza-Schorey C. Unregulated ARF6 activation in epithelial cysts generates hyperactive signaling endosomes and disrupts morphogenesis.Mol. Biol.

To this end, we used the previously described MDCK cell line that stably expresses the ARF6–GTP mutant, ARF6–Q67L, under the control of a tetracycline-responsive transactivator (hereon referred to as MDCKARF6–GTP) (14.Prigent M. Dubois T. Raposo G. Derrien V. Tenza D. Rossé C. Camonis J. Chavrier P. ARF6 controls post-endocytic recycling through its downstream exocyst complex effector.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163 (14662749): 1111-112110.1083/jcb.200305029Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Examination of the mitotic spindle angle in these cells revealed a robust defect in biased cell division. Unlike the parental control cells, which had a tightly regulated spindle angle almost universally within 10° of parallel to the growth surface (mean = 4.2°), MDCKARF6–GTP cells showed no significant grouping and an average spindle angle of 39.6° (Fig. 1, A–C and E). This spindle orientation defect was not because of stable incorporation of the constitutively active mutant of ARF6 as we saw similar results when treating parental cells with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known to increase endogenous ARF6–GTP levels (Fig. 1, D and E) (15.Palacios F. D'Souza-Schorey C. Modulation of Rac1 and ARF6 activation during epithelial cell scattering.J. Biol.

Because many of the proteins previously identified as playing a role in the maintenance of mitotic spindle orientation are components of the polarity complex, apical–basal polarity was assessed through the localization of two basolateral markers (β1-integrin and E-cadherin) and the apical marker gp-135. In the presence of ARF6–GTP, the basolateral markers β1-integrin (Fig. 1F) and E-cadherin (Fig. 1G) remained localized to the appropriate membrane domains. Gp-135 was exclusively localized to the apical surface of both MDCK and MDCKARF6–GTP cells (Fig. 1, F and G, red). Thus, expression of constitutively active ARF6 did not disturb the polarity of individual cells even if orientation of the mitotic spindle was perturbed. A key cellular role for ARF6 is regulation of endocytic membrane trafficking (16.D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. ARF proteins: Roles in membrane traffic and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7 (16633337): 347-35810.1038/nrm1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), and we have previously documented that inhibiting endocytosis, even in the presence of constitutive ARF6 activation, is sufficient to rescue glandular morphology (4.Tushir J.S. Clancy J. Warren A. Wrobel C. Brugge J.S. D'Souza-Schorey C. Unregulated ARF6 activation in epithelial cysts generates hyperactive signaling endosomes and disrupts morphogenesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21 (20462959): 2355-236610.1091/mbc.e09-09-0824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results led us to hypothesize that membrane endocytosis was likely facilitating mitotic spindle orientation in MDCK cells. To test this hypothesis, we first utilized Dynasore, the small molecule inhibitor of dynamin (17.Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dynasore, a cell-permeable inhibitor of dynamin.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10 (16740485): 839-85010.1016/j.devcel.2006.04.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Treatment of MDCKARF6–GTP cells with Dynasore resulted in a significant shift of spindle orientations back toward a parallel alignment with the growth surface, with an average spindle angle of 5.6° (Fig. 2, A and C). We note that potential off-target effects of Dynasore have been recently identified following treatment of triple KO fibroblasts depleted of endogenous Dnm1, Dnm2, and Dnm3 (18.Park R.J. Shen H. Liu L. Liu X. Ferguson S.M. De Camilli P. Dynamin triple knockout cells reveal off target effects of commonly used dynamin inhibitors.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 (24046449): 5305-531210.1242/jcs.138578Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The authors demonstrated alterations to peripheral actin ruffling and fluid-phase endocytosis in triple KO cells. To address the potential for off-target effects of the small molecule inhibitor in our system, we made use of MDCK cells stably expressing the dominant-negative mutant of ARF6, ARF6–T27N (MDCKARF6–GDP). We have previously shown that expression of ARF6–T27N blocks cell surface receptor internalization in MDCK cells via inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis (19.Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. ARF6-GTP recruits Nm23-H1 to facilitate dynamin-mediated endocytosis during adherens junctions disassembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4 (12447393): 929-93610.1038/ncb881Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Treatment of parental MDCK cells with HGF, a potent activator of ARF6, also resulted in a significant shift in mitotic spindle alignment. Conversely, HGF-stimulated MDCKARF6–GDP cells maintained normal mitotic spindle orientation. Again, there was tight grouping of spindle angles with an average shift of 5.1° from parallel (Fig. 2, B and C). This attenuation of spindle misalignment indicates that the HGF-mediated reorientation of the mitotic spindle requires subsequent activation of ARF6 and together these results indicate that the defect in spindle orientation seen with ARF6 activity depends on ARF6-regulated, and likely dynamin-mediated, endocytosis. Sustained ARF6 activation was previously documented to lead to increased ligand internalization including receptors such as cMet. Signaling through these intracellular receptors on endosomes led to robust and long-lived signaling resulting in high levels of phosphorylated (active) ERK (4.Tushir J.S. Clancy J. Warren A. Wrobel C. Brugge J.S. D'Souza-Schorey C. Unregulated ARF6 activation in epithelial cysts generates hyperactive signaling endosomes and disrupts morphogenesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21 (20462959): 2355-236610.1091/mbc.e09-09-0824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether the hyperactive ERK signaling emanating from “signaling endosomes” was responsible for the resulting spindle orientation defect. To this end we used the small molecule PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK, the kinase directly upstream of ERK, which readily blocks ERK activation in our model system (Fig. 3A). PD98059 treatment of MDCKARF6–GTP cells failed to restore normal spindle orientation (Fig. 3, B and C). PD98059 cells had a mean spindle angle of 50.1°, virtually indistinguishable from untreated MDCKARF6–GTP cells (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that the phospho-ERK signal arising from signaling endosomes is not responsible for the shift in spindle orientation upon ARF6 activation. In addition to receptor internalization, elevated ARF6–GTP in epithelial cells leads to the rapid and persistent internalization of E-cadherin from sites of cell–cell contacts. Indeed, in polarized epithelia, activation of ARF6 results in the disassembly of mature cadherin junctions and the internalization of E-cadherin via dynamin-dependent endocytosis where it appears in punctate, intracellular endosomal compartments (19.Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. ARF6-GTP recruits Nm23-H1 to facilitate dynamin-mediated endocytosis during adherens junctions disassembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4 (12447393): 929-93610.1038/ncb881Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 20.Palacios F. Price L. Schweitzer J. Collard J.G. D'Souza-Schorey C. An essential role for ARF6-regulated membrane traffic in adherens junction turnover and epithelial cell migration.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11532961): 4973-498610.1093/emboj/20.17.4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cadherin junction stability has previously been implicated in mitotic spindle regulation in mammalian cells, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans (6.den Elzen N. Buttery C.V. Maddugoda M.P. Ren G. Yap A.S. Cadherin adhesion receptors orient the mitotic spindle during symmetric cell division in mammalian epithelia.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20 (19553471): 3740-375010.1091/mbc.e09-01-0023Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, we questioned whether ARF6–GTP–mediated internalization of E-cadherin was responsible for the mitotic spindle defects in MDCKARF6–GTP cells. To uncouple the internalization of E-cadherin from additional cell surface cargo that is endocytosed in response to ARF6 activation, we utilized Wnt3A stimulation. In previous studies, we demonstrated that Wnt3A promotes ARF6 activation and cMet internalization resulting in hyperactive ERK signaling. This is turn leads to a series of intracellular signaling events prompting the destabilization of the adherens junctions and E-cadherin internalization (21.Pellon-Cardenas O. Clancy J. Uwimpuhwe H. D'Souza-Schorey C. ARF6-regulated endocytosis of growth factor receptors links cadherin-based adhesion to canonical Wnt signaling in epithelia.Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 33 (23716594): 2963-297510.1128/MCB.01698-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, treatment with PD98059 is expected to block Wnt3A-induced ERK activation and subsequent internalization of E-cadherin with no effect on cMet internalization. We confirmed the effect of Wnt3A and PD98059 on cMet and E-cadherin endocytosis (Fig. S1). Treatment of parental MDCK cells with Wnt3A resulted in a defect in mitotic spindle angle; the average spindle angle increased to 21.7° (Fig. 4, A and B). However co-treatment with PD98059 has no effect on spindle orientation as co-treated cells had a mean angle of 19.12° (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, the endocytosis of cMet and possibly additional cargo is responsible for the defect in spindle orientation seen with ARF6 activation; however, this is independent of ERK hyperactivation and the internalization E-cadherin. Rab35, a member of the Ras superfamily of monomeric G proteins has recently been shown to be a binding partner for the ARF6–GAP, ACAP2, and is also known to participate in cargo transport out of recycling endosomes (22.Allaire P.D. Marat A.L. Dall'Armi C. Di Paolo G. McPherson P.S. Ritter B. The Connecdenn DENN domain: A GEF for Rab35 mediating cargo-specific exit from early endosomes.Mol.

Furthermore, several reports have recently highlighted the antagonistic relationship between Rab35 and ARF6 wherein high levels of ARF6–GTP result in decreased Rab35 activation (26.Allaire P.D. Seyed Sadr M. Chaineau M. Seyed Sadr E. Konefal S. Fotouhi M. Maret D. Ritter B. Del Maestro R.F. McPherson P.S. Interplay between Rab35 and Arf6 controls cargo recycling to coordinate cell adhesion and migration.J.

Rab35, acting through ACAP2 switching off Arf6, negatively regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25 (24600047): 1532-154210.1091/mbc.e13-10-0600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first confirmed that ACAP2 and Rab35 co-precipitated with active ARF6 (Fig. 5A). Next, we observed that expression of constitutively active Rab35, Rab35(Q67L), in MDCKARF6–GTP cells resulted in an average spindle angle of 12.6°, rescuing the spindle angle orientation (Fig. 5, B and C). Further, the Rab35–Q67L expressing cells contained reduced amounts of internal cMet (Fig. 5, D and E). We also found that constitutive activation of Rab35 in MDCKARF6–GTP cells did not alter the intracellular accumulation of E-cadherin (Fig. 5F). Taken together, these results indicate that the disruption of intracellular signaling compartments by triggering the fast recycling of receptors and possibly additional cargoes restores proper mitotic spindle orientation. Prior reports have linked the loss of mitotic orientation to development of epithelial cysts with a multilumen phenotype similar to that arising from hyperactive ARF6 (4.Tushir J.S. Clancy J. Warren A. Wrobel C. Brugge J.S. D'Souza-Schorey C. Unregulated ARF6 activation in epithelial cysts generates hyperactive signaling endosomes and disrupts morphogenesis.Mol. Biol.

In line with the results above, ARF6–Q67L expression resulted in a profound defect in mitotic spindle angle when measured relative to the approximate center of mass of the cyst (Fig. 6, A and B). The majority of MDCKARF6–GTP cells were seen dividing such that chromosomes aligned at metaphase were nearly perpendicular (average 77.7°) to the radius of the cyst (Fig. 6, B and D). This is in stark contrast to parental cells in which the metaphase plate was parallel to the cyst radius with an average angle of 18.4° (Fig. 6, C and D). In light of previous research demonstrating that depletion of Cdc42–GTP results in the formation of multilumen cysts stemming from abnormal mitotic spindle orientation (7.Jaffe A.B. Kaji N. Durgan J. Hall A. Cdc42 controls spindle orientation to position the apical surface during epithelial morphogenesis.J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 29 (19273597): 2816-282710.1128/MCB.01713-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we examined the amount of active Cdc42 in MDCKARF6–GTP cells. We saw no reduction in the amount of Cdc42–GTP in MDCKARF6–GTP cysts (Fig. 6E). Additionally, expression of constitutively active Cdc42 (Cdc42–G12V) in MDCKARF6–GTP cells did not rescue spindle orientation defects (Fig. 6F), nor did overexpression of WT HA–Cdc42 lead to a reorientation of the mitotic spindle in parental MDCK cells (Fig. 6G). These results demonstrate that ARF6 activation alters mitotic spindle orientation in 3D cultures of epithelial cells, contributing to the formation of abnormal glandular structures, and these effects are independent of Cdc42 activity. The aberrant endocytosis stemming from elevated levels of ARF6–GTP has a profound effect on the development of epithelial glandular architecture (4.Tushir J.S. Clancy J. Warren A. Wrobel C. Brugge J.S. D'Souza-Schorey C. Unregulated ARF6 activation in epithelial cysts generates hyperactive signaling endosomes and disrupts morphogenesis.Mol. Biol.

As such, we sought to investigate the contribution of signaling endosome formation to mitotic spindle orientation and epithelial cystogenesis. Consistent with previous results, inhibiting dynamin-dependent endocytosis dow"
