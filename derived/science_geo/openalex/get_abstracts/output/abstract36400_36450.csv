https://openalex.org/W2054649519,"A ring-deleted analog of atrial natriuretic factor--des[Gln18, Ser19, Gly20, Leu21, Gly22] ANF4-23-NH2 (C-ANF4-23)--binds with high affinity to approximately 99% of ANF receptors in the isolated perfused rat kidney. In this preparation, C-ANF4-23 is devoid of detectable renal effects and does not antagonize any of the known renal hemodynamic and natriuretic actions of biologically active ANF1-28. In contrast, both C-ANF4-23 and ANF1-28 increase sodium excretion and decrease blood pressure in intact anesthetized rats. This apparent contradiction is resolved by the finding that the ring-deleted analog markedly increases plasma levels of endogenous immunoreactive ANF in the rat. The results show that the majority of the renal receptors of ANF are biologically silent. This new class of receptors may serve as specific peripheral storage-clearance binding sites, acting as a hormonal buffer system to modulate plasma levels of ANF."

https://openalex.org/W2006913937,"The gene for the human platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor has been cloned with oligonucleotides corresponding to the partial amino acid sequence of the purified receptor. The identity of this gene has been confirmed by the binding of alpha 2-adrenergic ligands to the cloned receptor expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The deduced amino acid sequence is most similar to the recently cloned human beta 2- and beta 1-adrenergic receptors; however, similarities to the muscarinic cholinergic receptors are also evident. Two related genes have been identified by low stringency Southern blot analysis. These genes may represent additional alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2059855350,"To investigate whether a particular receptor subtype can be coupled to multiple effector systems, recombinant M2 muscarinic receptors were expressed in cells lacking endogenous receptor. The muscarinic agonist carbachol both inhibited adenylyl cyclase and stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis was significantly less efficient and more dependent on receptor levels than the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Both responses were mediated by guanine nucleotide binding proteins, as evidenced by their inhibition by pertussis toxin; the more efficiently coupled adenylyl cyclase response was significantly more sensitive. Thus, individual subtypes of a given receptor are capable of regulating multiple effector pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1972200772,"Adhesion plaques, specialized regions of the plasma membrane where a cell contacts its substratum, are dynamic structures. However, little is known about how the protein-protein interactions that occur at adhesion plaques are controlled. One mechanism by which a cell might modulate its associations with the substratum is by selective, regulated proteolysis of an adhesion plaque component. Here we show that the catalytic subunit of the calcium-dependent protease type II (CDP-II) is localized in adhesion plaques of several cell types (BS-C-1, EBTr, and MDBK). We have compared the susceptibility of the adhesion plaque constituents vinculin, talin, and α-actinin to calcium-dependent proteolysis in vitro and have found talin to be the preferred substrate for CDP-II. The colocalization of a calcium-requiring proteolytic enzyme and talin in adhesion plaques raises the possibility that calcium-dependent proteolytic activity provides a mechanism for regulating some aspect of adhesion plaque physiology and function via cleavage of talin."
https://openalex.org/W1973245080,"Genetic analyses suggested that the opaque-2 (o2) locus in maize acts as a positive, transacting, transcriptional activator of the zein seed storage-protein genes. Because isolation of the gene is requisite to understanding the molecular details of this regulation, transposon mutagenesis with the transposable element suppressor-mutator (Spm) was carried out, and three mutable o2 alleles were obtained. One of these alleles contained an 8.3-kilobase autonomous Spm, another a 6.8-kilobase nonautonomous Spm, and the third an unidentified transposon that is unrelated to Spm. A DNA sequence flanking the autonomous Spm insertion was verified to be o2-specific and provided a probe to clone a wild-type allele. Northern blots indicated that the gene is expressed in wild-type endosperm but not in leaf tissues or in endosperms homozygous for a mutant allele of the O2 gene. A transcript was detected in endosperms homozygous for mutations at opaque-7 and floury-2, an indication that O2 expression is independent of these two other putative regulators of zein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2053877940,"We have identified a set of Tn5-generated mutants of Rhizobium meliloti on the basis of their failure to form a fluorescent halo under UV light when grown on agar medium containing Calcofluor. These mutations define a new genetic locus we have termed exoH. Alfalfa seedlings inoculated with exoH mutants form ineffective nodules that do not contain intracellular bacteria or bacteroids. Root hair curling is significantly delayed and infection threads abort in the nodule cortex. Analyses of exopolysaccharide secreted by exoH mutants have shown that it is identical to the Calcofluor-binding exopolysaccharide secreted by the exoH+ parental strain except for the fact that it completely lacks the succinyl modification. In vitro translation of total RNA isolated from nodules induced by an exoH mutant has shown that only one of the plant-encoded nodulins is induced, as compared with the 17 nodulins induced by wild-type strains. These observations suggest that succinylation of the bacterial polysaccharide is important for its role(s) in nodule invasion and possibly nodule development."
https://openalex.org/W2027532032,"The T antigen specified by SV40 virus is the only viral-encoded protein required for replication of SV40 DNA. T antigen has two activities that appear to be essential for viral DNA replication: specific binding to duplex DNA at the origin of replication and helicase activity that unwinds the two DNA strands. As judged by electron microscopy, DNA unwinding is initiated at the origin of replication and proceeds bidirectionally. Either linear or circular DNA molecules containing the origin of replication are effective substrates; with closed circular DNA, a topoisomerase capable of removing positive superhelical turns is required for an efficient reaction. Presence of an origin sequence on duplex DNA and a single-strand DNA-binding protein appear to be the only requirements for T antigen to catalyze unwinding. This reaction mediated by T antigen defines a likely pathway to precise initiation of DNA replication: (i) the sequence-specific binding activity locates the origin sequence, (ii) the duplex DNA is unwound at this site, and (iii) the DNA polymerase and primase begin DNA replication. A similar pathway has been inferred for the localized initiation of DNA replication by bacteriophage λ and by Escherichia coli in which a sequence-specific binding protein locates the origin and directs the DnaB helicase to this site. Observations with the SV40 system indicate that localized initiation of duplex DNA replication may be similar for prokaryotes and eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1513202942,"Angiotensin II stimulates sequential phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of initially the polyphosphoinositides and subsequently phosphatidylinositol (PI) in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells resulting in biphasic, sustained formation of diacylglycerol (DG). The mechanisms underlying this delayed induction of sustained DG accumulation are unknown but may be related to cellular events including processing of the angiotensin II receptor-ligand complex. In the present study, we characterized the kinetics of angiotensin II receptor sequestration and studied the effects of interventions which interfere with receptor processing on the pattern of angiotensin II-induced DG formation and phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Conversion of the angiotensin II receptor to an acid-resistant form was temperature-dependent, with half-times of 1.5 min at 37 degrees C and 7 min at 19 degrees C. Reducing the temperature to 25 or 19 degrees C caused a marked temporal separation between the two phases of DG accumulation. There was a close temporal correlation between the effect of temperature on receptor sequestration and on sustained DG accumulation. Furthermore, phenylarsine oxide (5 min, 10 microM), which inhibited angiotensin II receptor internalization, also selectively inhibited the sustained phase of DG accumulation (81 +/- 6% inhibition). Monensin and chloroquine, which interfere with receptor processing through the lysosomal-degradative pathway, had no effect on angiotensin II-induced DG formation in these cells, suggesting that the processing event important to hormonally induced sustained DG accumulation occurs early in the internalization pathway, probably at the level of the plasma membrane. Moreover, the acid-resistant state of the angiotensin II receptor-ligand complex retained its ability to signal, since removal of the surface signal by competitive antagonism with Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II or acid-wash only slowly reversed accumulation of DG and depression of total cell calcium. These experiments support our previous observation that the initial and sustained phases of angiotensin II-induced diacylglycerol formation in vascular smooth muscle are differentially controlled and suggest that an early event in the cellular processing of the angiotensin II-receptor complex is essential to maintenance of DG accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1991078253,Cytochrome c and cytochrome b5 form an electrostatically associated electron transfer complex. Computer models of this and related complexes that were generated by docking the x-ray structures of the individual proteins have provided insight into the specificity and mechanism of electron transfer reactions. Previous static modeling studies were extended by molecular dynamics simulations of a cytochrome c-cytochrome b5 intermolecular complex. The simulations indicate that electrostatic interactions at the molecular interface results in a flexible association complex that samples alternative interheme geometries and molecular conformations. Many of these transient geometries appear to be more favorable for electron transfer than those formed in the initial model complex. Of particular interest is a conformational change that occurred in phenylalanine 82 of cytochrome c that allowed the phenyl side chain to bridge the two cytochrome heme groups.
https://openalex.org/W1603838026,"Abstract The multihormonal regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was studied using chimeric genes composed of various regions of the PEPCK gene promoter region fused to the coding sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. These constructions, transfected into H4IIE hepatoma cells, are regulated like the endogenous PEPCK gene: dexamethasone and cAMP both stimulate PEPCK-CAT gene expression and their effects are additive; insulin inhibits the individual or combined effects of these stimulatory agents; and insulin inhibits dexamethasone-stimulated PEPCK-CAT fusion gene expression in a concentration-dependent fashion that is half-maximal at 10(-11) M. The induction by dexamethasone and the inhibition by insulin is specific for the DNA sequences that flank the 5' end of the PEPCK gene because similar effects were not observed for a plasmid in which the promoter and enhancer sequences of simian virus 40 (SV40) are fused to CAT. These results imply that the DNA adjacent to the transcription start site of the PEPCK gene contains the cis-acting hormone response elements responsible for the multihormonal regulation of this gene, including the insulin response."
https://openalex.org/W1791589681,"The precursor of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein ADP/ATP carrier is cytoplasmically synthesized without an amino-terminal peptide extension. We constructed a truncated precursor lacking the 103 amino acids from the amino terminus (about a third of the protein). Import of the truncated precursor into mitochondria showed the import characteristics of the authentic precursor, including nucleoside triphosphate dependence, requirement for a protease-sensitive component on the mitochondrial surface, two-step specific binding to the outer membrane, and membrane potential-dependent translocation into the inner membrane. We conclude that, in contrast to all other mitochondrial precursor proteins studied so far, domains of the ADP/ATP carrier distant from the amino terminus can carry specific targeting information for transport into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1598451699,"Abstract Human neutrophils synthesize platelet-activating factor (PAF) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) when stimulated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. These processes are enhanced to a variable extent by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a direct activator of protein kinase C. The long chain amines sphingosine, stearylamine (Hannun, Y.A., Loomis, C.R., Merrill, A.H., Jr., and Bell, R.M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12604-12609), and palmitoylcarnitine competitively inhibit activation of purified protein kinase C in vitro and inhibit protein kinase C-mediated activation of the respiratory burst in human neutrophils (Wilson, E., Olcott, M.C., Bell, R.M., Merrill, A.H., Jr., and Lambeth, J.D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12616-12623). These amines were found to inhibit A23187-induced PAF and LTB4 synthesis. Inhibition of PAF and LTB4 synthesis occurred in parallel; half-maximal inhibition by sphingosine occurred at 7 microM, with complete inhibition at 15 microM. PMA by itself did not induce the synthesis of PAF or LTB4, although it did enhance PAF and LTB4 synthesis at suboptimal concentrations of A23187. PMA reversed long chain amine inhibition of PAF and LTB4 accumulation. Reversal of the inhibition of PAF and LTB4 accumulation occurred in parallel, was concentration-dependent, and was complete by approximately 3 x 10(-8) M PMA. The inactive 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate ester did not reverse inhibition at these concentrations. Sphingosine completely prevented the A23187-induced release of [3H]arachidonate and its various metabolites from [3H]arachidonate-labeled cells. PMA, but not 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate, restored arachidonate release and its metabolism. Therefore, while activation of protein kinase C is not sufficient to induce PAF and LTB4 synthesis, its action appears to be required to couple a rise in intracellular Ca2+ to their synthesis. This coupling occurs at the level of the initial reaction in the production of lipid mediators, a phospholipase A2-like activity that mobilizes the two substrates 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and arachidonic acid from complex lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1582951014,"Abstract A chimeric gene was constructed in which sequences between 253 base pairs (bp) upstream of the start of transcription of the human pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene and 117 bp downstream of that site were fused to the human alpha 1-globin gene, at a site immediately upstream of the globin initiation codon. Expression of this and subsequent chimeric gene constructions was investigated in microinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes. Presence of 253 bp of pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene promoter sequences, containing a CAAT box and a TATA box, resulted in a relatively modest level of expression of the linked globin sequences. Lengthening of the pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene promoter region to include 2400 bp of upstream sequences, increased transcription of the marker gene to some extent. Strong activation of transcription was obtained when a 782-bp fragment of the first intron of the collagen gene was introduced in chimeric constructions containing only 240 bp of the collagen promoter. An enhancing effect of the intron segment on expression of the marker gene was observed from downstream or upstream positions relative to the initiation site of transcription. Sequencing of the intron segment revealed the presence of four decanucleotide consensus sites for binding of the constitutive transcription factor Sp1, as well as an enhancer core motif. Our experiments also showed that the cis-acting region strongly enhance the activity of the pro-alpha 1(I) promoter in transfected fibroblasts. On the basis of these observations we conclude that the segment broadly located between +700 and +1300 in the first intron of the human pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene contains cis-acting sequences with an enhancer effect on transcription of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1567122856,"Evidence for the presence of a quinol oxidase super-complex composed of a cytochrome bc1 complex and cytochrome oxidase in the respiratory chain of a Gram-positive thermophilic bacterium PS3 is reported. On incubation with an octyl glucoside-solubilized fraction of the total membranes of PS3 anti-serum against PS3 cytochrome oxidase gave an immunoprecipitate that showed both quinol-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase activities. When the cholate-deoxycholate and LiCl-treated membranes of PS3 were solubilized and subjected to ion-exchange chromatography in the presence of octaethyleneglycol dodecyl ether, most of the A-, B-, and C-type cytochromes were copurified as a peak having both quinol-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase activities. The immunoprecipitate and quinol oxidase preparation contained hemes a, b, and c in a ratio of about 2:2:3, indicating the presence of one-to-one complex of cytochrome oxidase containing 2 hemes a and one heme c, and a bc1 complex containing 2 hemes b and 2 hemes c. Gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate showed that the immunoprecipitate and quinol oxidase preparation were composed of seven subunits; those of 51 (56-kDa), 38, and 22 kDa for cytochrome oxidase and those of 29, 23, 21, and 14 kDa for the bc1 complex. The 38-, 29-, and 21 kDa components possessed covalently bound heme c. The apparent molecular mass of the super complex was estimated to be as 380 kDa by gel filtration."

https://openalex.org/W2005592280,"A major problem in treatment of cancers arising in steroid-sensitive cells is their inevitable progression to a steroid-insensitive state; current therapies are based on the assumption that hormone insensitivity is associated with loss of receptor. We demonstrate for the first time that breast tumor cells can progress to steroid insensitivity in spite of functional steroid receptors. Transfection of the steroid-inducible LTR-C3 gene into unresponsive S115 mouse mammary tumor cells results in full inducibility of that gene with both androgen and glucocorticoid. Thus, although all known endogenous inducible parameters are lost, the steroid sensitivity of a transfected exogenous gene demonstrates that the machinery for steroid responsiveness is still fully functional. Furthermore, these transfected genes retain steroid sensitivity only while steroid is present; on prolonged withdrawal of steroid, they lose responsiveness, implying an epigenetic mechanism is involved."
https://openalex.org/W1539159860,"Hydrogenase I (bidirectional) and hydrogenase II (uptake) of Clostridium pasteurianum have been investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, in the presence and absence of the inhibitor, CO. These hydrogenases contain both a novel type of iron-sulfur cluster (H), which is the proposed site of H2 catalysis, and ferredoxin-type [4Fe-4S] clusters (F). The results show that the H clusters of these two hydrogenases have very different properties. The H cluster of oxidized hydrogenase II (Hox-II) exhibits three distinct EPR signals, two of which are pH-dependent. Hox-II binds CO reversibly to give a single, pH-independent species with a novel, rhombic EPR spectrum. The H cluster of reduced hydrogenase II (Hred-II) does not react with CO. In contrast, the EPR spectrum of Hox-I appears homogeneous and independent of pH. Hox-I has a much lower affinity for CO than Hox-II, and binds CO irreversibly to give an axial EPR signal. Hred-I also binds CO irreversibly. The EPR spectra of Fred-I and Fred-II show little or no change after CO treatment. Prior exposure to CO does not affect the catalytic activity of the reduced or oxidized hydrogenases when assayed in the absence of CO, but both enzymes are irreversibly inactivated if CO is present during catalysis. Mechanisms for H2 activation by hydrogenase I and hydrogenase II are proposed from the determined midpoint potentials (Em, pH 8.0) of H-I and H-II (Em approximately −400 mV, −CO; approximately −360 mV, +CO), F-I (Em = −420 mV, +/− CO), and F-II (Em = −180 mV, +/- CO). These allow one to rationalize the different modes of CO binding to the two hydrogenases and suggest why hydrogenase II preferentially catalyzes H2 oxidation. The results are discussed in light of recent spectroscopic data on the structures of the two H clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2165968581,"The membrane-associated phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.41) was purified 2,300-fold from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The purification procedure included Triton X-100 solubilization of mitochondrial membranes, CDP-diacylglycerol-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The procedure resulted in a nearly homogeneous enzyme preparation as determined by native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiation inactivation of mitochondrial associated and purified CDP-diacylglycerol synthase suggested that the molecular weight of the native enzyme was 114,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme preparation yielded two subunits with molecular weights of 56,000 and 54,000. Antibodies prepared against the purified enzyme immunoprecipitated CDP-diacylglycerol synthase activity and subunits. CDP-diacylglycerol synthase activity was dependent on magnesium ions and Triton X-100 at pH 6.5. Thio-reactive agents inhibited activity. The activation energy for the reaction was 9 kcal/mol, and the enzyme was thermally labile above 30 degrees C. The Km values for CTP and phosphatidate were 1 and 0.5 mM, respectively, and the Vmax was 4,700 nmol/min/mg. Results of kinetic and isotopic exchange reactions suggested that the enzyme catalyzes a sequential Bi Bi reaction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2120633292,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) is an important second-messenger molecule that mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores in response to the occupancy of receptor by various Ca2+-mobilizing agonists. The fate of Ins-1,4,5-P3 is determined by two enzymes, a 3-kinase and a 5-phosphomonoesterase. The first enzyme converts Ins-1,4,5-P3 to Ins-1,3,4,5-P4, whereas the latter forms Ins-1,4-P2. Recent studies suggest that Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 might modulate the entry of Ca2+ from an extracellular source. In the current report, we describe the partial purification of the 3-kinase [approximately 400-fold purified, specific activity = 0.12 mumol/(min.mg)] from the cytosolic fraction of bovine brain and studies of its catalytic properties. We found that the 3-kinase activity is significantly activated by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex. Therefore, we propose that Ca2+ mobilized from endoplasmic reticulum by the action of Ins-1,4,5-P3 forms a complex with calmodulin, and that the Ca2+/calmodulin complex stimulates the conversion of Ins-1,4,5-P3, an intracellular Ca2+ mobilizer, to Ins-1,3,4,5-P4, an extracellular Ca2+ mobilizer. A rapid assay method for the 3-kinase was developed that is based on the separation of [3-32P]Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 and [gamma-32P]ATP by thin-layer chromatography. Using this new assay method, we evaluated kinetic parameters (Km for ATP = 40 microM, Km for Ins-1,4,5-P3 = 0.7 microM, Ki for ADP = 12 microM) and divalent cation specificity (Mg2+ much greater than Mn2+ greater than Ca2+) for the 3-kinase. Studies with various inositol polyphosphates indicate that the substrate-binding site is quite specific to Ins-1,4,5-P3. Nevertheless, Ins-2,4,5-P3 could be phosphorylated at a velocity approximately 1/20-1/30 that of Ins-1,4,5-P3."

https://openalex.org/W1866700903,"The interaction of calmodulin with calcineurin, a calcium- and calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase, was investigated using a solid-phase assay. Binding of 125I-calmodulin by calcineurin immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane filters was of high affinity, reversible, and calcium-dependent. Complex binding kinetics reflected a time- and calcium/calmodulin-dependent conformational change of calcineurin which was shown to be ligand-induced renaturation. After renaturation and removal of calmodulin, immobilized calcineurin exhibited simple 125I-calmodulin binding kinetics with a single class of independent sites. The maximum stoichiometry of 125I-calmodulin binding to immobilized calcineurin was 0.1 mol/mol. The association rate (K1 = 8.9 x 10(3) M-1 S-1) and the dissociation rate (K-1 = 8.5 x 10(-5) s-1) yielded a dissociation constant of Kd = 10 nM. Equilibrium binding analyses gave a Kd value of 16 nM. The affinity of 125I-calmodulin for immobilized calcineurin was half that of unmodified calmodulin. Using equilibrium competition experiments, we determined, for the first time, the dissociation constant for the binding of native calmodulin by calcineurin in solution, Kd less than or equal to 0.1 nM (Kd for 125I-calmodulin = 0.23 +/- 0.09 nM). The effects of ionic strength and pH on 125I-calmodulin binding to immobilized calcineurin were characterized. The dissociation rate was dependent on free calcium concentration, with half-maximal rate at 700 nM calcium. 125I-Calmodulin equilibrium binding by the immobilized A subunit of calcineurin exhibited half the affinity of the holoenzyme, Kd = 30 nM. The described phenomenon, of reversible denaturation associated with immobilization of a protein on nitrocellulose, may be a general one open to exploitation in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W1551787313,"Abstract We have recently shown (Lindahl, P. A., Day, E. P., Kent, T. A., Orme-Johnson, W. H., and Munck, E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11160-11173) that the [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster of the native Fe protein can exist in two forms characterized by different cluster spin: an S = 1/2 state exhibiting a g = 1.94 type EPR signal and an S = 3/2 state yielding signals at g approximately 5.8 and 5.1. We have now extended our study of the Fe protein to include the MgATP- and MgADP-bound forms. The [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster of the nucleotide-bound Fe protein exists in a similar S = 1/2, S = 3/2 spin mixture. The S = 3/2 cluster exhibits a broad EPR signal at g approximately 4.8. In spectra of the MgATP-bound protein, we have also observed a g = 4.3 signal from an S = 5/2 state (D = 1 - 3 cm-1, E/D approximately 0.32). Various experiments strongly suggest that this signal does not originate from adventitiously bound Fe3+. The g = 4.3 signal may arise from approximately 2% of the [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters when MgATP is protein-bound. We have also discovered substoichiometric amounts of what appears to be ADP in some nominally nucleotide-free Fe protein samples. MgATP binds to Fe protein in the presence of perturbing solvents, resulting in EPR spectra similar to those of MgATP-bound samples in aqueous solutions; MgADP binding, on the other hand, results in signals more typical of the solvent state. Spectra of samples frozen during turnover of the nitrogenase system exhibit a mixture of spin states. Characterization of the Fe protein EPR signature described here should aid future mechanistic and nucleotide-binding studies."

When spleen cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated secondary recipients, clonal erythroleukemias or B cell lymphomas expressing the v-fms-coded glycoprotein developed. Other secondary recipients repopulated by “unmarked” progenitor cells or by cryptic provirus-positive precursors present in the spleens of the same donor mice did not develop disease; thus cells expressing v-fms did not invariably have a proliferative advantage after transplantation. Several primary engrafted recipients developed myeloproliferative disorders that were provirus-positive without evidence of clonality.

https://openalex.org/W1495809390,"Abstract 5-Ethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), which is currently being pursued for the topical treatment of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections in humans. Using [4-14C]EDU as the radiolabeled analogue of EDU, it was ascertained that, at antivirally active doses, EDU is phosphorylated to a much greater extent by HSV-infected Vero cells than by mock-infected cells. Within the HSV-1-infected cells, EDU was incorporated to a much greater extent into viral DNA than cellular DNA. Using varying doses of EDU, a close correlation was found between the incorporation of EDU into viral DNA, the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis, and the inhibition of virus yield. It is postulated that the selectivity of EDU as an antiviral agent depends on both its preferential phosphorylation by the virus-infected cell and its preferential incorporation into viral DNA. The latter than results in a suppression of viral DNA synthesis and, hence, shutoff of viral progeny formation."

https://openalex.org/W83690124,"Previous work has shown that 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) and 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) may be metabolized in the mammalian kidney through a side chain oxidation pathway resulting in C23-C24 cleavage, yielding 24,25,26,27-tetranor-23-OH-D3. In the present study, we have used UMR-106 clonal osteoblast cells to demonstrate that products of the side chain oxidation pathway are produced by an osteoblast-like cell. Cells cultured on microcarrier beads and incubated in the presence of pharmacological levels of substrate (1.4 microM, either 25-OH-D3 or 1,25-(OH)2D3) produced sufficient quantities of metabolite to allow identification through mass spectrometry. In addition, putative metabolites were identified through comigration with authentic standards on three high pressure liquid chromatography systems, chemical modification by NaBH4 and periodate, and UV spectral characterization. The pathway was undetectable unless the cells had been exposed to 1,25-(OH)2D3 prior to incubation with substrate. We have shown that 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces the 24-hydroxylase and perhaps also the other enzymes of this pathway in the bone cell. Although we used pharmacological concentrations of substrate to demonstrate the existence of the side chain oxidation pathway in bone cells, physiological levels of 25-OH-D3 or 1,25-(OH)2D3 were also metabolized through the pathway, at least as far as the penultimate product. We speculate that the side chain oxidation pathway may be ubiquitous among vitamin D target tissues."

The exonuclease activities can be inactivated selectively by an oxidation reaction that requires molecular oxygen, a reducing agent, and iron at a concentration less than or equimolar to that of the gene 5 protein. Both exonuclease activities can be diminished by several thousandfold, with only a small decline in the polymerase activity. Escherichia coli thioredoxin, an accessory protein that binds tightly to the gene 5 protein and increases the processivity of the polymerization reaction, has no effect on the rate of oxidation. We propose that iron binds specifically to the exonuclease domain and, in the presence of molecular oxygen and a reducing agent, generates reactive oxygen species that selectively modify amino acid residues essential for the exonuclease activities."
https://openalex.org/W1625185791,"Treatment of thymic lymphocytes with the mitogenic lectin concanavalin A (ConA) increases the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and stimulates phosphoinositide turnover. ConA also induced a rapid, amiloride-sensitive, Na+-dependent increase in cytosolic pH of 0.13 +/- 0.01, indicative of stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiport. To investigate the mechanism underlying activation of Na+/H+ exchange by ConA, the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration changes induced by this lectin were precluded by loading the cells with Ca2+-buffering agents and suspension in Ca2+-free media. Under these conditions, the ConA-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization proceeded normally. Two approaches were used to assess the role of protein kinase C. First, this enzyme was inhibited by the addition of 1-(5-isoquinolinysulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine. In the presence of this potent antagonist, stimulation of the antiport by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was greatly inhibited. In contrast, stimulation by ConA was unaffected. Second, protein kinase C was depleted by overnight incubation with phorbol esters. Following this treatment, Na+/H+ exchange was no longer activated by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate, but was still stimulated by ConA. These data suggest that a Ca2+- and protein kinase C-independent mechanisms mediates the activation of Na+/H+ exchange by ConA. The possible role of GTP-binding proteins in the activation was also studied. The antiport was not stimulated by either fluoroaluminate or vanadate. Moreover, pretreatment with pertussis toxin failed to inhibit the ConA-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization. In contrast, preincubation with cholera toxin partially inhibited activation. Under these conditions, cholera toxin significantly elevated intracellular cAMP levels. Inhibition was also observed in cells treated with forskolin at concentrations that increased [cAMP]. The data suggest that a novel cAMP-sensitive signaling mechanism not involving Ca2+ and protein kinase C is involved in the stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange by mitogens in T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1496054687,"Abstract A previously unreported single-stranded DNA-dependent nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase with DNA unwinding activity has been purified from extracts of Escherichia coli lacking the F factor. Fractions of the purified enzyme contain a major polypeptide of Mr = 75,000 which contains the active site(s) for both ATP hydrolysis and helicase activity. This is consistent with the results of gel filtration chromatography which indicate a native molecular mass of 75 kDa. The 75-kDa helicase has a preference for ATP (dATP) as a substrate in the hydrolysis reaction and requires the presence of a single-stranded DNA cofactor. The helicase reaction catalyzed by the enzyme has been characterized using an in vitro strand displacement assay. The 75-kDa helicase displaces a 71-nucleotide DNA fragment in an enzyme concentration-dependent and time-dependent reaction. The helicase reaction depends on the presence of a hydrolyzable nucleoside 5'-triphosphate (NTP) suggesting that NTP hydrolysis is required for the unwinding activity. In addition, the enzyme can displace a 343-nucleotide DNA fragment albeit less efficiently. The direction of the unwinding reaction is 3' to 5' with respect to the strand of DNA on which the enzyme is bound. The molecular size of this helicase and the direction of the unwinding reaction are similar to both helicase II and Rep protein. However, the 75-kDa helicase has been shown to be distinct from both helicase II and Rep protein using immunological, physical, and genetic criteria. The discovery of a new helicase brings the total number of helicases found in E. coli cell extracts (lacking F factor) to five."
https://openalex.org/W1576306931,"This study describes evidence for the existence of a H+/glycine symport system in rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles. An inward proton gradient stimulates glycine transport across the brush-border membrane, and this H+-driven glycine uptake is attenuated by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. It is a positive rheogenic process, i.e. the H+-dependent glycine uptake is further enhanced by an intravesicular negative potential. Glycine uptake is stimulated to a lesser degree by an inward Na+ gradient. H+-dependent glycine uptake is inhibited by sarcosine (69%), an analog amino acid, imino acids (proline 81%, hydroxy proline 67%), and beta-alanine (31%), but not by neutral (L-leucine) or basic (L-lysine) amino acids. The results demonstrate that H+ glycine co-transport system in rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles is a carrier-mediated electrogenic process and that transport is shared by imino acids and partially by beta-alanine."
https://openalex.org/W1564845388,"The gene for iso-1-cytochrome c from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was recloned into a pSP65 vector containing an active bacteriophage SP promoter. The iso-1-cytochrome c gene was cloned as an 856-base pair XhoI-HindIII fragment. When the resulting plasmid was digested at the HindIII site 279 bases downstream from the termination codon of the gene and transcribed in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase, full length transcripts were produced. The SP6 iso-1-cytochrome c mRNA was translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, and the protein products were analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. One major band with a molecular weight of 12,000 was detected by autofluorography and coincided with the Coomassie staining band of apocytochrome c from S. cerevisiae. The product was also shown to be identical with that of standard yeast apocytochrome c on an isoelectrofocusing gel. The in vitro synthesized iso-1-apocytochrome c was enzymatically methylated by adding partially purified S-adenosyl-L-methionine:cytochrome c-lysine N-methyltransferase (protein methylase III, EC 2.1.1.59) from S. cerevisiae along with S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the in vitro translation mixtures. The methylation was shown to be inhibited by the addition of the methylase inhibitor S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine or the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin. The principal type of methylated amino acid in the protein was found to be epsilon-N-trimethyllysine which accounted for 77% of the total. Finally, the methylation of in vitro synthesized iso-1-apocytochrome c was found to increase its import into mitochondria isolated from S. cerevisiae 2-4-fold over unmethylated protein, but not into rat liver mitochondria. This suggests that methylation facilitates the import of apocytochrome c into mitochondria by a specific receptor mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1605950929,"Myeloperoxidase, a granule-associated enzyme of neutrophils and monocytes, combines with H2O2 and chloride to form a potent microbicidal system that contributes to phagocyte antimicrobial activity. The nature of the lesion or lesions induced by the myeloperoxidase system which are responsible for the loss of microbial replicative activity (viability) remains unknown. Using Escherichia coli grown to late log or stationary phase under conditions of low aeration with succinate as the sole carbon source, we found that myeloperoxidase-induced loss of microbial viability could be correlated with a decrease in succinate-dependent respiration (succinate oxidase activity). Succinate dehydrogenase activity fell rapidly to undetectable levels during incubation with the myeloperoxidase system, suggesting that damage to the dehydrogenase was a major factor in the loss of oxidase activity. Other components of the succinate oxidase system were resistant to the actions of myeloperoxidase. The ubiquinone-8 and cytochrome components of the respiratory chain remained nearly constant in amount despite reduction of respiration to undetectable levels. However, as expected from the loss of succinate dehydrogenase activity, succinate-ubiquinone reductase and succinate-cytochrome reductase activities were markedly impaired. We propose that the loss of E. coli viability induced by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-chloride system is due in part to the loss of electron transport function consequent to the oxidation of critical catalytic centers in susceptible dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W2119106941,"Beta-Adrenergic agonist-stimulated hyperpolarization, whole-cell cAMP accumulation, and activity of isoproterenol-stimulated membrane-bound adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) in Xenopus laevis ovarian oocytes are entirely dependent on the presence of nascent follicle cells. A method was developed to remove rapidly and completely all extra-oocyte cell types to yield defolliculated oocytes that exhibited normal viability and resting membrane potentials yet lacked beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR)-stimulated responses. Purified follicle membranes contained beta AR-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, whereas oocyte cell membranes did not. Purified oocyte membrane preparations from X. laevis oocytes previously microinjected with C6-2B rat astrocytoma mRNA, and subsequently defolliculated, exhibited novel beta AR and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These experiments demonstrate that oocytes expressed rat C6-2B mRNA coding for the beta-adrenergic receptor and the components necessary for forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1585864471,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the operon encoding maize chloroplast ribosomal protein genes S7 and S12 and the promoter activity of a chimeric construct of the -10/-35 sequence of this operon (attached to a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene) have been determined. This operon occurs in the chloroplast genome divided in two parts: part A contains exon 1 of rpS12 (encoding the N-terminal 38 amino acid residues), whereas part B has the following structure: promoter-rpS12 (exon 2 + intron + exon 3)-spacer-rpS7-terminator. Part A is located at the approximate coordinate position 41000, whereas two copies of part B are located at two distant locations in the genome at coordinate positions 18700 and 120200. This unusual organization of the S12 operon in maize (a monocot plant) is similar to that reported in a dicot and a lower plant. The deduced amino acid sequence of maize chloroplast S7 shows 43, 38, 71, and 85% and of S12 shows 66, 72, 91 and 90% sequence identity to the corresponding sequences of Escherichia coli, Euglena gracilis, Marchantia polymorpha, and Nicotiana tabacum, respectively. The promoter upstream of rpS12 (part B) is transcriptionally active in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1489821268,"A bioactive biotin-containing derivative of the synthetic bovine parathyroid hormone analog [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]bovine parathyroid hormone-(1-34) (bPTH-(1-34] amide was prepared by reacting the peptide with N-biotinyl-epsilon-aminocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The derivative was incubated with particulate renal plasma membranes or with detergent [3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) extracts of renal cortical membranes, and two membrane components were identified. Labeling of these components was competitively inhibited by underivatized bPTH-(1-34) or bPTH-(3-34) but not by insulin, adrenocorticotropin, or oxidized rat PTH-(1-34). PTH-binding components that were immobilized on nitrocellulose could be detected by incubating the membrane with biotinyl-bPTH-(1-34). Binding components of apparent molecular mass 68, 70, and 150 kDa were specifically labeled in plasma membranes derived from canine, human, and porcine renal cortex, rat liver, and human fibroblasts. The 68-kDa binding protein was found to be consistently more acidic than the 70-kDa binding protein in human, porcine, and canine renal membranes analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The 68-70-kDa receptor doublet could be specifically isolated by streptavidin-agarose chromatography of solubilized membrane extracts that had first been incubated with biotinyl-BPTH-(1-34). Biotinyl-bPTH-(1-34) should be useful as a tool for further characterization and purification of the PTH receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1501457235,"It has previously been demonstrated that the insulin-mimetic agent trypsin stimulates autophosphorylation of purified insulin receptors and activates the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in vitro. We now report the effects of trypsin on whole cell tyrosine kinase activation and insulin receptor autophosphorylation. Trypsin treatment of intact adipocytes produces a time-dependent stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity as measured in lectin extracts containing the insulin receptor, or specifically immunoprecipitated insulin receptor samples. Trypsin treatment of adipocytes also results in a loss of insulin binding capacity, and a linear correlation exists between loss of binding and stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity. Exposure of adipocytes to trypsin is known to result in a time- and dose-dependent activation of intracellular glycogen synthase. Examination of the time courses of stimulation of tyrosine kinase and glycogen synthase activation in our system indicates that the stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity by trypsin occurs with sufficient rapidity and magnitude to be consistent with a role of phosphorylation in the activation of glycogen synthase. Trypsin has further been demonstrated to stimulate autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor in intact adipocytes. Cells prelabeled with [32P]PO4 for 2 h were exposed to trypsin, and receptors were partially purified over wheat germ agglutinin-agarose columns. Receptors were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the beta-subunit was identified by autoradiography. The protein was extracted and hydrolyzed, and the phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis and quantitated. Two- and five-fold increases in phosphotyrosine were observed with 3 and 10 min of trypsin treatment, respectively. We conclude that trypsin-induced cleavage of the insulin receptor alpha-subunit is relevant to the ability of trypsin to activate the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in intact adipocytes. We further conclude that autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and activation of its tyrosine kinase by trypsin may be important to the insulin-mimetic anabolic effects of trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1573502410,"Abstract It has been generally accepted that transcriptional polarity in prokaryotic systems is due to an uncoupling of translation and transcription which unmasks latent rho-dependent termination sites in a polycistronic messenger RNA. In this report, we identify and characterize rho-dependent termination sites responsible for transcriptional polarity in the ilvGMEDA operon of wild-type Escherichia coli K12. The ilvG gene in the wild-type E. coli K12 ilvGMEDA operon contains a frameshift site which results in termination of translation in the middle of the gene. Mutations have been characterized which restore the reading frame of this gene. In addition to allowing full-length expression of the ilvG product, these mutations cause a 3-4-fold elevation in the expression of the operon distal genes. This transcriptional polarity effect on operon distal genes also has been shown to be relieved by rho suppressor mutations. We have used in vitro transcription experiments to identify rho-dependent transcriptional termination sites downstream of the frameshift site in the ilvG gene. Three tandem rho-dependent sites have been located in the ilv'GM' gene region using transcription reactions containing linear or supercoiled plasmid DNA templates. Accumulatively, these rho-dependent termination sites account for about 80% in vitro transcription termination, which is in agreement with the in vivo measurements of transcriptional polarity on operon distal gene expression. These transcriptional experiments provide in vitro confirmation for the latent rho-dependent termination site model of transcriptional polarity."
https://openalex.org/W1603932144,"Abstract Protein phosphatases 1 and 2B from rabbit skeletal muscle were found to catalyze the dephosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in vitro. Phosphorylation of protein phosphatase-1 by the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, pp60v-src, abolished S6 dephosphorylation by the purified enzyme. Analysis of the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a and phosphorylase kinase in Xenopus oocyte extracts and after microinjection indicated the presence of oocyte enzymes similar to protein phosphatases-1 and -2B. Studies with 32P-labeled 40 S ribosomal subunits suggested that these enzymes were functioning as S6 phosphatases in oocytes. These findings support the hypothesis that regulation of protein phosphatase activity may be involved in the increase in S6 phosphorylation observed after mitogenic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1507899407,"The PvuII fragment of human genomic clone LCV-517 which contains the entire coding region of a beta-adrenergic receptor gene was cloned into the SmaI site of the expression vector pMSG. The recombinant DNA was cotransfected with pRSVneo into mouse B-82 cells using the CaPO4 precipitation method. B-82 cells do not possess beta-adrenergic receptors but do contain prostaglandin E1 receptors that stimulate adenylate cyclase. Following transfection, several colonies expressing beta-adrenergic receptors were isolated. Analysis of ligand binding to expressed beta-receptors indicated that the protein encoded by the gene in clone LCV-517 was a beta 2-adrenergic subtype. Human beta 2-adrenergic receptors photoaffinity labeled with [125I]iodocyanopindolol diazirine migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels consistent with a molecular mass of 68,000, demonstrating that the receptor is glycosylated to an extent of 25-30% by weight. Addition of isoproterenol to cultures of transfected cells resulted in a 3-4-fold stimulation of adenylate cyclase, an effect similar to that seen in control B-82 cells with prostaglandin E1. These data describe the production of stable murine clonal cell lines expressing human beta 2-adrenergic receptors and illustrate the utility of such lines in the biochemical and pharmacological characterization of receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1507532299,"Three independently derived antifolate-resistant Leishmania major cell lines overproduce the bifunctional protein thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR) by amplification of a region of DNA (R-region DNA) that contains the gene for TS-DHFR. On orthogonal-field-alteration gel electrophoresis (OFAGE), the extrachromosomal R-region DNAs are circular molecules, and different forms of R-region DNA within these cell lines are resolved. The R-region DNAs migrate aberrantly on OFAGE with respect to linear DNA and supercoiled plasmid standards. We describe a method for the isolation of these R-region DNA forms from OFAGE. By electron microscopy, we show that the extrachromosomal elements are single supercoiled circular DNA molecules, and are predominantly circular monomers and dimers of the original R-region DNA amplification unit. Using OFAGE, an analysis of cloned isolates shows that individual cells may contain multiple forms of R-region DNA. Furthermore, within a given cell line, certain distinguishable forms appear to have the same size and restriction map, suggesting they may be topoisomers. The multiple forms of R-region DNA are in a dynamic state in the antifolate-resistant populations, and the relative amount of DNA in each form as well as the number of forms within each cell line change through time. As currently understood, the generation of amplified R-region DNA in L. major is summarized."
https://openalex.org/W1559263211,"Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated diadenosine tetraphosphate was found to inhibit the in vitro replication of SV40 DNA. This inhibition was sensitive to preincubation of the polymer with either poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A):ADP phosphohydrolase, or an excess of free Ap4A. In contrast, the general catalytic activity of DNA polymerase was not inhibited by the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Ap4A when activated salmon sperm DNA was used as a template. These data suggest that inhibition of SV40 DNA replication by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Ap4A requires both the intact polymer and intact Ap4A moiety and is specific to events occurring during the initiation or elongation of a double-stranded template. Since both poly(ADP-ribose) and Ap4A accumulate in cultured mammalian cells following stresses which are accompanied by DNA strand breaks, these data are consistent with a model in which poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Ap4A inhibits DNA replication following DNA damage."

Chem. 261, 16219-16225) interrupts a single phosphodiester bond in duplex DNA circles from various sources, only in their supercoiled form, but not following their relaxation by DNA topoisomerases. However, this requirement for DNA substrate supercoiling was not observed using the natural kinetoplast DNA as a substrate. Relaxed kinetoplast DNA minicircles, either free or topologically linked, were efficiently nicked by the enzyme. Furthermore, bacterial plasmids, containing a unit length kinetoplast DNA minicircle insert, were used as substrates for nicking in their relaxed form. This capacity to activate a relaxed DNA topoisomer as a substrate for nicking is an intrinsic property of the sequence-directed bend, naturally present in kinetoplast DNA. The 211-base pair fragment of the bent region from C. fasciculata kinetoplast DNA could support the nicking of a relaxed DNA substrate in a reaction dependent upon the DNA helix curvature."
https://openalex.org/W1567809146,"Metalloprotein autoreduction is a complex phenomenon composed of multiple reactions, the nature of which depends on the metal, its prosthetic group, and the manner in which they interact with the protein. In all types of autoreduction the protein amino acid side chains are implicated as being a potential source of reducing equivalents, with H2O2 playing a critical role in the side chain oxidation. CO-facilitated autoreduction is distinguished from this more general process by the fact that the CO can be directly oxidized to CO2 on reacting with a peroxide-derived ferryl-oxo species. The implications of the findings with respect to methodologies for isolation of minimally perturbed hemeproteins and the mechanism of hemeprotein turnover are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1516874744,"The activity of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.87), the rate-controlling enzyme in melatonin synthesis is stimulated approximately equal to 100-fold by an adrenergic cyclic AMP mechanism in both neonatal and adult rat pineal glands. This stimulation is blocked in the adult gland by the depolarizing agents ouabain (1 microM) and K+ (80 mM) (Parfitt, A., Weller, J.L., Klein, D.C., Sakai, K.K., and Marks, B.H. (1975) Mol. Pharmacol. 11, 241-255). In the present study pineal glands obtained from prenatal to adult rats were used; it was found that K+ (80 microM) inhibited the adrenergic stimulation of N-acetyltransferase activity at all ages but that ouabain (1 nM to 1 mM) treatment was not inhibitory early in development. In contrast, in the neonate, ouabain (1-100 nM) enhanced adrenergic induction of N-acetyltransferase activity, and ouabain treatment alone (1-1000 nM) stimulated N-acetyltransferase activity. A small stimulation was also seen at one concentration (1 nM) in the adult. Analysis of the development of high affinity ouabain binding sites and Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the intact pineal gland indicated that the developmental pattern of both resemble the development of ouabain inhibition of the adrenergic stimulation of N-acetyltransferase activity. All are low for the first few days of life, gradually increase during the next 3 weeks of life, and then approach adult levels. Similarly, ouabain (1 nM to 1 mM) had no effect on 86Rb uptake in the 2-day-old gland but blocked (IC50 congruent to 20 nM) 86Rb uptake in the adult gland. These findings indicate ouabain probably has little inhibitory effect on the norepinephrine stimulation of N-acetyltransferase activity in the neonatal because a high affinity ouabain binding form of Na+,K+-ATPase activity, similar to the alpha + form identified in rat brain, is at very low levels in the pinealocyte. Accordingly, it appears that an ouabain-insensitive mechanism in the neonatal gland maintains membrane potential and that this mechanism plays a less important role in the adult. The explanation of why ouabain alone stimulates N-acetyltransferase activity and why it enhances the effects of norepinephrine in the neonatal pineal gland might be that ouabain acts on surviving neural elements present in the gland to cause the net release of a transmitter, perhaps norepinephrine, which then stimulates N-acetyltransferase activity."

The pure enzyme contains 1 mol of high-spin heme and 2 mol of non-heme iron. It requires both of these as well as molecular O2 and a reducing agent for catalytic activity. Although the enzyme has many characteristics of a peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide cannot substitute for oxygen and dithionite for catalysis. The catalytic reaction is not affected by catalase, superoxide dismutase, or by hydroxyl radical scavengers. A comparison between porphobilinogen oxygenase and a commercial preparation of horseradish peroxidase was made. The latter also catalyzes aerobic porphobilinogen oxidation, with dithionite as electron donor. Here the oxidation of porphobilinogen is inhibited by superoxide dismutase and was not affected by catalase."
