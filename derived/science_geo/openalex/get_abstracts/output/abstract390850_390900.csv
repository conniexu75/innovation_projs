https://openalex.org/W2156023352,"MicroRNAs are a family of regulatory molecules involved in many physiological processes, including differentiation and activation of cells of the immune system. We found that brain-specific miR-124 is expressed in microglia but not in peripheral monocytes or macrophages. When overexpressed in macrophages, miR-124 directly inhibited the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α) and its downstream target PU.1, resulting in transformation of these cells from an activated phenotype into a quiescent CD45(low), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II(low) phenotype resembling resting microglia. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), miR-124 was downregulated in activated microglia. Peripheral administration of miR-124 in EAE caused systemic deactivation of macrophages, reduced activation of myelin-specific T cells and marked suppression of disease. Conversely, knockdown of miR-124 in microglia and macrophages resulted in activation of these cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify miR-124 both as a key regulator of microglia quiescence in the central nervous system and as a previously unknown modulator of monocyte and macrophage activation."
https://openalex.org/W2145016172,"The molecular basis of CNS myelin regeneration (remyelination) is poorly understood. We generated a comprehensive transcriptional profile of the separate stages of spontaneous remyelination that follow focal demyelination in the rat CNS and found that transcripts that encode the retinoid acid receptor RXR-γ were differentially expressed during remyelination. Cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage expressed RXR-γ in rat tissues that were undergoing remyelination and in active and remyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions. Knockdown of RXR-γ by RNA interference or RXR-specific antagonists severely inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation in culture. In mice that lacked RXR-γ, adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells efficiently repopulated lesions after demyelination, but showed delayed differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Administration of the RXR agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid to demyelinated cerebellar slice cultures and to aged rats after demyelination caused an increase in remyelinated axons. Our results indicate that RXR-γ is a positive regulator of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and remyelination and might be a pharmacological target for regenerative therapy in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2020764051,"The roles of striatopallidal (indirect) and striatonigral (direct) pathway neurons in regulating behavior is of great interest. Ferguson et al. selectively and transiently disrupt either one pathway or the other. They find that disrupting striatopallidal neuronal activity facilitated behavioral sensitization, whereas disrupting striatonigral neurons impaired its persistence. Dorsal striatum is important for the development of drug addiction; however, a precise understanding of the roles of striatopallidal (indirect) and striatonigral (direct) pathway neurons in regulating behaviors remains elusive. Using viral-mediated expression of an engineered G protein–coupled receptor (hM4D), we found that activation of hM4D receptors with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) potently reduced striatal neuron excitability. When hM4D receptors were selectively expressed in either direct or indirect pathway neurons, CNO did not change acute locomotor responses to amphetamine, but did alter behavioral plasticity associated with repeated drug treatment. Specifically, transiently disrupting striatopallidal neuronal activity facilitated behavioral sensitization, whereas decreasing excitability of striatonigral neurons impaired its persistence. These findings suggest that acute drug effects can be parsed from the behavioral adaptations associated with repeated drug exposure and highlight the utility of this approach for deconstructing neuronal pathway contributions to behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2140146894,"Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and catalyses the trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27), which represses gene transcription. EZH2 enhances cancer-cell invasiveness and regulates stem cell differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that EZH2 can be phosphorylated at Thr 487 through activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). The phosphorylation of EZH2 at Thr 487 disrupted EZH2 binding with the other PRC2 components SUZ12 and EED, and thereby inhibited EZH2 methyltransferase activity, resulting in inhibition of cancer-cell invasion. In human mesenchymal stem cells, activation of CDK1 promoted mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts through phosphorylation of EZH2 at Thr 487. These findings define a signalling link between CDK1 and EZH2 that may have an important role in diverse biological processes, including cancer-cell invasion and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028183762,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, reduced fertility in males and situs inversus in about 50% of affected individuals (Kartagener syndrome). It is caused by motility defects in the respiratory cilia that are responsible for airway clearance, the flagella that propel sperm cells and the nodal monocilia that determine left-right asymmetry. Recessive mutations that cause PCD have been identified in genes encoding components of the outer dynein arms, radial spokes and cytoplasmic pre-assembly factors of axonemal dyneins, but these mutations account for only about 50% of cases of PCD. We exploited the unique properties of dog populations to positionally clone a new PCD gene, CCDC39. We found that loss-of-function mutations in the human ortholog underlie a substantial fraction of PCD cases with axonemal disorganization and abnormal ciliary beating. Functional analyses indicated that CCDC39 localizes to ciliary axonemes and is essential for assembly of inner dynein arms and the dynein regulatory complex."

https://openalex.org/W1983831423,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent infections of the respiratory tract associated with the abnormal function of motile cilia. Approximately half of individuals with PCD also have alterations in the left-right organization of their internal organ positioning, including situs inversus and situs ambiguous (Kartagener's syndrome). Here, we identify an uncharacterized coiled-coil domain containing a protein, CCDC40, essential for correct left-right patterning in mouse, zebrafish and human. In mouse and zebrafish, Ccdc40 is expressed in tissues that contain motile cilia, and mutations in Ccdc40 result in cilia with reduced ranges of motility. We further show that CCDC40 mutations in humans result in a variant of PCD characterized by misplacement of the central pair of microtubules and defective assembly of inner dynein arms and dynein regulatory complexes. CCDC40 localizes to motile cilia and the apical cytoplasm and is required for axonemal recruitment of CCDC39, disruption of which underlies a similar variant of PCD."
https://openalex.org/W2022912258,"The surface area of human primary visual cortex (V1) varies substantially between individuals for unknown reasons. We found that this variability was strongly and negatively correlated with the magnitude of two common visual illusions, where two physically identical objects appear different in size as a result of their context. Because such illusions dissociate conscious perception from physical stimulation, our findings indicate that the surface area of V1 predicts variability in conscious experience."

https://openalex.org/W2064538665,"To avoid excess accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), eukaryotic cells have signaling pathways from the ER to the cytosol or nucleus. These processes are collectively termed the ER stress response. Double stranded RNA activated protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is a major transducer of the ER stress response and directly phosphorylates eIF2α, resulting in translational attenuation. Phosphorylated eIF2α specifically promotes the translation of the transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 plays important roles in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Perk(-/-) mice are reported to exhibit severe osteopenia, and the phenotypes observed in bone tissues are very similar to those of Atf4(-/-) mice. However, the involvement of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling pathway in osteogenesis is unclear. Phosphorylated eIF2α and ATF4 protein levels were attenuated in Perk(-/-) calvariae, and the gene expression levels of osteocalcin (Ocn) and bone sialoprotein (Bsp), which are targets for ATF4, were also down-regulated. Treatment of wild-type primary osteoblasts with BMP2, which is required for osteoblast differentiation, induced ER stress, leading to an increase in ATF4 protein expression levels. In contrast, the level of ATF4 in Perk(-/-) osteoblasts was severely diminished. The results indicate that PERK signaling is required for ATF4 activation during osteoblast differentiation. Perk(-/-) osteoblasts exhibited decreased alkaline phosphatase activities and delayed mineralized nodule formation relative to wild-type cultures. These abnormalities were almost completely restored by the introduction of ATF4 into Perk(-/-) osteoblasts. Taken together, ER stress occurs during osteoblast differentiation and activates the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling pathway followed by the promotion of gene expression essential for osteogenesis, such as Ocn and Bsp."

A serum antibody preexisting in middle-aged adults cross-reacts with, but does not protect against, 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. The existence of this antibody may account for the unusual age distribution of severe flu cases during pandemics. Pandemic influenza viruses often cause severe disease in middle-aged adults without preexisting comorbidities. The mechanism of illness associated with severe disease in this age group is not well understood1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we find preexisting serum antibodies that cross-react with, but do not protect against, 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in middle-aged adults. Nonprotective antibody is associated with immune complex–mediated disease after infection. We detected high titers of serum antibody of low avidity for H1-2009 antigen, and low-avidity pulmonary immune complexes against the same protein, in severely ill individuals. Moreover, C4d deposition—a marker of complement activation mediated by immune complexes—was present in lung sections of fatal cases. Archived lung sections from middle-aged adults with confirmed fatal influenza 1957 H2N2 infection revealed a similar mechanism of illness. These observations provide a previously unknown biological mechanism for the unusual age distribution of severe cases during influenza pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W2041144936,"Paul Brennan, Stephen Chanock and colleagues performed a genome-wide association study for renal carcinoma. They identified two genetic susceptibility loci. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 3,772 affected individuals (cases) and 8,505 controls of European background from 11 studies and followed up 6 SNPs in 3 replication studies of 2,198 cases and 4,918 controls. Two loci on the regions of 2p21 and 11q13.3 were associated with RCC susceptibility below genome-wide significance. Two correlated variants (r2 = 0.99 in controls), rs11894252 (P = 1.8 × 10−8) and rs7579899 (P = 2.3 × 10−9), map to EPAS1 on 2p21, which encodes hypoxia-inducible-factor-2 alpha, a transcription factor previously implicated in RCC. The second locus, rs7105934, at 11q13.3, contains no characterized genes (P = 7.8 × 10−14). In addition, we observed a promising association on 12q24.31 for rs4765623, which maps to SCARB1, the scavenger receptor class B, member 1 gene (P = 2.6 × 10−8). Our study reports previously unidentified genomic regions associated with RCC risk that may lead to new etiological insights."
https://openalex.org/W1988156733,"Bernd Wollnik and colleagues report mutations in CEP152 cause Seckel syndrome, which is characterized by short stature, severe microcephaly and mental retardation. The work suggests that CEP152 has a function in genome maintenance. Functional impairment of DNA damage response pathways leads to increased genomic instability. Here we describe the centrosomal protein CEP152 as a new regulator of genomic integrity and cellular response to DNA damage. Using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, we identified CEP152 mutations in Seckel syndrome and showed that impaired CEP152 function leads to accumulation of genomic defects resulting from replicative stress through enhanced activation of ATM signaling and increased H2AX phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2149906170,"In membrane proteins with a 'LeuT-fold', it is not clear how ion- and substrate-transport are coupled. Watanabe et al. present a comprehensive study of the structure and biochemical properties of the sodium/galactose transporter (vSGLT) from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and a new crystal structure of the 'inward-open' conformation. These experiments show that sodium exit causes a reorientation of transmembrane helix 1, opening an inner gate required for substrate exit, while also triggering minor rigid body movements in two sets of transmembrane helical bundles. This cascade of conformational changes is responsible for the proper timing of ion and substrate release. Here, a comprehensive study of the sodium/galactose transporter (vSGLT) is presented, consisting of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical characterization and a new crystal structure of the 'inward-open' conformation. These experiments show that sodium exit causes a reorientation of transmembrane helix 1, opening an inner gate required for substrate exit, while also triggering minor rigid-body movements in two sets of transmembrane helical bundles. This cascade of conformational changes is responsible for the proper timing of ion and substrate release. Membrane co-transport proteins that use a five-helix inverted repeat motif have recently emerged as one of the largest structural classes of secondary active transporters1,2. However, despite many structural advances there is no clear evidence of how ion and substrate transport are coupled. Here we report a comprehensive study of the sodium/galactose transporter from Vibrio parahaemolyticus (vSGLT), consisting of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical characterization and a new crystal structure of the inward-open conformation at a resolution of 2.7 Å. Our data show that sodium exit causes a reorientation of transmembrane helix 1 that opens an inner gate required for substrate exit, and also triggers minor rigid-body movements in two sets of transmembrane helical bundles. This cascade of events, initiated by sodium release, ensures proper timing of ion and substrate release. Once set in motion, these molecular changes weaken substrate binding to the transporter and allow galactose readily to enter the intracellular space. Additionally, we identify an allosteric pathway between the sodium-binding sites, the unwound portion of transmembrane helix 1 and the substrate-binding site that is essential in the coupling of co-transport."

https://openalex.org/W2129604622,"The detection of promoter region hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing has facilitated the identification of candidate renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumour suppressor genes (TSGs). We have used a genome-wide strategy (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and whole-genome array analysis in combination with high-density expression array analysis) to identify genes that are frequently methylated and silenced in RCC. MeDIP analysis on 9 RCC tumours and 3 non-malignant normal kidney tissue samples was performed, and an initial shortlist of 56 candidate genes that were methylated by array analysis was further investigated; 9 genes were confirmed to show frequent promoter region methylation in primary RCC tumour samples (KLHL35 (39%), QPCT (19%), SCUBE3 (19%), ZSCAN18 (32%), CCDC8 (35%), FBN2 (34%), ATP5G2 (36%), PCDH8 (58%) and CORO6 (22%)). RNAi knockdown for KLHL35, QPCT, SCUBE3, ZSCAN18, CCDC8 and FBN2 resulted in an anchorage-independent growth advantage. Tumour methylation of SCUBE3 was associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer death or relapse (P=0.0046). The identification of candidate epigenetically inactivated RCC TSGs provides new insights into renal tumourigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2055031064,"Establishing precise synaptic connections is crucial to the development of functional neural circuits. The direction-selective circuit in the retina relies upon highly selective wiring of inhibitory inputs from starburst amacrine cells (SACs) onto four subtypes of ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), each preferring motion in one of four cardinal directions. It has been reported in rabbit that the SACs on the 'null' sides of DSGCs form functional GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-mediated synapses, whereas those on the preferred sides do not. However, it is not known how the asymmetric wiring between SACs and DSGCs is established during development. Here we report that in transgenic mice with cell-type-specific labelling, the synaptic connections from SACs to DSGCs were of equal strength during the first postnatal week, regardless of whether the SAC was located on the preferred or null side of the DSGC. However, by the end of the second postnatal week, the strength of the synapses made from SACs on the null side of a DSGC significantly increased whereas those made from SACs located on the preferred side remained constant. Blocking retinal activity by intraocular injections of muscimol or gabazine during this period did not alter the development of direction selectivity. Hence, the asymmetric inhibition between the SACs and DSGCs is achieved by a developmental program that specifically strengthens the GABA-mediated inputs from SACs located on the null side, in a manner not dependent on neural activity."
https://openalex.org/W1981466043,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most deadly type of cancer in the United States and worldwide. Although new therapy is available, the survival rate of NSCLC patients remains low. One hallmark of cancer cells is defects in the apoptotic cell death program. In this study, we investigate the role of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, known to regulate cell survival and death, in a panel of fourteen NSCLC cell lines. NSCLC cell lines express high levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L), but not Bcl-2. Silencing the expression of Mcl-1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides potently killed a subgroup of NSCLC cell lines. In contrast, Bcl-x(L) siRNA had no effect in these lines unless Mcl-1 siRNA was also introduced. Interestingly, high MCL1 to BCL-xl messenger RNA determines whether the cells depend on Mcl-1 for survival. We further investigated the role of Mcl-1 in NSCLC cells using a Mcl-1-dependent cell line, H23. The expression of a complementary DNA containing only the coding region of MCL1 rescued H23 cells from the toxicity of a 3' untranslated region (UTR) targeting Mcl-1 siRNA but not a siRNA targeting the coding region of MCL1. Furthermore, we show that Mcl-1 sequesters the BH3-only protein Noxa and Bim and the apoptotic effector Bak. Not surprisingly, Noxa, Bim, or Bak knockdown partially rescued H23 cells from toxicity mediated by Mcl-1 siRNA to different degrees. Collectively, our results indicate that targeting Mcl-1 may improve therapy for a subset of NSCLC patients."

https://openalex.org/W2067012111,"The encoding of physical stimuli by the nervous system is thought to depend on the correlation between various input signals, but this theory has rarely been empirically tested. Jon Cafaro and Fred Rieke introduce a novel recording technique for simultaneously measuring excitatory and inhibitory conductances of retinal ganglion cells, and show that excitatory and inhibitory inputs are strongly correlated, thereby cancelling each other out. On reintroducing these conductance changes into the cell with or without correlations, they find that, as predicted by theoretical work, correlations significantly increase the reliability of the spiking response. This study introduces a novel recording technique for simultaneously measuring excitatory and inhibitory conductances of retinal ganglion cells to show that excitatory and inhibitory inputs are strongly correlated, thereby cancelling each other. Furthermore, dynamic clamp is used to introduce these conductance changes into the cell with or without correlations, and it is found that, as predicted by theoretical work, correlations significantly increase reliability of the spiking response. Computation in the nervous system often relies on the integration of signals from parallel circuits with different functional properties. Correlated noise in these inputs can, in principle, have diverse and dramatic effects on the reliability of the resulting computations1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Such theoretical predictions have rarely been tested experimentally because of a scarcity of preparations that permit measurement of both the covariation of a neuron’s input signals and the effect on a cell’s output of manipulating such covariation. Here we introduce a method to measure covariation of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs a cell receives. This method revealed strong correlated noise in the inputs to two types of retinal ganglion cell. Eliminating correlated noise without changing other input properties substantially decreased the accuracy with which a cell’s spike outputs encoded light inputs. Thus, covariation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs can be a critical determinant of the reliability of neural coding and computation."

https://openalex.org/W2085716871,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a heparin-binding cytokine that enhances growth, motility, and angiogenesis of many tumor types, including multiple myeloma where it is often highly expressed. However, little is known regarding what controls HGF level and activity in these tumors. Evaluation of bone marrow biopsies from myeloma patients revealed a strong positive correlation between the levels of HGF and heparanase, an endoglucuronidase known to promote aggressive tumor behavior. In vitro, addition of recombinant heparanase to myeloma cells or transfection of myeloma cell lines with the cDNA for heparanase significantly increased tumor cell expression and secretion of biologically active HGF. Shed syndecan-1, whose levels in myeloma are also enhanced by heparanase expression, binds to secreted HGF. This syndecan-1-HGF complex is active as shown by its ability to stimulate paracrine signaling via c-Met, the cell surface receptor for HGF. Surprisingly, heparanase enzyme activity was not required for up-regulation of HGF expression by the tumor cells. This is in contrast to the heparanase-mediated enhanced syndecan-1 shedding, which does require activity of the enzyme. This suggests that two different functional domains within the heparanase enzyme (the enzyme active site and a separate site) contribute to events leading to enhanced HGF signaling. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism driving the HGF pathway whereby heparanase stimulates an increase in both HGF expression and syndecan-1 shedding to enhance HGF signaling. This work also provides further mechanistic insight into the dynamic role of heparanase in driving aggressive tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2043471647,"Mesothelioma is an asbestos-associated and notoriously chemotherapy-resistant neoplasm. Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), epidermal growth factor receptor and MET, has been described in subsets of mesothelioma, suggesting that TKs might represent therapeutic targets in this highly lethal disease. We employed proteomic screening by phosphotyrosine immunoaffinity purification and tandem mass spectrometry to characterize RTK activation in mesothelioma cell lines. These assays demonstrated expression and activation of the AXL protein, which is an RTK with known oncogenic properties in non-mesothelial cancer types. AXL was expressed and activated strongly in 8 of 9 mesothelioma cell lines and 6 of 12 mesothelioma biopsies, including each of 12 mesotheliomas with spindle-cell histology. Somatic AXL mutations were not found, but all mesotheliomas expressed an alternatively spliced AXL transcript with in-frame deletion of exon 10, and six of seven mesothelioma cell lines expressed the AXL ligand, growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6). GAS6 expression appeared to be functionally relevant, as indicated by modulation of AXL tyrosine phosphorylation by knockdown of endogeneous GAS6, and by administration of exogenous GAS6. AXL silencing by lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA suppressed mesothelioma migration and cellular proliferation due to G1 arrest. The AXL inhibitor DP-3975 inhibited cell migration and proliferation in mesotheliomas with strong AXL activation. DP-3975 response in these tumors was characterized by inhibition of PI3-K/AKT/mTOR and RAF/MAPK signaling. AXL inhibition suppressed mesothelioma anchorage-independent growth, with reduction in colony numbers and size. These studies suggest that AXL inhibitors warrant clinical evaluation in mesothelioma."
https://openalex.org/W1968824596,"Structural analysis by NMR reveals that the Gly237-Pro238 bond of the signaling protein Crk in the cis form stabilizes an autoinhibited conformation between two tandem SH3 domains, whereas the trans form promotes an activated conformation for Abl kinase binding. Proline switches, controlled by cis-trans isomerization, have emerged as a particularly effective regulatory mechanism in a wide range of biological processes. Here we report the structures of both the cis and trans conformers of a proline switch in the Crk signaling protein. Proline isomerization toggles Crk between two conformations: an autoinhibitory conformation, stabilized by the intramolecular association of two tandem SH3 domains in the cis form, and an uninhibited, activated conformation promoted by the trans form. In addition to acting as a structural switch, the heterogeneous proline recruits cyclophilin A, which accelerates the interconversion rate between the isomers, thereby regulating the kinetics of Crk activation. The data provide atomic insight into the mechanisms that underpin the functionality of this binary switch and elucidate its remarkable efficiency. The results also reveal new SH3 binding surfaces, highlighting the binding versatility and expanding the noncanonical ligand repertoire of this important signaling domain."

https://openalex.org/W1983571732,"The tumor suppressor p53 has a crucial role in cellular response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, but it is still unclear whether p53 can modulate radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE). In the present work, three different hepatoma cell lines, namely HepG2 (wild p53), PLC/PRF/5 (mutation p53) and Hep3B (p53 null), were irradiated with γ-rays and then co-cultured with normal Chang liver cell (wild p53) in order to elucidate the mechanisms of RIBE. Results showed that the radiosensitivity of HepG2 cells was higher than that of PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B cells. Only irradiated HepG2 cells, rather than irradiated PLC/PRF/5 or Hep3B cells, could induce bystander effect of micronuclei (MN) formation in the neighboring Chang liver cells. When HepG2 cells were treated with 20 μM pifithrin-α, an inhibitor of p53 function, or 5 μM cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of cytochrome-c release from mitochondria, the MN induction in bystander Chang liver cells was diminished. In fact, it was found that after irradiation, cytochrome-c was released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm only in HepG2 cells in a p53-dependent manner, but not in PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B cells. Interestingly, when 50 μg/ml exogenous cytochrome-c was added into cell co-culture medium, RIBE was significantly triggered by irradiated PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B cells, which previously failed to provoke a bystander effect. In addition, this exogenous cytochrome-c also partly recovered the RIBE induced by irradiated HepG2 cells even with CsA treatment. Our results provide new evidence that the RIBE can be modulated by the p53 status of irradiated hepatoma cells and that a p53-dependent release of cytochrome-c may be involved in the RIBE."

The present study was conducted to investigate the possible DNA-damaging effect of aldosterone receptor activation in vivo. Crl:CD (Sprague-Dawley) rats were treated for 6 wk with desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and salt to induce a mineralocorticoid-dependent hypertension. DOCA-salt treatment caused increased blood pressure (+26 mmHg) compared to untreated rats, elevated markers of kidney failure (up to 62-fold for Kim-1), and the induction of several proinflammatory genes and proteins (up to 2.6-fold for tissue MCP-1). The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone (MR IC50 24 nM) and the novel nonsteroidal antagonist BR-4628 (MR IC50 28 nM) decreased these damage markers. DOCA-salt treatment also caused 8.8-fold increased structural DNA damage, determined with the comet assay, double-strand breaks (3.5-fold), detected immunohistochemically, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, the oxidatively modified mutagenic DNA base 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-oxodG), quantified by LC-MS/MS, was almost 2-fold higher in DOCA-salt-treated kidneys.

Type 1 rhodopsins are widespread in the microbial world in prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) and in eukaryotes (fungi and algae) (1Spudich J.L.

An interesting feature of this photoactive protein family is a wide range of seemingly dissimilar functions performed by its members. Some rhodopsins are light-driven transporters, such as proton pumps bacteriorhodopsin (BR) 2The abbreviations used are BR, bacteriorhodopsin; MR, middle rhodopsin; HwBR, bacteriorhodopsin-like protein from H. walsbyi; SRII, sensory rhodopsin II; HtrII, halobacterial transducer protein for SRII; DDM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; HR, halorhodopsin. in haloarchaea, xanthorhodopsin in halophilic bacteria, proteorhodopsin in marine bacteria, and Leptosphaeria rhodopsin in fungi (1Spudich J.L.

Other rhodopsins are light sensors, such as the phototaxis receptors sensory rhodopsins I (SRI) and II (SRII) in haloarchaea (1Spudich J.L.

These sensory receptors relay signals through protein-protein interactions to integral membrane transducer proteins I (HtrI) and II (HtrII) for SRI and SRII, respectively (15Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; 84: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and to a trimeric G-protein transducin for rhodopsin (3Costanzi S. Siegel J. Tikhonova I.G. Jacobson K.A. Curr.

SRI mediates attractant motility responses to green/orange wavelengths used by ion pumps BR and halorhodopsin (HR) (16Spudich J.L. Bogomolni R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas SRII mediates blue light avoidance responses (15Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; 84: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). SRI also mediates repellent responses to damaging near-UV light by a color-sensitive two-photon mechanism, so that cells migrate toward green/orange regions but not into full spectrum solar radiation containing damaging short wavelength photons (16Spudich J.L. Bogomolni R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Spudich J.L. Bogomolni R.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 193-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The SRI-HtrI and SRII-HtrII complexes control a cytoplasmic phosphorylation pathway composed of a histidine kinase CheA and a response regulator CheY that modulates the motility of the cells (18Spudich J.L. Yang C.S. Jung K.H. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Light-activated rhodopsin binds to the transducin molecule and mediates the GDP-GTP exchange reaction (3Costanzi S. Siegel J. Tikhonova I.G. Jacobson K.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Hofmann K.P. Scheerer P. Hildebrand P.W. Choe H.W. Park J.H. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 540-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), which is common among G-protein-coupled receptors. The signal relay mechanisms by SR-Htr and rhodopsin-transducin complexes have become a focus of research efforts of many groups, in part because of their importance for general understanding of communication between proteins and signal transduction mediated by membrane proteins. But how did the signaling rhodopsins evolve? In the case of type 1 rhodopsins, phylogenetic analysis strongly suggests that rhodopsin photosensors like SRI and SRII evolved from light-driven proton pumps such as BR (Fig. 1a) (5Sharma A.K. Spudich J.L. Doolittle W.F. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 463-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In fact, when SRI from Halobacterium salinarum and SRII from Natronomonas pharaonis are separated from their tightly bound transducers HtrI and HtrII, they exhibit light-driven electrogenic proton transport across the membrane (19Bogomolni R.A. Stoeckenius W. Szundi I. Perozo E. Olson K.D. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10188-10192Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Sumi M.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that the essential features of the proton transport mechanism of BR are conserved in the signal transduction mechanism of SRs, although primary structures of BR and SRII differ by 74% (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, the replacement of only three residues converts BR into an SRII-like phototaxis receptor (22Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), indicating that the essential features of the signal transduction mechanism of SRII are conserved in the proton transport mechanism of BR as well. In fact, the atomic structure of BR from H. salinarum (23Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.T. Cartailler J.P. Lanyi J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) aligns with that of SRII from the related haloarchaeon N. pharaonis fairly well (Fig. 1b) (24Luecke H. Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 25Royant A. Nollert P. Edman K. Neutze R. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Navarro J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10131-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The studies of the signal-competent BR mutant tell us what changes would be required to convert BR into SRII. A single replacement (A215T) corresponding to Thr-204 in SRII, which bridges the retinal and the membrane-embedded surface (Fig. 1b), confers weak phototaxis signaling activity. Two additional changes (surface substitutions P200T and V210Y), which are expected to align BR and HtrII similar to SRII and HtrII, greatly enhance the signaling (22Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Combining this with other findings (26Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14166-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Wada A. Ito M. Kamo N. Kandori H. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6208-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we proposed a model for signaling in which the initial storage of energy of photoisomerization in hydrogen bond between Tyr-174, which is in contact with retinal, and Thr-204 is followed by the transfer of that chemical energy to drive structural transitions in HtrII (Fig. 1b) (31Suzuki D. Irieda H. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Sudo Y. Sensors. 2010; 10: 4010-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, questions on when and how the molecular evolution from BR to SRII occurred remain unsolved, because no evolutionary intermediate between BR and SRII has been previously discovered. In other words, it is unclear when the SRII-like properties (blue-shifted absorption maximum, slow photocycle, interaction with HtrII, etc. (32Spudich J.L. Zacks D.N. Bogomolni R.A. Israel J. Chem. 1995; 35: 495-513Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) appeared. In 2006, Oesterhelt and co-worker s (33Bolhuis H. Palm P. Wende A. Falb M. Rampp M. Rodriguez-Valera F. Pfeiffer F. Oesterhelt D. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) reported the genomic sequence of the archaeon halophile Haloquadratum walsbyi, which encodes two microbial rhodopsins as shown in Fig. 1a. Interestingly, one of them is located between BR and SRII phylogenetically and has a Thr residue critical for signaling (Fig. 1a) (22Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34239-34245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized properties of these microbial rhodopsins and discussed their implications on the evolutionary pathway from BR to SRII. H. walsbyi (a kind gift from Dr. Dyall-Smith) was grown aerobically at 40 °C, pH 7.0, in a medium with the following composition (g/liter): NaCl, 195; MgSO4·7H2O, 25; MgCl2·6H2O, 16.3; CaCl2·2H2O, 1.25; KCl, 5.0; NaHCO3, 0.25; NaBr, 0.625; and yeast extract (Difco), 1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Genomic DNA was prepared using the method of Marmur (34Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8945) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α cells were used as a host for DNA manipulation, and BL21(DE3) cells were used to express the genes. For DNA manipulation, the rhodopsin genes (bopI and bopII, Fig. 1a) were amplified using PCR from the genomic DNA of H. walsbyi. For bopI, the forward primer 5′-CATATGGCGACACCAGGCTCAGAAGCG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGGTGTGATTTTATATCGTTCGTCGA-3′ were designed (underlined parts indicate the restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI). The stop codon was deleted during amplification. The NdeI and XhoI fragment was ligated to the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET21c(+) vector (Novagen). Consequently, the plasmid encodes rhodopsin with six histidines at the C terminus, and it was named pET-sqbopI. This cloning strategy resulted in the following N- and C-terminal peptide sequences: 1MATP(X)5DIKSH246LEHHHHHH. For bopII, the forward primer 5′-GCTAGCATGTCTCAGCTGGCGCTGCAAATG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGGTCCGCAGCAGTTTCTTGTGCTGA-3′ were designed (underlined parts indicate the restriction sites for NheI and XhoI). The stop codon was deleted during amplification. Because the bopII gene contains an NheI site, the amplified fragment was digested into two pieces (large and small fragments) by NheI and XhoI. Therefore, the complete bopII gene cloning was composed of two steps as follows: large fragment cloning into the NheI and XhoI sites of the expression vector and the following small fragment cloning at the NheI site. The expression vector was constructed by introducing multicloning sites of pET21a into the pBAD vector. The direction of the inserted small fragment was confirmed by sequencing. Consequently, the plasmid encodes rhodopsin with six histidines at the C terminus, and it was named pBAD-sqbopII. This cloning strategy resulted in the following N- and C-terminal peptide sequences: 1MASMSQLA(X)5TAAD254LEHHHHHH. All constructed plasmids were analyzed using an automated sequencer (ABI 3100) to confirm the expected nucleotide sequences. Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (final concentration 50 μg/ml). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid were grown to an OD660 of 0.3–0.5 in a 30 °C incubator, followed by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for MR or 0.1% l-arabinose for HwBR and 5 μm all-trans-retinal (35Sudo Y. Okada A. Suzuki D. Inoue K. Irieda H. Sakai M. Fujii M. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Homma M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10136-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 10 h post-induction at 18 °C by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended in buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5) containing 1 m NaCl, and disrupted by sonication or a French press. Cell debris was removed by low speed centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Crude membranes were collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and washed with buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5) containing 1 m NaCl. For solubilization of the membranes, 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) was added, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized membranes were isolated by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was applied to a nickel affinity column (HisTrap, GE Healthcare) at 4 °C in the dark. Thereafter, the column was washed extensively with buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5) containing 1 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.05% w/v DDM to remove unspecifically bound proteins. The histidine-tagged proteins were then eluted using a linear gradient of up to 100% elution buffer (0.05% DDM, 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, and 500 mm imidazole). The eluted proteins were then further applied to a HiTrapQ ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing 30 mm NaCl and 0.05% DDM. Thereafter, the column was washed extensively with the buffer to remove unspecifically bound proteins. The proteins were then eluted using a linear gradient of up to 100% elution buffer (0.05% DDM, 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5). For the FTIR measurements, the eluted proteins were then further purified by a Sephacryl S-400 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer containing 0.05% DDM, 1 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0. The purified samples were then reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes (protein/phosphatidylcholine = 1:30 molar ratio) by removing the detergent with SM2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad). The sample was concentrated and exchanged using an Amicon ultra concentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA) against the media with compositions given below. UV-visible spectra were obtained using a UV2450 spectrophotometer with an ISR2200 integrating sphere (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed following the published procedure (36Suzuki D. Furutani Y. Inoue K. Kikukawa T. Sakai M. Fujii M. Kandori H. Homma M. Sudo Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 48-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified sample was analyzed in buffer (0.1% DDM, 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0). The HPLC system consisted of a PU-2080 pump and an UV-2075 UV/visible detector (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The chromatograph was equipped with a silica column (6.0 × 150 mm; YMC-Pack SIL), and the solvent was 12% (v/v) ethyl acetate and 0.12% (v/v) ethanol in hexane, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Extraction of retinal oxime from the sample was carried out with hexane after denaturation in methanol and 500 mm hydroxylamine at 4 °C. The molar ratios of retinal isomers were calculated from the areas of the peaks monitored at 360 nm. The assignment of each peak was performed by comparing it with the HPLC pattern from retinal oximes of authentic all-trans- and 13-cis-retinals (36Suzuki D. Furutani Y. Inoue K. Kikukawa T. Sakai M. Fujii M. Kandori H. Homma M. Sudo Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 48-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the assignment of the 11-cis-retinal peak, a mixture of retinal isomers was prepared by irradiating all-trans-retinal dissolved in acetonitrile overnight with a fluorescent lamp according to the standard method (37Maeda A. Schichida Y. Yoshizawa T. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the time-resolved flash spectroscopy, the apparatus and the procedure for the analysis were described previously (38Yagasaki J. Suzuki D. Ihara K. Inoue K. Kikukawa T. Sakai M. Fujii M. Homma M. Kandori H. Sudo Y. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). FTIR spectroscopy was performed following the established protocol (39Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2866-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). After hydration with H2O or D2O, the sample film was placed in a cell mounted in an Oxford Optistat-DN cryostat placed in a FTS-40 spectrometer (Bio-Rad). Spectra were constructed from 128 interferograms with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. To investigate the structural changes upon formation of the K-and M-intermediates, difference spectra were calculated from spectra before and after illumination. For HwBR, illumination with 520 nm light (KL52 filter) at 77 K for 2 min converted HwBR to HwBRK, and a subsequent illumination with >610 nm light (R63 filter) for 1 min reverted the HwBRK back to HwBR, as evidenced by the same (but inverted) spectral shape. The cycles of alternating illuminations with 520 and >610 nm light were repeated a number of times. Thirty two difference spectra obtained in this way were averaged for each HwBRK minus the HwBR spectrum. For MR, illumination with 500 nm light (KL50 filter) at 77 K for 2 min converted the MR to MRK. Because MRK was completely reconverted to MR upon illumination with >540 nm light (O56) for 1 min, as evidenced by the spectral shape, which is a mirror image of that for the MR-MRK transition, cycles of alternating illumination with 500 and >540 nm light were repeated a number of times. Twenty four difference spectra obtained in this way were averaged for each MRK minus MR spectrum. The proton transport activity of each protein was measured by monitoring pH changes using a glass electrode (40Kawanabe A. Furutani Y. Jung K.H. Kandori H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 16439-16444Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, spheroplasts containing HwBR or MR protein were illuminated at >500 nm through a glass filter (AGC Techno Glass Y-52, Japan), and the pH value changes were monitored (F-55 pH meter, Horiba, Japan). The amount of protein in the spheroplast suspension was estimated by measuring the absorption spectra after solubilizing the protein with 2% DDM. The concentrations of the solutions with HwBR and MR were 0.06 and 0.04 μm, respectively. H. salinarum strain Pho81Wr−, which lacks the four native rhodopsins (BR, HR, SRI, and SRII) and the two transducer proteins (HtrI and HtrII), and is carotenoid pigment-deficient and restriction-deficient, was used for transformation by following the previously described protocol (22Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid was modified from plasmid pYS001 that encodes the WT SRII-HtrII fusion gene (22Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For preparation of the MR-HtrII expression plasmid, the 5′ and 3′ ends of the bopI gene were mutated by PCR to introduce NcoI and SpeI restriction sites, respectively. The resulting NcoI-SpeI fragments were ligated with the large fragment of the NcoI/SpeI-treated pYS001 vector. The stop codon was deleted during amplification, which generated a linker region between SRII and HtrII that contains 11 residues (Thr-Ser-Ala-Ser-Ala-Ser-Asn-Gly-Ala-Ser-Ala; 5′-CTAGTGCGTCGGCGTCGAACGGCGCGTCGGCG-3′) (22Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The underlined part indicates the added restriction site for SpeI. The A201T/M211Y mutant gene of MR was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method. All constructed plasmids were analyzed using an automated sequencer to confirm the expected nucleotide sequences. Phototaxis responses were measured as transient swimming reversal frequency changes of cell populations in response to pulse photostimuli. Swimming reversals were measured by stimulus-induced effects as the ratio of rate of change of direction to speed (22Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The genome sequence of H. walsbyi contains two genes that encode microbial rhodopsins (bopI and bopII) (Fig. 1a and supplemental Fig. S1) and also one gene that encodes a halorhodopsin-like protein (33Bolhuis H. Palm P. Wende A. Falb M. Rampp M. Rodriguez-Valera F. Pfeiffer F. Oesterhelt D. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of bopII (HwBR) is distantly related to BR from H. salinarum (∼52% identity) and contains all amino acid residues (Asp-85, Asp-96, Asp-201, Glu-194, and Glu-204 in BR) identified as necessary for its function (Fig. 1a) (41Lanyi J.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 665-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In contrast, bopI (MR) is distantly related to both BR and SRII (∼41% identity with BR and ∼35% identity for SRII) and contains the amino acid residues important for the proton pumping function (Asp-85, Asp-96, Asp-212, and Glu-204 in BR) except for the equivalent of Glu-194 in BR, and also those important for signal transduction (Tyr-174 and Thr-204 in SRII (28Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34239-34245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). The identity of the amino acid sequences between HwBR and MR is 41%. The phylogenetic analysis showed that HwBR and MR can be classified as BR and an intermediate type between BR and SRII, respectively (Fig. 1a). The gene sequence of bopII is similar to that of a BR gene from Haloarcula vallismortis, and although bopI is located near bopII in the genome (33Bolhuis H. Palm P. Wende A. Falb M. Rampp M. Rodriguez-Valera F. Pfeiffer F. Oesterhelt D. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), the gene sequence of bopI is quite different from bopII, suggesting that bopI is gained by the lateral gene transfer. The supplemental Fig. S2 shows the deduced secondary structure of MR from H. walsbyi. Similar to other microbial rhodopsins, it has seven transmembrane segments. A lysine on the helix G and an aspartate residue (Asp-84) on the helix C, which are predicted to be necessary for the stabilization of the Schiff base and for the binding between protein and retinal, are completely conserved both in HwBR and in MR (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Sensory rhodopsin genes previously identified are followed by the genes of cognate transducers, in an operon that is under control of the same promoter (42Seidel R. Scharf B. Gautel M. Kleine K. Oesterhelt D. Engelhard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3036-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The transducer proteins HtrI for SRI and HtrII for SRII belong to a family of two transmembrane helical proteins similar to chemoreceptors Tar and Tsr in E. coli (31Suzuki D. Irieda H. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Sudo Y. Sensors. 2010; 10: 4010-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and they are termed methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (31Suzuki D. Irieda H. Homma M. Kawagishi I.

We tested these hypotheses in mouse xenografts of human lung cancers. AdoMet recycling from 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) was blocked by inhibition of MTAP with methylthio-DADMe-Immucillin-A (MTDIA), an orally available, nontoxic, picomolar transition state analogue. Blood, urine, and tumor levels of MTA increased in response to MTDIA treatment. MTDIA treatment inhibited A549 (human non-small cell lung carcinoma) and H358 (human bronchioloalveolar non-small cell lung carcinoma cells) xenograft tumor growth in immunodeficient Rag2(-/-)γC(-/-) and NCr-nu mice. Systemic MTA accumulation is implicated as the tumor-suppressive metabolite because MTDIA is effective for in vivo treatment of A549 MTAP(-/-) and H358 MTAP(+/+) tumors. Tumors from treated mice showed increased MTA and decreased polyamines but little alteration in AdoMet, methionine, or adenine levels. Gene expression profiles of A549 tumors from treated and untreated mice revealed only modest alterations with 62 up-regulated and 63 down-regulated mRNAs (≥ 3-fold). MTDIA antitumor activity in xenografts supports MTAP as a target for lung cancer therapy."

However, little is known about the mechanisms of activation of STAT proteins. In this study, we identify and clarify the contribution of various STAT kinases in two widely used neoplastic mast cell lines, P815 and HMC-1.

KIT-Asp816 mutant can directly phosphorylate STATs on the activation-specific tyrosine residues in vitro. However, within cells, SRC family kinases and JAKs diversely contribute to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins downstream of the KIT mutant. Using a panel of inhibitors, we provide evidence for the implication or exclusion of serine/threonine kinases as responsible for serine phosphorylation of STAT1, -3, and -5 in the two cell lines.

We have determined the quaternary structure and functional unit of the recently discovered ECF-type (energy coupling factor) of ABC transporters, which is widespread among prokaryotes. ECF transporters are protein complexes consisting of a conserved energizing module (two peripheral ATPases and the integral membrane protein EcfT) and a non-conserved integral membrane protein responsible for substrate specificity (S-component). S-components for different substrates are often unrelated in amino acid sequence but may associate with the same energizing module. Here, the energizing module from Lactococcus lactis was shown to form stable complexes with each of the eight predicted S-components found in the organism. The quaternary structures of three of these complexes were determined by light scattering. EcfT, the two ATPases (EcfA and EcfA′), and the S-components were found to be present in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The complexes were reconstituted in proteoliposomes and shown to mediate ATP-dependent transport. ECF-type transporters are the smallest known ABC transporters.

They form one of the largest known protein families and are found in organisms from all kingdoms of life (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar). ABC transporters consist of two homologous or identical integral membrane domains that form the translocation pore and two peripheral nucleotide-binding domains (ATPases) that energize the transport. ABC importers contain additional extracellular or periplasmic soluble substrate-binding domains or proteins and are found only in prokaryotes (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar, 2Rees D.C. Johnson E. Lewinson O. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Recently, a new type of ABC importer was found, which is widespread among prokaryotes and was named the ECF type (for energy coupling factor) (4Hebbeln P. Rodionov D.A. Alfandega A. Eitinger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2909-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Rodionov D.A. Hebbeln P. Eudes A. ter Beek J. Rodionova I.A. Erkens G.B. Slotboom D.J. Gelfand M.S. Osterman A.L. Hanson A.D. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Like classical ABC transporters, they consist of peripheral (ATPase) and transmembrane subunits that together form an energizing module. Unlike classical ABC importers, ECF-type transporters employ integral membrane proteins (named “S-components”) as substrate-binding proteins. The S-components are small (20–25 kDa) and hydrophobic (4–6 predicted transmembrane segments) (5Rodionov D.A. Hebbeln P. Eudes A. ter Beek J. Rodionova I.A. Erkens G.B. Slotboom D.J. Gelfand M.S. Osterman A.L. Hanson A.D. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analyses have predicted that ECF-type transporters are involved in the uptake of vitamins or other nutrients needed in trace amounts (such as Ni2+ or Co2+ ions) (4Hebbeln P.

The riboflavin-binding protein RibU from Staphylococcus aureus was found to have a new fold, unrelated to the membrane domains of other ABC transporters (8Zhang P. Wang J. Shi Y. Nature. 2010; 468: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).ECF-type ABC transporters fall into two groups (5Rodionov D.A. Hebbeln P. Eudes A. ter Beek J. Rodionova I.A. Erkens G.B. Slotboom D.J. Gelfand M.S. Osterman A.L. Hanson A.D. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In group I, S-components are encoded in the same operon as the energizing module (hence designated as “dedicated” energizing modules). The biotin transporter BioMNY from Rhodobacter capsulatus is the best characterized member of this group (4Hebbeln P. Rodionov D.A. Alfandega A. Eitinger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2909-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Group II ECF transporters consist of energizing modules that are encoded in an operon without S-component genes. These energizing modules usually consist of two different homologous ATPases (EcfA and EcfA′), alongside the membrane protein EcfT, and are predicted to interact with various S-components that are encoded by genes scattered over the genome (hence the name “shared” energizing modules) (5Rodionov D.A. Hebbeln P. Eudes A. ter Beek J. Rodionova I.A. Erkens G.B. Slotboom D.J. Gelfand M.S. Osterman A.L. Hanson A.D. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The different S-components are often unrelated at the sequence level. The group II proteins are particularly abundant in Gram-positive organisms, many of which are pathogens.Here, we present the first genome-wide experimental analysis of an ECF-type transporter with shared energizing modules. We reveal the quaternary structure and minimal functional unit using purified proteins solubilized in detergent or reconstituted in proteoliposomes.RESULTSThe genome of the Gram-positive bacterium L. lactis contains one operon coding for a shared energizing module (ecfAA′T, annotated as cbiOOQ2). In addition, it contains eight different genes coding for predicted S-components with confirmed or predicted specificity for vitamins and their precursors (5Rodionov D.A. Hebbeln P.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the quaternary structure of the ECF-type ABC transporters, we initially aimed to isolate the energizing module EcfAA′T from L. lactis (18Kunji E.R. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). His-tagged EcfAA′T was produced in L. lactis, solubilized, and purified by nickel affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Fig. 1a shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified complex. Besides the three proteins from the energizing module (His-EcfA, EcfA′, and EcfT), we consistently co-purified several proteins with molecular masses around 20 kDa. We hypothesized that these proteins could be the endogenous S-components from L. lactis that had formed stable complexes with the energizing modules. Indeed, one of the proteins (indicated in Fig. 1a) was identified by MALDI mass spectrometry as the S-component NiaX. We could not reveal the identities of the other co-purified proteins, presumably because the physicochemical properties of the S-components (small and very hydrophobic proteins) precluded identification by in-gel protein digestion, peptide extraction, and mass spectrometry.Co-purification of the different endogenous S-components with the energizing module introduced heterogeneity and complicated structural analysis. Therefore, we decided to overproduce the energizing module in E. coli MC1061, a strain devoid of endogenous ECF-type ABC transporters or S-components. The His-tagged energizing module EcfAA′T was again purified by nickel affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1a) revealed that only the band corresponding to the His-tagged subunit (EcfT) was visible, indicating that the energizing module had not formed a stable complex or that the complex had fallen apart during the purification in detergent solution.Possibly, the energizing module can form stable complexes only if an S-component is attached. To test this hypothesis, we co-produced each of the eight S-components (containing a C-terminal STREPII tag) with the EcfAA′T-His module in E. coli MC1061. Membrane solubilization followed by metal affinity and size-exclusion chromatography resulted in co-purification of the entire complex containing both the energizing module and the co-produced S-component (Fig. 1b).The subunit stoichiometry of the complexes containing the EcfA, EcfA′, and EcfT and the S-components is not known (e.g. see Ref. 19Finkenwirth F. Neubauer O. Gunzenhäuser J. Schoknecht J. Scolari S. Stöckl M. Korte T. Herrmann A. Eitinger T. Biochem. J. 2010; 431: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is possible that the S-component and EcfT together form the membrane pore (in a 1:1 stoichiometry) and associate with a heterodimer of the two ATPases (EcfA and EcfA′). In this case, the S-component would form an integral part of the complex. On the other hand, it is also possible that two EcfT subunits form a complex with EcfA and EcfA′ (2:1:1 stoichiometry) and that the S-component is attached only peripherally, possibly in multiple copies. The latter organization could resemble sulfonylurea receptors (SURs). SURs are complete ABC transporters, with two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, that associate with an unrelated membrane protein (in this case with KATP channels) (20Bryan J. Muñoz A. Zhang X. Düfer M. Drews G. Krippeit-Drews P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 453: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).To determine the molecular weight of the complexes (and thus the subunit stoichiometry), it was not possible to use the elution volumes from a size-exclusion column, which had been calibrated with globular protein markers because the amount of attached detergent was not known. Instead, we determined the subunit stoichiometries of three complexes (EcfAA′T-NiaX, EcfAA′T-BioY, and EcfAA′T-ThiT) by SEC-MALLS. SEC-MALLS explicitly accounts for the amount of detergent bound to a membrane protein and allows for determination of the absolute molecular mass of a protein in a protein-lipid-detergent mixed micelle. The technique does not make use of the elution volume from the size-exclusion column. SEC is used only to separate the protein of interest from different species (contaminants/excess empty detergent micelles/aggregated proteins) (14Slotboom D.J. Duurkens R.H. Olieman K. Erkens G.B. Methods. 2008; 46: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The mass of protein complex was determined throughout the elution peak and was found to be ∼119 kDa (shown in Fig. 2a for EcfAA′T-NiaX). The only subunit stoichiometry consistent with the data was a 1:1:1:1 ratio between the ATPases EcfA and EcfA′, the transmembrane protein EcfT, and the S-component NiaX, which has a calculated mass of 120.5 kDa (Table 2). The same quaternary structure was found for EcfAA′T-BioY and EcfAA′T-ThiT (supplemental Tables 1 and 2). In all three cases, a stoichiometry in which two EcfT subunits would be present, in addition to one or more S-components, was not consistent with the data.FIGURE 2Subunit stoichiometry of the EcfAA′T-S-component complex. a, SEC-MALLS analysis of the EcfAA′T-NiaX complex.

Open table in a new tab For EcfAA′T-BioY and EcfAA′T-ThiT, the complexes with 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry fitted best to the experimental data, although hypothetical complexes consisting of three ATPase subunits also fitted reasonably well (supplemental Tables 1 and 2). However, we do not expect three ATPases to be present in the complex. The EcfA and EcfA′ are typical ABC transporter ATPases, and it is well known that these ATPases form dimers, with the active sites on the dimer interface. Furthermore, on the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1), the bands for EcfA and EcfA′ were equally intense. The two proteins are soluble and homologous (identity is 35%) and therefore likely to stain in a similar way. It is thus likely that EcfA and EcfA′ are present in a 1:1 ratio.The purified complexes EcfAA′T-NiaX and EcfAA′T-RibU were reconstituted in liposomes to investigate whether the protein complexes found in detergent solution sufficed for transport. Uptake of radiolabeled niacin (by EcfAA′T-NiaX) or riboflavin (by EcfAA′T-RibU) into the proteoliposomes was indeed observed. Transport depended on the presence of Mg-ATP in the lumen of the liposomes. The accumulation levels of niacin and riboflavin were 8.7- and 26-fold, respectively. Inclusion of only Mg2+ ions or Mg-ADP in the liposome lumen did not result in substrate transport (Fig. 3). Also, the presence of 10 mm Mg-AMP-PNP, a slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogue, did not support substrate accumulation, showing that ATP hydrolysis was required (data not shown). As expected, riboflavin was not transported by the EcfAA′T-NiaX complex.FIGURE 3Transport of [3H]niacin (a) and [3H]riboflavin (b) into proteoliposomes containing EcfAA′T-NiaX and EcfAA′T-RibU, respectively. Error bars indicate the S.E. of three measurements. The proteoliposomes were loaded with 50 mm potassium phosphate, supplemented with 10 mm MgSO4 and 10 mm ATP (closed circles), 10 mm MgSO4 only (open circles), or 10 mm MgSO4 and 10 mm ADP (closed triangles). The pH was 7. The accumulation levels of niacin (at the 3-min time point) and riboflavin (at the 6-min time point) are 8.7- and 26-fold, respectively. The non-zero levels of radioactivity (riboflavin or niacin) counted using the proteoliposomes loaded with Mg-ADP or MgSO4 only are due to nonspecific binding of the label to the proteoliposomes. Similar levels were observed when proteoliposomes of an unrelated protein were used (the secondary active aspartate transporter GltPh, data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In a complementary experiment, we measured transport by an efflux assay using proteoliposomes in which the orientation of the EcfAA′T-NiaX complexes (right-side-out or inside-out) was deliberately scrambled (17Geertsma E.R. Nik Mahmood N.A. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Poolman B. Nature Protocols. 2008; 3: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Importantly, upon the addition of external Mg-ATP, luminal niacin was rapidly released from the liposomes (supplemental Fig. 1), confirming that the reconstituted complexes mediated substrate translocation in the presence of Mg-ATP.DISCUSSIONFor the first time, we have shown in a comprehensive genome-wide analysis that all predicted S-components in a single organism (BioY, BioY2, HmpT, NiaX, PanT, QueT, RibU, and ThiT from L. lactis) indeed interact with the same energizing module. With the exception of BioY and BioY2, the S-components do not share significant sequence similarity, raising the question how these proteins recognize the same EcfAA′T module. Presumably, there is a structurally conserved motif in the S-components that is responsible for the interaction with either the EcfT protein or a nucleotide-binding domain or both. It is not clear from the amino acid sequences whether the S-components contain a motif related to the coupling helix that mediates binding between the membrane domains and ATPase subunits in classical ABC transporters. The crystal structure of RibU from S. aureus also did not reveal a coupling helix or any obvious binding sites for the T-component (8Zhang P. Wang J. Shi Y. Nature. 2010; 468: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, from our work, it is clear that the interactions between the energizing module and the S-components are strong and that the EcfAA′T module is stable in detergent only when an S-component is attached.The observed subunit stoichiometry of the purified complexes (1:1:1:1 EcfA:EcfA′:EcfT:S-component) shows that the S-component is an integral part of the ECF transporter taking the place of one of the two transmembrane domains found in classical ABC transporters (Fig. 2b), which may explain why EcfAA′T alone did not form a stable complex in the absence of an S-component (Fig. 1a). The quaternary structure makes ECF transporters clearly different from the SURs, to which the KATP channels are attached peripherally (20Bryan J. Muñoz A. Zhang X. Düfer M. Drews G. Krippeit-Drews P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 453: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).The presence of a single S-component in the complex is consistent with previous results showing that the S-component ThiT is monomeric in detergent solution in the absence of the energizing module and that monomeric ThiT binds its substrate thiamin in a 1:1 ratio (6Erkens G.B. Slotboom D.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3203-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It also agrees with the recent crystal structure of RibU that has a monomeric functional unit (8Zhang P. Wang J. Shi Y. Nature. 2010; 468: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results are not directly compatible with FRET lifetime measurements in E. coli cells expressing the biotin transporter BioMNY (which has a dedicated energizing module). A multimeric state was found for the S-component BioY, both alone and in complex with its dedicated energizing module (19Finkenwirth F. Neubauer O. Gunzenhäuser J. Schoknecht J. Scolari S. Stöckl M. Korte T. Herrmann A. Eitinger T. Biochem. J. 2010; 431: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is possible that the structure of BioMNY is different from the ECF-type transporters with shared energizing modules studied here. On the other hand, it is also possible that the basic unit with a 1:1:1:1 subunit stoichiometry forms higher order arrays as part of the transport cycle. Our SEC-MALLS analysis indicated that the complexes have a tendency to form higher order aggregates in detergent solution. Besides the main protein peak in the chromatogram (at 12.3 ml), a shoulder (at 11.1 ml) was also present that eluted earlier. The protein complex in this peak had a calculated molecular mass of exactly twice the mass of the protein in the main peak (Fig. 2a). Likely, the protein peak eluting at 11.1 ml represents a dimer of two EcfAA′T-NiaX complexes, and the data indicate that the complex has a tendency to aggregate in detergent solution.The uptake and efflux experiments revealed that the reconstituted complexes with a 1:1:1:1 quaternary structure (EcfA:EcfA′:EcfT:S-component) mediated ATP-dependent transport without the need for any soluble substrate-binding domains, which are employed by classical ABC import proteins. Thus, the ECF-type ABC transporters described here represent the smallest functional unit of any ABC importer found so far, with a total molecular mass of around 120 kDa. The use of eight different S-components and a single energizing module further adds to the minimalist properties of these transporters.

They form one of the largest known protein families and are found in organisms from all kingdoms of life (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar). ABC transporters consist of two homologous or identical integral membrane domains that form the translocation pore and two peripheral nucleotide-binding domains (ATPases) that energize the transport. ABC importers contain additional extracellular or periplasmic soluble substrate-binding domains or proteins and are found only in prokaryotes (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar, 2Rees D.C. Johnson E. Lewinson O. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Recently, a new type of ABC importer was found, which is widespread among prokaryotes and was named the ECF type (for energy coupling factor) (4Hebbeln P. Rodionov D.A. Alfandega A. Eitinger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2909-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Rodionov D.A. Hebbeln P. Eudes A. ter Beek J. Rodionova I.A. Erkens G.B. Slotboom D.J. Gelfand M.S. Osterman A.L. Hanson A.D. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Like classical ABC transporters, they consist of peripheral (ATPase) and transmembrane subunits that together form an energizing module. Unlike classical ABC importers, ECF-type transporters employ integral membrane proteins (named “S-components”) as substrate-binding proteins. The S-components are small (20–25 kDa) and hydrophobic (4–6 predicted transmembrane segments) (5Rodionov D.A. Hebbeln P. Eudes A. ter Beek J. Rodionova I.A. Erkens G.B. Slotboom D.J. Gelfand M.S. Osterman A.L. Hanson A.D. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analyses have predicted that ECF-type transporters are involved in the uptake of vitamins or other nutrients needed in trace amounts (such as Ni2+ or Co2+ ions) (4Hebbeln P.

The riboflavin-binding protein RibU from Staphylococcus aureus was found to have a new fold, unrelated to the membrane domains of other ABC transporters (8Zhang P. Wang J. Shi Y. Nature. 2010; 468: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).ECF-type ABC transporters fall into two groups (5Rodionov D.A. Hebbeln P. Eudes A. ter Beek J. Rodionova I.A. Erkens G.B.

https://openalex.org/W2038488961,"Hypoxia promotes neural stem cell proliferation, the mechanism of which is poorly understood. Here, we have identified the nuclear orphan receptor TLX as a mediator for proliferation and pluripotency of neural progenitors upon hypoxia. We found an enhanced early protein expression of TLX under hypoxia potentiating sustained proliferation of neural progenitors. Moreover, TLX induction upon hypoxia in differentiating conditions leads to proliferation and a stem cell-like phenotype, along with coexpression of neural stem cell markers. Following hypoxia, TLX is recruited to the Oct-3/4 proximal promoter, augmenting the gene transcription and promoting progenitor proliferation and pluripotency. Knockdown of Oct-3/4 significantly reduced TLX-mediated proliferation, highlighting their interdependence in regulating the progenitor pool. Additionally, TLX synergizes with basic FGF to sustain cell viability upon hypoxia, since the knockdown of TLX along with the withdrawal of growth factor results in cell death. This can be attributed to the activation of Akt signaling pathway by TLX, the depletion of which results in reduced proliferation of progenitor cells. Cumulatively, the data presented here demonstrate a new role for TLX in neural stem cell proliferation and pluripotency upon hypoxia."

Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)c are transcription factors that control cell differentiation and function. We tested whether Notch and NFAT signaling pathways interacted in osteoblastic cells. Notch signaling was induced in ST-2 cells using vectors expressing Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), and in RosaNotch osteoblastic cells by Cre recombinase-mediated excision of a loxP-flanked STOP cassette cloned between the Rosa26 promoter and NICD. NFATc1 was induced in RosaNotch osteoblastic cells by transducing an adenoviral vector expressing constitutively active NFATc1. Notch inhibited NFAT transactivation and NFATc1 transcription.

In the present study, the effects of Notch1 and the products of its target genes Hey1 and Hey2 on NFAT transactivation were explored in cells of the osteoblastic lineage. In addition, the effects of NFATc1 on Notch signaling and the effects of these signaling pathways on osteoblastic differentiation were investigated.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we examined the role of Notch1 in the regulation of NFAT transactivation in ST-2 stromal cells, primary bone marrow stromal cells and calvarial osteoblasts. The results reported demonstrate that Notch1 inhibits NFAT transactivation in the culture models studied. A similar effect has been described in C2C12 cells, an immortalized myoblastic cell line; however, the mechanisms of Notch action were not investigated, and the regulation of NFAT in osteoblastic cells was not explored (14Mammucari C. di Vignano T.

Thus, the effects of Notch1 and Notch2 on the NFATc1 promoter are divergent. This differential regulation could be explained by the diverse cellular environments where the activities were tested, or by the recruitment of different co-regulators of transcription by the Notch1 and Notch2 intracellular domains to the NFATc1 promoter. It is also possible that Notch1 and Notch2 induce the expression of different downstream effectors, resulting in opposite outcomes on the regulation of NFATc1 transcription. The inhibitory effects of Notch1 on NFAT transactivation can be explained by the suppression of NFATc1 transcription, which occurred in both ST-2 cells and primary osteoblasts. Hey1 and Hey2 suppressed NFAT transactivation in ST-2 cells, and it is conceivable that they mediated the inhibitory effect of NICD on NFATc1 transcription. NICD suppressed the levels of a caNFATc1 protein expressed under control of the CMV promoter in RosaNotch osteoblasts. This promoter is used for constitutive protein overexpression in mammalian cells, and inhibition of its activity by NICD has not been reported (66Boshart M. Weber F. Jahn G. Dorsch-Häsler K. Fleckenstein B. Schaffner W. Cell. 1985; 41: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 67Nelson J.A. Reynolds-Kohler C. Smith B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4125-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, destabilization of the NFATc1 protein by NICD may explain the results observed.Notch also suppressed the expression of Prkg2, which encodes cGKII, a kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3β, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits the activity of NFAT. Forced expression of the constitutively active cGKIIS126E mutant relieved the inhibitory effects of NICD on NFAT transactivation in ST-2 cells. Thus, the suppression of cGKII expression by Notch could contribute to its inhibitory effects on NFAT transactivation in ST-2 cells. Although Notch suppressed Prkg2 in RosaNotch osteoblasts, cGKIIS126E did not reverse the inhibitory effects of Notch on NFAT transactivation, indicating that in these cells Notch acts primarily by suppressing NFATc1 transcription. Therefore, the inhibition of NFAT transactivation by NICD is mediated by cGKII only at defined stages of osteoblast differentiation.NFATc1 suppressed transactivation of the 12xCSL-Luc reporter construct, and binding of caNFATc1 to a Csl consensus sequence was demonstrated by EMSA, suggesting that NFATc1 inhibits canonical Notch signaling by competing with CSL for binding to DNA. Conversely, induction of Notch signaling suppressed the interaction of caNFATc1 with an Nfatc1 consensus sequence, indicating that NICD suppresses NFAT transactivation by decreasing the binding of NFATc1 to DNA. These findings support the notion that NFATc1 and CSL compete for similar DNA consensus sequences, explaining the reciprocal inhibitory effects of Notch and NFAT signaling on the transactivation of their target genes. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy demonstrated that CSL and NFATc1 interact in the nucleus of primary calvarial osteoblasts, and formation of a complex between CSL and NFATc1 can provide an additional explanation for the reciprocal inhibition of the Notch and NFAT signaling pathways. Interactions of CSL with other transcription factors have been reported in mesenchymal cells, and our results strengthen the notion that Notch canonical signaling is regulated by alternate signaling pathways (71Kitamura T. Kitamura Y.I. Funahashi Y. Shawber C.J. Castrillon D.H. Kollipara R. DePinho R.A. Kitajewski J. Accili D. J. Clin.

Down-regulation of endogenous NFATc1 favored the commitment of ST-2 cells to the osteoblastic lineage, whereas constitutive activation of NFAT signaling did not affect cell fate in either ST-2 cells or in primary bone marrow stromal cells. This indicates that basal levels of NFATc1 are sufficient to hamper the commitment of stromal cells to the osteoblastic lineage and an increase in the levels of active NFATc1 do not result in further suppression of osteoblastogenesis. In primary cultures, constitutive activation of NFATc1 decreased the expression of osteoblastic markers, indicating suppression of mature osteoblastic function. Although the effects of NFATc1 on osteoblast differentiation and function have been controversial, these results are in agreement with recent work demonstrating that NFATc1 inhibits osteoblastic differentiation and suppresses the activity of the osteocalcin promoter by recruiting histone deacetylases (28Koga T.

These results are also in agreement with findings obtained from mice where the osteoblast-specific deletion of Calcineurin, an activator of NFAT signaling, enhances osteoblastic function and trabecular bone volume (32Yeo H.

However, these results differ from those obtained following the global deletion of Calcineurin or Nfatc2 resulting in suppressed osteoblastic function, or Nfatc1 resulting in defective bone formation in the skull (28Koga T.

It is conceivable that the impaired osteoblastic function observed in calcineurin, Nfatc1, and Nfatc2 global null mice is due to systemic effects, and this would explain the discrepancy with the results obtained in the conditional null models.In conclusion, Notch and NFATc1 form a regulatory signaling network that controls osteoblast differentiation and function. Notch signaling suppresses NFATc1 transactivation by inhibiting its transcription and its binding to Nfatc1 consensus sequences, and NFATc1 suppresses Notch canonical signaling by competing for binding to Csl consensus sequences. The reciprocal inhibition of Notch and NFAT transactivation represents a novel mechanism to temper their suppressive effects on osteoblastic function. This system is redundant because both pathways oppose osteoblast activity, and in the event of failure in either the Notch or NFAT signaling pathways, suppression of osteoblastogenesis would still occur. IntroductionNotch proteins are single pass transmembrane receptors that play a critical role in cell fate decisions. Notch regulates several developmental processes, and contributes to the regulation of cell renewal in multiple organs and cell systems (1Fortini M.E. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 633-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Notch is involved in skeletal development and homeostasis, because it inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, and suppresses osteoblast differentiation and osteoclastogenesis (2Mead T.J.

There are four Notch receptors (Notch1 to 4) and five canonical ligands, which are Serrate/Jagged1 and 2, and Delta-Like 1, 3, and 4 (7D'Souza B. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5148-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).

In the canonical Notch signaling pathway, NICD translocates to the nucleus and interacts with Epstein-Barr virus latency C promoter binding factor 1, suppressor of hairless and Lag-1 (CSL), which is bound to DNA and suppresses gene expression by recruiting transcriptional co-repressors. The binding of NICD to CSL induces the formation of a ternary complex with Mastermind-like proteins, which displaces the transcriptional co-repressors and recruits co-activators of transcription (9Kovall R.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5099-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2001569497,"Cells lacking the exosome-associated protein Rrp47 show similar defects in stable RNA processing to those observed in the absence of the catalytic subunit Rrp6, but the precise mechanism(s) by which Rrp47 functions together with Rrp6 remains unclear. Deletion complementation analyses defined an N-terminal region of Rrp47, largely coincident with the bioinformatically defined Sas10/C1D domain, which was sufficient for protein function in vivo. In vitro protein interaction studies demonstrated that this domain of Rrp47 binds the PMC2NT domain of Rrp6. Expression of the N-terminal domain of Rrp47 in yeast complemented most RNA-processing defects associated with the rrp47Δ mutant but failed to complement the defect observed in 3'-end maturation of box C/D small nucleolar RNAs. Consistent with these results, protein capture assays revealed an interaction between the C-terminal region of Rrp47 and the small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins Nop56 and Nop58. Filter binding assays demonstrated that deletion of the lysine-rich sequence at the C terminus of Rrp47 blocked RNA binding in vitro. Furthermore, a protein mutated both at the C terminus and within the N-terminal domain showed a synergistic defect in RNA binding without impacting on its ability to interact with Rrp6. These studies provide evidence for a role of Rrp47 in registering a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle assembly, functionally characterize the Sas10/C1D domain of Rrp47, and show that both the C terminus of Rrp47 and the N-terminal domain contribute to its RNA-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1972280410,"Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is an essential quality control process whereby misfolded proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol. The ATPase p97 acts as an essential component of this process by providing the force needed for retrotranslocation and by serving as a processing station for the substrate once in the cytosol. Proteins containing the ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) ubiquitin-like domain function as adaptors for p97 through their direct binding with the amino terminus of the ATPase. We demonstrate that the UBX protein SAKS1 is able to act as an adaptor for p97 that negatively modulates ERAD. This requires the ability of SAKS1 to bind both polyubiquitin and p97. Moreover, the association between SAKS1 and p97 is positively regulated by polyubiquitin binding of the UBX protein. SAKS1 also negatively impacts the p97-dependent processing required for degradation of a cytosolic, non-ERAD, substrate. We find SAKS1 is able to protect polyubiquitin from the activity of deubiquitinases, such as ataxin-3, that are necessary for efficient ERAD. Thus, SAKS1 inhibits protein degradation mediated by p97 complexes in the cytosol with a component of the mechanism being the ability to shield polyubiquitin chains from ubiquitin-processing factors."

https://openalex.org/W2057463560,"Guanine nucleotide binding protein-like 3-like (GNL3L) is a nucleolar protein and the vertebrate paralogue of nucleostemin (NS). We previously reported that nucleoplasmic mobilization of NS stabilizes MDM2 (mouse double minute 2). Here, we investigated the role of GNL3L as a novel MDM2 regulator. We found that GNL3L binds MDM2 in vivo and displays the same function as NS in stabilizing MDM2 protein and preventing its ubiquitylation. The interaction between GNL3L and MDM2 also takes place in the nucleoplasm. However, the MDM2 regulatory activity of GNL3L occurs constitutively and does not so much depend on the nucleolar release mechanism as NS does. GNL3L depletion triggers G2/M arrest in the p53-wild-type HCT116 cells more than in the p53-null cells, and upregulates specific p53 targets (that is, Bax, 14-3-3σ and p21) without affecting the ubiquitylation or stability of p53 proteins. The inhibitory activity of GNL3L on p53-mediated transcription correlates with the increased expression of GNL3L and reduced expression of 14-3-3σ and p21 in human gastrointestinal tumors. This work shows that in contrast to most nucleolar proteins that negatively control MDM2, GNL3L and NS are the only two that are designed to stabilize MDM2 protein under basal or induced condition, respectively, and may act as tumor-promoting genes."

https://openalex.org/W2066082092,"Disruption of the breast cancer susceptibility gene Brca1 results in defective lobular-alveolar development in the mammary gland and a predisposition to breast tumourigenesis in humans and in mice. Recent evidence suggests that BRCA1 loss in humans is associated with an expansion of the luminal progenitor cell compartment in the normal breast and tumours with a luminal progenitor-like expression profile. To further investigate the role of BRCA1 in the mammary gland, we examined the consequences of Brca1 loss in mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that Brca1 loss is associated with defective morphogenesis of SCp2 and HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cell lines and that in the MMTV-Cre Brca1Co/Co mouse model of Brca1 loss, there is an accumulation of luminal progenitor (CD61+CD29loCD24+) cells during pregnancy. By day 1 of lactation, there are marked differences in the expression of 1379 genes, with most significantly altered pathways and networks, including lactation, the immune response and cancer. One of the most differentially expressed genes was the luminal progenitor marker, c-kit. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the increase in c-kit levels is associated with an increase in c-kit positivity. Interestingly, an inverse association between Brca1 and c-kit expression was also observed during mammary epithelial differentiation, and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Brca1 resulted in a significant increase in c-kit mRNA levels. We found no evidence that c-kit plays a direct role in regulating differentiation of HC11 cells, suggesting that Brca1-mediated induction of c-kit probably contributes to Brca1-associated tumourigenesis via another cellular process, and that c-kit is likely to be a marker rather than a mediator of defective lobular-alveolar development resulting from Brca1 loss."
https://openalex.org/W2156920475,"Telomerase is tightly regulated in humans relative to mice, owing to the differential regulation of TERT genes. To explore hTERT regulation in vivo, we engineered mice with a 160-kb transgenic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) spanning the hTERT locus with a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) cassette downstream of its promoter. Analysis of multiple founder lines revealed that the Rluc expression profile from the transgenic hTERT reporter locus reproduced that of the native hTERT gene in all tissues and organs examined, demonstrating that genetic sequence determined the species-specific developmental regulation of the hTERT gene and that mouse epigenetic and transcription machineries faithfully regulated hTERT transcription. Thus, these mice allowed detailed analyses of developmental hTERT regulation. Both the transgenic hTERT reporter and the endogenous mTERT locus were expressed in early embryonic stages, and their mRNA levels progressively decreased throughout embryonic and postnatal development. Whereas hTERT transcription was much lower than mTERT expression in most organs, it increased significantly during postnatal development of thymus, testis, and ovary. In testis, the Rluc mRNA was enriched in elongating spermatids of seminiferous tubules. In addition, the transcription of transgenic hTERT reporter, but surprisingly not the endogenous mTERT gene, was activated during Wnt1-induced mammary tumorigenesis, allowing the monitoring of tumor development via noninvasive bioluminescent imaging. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the hTERT transgenic reporter system recapitulates the developmental regulation of the hTERT gene in a chromosomal position-independent manner and serves as a legitimate model to explore telomerase regulation in the development of normal and neoplastic tissues in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1965875359,"Heat-labile toxins (LTs) have ADP-ribosylation activity and induce the secretory diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains in different mammalian hosts. LTs also act as adjuvants following delivery via mucosal, parenteral, or transcutaneous routes. Previously we have shown that LT produced by human-derived ETEC strains encompass a group of 16 polymorphic variants, including the reference toxin (LT1 or hLT) produced by the H10407 strain and one variant that is found mainly among bacterial strains isolated from pigs (LT4 or pLT). Herein, we show that LT4 (with six polymorphic sites in the A (K4R, K213E, and N238D) and B (S4T, A46E, and E102K) subunits) displays differential in vitro toxicity and in vivo adjuvant activities compared with LT1. One in vitro generated LT mutant (LTK4R), in which the lysine at position 4 of the A subunit was replaced by arginine, showed most of the LT4 features with an ∼10-fold reduction of the cytotonic effects, ADP-ribosylation activity, and accumulation of intracellular cAMP in Y1 cells. Molecular dynamic studies of the A subunit showed that the K4R replacement reduces the N-terminal region flexibility and decreases the catalytic site crevice. Noticeably, LT4 showed a stronger Th1-biased adjuvant activity with regard to LT1, particularly concerning activation of cytotoxic CD8(+) T lymphocytes when delivered via the intranasal route. Our results further emphasize the relevance of LT polymorphism among human-derived ETEC strains that may impact both the pathogenicity of the bacterial strain and the use of these toxins as potential vaccine adjuvants."
https://openalex.org/W1998313754,"Our previous studies demonstrated that protein kinase D (PKD), a serine/threonine kinase implicated in various cell processes, is upregulated in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), supporting a possible tumorigenic role for PKD in skin. As the greatest risk factor for BCC is sun exposure, the ability of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation to activate PKD in primary mouse keratinocytes was investigated. Using western analysis with two autophosphorylation-specific antibodies, we show for the first time that UVB activated PKD in a time- and dose-dependent manner. UVB-induced PKD activation was verified using an in vitro kinase assay. Furthermore, activation was reduced by antioxidant pretreatment, suggesting a link with oxidative stress. UVB-induced PKD activation was mediated primarily by Src family tyrosine kinases rather than protein kinase C (PKC), and in fact, UVB did not alter PKC-mediated transphosphorylation. UVB induced apoptosis dose dependently, and this death could be prevented by overexpression of wild-type PKD, but not mutant PKD or the empty adenovirus. Indeed, a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by Src kinases exacerbated UVB-elicited apoptosis. Thus, our data indicate that UVB irradiation of keratinocytes induces Src-mediated activation of PKD, which protects cells from UVB-stimulated apoptosis, providing a possible explanation for the observed upregulation of PKD in BCC."

IntroductionThe flagellated and binucleated protozoan Giardia duodenalis (synonymous of Giardia lamblia and Giardia intestinalis) is an extracellular parasite of the upper part of the small intestine of mammals, including humans, where it causes giardiasis, an acute enteritis (1Thompson R.C. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Besides its relevance for human and animal health, G. duodenalis is also a fascinating and simple eukaryotic organism with a minimalistic genomic and cellular organization that arouses a great interest as a biological model (2Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Gillin F.D. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Olsen G.J. Best A.A. Cande W.Z. Chen F. Cipriano M.J. Davids B.J. Dawson S.C. Elmendorf H.G. Hehl A.B. Holder M.E. Huse S.M. Kim U.U.

Science. 2007; 317: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In this perspective we have previously characterized the single giardial 14-3-3 (g14-3-3) isoform, a member of a small dimeric protein family ubiquitously conserved in eukaryotes (3Lalle M.

Crescenzi M. Pozio E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2010; 40: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3s are able to bind a wide range of proteins containing consensus binding motifs usually phosphorylated on serine or threonine, thus, regulating multiple cellular processes, i.e. the metabolism, cell cycle progression, signal transduction pathways, cell growth, and differentiation (5Aitken A. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 2006; 16: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the g14-3-3 is modified in a peculiar fashion by the phosphorylation of Thr-214 and the polyglycylation of Glu-246 (3Lalle M. Salzano A.M. Crescenzi M. Pozio E. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 2010; 40: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The glycylation, first discovered at the C-terminal domain of α- and β-tubulin, is a post-translational modification consisting of the covalent addition of one or multiple glycines to the γ-carboxyl groups of specific glutamic acids of target proteins (6Bré M.H. Redeker V. Vinh J. Rossier J. Levilliers N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Vinh J. Langridge J.I. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. Redeker V. Loyaux D. Rossier J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, polyglycylation has been also reported for several proteins, including the mammalian nucleosome assembly proteins (8Ikegami K. Horigome D. Mukai M. Livnat I. MacGregor G.R. Setou M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Ikegami K. Setou M. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Rogowski K.

Whereas the phosphorylation of g14-3-3 is a constitutive post-translational modification, the polyglycylation of the protein is regulated during the G. duodenalis life cycle with a remarkable reduction in the length of the polyglycine chain during the early phase of the encystation process (3Lalle M. Salzano A.M. Crescenzi M. Pozio E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5137-5148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Lalle M. Bavassano C. Fratini F. Cecchetti S. Boisguerin P. Crescenzi M. Pozio E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2010; 40: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Polyglycylation has been related to the intracellular localization of g14-3-3, as the shortening of the polyglycine chain is correlated with a partial relocalization of the protein inside the nuclei. In fact, in G. duodenalis parasites expressing the g14-3-3 mutant E246A, which cannot be polyglycylated, the protein localizes in the nuclei throughout the parasite life cycle, resulting in a faster differentiation of the trophozoite into the cyst stage once the process has been induced (3Lalle M.

However, the existence of enzymes responsible for the removal of glycines has only been indirectly demonstrated, but information about their identity is still missing (16Weber K. Schneider A. Westermann S. Müller N. Plessmann U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Campanati L. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. de Souza W. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).In this work we demonstrate that the giardial TTLL3 (gTTLL3), a member of the TTLL family, is the enzyme responsible for the 14-3-3 polyglycylation. We also identify two metallopeptidases of the M20 family, here termed gDIP1 and gDIP2, as enzymes able to shorten the g14-3-3 polyglycine tail both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we show that the ectopic expression of gDIP2 alters the g14-3-3 localization and strongly hampers the cyst formation.DISCUSSIONIn this work we have shown that in G. duodenalis, despite the presence of several TTLL encoding genes, only the gTTLL3 protein displays an appreciable polyglycylation activity on g14-3-3. An in vitro glycylation assay using the AXO49 Ab, which recognizes polyglycine chains of at least four residues (3Lalle M. Salzano A.M. Crescenzi M. Pozio E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5137-5148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Bré M.H. Redeker V. Quibell M. Darmanaden-Delorme J. Bressac C. Cosson J. Huitorel P. Schmitter J.M. Rossler J. Johnson T. Adoutte A. Levilliers N. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 727-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), together with the recombinant unmodified g14-3-3 suggests that gTTLL3 could be initiating/elongating enzymes that catalyze both the addition of the first glycine on the C terminus of g14-3-3 and the subsequent elongation of the polyglycine chain. Recent findings have demonstrated that in vertebrates polyglycylation of microtubules occurs by a two-step mechanism requiring the combined activities of the TTLL3/8 and TTLL10 enzymes (9Ikegami K. Setou M. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Rogowski K. Juge F. van Dijk J. Wloga D. Strub J.M. Levilliers N. Thomas D. Bré M.H. Van Dorsselaer A. Gaertig J. Janke C. Cell. 2009; 137: 1076-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism probably functions in the ciliate T. thermophila, where the TTLL3 homolog shows only glycine-ligase/initiase activity on tubulin (15Wloga D. Webster D.M. Rogowski K. Bré M.H.

On the contrary, in organisms lacking TTLL10 homologs, bifunctional activities have been reported. In D. melanogaster, DmTTLL3A mono- and polyglycylates the α- and the β-tubulin, whereas DmTTLL3B mono- and polyglycylates non-tubulin proteins (10Rogowski K. Juge F. van Dijk J. Wloga D. Strub J.M.

Notably, mammalian TTLL10 is also able to act as a bifunctional enzyme on nucleosome assembly proteins (8Ikegami K. Horigome D. Mukai M. Livnat I. MacGregor G.R. Setou M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The evidence that gTTLL3 is the only member of the giardial TTLL family clustering close to other mono- and polyglycylases and that G. duodenalis does not have a TTLL10 homolog protein (Ref. 20Redeker V. Levilliers N. Vinolo E. Rossier J. Jaillard D. Burnette D. Gaertig J. Bré M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 596-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; supplemental Fig. S1) is in favor of a direct role of gTTLL3 not only in g14-3-3 but most probably also in the tubulin polyglycylation.As suggested by anti-polyGly immunoblotting and immunolocalizations, expression of the FLAG-gTTLL3 led also to an increase in polyglycylation levels of tubulin and microtubule structures. However, further studies are needed to clarify the activity of gTTLL3 on G. duodenalis tubulin as well as to define the function of the other gTTLLs, in particular gTTLL7, the only one that failed to be expressed.In T. thermophila, TTLL3 protein homologs localize primarily in cilia or basal bodies, with the exception of TTLL3Dp, which is present in the cell body (15Wloga D. Webster D.M. Rogowski K. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. Jerka-Dziadosz M. Janke C. Dougan S.T. Gaertig J. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 867-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the FLAG-gTTLL3 protein partially co-localizes with g14-3-3 at all stages, in agreement with its polyglycylation activity toward g14-3-3, and it is not present in flagella or basal bodies. Intriguingly, in cysts the FLAG-gTTLL3 signal accumulates just underneath the cyst wall, most probably at the plasmalemma level. In agreement with gene expression data, this peculiar localization could suggest that physiologically the protein is constitutively expressed and stored during the dormant cyst stage to be eventually available during excystation. A similar conservative strategy is adopted by G. duodenalis during cyst formation; the ventral disc and flagella are broken into several large fragments, stored in the cytoplasm of the cyst, and apparently reassembled during excystation (35Palm D. Weiland M. McArthur A.G. Winiecka-Krusnell J. Cipriano M.J. Birkeland S.R. Pacocha S.E. Davids B. Gillin F. Linder E. Svärd S. Mol. Biochem.

Int. 2009; 58: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The production of FLAG-gTTLL3 protein did not affect the deglycylation of g14-3-3 during encystation, g14-3-3 localization, or the encystation timing. These data suggest that the developmental modulation of polyglycine chain length is exerted by deglycylating enzymes irrespective of the starting polyglycylation level. This hypothesis is supported by the almost constant expression of the gttll3 gene in the wild type G. duodenalis strain.To the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting the identification of two metallopeptidases, gDIP1 and gDIP2, with a deglycylase activity. The reversible nature of polyglycylation and the existence of tubulin deglycylases were previously shown in cytoplasmic extracts of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, but the enzymes were not identified (6Bré M.H. Redeker V. Vinh J. Rossier J. Levilliers N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). gDIP1 and gDIP2 belong to the MH clan, subfamily M20C. Metallopeptidases of the clan MH contains six families (M18, M20, M25, M28, M40, and M42) with enzymes having known activities such as carboxypeptidases or aminopeptidases. Members of the M20 metallohydrolase family, further divided into four subfamilies (A–D), require co-catalytic divalent metal ions, generally zinc, for their activity, and all include different exopeptidases, like the members of the clans MF and MG (37Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D227-D233Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). However, the M20 and M28 families are unique in attacking the C terminus of the substrate (37Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D227-D233Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The glutamate carboxypeptidase G2 of Pseudomonas sp. (subfamily M20A) hydrolyzes the C-terminal glutamate moiety from folic acid and its analogues (38Minton N.P. Atkinson T. Sherwood R.F. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the tripeptidase T (M20B) of Lactococcus lacti hydrolyzes only tripeptides (39Mori S. Nirasawa S. Komba S. Kasumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1748: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), the bacterial aminoacylhistidine dipeptidase performs hydrolysis of dipeptides (40Henrich B. Klein J.R. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, London2004: 951-953Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar), and the thermostable carboxypeptidase Ss1 (M20D) of the archean Sulfolobus solfataricus is able to cleave N-blocked tripeptides (41Colombo S. Toietta G. Zecca L. Vanoni M. Tortora P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5561-5566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The ectopic expression of FLAG-gDIP1 and FLAG-gDIP2 in G. duodenalis results in a remarkable reduction in the length of the polyglycine chain of g14-3-3, down to a size comparable with that observed in the g14-3-3 from wild type encysting parasites (3Lalle M. Salzano A.M. Crescenzi M. Pozio E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5137-5148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a complete deglycylation of g14-3-3 was not observed at any stage in FLAG-gDIP1 or FLAG-gDIP2 transgenic parasite. A possible explanation for these observations might be related to the need for FLAG-gDIP1 and -2 activities for a cofactor protein, likely present in limiting amounts. Alternatively or in addition, the function of both enzymes might be partially counteracted by the activity of endogenous gTTLL3. The physiological, simultaneous expression of both the gttll3 and gdip1 genes in trophozoites and encysting parasites weighs in favor of the second hypothesis, again indicating that in G. duodenalis a fine balance exists between polyglycylation and deglycylation of g14-3-3. However, even though the partial deglycylation of g14-3-3 obtained in vitro with FLAG-tagged enzymes confirms the in vivo observations, the experimental conditions used in vitro might not allow the enzymes to express their full activities. Furthermore, the modest-to-absent inhibitory effect exerted by the metal chelator EDTA on the FLAG-gDIPs activities has also been reported for other metallopeptidases of different clans, such as human aminopeptidase N, Bacillus stearothermophilus aminopeptidase I, and Sabellastarte magnifica metallocarboxypeptidase (42Moser P. Roncari G. Zuber H. Int. J. Protein. Res. 1970; 2: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Vanderheyden P.M. Demaegdt H. Swales J. Lenaerts P.J. De Backer J.P. Vogel L.K. Vauquelin G.

Aviles F.X. Chávez M.A. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 4875-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In these cases the absence of the inhibitory effect has been related to a strong binding of the metal to the enzyme.Previously, we have demonstrated that the E246A mutant of g14-3-3, which cannot be glycylated, localizes to the nuclei already at the trophozoite stage, resulting in a faster differentiation of trophozoites into cysts (4Lalle M. Bavassano C. Fratini F. Cecchetti S. Boisguerin P. Crescenzi M. Pozio E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2010; 40: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we show that despite the comparable shortening of g14-3-3 polyglycine chain attained by both metallopeptidases, the g14-3-3 localization in the trophozoites nuclei occurs only in FLAG-gDIP2 transfectants. Moreover, we observe that the expression of FLAG-gDIP2 strongly hampers cyst formation and affects CWP protein levels, whereas the forced expression of FLAG-gDIP1 results only in a limited reduction of encystation efficiency. Nevertheless, these results are not in conflict, as the g14-3-3 E246A point mutation only affects the g14-3-3 itself, whereas the expression of FLAG-gDIP1 and FLAG-gDIP2 might exert its effect on multiple targets, most likely including tubulin. Taken together, these data indicate that gDIP1 and gDIP2, besides their role in deglycylation of 14-3-3 and possibly tubulin, might carry out other functions, as also suggested by the different localization of the two proteins. Indeed, FLAG-gDIP2 labeling is evident in the median body, in the marginal groove, and in the ventrolateral flanges, whereas FLAG-gDIP1 localizes also in the nuclei. Moreover, the fact that gdip2 is down-regulated at the encystation, whereas gdip1 is almost constitutively expressed supports the possible involvement of these enzymes in different cellular processes. Deglycylation of nuclear proteins, such as transcriptional or chromatin remodeling factors, might be responsible for the defect in encystation most clearly observed in the FLAG-gDIP2 transgenic line. It has been proposed that glycylation by TTLL10 of nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) in the mouse might modulate NAP1-histone interactions, thus inducing transcriptional repression during spermiogenesis (8Ikegami K. Horigome D. Mukai M. Livnat I. MacGregor G.R. Setou M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In D. melanogaster, depletion of DmTTLL3B protein results in several defects attributed to the potential lack of glycylation of its substrates, including chaperonins and motor proteins (10Rogowski K. Juge F. van Dijk J. Wloga D. Strub J.M. Levilliers N. Thomas D. Bré M.H. Van Dorsselaer A. Gaertig J. Janke C.

Intriguingly, G. duodenalis motor proteins are localized in an area corresponding to the lateral crest of the trophozoite (45Narcisi E.M. Paulin J.J. Fechheimer M. J. Parasitol. 1994; 80: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, further studies are needed to verify the existence of other polyglycylation substrates and their possible involvement in the differentiation of G. duodenalis.Recently, Kimura et al. (46Kimura Y. Kurabe N. Ikegami K. Tsutsumi K. Konishi Y. Kaplan O.I. Kunitomo H. Iino Y. Blacque O.E. Setou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22936-22941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) published the identification in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans of tubulin deglutamylases as cytosolic carboxypeptidases of the MC clan, M14 family, subfamily M14D of metallopeptidases. G. duodenalis has four genes encoding proteins assigned to the M14 family but all classified as non-peptidase homologs (23Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, London2004: 231-268Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Notably, metallopeptidases of the MC and the MH clans share no detectable sequence homologies (47Wouters M.A. Husain A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1191-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), thus, excluding the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin. However, they show a common protein fold similar to peptidases in which two zinc atoms are essential for their activity (such as MH metallopeptidases), implying that metallopeptidase activity might be acquired in independent evolutionary events (37Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D227-D233Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Because the identified deglutamylases (46Kimura Y. Kurabe N. Ikegami K. Tsutsumi K.

Indeed, members of the metallopeptidase clans M14 and M28 and subfamilies M20A and M20D, but none of the M20C, have been identified in the partially annotated genomes of the ciliates T. thermophila and P. tetraurelia as well as in humans and D. melanogaster (23Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, London2004: 231-268Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified in G. duodenalis a polyglycylase and two deglycylases that act in concert to modulate the stage-dependent glycylation state of the multifunctional regulatory g14-3-3 protein. IntroductionThe flagellated and binucleated protozoan Giardia duodenalis (synonymous of Giardia lamblia and Giardia intestinalis) is an extracellular parasite of the upper part of the small intestine of mammals, including humans, where it causes giardiasis, an acute enteritis (1Thompson R.C. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Besides its relevance for human and animal health, G. duodenalis is also a fascinating and simple eukaryotic organism with a minimalistic genomic and cellular organization that arouses a great interest as a biological model (2Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Gillin F.D. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Olsen G.J. Best A.A. Cande W.Z. Chen F. Cipriano M.J. Davids B.J. Dawson S.C. Elmendorf H.G. Hehl A.B. Holder M.E. Huse S.M. Kim U.U.

Science. 2007; 317: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In this perspective we have previously characterized the single giardial 14-3-3 (g14-3-3) isoform, a member of a small dimeric protein family ubiquitously conserved in eukaryotes (3Lalle M.

Crescenzi M. Pozio E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2010; 40: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3s are able to bind a wide range of proteins containing consensus binding motifs usually phosphorylated on serine or threonine, thus, regulating multiple cellular processes, i.e. the metabolism, cell cycle progression, signal transduction pathways, cell growth, and differentiation (5Aitken A. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 2006; 16: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the g14-3-3 is modified in a peculiar fashion by the phosphorylation of Thr-214 and the polyglycylation of Glu-246 (3Lalle M. Salzano A.M. Crescenzi M. Pozio E. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 2010; 40: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The glycylation, first discovered at the C-terminal domain of α- and β-tubulin, is a post-translational modification consisting of the covalent addition of one or multiple glycines to the γ-carboxyl groups of specific glutamic acids of target proteins (6Bré M.H.

Recently, polyglycylation has been also reported for several proteins, including the mammalian nucleosome assembly proteins (8Ikegami K. Horigome D. Mukai M. Livnat I. MacGregor G.R. Setou M.

Recent observations show that PAI-1 may also be implicated in maintaining integrity of cells, especially with respect to cellular proliferation or apoptosis. In the present study we provide evidence that PAI-1 interacts with proteasome and affects its activity. First, by using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that the α3 subunit of proteasome directly interacts with PAI-1. Then, to ensure that the PAI-1-proteasome complex is formed in vivo, both proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from endothelial cells and identified with specific antibodies. The specificity of this interaction was evidenced after transfection of HeLa cells with pCMV-PAI-1 and coimmunoprecipitation of both proteins with anti-PAI-1 antibodies. Subsequently, cellular distribution of the PAI-1-proteasome complexes was established by immunogold staining and electron microscopy analyses. Both proteins appeared in a diffuse cytosolic pattern but also could be found in a dense perinuclear and nuclear location. Furthermore, PAI-1 induced formation of aggresomes freely located in endothelial cytoplasm. Increased PAI-1 expression abrogated degradation of degron analyzed after cotransfection of HeLa cells with pCMV-PAI-1 and pd2EGFP-N1 and prevented degradation of p53 as well as IκBα, as evidenced both by confocal microscopy and Western immunoblotting."
https://openalex.org/W2041998309,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to HER2 are currently used to treat breast cancer, but low clinical efficacy, along with primary and acquired resistance to therapy, commonly limit clinical applications. We previously reported that combinations of antibodies directed at non-overlapping epitopes of HER2 are endowed with enhanced antitumor effects, probably due to accelerated receptor degradation. Here, we extend these observations to three-dimensional mammary cell models, and compare the effects of single mAbs with the effects of antibody combinations. Collectively, our in vitro assays and computational image analyses indicate that combining mAbs against different epitopes of HER2 better inhibits invasive growth. Importantly, while growth factors are able to reduce intraluminal apoptosis and induce an invasive phenotype, combinations of mAbs better than single mAbs can reverse the growth factor-induced phenotypes of HER2-overexpressing spheroids. In conclusion, our studies propose that mAb combinations negate the biological effects of growth factors on invasive growth of HER2-overexpressing cells. Hence, combining mAbs offers a therapeutic strategy, potentially able to enhance clinical efficacy of existing antireceptor immunotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2123197724,"The SET1 family of methyltransferases carries out the bulk of histone H3 Lys-4 methylation in vivo. One of the common features of this family is the regulation of their methyltransferase activity by a tripartite complex composed of WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L. To selectively probe the role of the SET1 family of methyltransferases, we have developed a library of histone H3 peptide mimetics and report herein the characterization of an Nα acetylated form of histone H3 peptide (NαH3). Binding and inhibition studies reveal that the addition of an acetyl moiety to the N terminus of histone H3 significantly enhances its binding to WDR5 and prevents the stimulation of MLL1 methyltransferase activity by the WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L complex. The crystal structure of NαH3 in complex with WDR5 reveals that a high-affinity hydrophobic pocket accommodates the binding of the acetyl moiety. These results provide the structural basis to control WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L-MLL1 activity and a tool to manipulate stem cell differentiation programs."

Several stages of vesicular transport are mediated by the small GTPase Arf, which is controlled in a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis by Arf guanine-nucleotide exchange factors and Arf GTPase-activating proteins (ArfGAPs), respectively. In budding yeast the Age2 + Gcs1 ArfGAP pair facilitates post-Golgi transport. We have found the AGE1 gene, encoding another ArfGAP, can in high gene-copy number alleviate the temperature sensitivity of cells carrying mutations affecting the Age2 + Gcs1 ArfGAP pair. Moreover, increased AGE1 gene dosage compensates for the complete absence of the otherwise essential Age2 + Gcs1 ArfGAP pair. Increased dosage of SFH2, encoding a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, also allows cell growth in the absence of the Age2 + Gcs1 pair, but good growth in this situation requires Age1. The ability of Age1 to overcome the need for Age2 + Gcs1 depends on phospholipase D activity that regulates lipid composition. We show by direct assessment of Age1 ArfGAP activity that Age1 is regulated by lipid composition and can provide ArfGAP function for post-Golgi transport.

We show by direct assessment of Age1 ArfGAP activity that Age1 is regulated by lipid composition and can provide ArfGAP function for post-Golgi transport. Eukaryotic cells move protein and membrane cargo between the plasma membrane and various organelles by a process termed vesicular transport. Each step in the vesicular-transport process, including vesicle generation, cargo packaging, vesicle targeting, and vesicle fusion, is controlled by a variety of proteins (for review, see Ref. 1Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Regulated vesicular transport not only ensures the fidelity of cargo delivery but also maintains the structural and functional integrity of membrane organelles. Each stage of vesicular transport relies on a specific set of proteins to form the transport vesicle and direct the vesicle to the target compartment. For example, vesicles involved in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum require coat protein complex I (COPI) and the small GTPase Arf1 (2Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C.

Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), whereas transport vesicles originating from the trans-Golgi network also require the Arf1 GTPase but use the clathrin coat complex (4Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 5Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Arf1 regulates recruitment of coat protein complex I and clathrin coat complexes to the donor membrane, where these coat complexes mediate the generation of transport vesicles by deforming the membrane. Arf regulatory activity depends on a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis, which is in turn regulated by two types of proteins, Arf guanine-nucleotide exchange factors and Arf GTPase-activating proteins (ArfGAPs). 6The abbreviations used are: ArfGAPArf GTPase-activating proteinDAGdiacylglycerolmyrmyristoylatedRFPred fluorescent protein. Arf guanine-nucleotide exchange factors mediate the exchange of GDP for GTP on Arf to activate Arf and allow coat recruitment (6Peyroche A. Paris S. Jackson C.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas ArfGAPs stimulate hydrolysis of Arf-bound GTP to inactivate Arf and allow release of coat proteins from transport vesicles in preparation for fusion of the transport vesicle with a target membrane (7Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Arf GTPase-activating protein diacylglycerol myristoylated red fluorescent protein. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains ArfGAP proteins that are characterized by a zinc-binding motif (CXXCX16CXXC, where C is cysteine and X is any amino acid) and a nearby invariant arginine residue, which together constitute a catalytic center known as the ArfGAP domain (4Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Four yeast proteins, Gcs1, Glo3, Age2, and Age1, have been shown to exert ArfGAP activity in vitro (8Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl.

Yeast. 2003; 20: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with the Age2 + Gcs1 ArfGAP pair providing essential overlapping function for post-Golgi transport (10Poon P.P. Nothwehr S.F. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Vesicular transport is also mediated by membrane lipid composition through the effects of lipid-protein interactions on protein function. The membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol is phosphorylated on the inositol ring to produce distinct phospholipid species that, like Arf, are involved in protein recruitment to membranes for vesicle formation. One family of yeast proteins that affects membrane lipid composition is defined by the Sec14 phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that is involved in vesicle formation for post-Golgi transport, presumably by creating a lipid composition permissive for vesicle formation. Indeed, we and others have shown that ArfGAP activity is modulated by lipid environment (12Yanagisawa L.L. Marchena J. Xie Z. Li X. Poon P.P. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Randazzo P.A. Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2193-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and that increased abundance of the Sec14 homologue Sfh2 enhances Gcs1 activity for post-Golgi transport (14Wong T.A. Fairn G.D. Poon P.P. Shmulevitz M. McMaster C.R. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12777-12782Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have investigated the function of the Age2 + Gcs1 pair for post-Golgi transport by identifying yeast genes that, in increased dosage, alleviate the deleterious effects of impaired ArfGAP function. The AGE1 gene is shown here to alleviate defects resulting from deficient ArfGAP function for post-Golgi transport. The AGE1 gene was initially described as a suppressor of Arf1 temperature sensitivity (SAT1) (15Zhang C.J. Cavenagh M.M. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19792-19796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and was later renamed as encoding an ArfGAP with effector functions (AGE1) (11Zhang C.J. Bowzard J.B. Anido A. Kahn R.A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Those studies implicated the Age1 protein in Arf1 function because increased AGE1 gene dosage alleviates the temperature sensitivity caused by the arf1-3 mutant allele (15Zhang C.J. Cavenagh M.M. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19792-19796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A more direct role for Age1 in Arf1 function was implied by the finding that the Age1 protein has ArfGAP activity in vitro (11Zhang C.J. Bowzard J.B. Anido A. Kahn R.A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We show here that deletion of the AGE1 gene compromises the ability of increased SFH2 gene dosage to alleviate post-Golgi transport defects in cells lacking the Age2 + Gcs1 ArfGAP pair. Moreover, we find that the ability of AGE1 to effectively alleviate post-Golgi transport defects depends upon phospholipase D, an effector of an Sfh2-mediated phosphoinositide metabolic pathway (16Routt S.M. Ryan M.M. Tyeryar K. Rizzieri K.E. Mousley C. Roumanie O. Brennwald P.J. Bankaitis V.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that the in vitro ArfGAP activity of Age1 is stimulated by diacylglycerol (DAG), a downstream product of phospholipase D activity. Thus, our analysis highlights the importance of phospholipid metabolism for ArfGAP activity in post-Golgi vesicular transport. Yeast strains used in this study are described in Table 1. Yeast cells were propagated and transformed using standard techniques. Genes encoding the organelle-specific red fluorescent protein (RFP) markers (17Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S.

Plasmids used in this study are described in Table 2. To generate the N-terminal deletion alleles of AGE1 expressed from the endogenous AGE1 promoter, a 600-bp sequence upstream of AGE1 including the first two codons of AGE1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into YEp351 to yield plasmid pSL485. The segments of Age1 encoding the various truncations plus ∼300 bp of downstream sequence were amplified by PCR and cloned downstream of the AGE1 promoter in pSL485 to yield the various high-copy plasmids expressing the AGE1 truncations. The AGE1 sequences from the high-copy plasmids were subcloned into pRS315 to create the low-copy plasmids expressing the AGE1 truncations. For protein expression in bacteria, the entire AGE1 open reading frame and AGE1 codons 169–482 were separately subcloned into pET21b (Novagen) to create plasmids pSL363 and pSL396, respectively. To produce the Age1-GFP and Age1ΔN-GFP fusions, the AGE1 open reading frame and AGE1 sequence from codon 164 to 482 were amplified by PCR and inserted into vector pGREG600 by in vivo ligation in yeast (18Jansen G.

Open table in a new tab Staining with the lipophilic dye FM 4-64 was performed as described (14Wong T.A. Fairn G.D. Poon P.P. Shmulevitz M. McMaster C.R. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For subcellular localization of GFP and RFP protein fusions, cells were concentrated in growth medium by centrifugation just before analysis by fluorescence microscopy. For phospholipid binding and in vitro ArfGAP assays, bacterially expressed Age1ΔN-His6 was purified and eluted from nickel-bead resin under native conditions according to the manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen Inc.). To isolate myristoylated-Arf1-His6 (myr-Arf1-His6), bacterial cells carrying plasmids pET-Arf1 and pACYC/ET3d/yNMT were first grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5. A 100-fold concentrated solution of 50 μm myristate, 6 μm bovine serum albumin was added to the culture and incubated for 20 min before inducing protein expression with 1 mm IPTG. The cells were then grown overnight at 25 °C, harvested, and frozen at −20 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and the cells were lysed by adjusting the cell suspension to 0.2% Triton X-100. Lysates were incubated with 50 μg/ml DNase on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 30 min to pellet cell debris. Supernatants were adjusted to 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and treated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were collected in a disposable column and washed twice with 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Myr-Arf1-His6 was eluted with 250 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Fractions enriched with myr-Arf1-His6, identified by Bradford assay, were washed and concentrated with the use of Centricon filtering systems. Samples of myr-Arf1-His6 were stored at −80 °C as protein preparations in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol. Phospholipid strips (Echelon Inc.) were pretreated with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h. The strips were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the dark with 0.5 μg/ml purified Age1ΔN-His6 in TBST containing 1% BSA. The strips were washed with several changes of TBST over a 1-h period and then exposed to affinity-purified anti-Age1 antibodies, diluted in TBST containing 1% BSA, for 1.5 h at room temperature. The strips were washed with TBST, treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1.5 h, and washed with TBST; strip-bound Age1ΔN-His6 was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). A GST-tagged C-terminal fragment of the Legionella pneumophila SidC protein (PI(4)P Grip, Echelon Inc.) was used as a control for binding specificity to the phospholipid strips. Bound protein was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare). Unilamellar lipid vesicles were prepared essentially as described (20Huber I. Rotman M. Pick E. Makler V. Rothem L. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Lipid mixtures were prepared in chloroform, evaporated as thin films, and then resuspended in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, as a solution of either 10 mm dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine or 8.5 mm dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, 1.5 mm dioleoylglycerol (mixture of 1,3 and 1,2 isomers) or 8.5 mm dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, 1.5 mm phosphatidic acid. The lipid mixtures were then extruded by 20 passages through 100-nm pore filters to produce uniform-sized liposomes. 1-ml loading reactions prepared on ice consisted of 8 μm myr-Arf1-His6, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP and unlabeled GTP (10,000–20,000 cpm/pmol), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 100 μl of one of the lipid preparations, which were added after a brief warming of the reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min and terminated by adjusting the MgCl2 concentration to 2 mm and icing the reaction. Unincorporated GTP was removed by harvesting and washing the GTP-loaded myr-Arf1 with Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter units with Ultracel-10 membranes. GTP hydrolysis was assayed essentially as previously described (20Huber I. Rotman M. Pick E. Makler V. Rothem L. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 100-μl reactions consisted of varying amounts of Age1ΔN-His6 in 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 10 μl of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded myr-Arf1-His6, added last to initiate the reaction. Assays were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated with the addition of 500 μl of a cold charcoal suspension and incubation on ice for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min, 300 μl of the supernatant was transferred to scintillation mixture, and the amount of radioactivity released was quantified by scintillation counting. The gcs1-3 or gcs1-4 mutation in combination with the age2Δ gene deletion results in double-mutant cells that exhibit a temperature sensitivity for growth associated with defective post-Golgi transport (10Poon P.P. Nothwehr S.F. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Wong T.A. Fairn G.D. Poon P.P. Shmulevitz M. McMaster C.R. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12777-12782Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further characterize Age2 + Gcs1 ArfGAP function, we sought genes that, in increased gene dosage, alleviate this temperature sensitivity. We introduced a yeast genomic library into age2Δ gcs1-3 double-mutant cells and selected for colony formation at 37 °C. Of the 8 colonies capable of growth at 37 °C, 6 carried genomic inserts containing AGE2, and 2 were found to carry the AGE1 gene (Fig. 1A). AGE1 encodes a protein with 40% identity and 62% similarity to the ArfGAP Gcs1 and that has ArfGAP activity in vitro (11Zhang C.J. Bowzard J.B. Anido A. Kahn R.A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, increasing the gene dosage for another ArfGAP, Age1, alleviates the growth defect caused by deficient ArfGAP function in post-Golgi transport. The ability of increased AGE1 gene dosage to allow growth by age2Δ gcs1-3 cells probably results from the restoration of effective transport that is compromised in the ArfGAP mutant cells. To address this possibility directly, we monitored the effects of increased AGE1 dosage on the trafficking of two reporters that depend on vesicular transport for proper localization. The lipophilic dye FM 4-64 provides a sensitive measure of post-Golgi function for the endocytic transport pathway (21Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). FM 4-64 is internalized from the cell surface via endocytosis, transported through endosomal compartments, and delivered to the vacuolar periphery. Activity of the Age2 + Gcs1 ArfGAP pair mediates this delivery of FM 4-64 to the vacuole (10Poon P.P. Nothwehr S.F. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At the restrictive temperature, age2Δ gcs1-3 cells carrying vector alone exhibited impaired endocytic transport such that FM 4-64 extensively stained the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A), indicating that the membrane-bound dye remained trapped in endosomal compartments. In marked contrast, age2Δ gcs1-3 mutant cells carrying either a low-copy GCS1 plasmid or a high-copy AGE1 plasmid effectively transported FM 4-64 to the vacuole periphery, yielding the typical ring staining pattern seen in a cell with intact endocytic transport. Thus, the Age1 ArfGAP can provide function for post-Golgi transport. Another measure of post-Golgi transport is the recycling of the v-SNARE Snc1 (22Lewis M.J. Nichols B.J. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Riezman H. Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Snc1 mediates the targeting of vesicles from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and is then retrieved from the plasma membrane to the endosomes and subsequently transported to the trans-Golgi network. This retrieval pathway recycles Snc1 for successive rounds of transport to the cell surface. In wild-type cells, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to Snc1 is seen at Golgi and endosomal compartments but is enriched at the plasma membrane of the growing bud (22Lewis M.J. Nichols B.J. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Riezman H. Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This localization of GFP-Snc1 was also observed at 37 °C in age2Δ gcs1-4 cells carrying a GCS1 plasmid (Fig. 2B). In contrast, age2Δ gcs1-4 cells carrying empty vector exhibited punctate GFP-Snc1 staining without staining at the plasma membrane, indicative of a block in transport of GFP-Snc1 from internal compartments to the cell surface. Although the majority of age2Δ gcs1-4 cells carrying an AGE1 plasmid displayed GFP-Snc1 localized at internal structures, a portion of the population exhibited GFP-Snc1 at the plasma membrane, a situation not observed in mutant cells carrying vector alone. Thus, an increased dosage of AGE1 can restore (albeit partially) the ability of age2Δ gcs1-4 mutant cells to properly traffic GFP-Snc1. The Age1 protein differs from other members of the yeast ArfGAP family by possessing a long N-terminal extension (Fig. 3A). To assess the involvement of these N-terminal sequences in Age1 function, we created the AGE1ΔN allele, which is expressed from the endogenous AGE1 promoter but lacks the sequences encoding codons 3–166 of the Age1 protein (Fig. 3A). A similarly truncated Age1 protein retains ArfGAP activity in vitro (11Zhang C.J. Bowzard J.B. Anido A. Kahn R.A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive age2Δ gcs1-4 mutant cells carrying a high-copy AGE1ΔN plasmid grew at 37 °C and actually grew better than cells carrying the high-copy intact AGE1 gene (Fig. 1B). When these AGE1 alleles were on low-copy plasmids, the difference was even more pronounced; cells carrying a low-copy AGE1ΔN plasmid grew well at 37 °C, whereas cells harboring a low-copy AGE1 plasmid did not (Fig. 1B). The absence of residues 3–166 from the N terminus of Age1, therefore, results in enhanced ability to alleviate the growth defects of mutant cells, suggesting that N-terminal sequences have a pronounced effect upon Age1 activity. To localize potential regulatory regions within the Age1 N terminus, we assessed various AGE1 truncation alleles for alleviation of growth defects of mutant cells. The truncation alleles were constructed in a manner similar to AGE1ΔN, with the deletion of sequences from codon 3 to downstream codons ranging from codon 60 to 160. When expressed from low-copy plasmids, truncated proteins lacking the first 80 residues or fewer failed, like intact Age1, to alleviate the temperature sensitivity of age2Δ gcs1-4 cells (Fig. 3B). These truncations did, however, alleviate growth defects when expressed from high-copy plasmids. In contrast, truncations lacking the first 90 or more residues of Age1 were effective in alleviating the growth defects even at low plasmid copy number. The alleviation by AGE1 (or AGE1 truncations) of temperature sensitivity in the situations described above took place in cells with mutant Gcs1 proteins that may provide residual Gcs1 activity. Therefore, we determined the ability of increased Age1 abundance to compensate for (bypass) the complete absence of the Age2 + Gcs1 essential protein pair. Diploid cells heterozygous for age2Δ and gcs1Δ deletion mutations were transformed with a high-copy AGE1 or AGE1ΔN plasmid or empty vector and then induced to undergo meiosis (sporulation). Resulting haploid segregants lacking both the Age2 and Gcs1 proteins were recovered when the A"
