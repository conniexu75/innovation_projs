https://openalex.org/W2020055566,"Mature T cells segregate phenotypically into one of two classes: those that express the surface glycoprotein CD4, and those that express the glycoprotein CD8. The CD4 molecule is expressed primarily on helper T cells whereas CD8 is found on cytotoxic and suppressor cells. A more stringent association exists, however, between these T-cell subsets and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products recognized by their T-cell receptors (TCRs). CD8+ lymphocytes interact with targets expressing class I MHC gene products, whereas CD4+ cells interact with class II MHC-bearing targets. To explain this association, it has been proposed that these 'accessory' molecules bind to monomorphic regions of the MHC proteins on the target cell, CD4 to class II and CD8 to class I products. This binding could hold the T cell and its target together, thus improving the probability of the formation of the trimolecular antigen: MHC: TCR complex. Because the TCR on CD4+ cells binds antigen in association with class II MHC, it has been difficult to design experiments to detect the association of CD4 with a class II molecule. To address this issue, we devised a xenogeneic system in which human CD4 complementary DNA was transfected into the murine CD4-, CD8- T-cell hybridoma 3DT-52.5.8, the TCR of which recognizes the murine class I molecule H-2Dd. The murine H-2Dd-bearing target cell line, P815, was cotransfected with human class II HLA-DR alpha, beta and invariant chain cDNAs. Co-culture of the parental T-cell and P815 lines, or of one parental and one transfected line resulted in a low baseline response. In contrast, a substantial increase in response was observed when CD4+ 3DT-52.5.8 cells were co-cultured with HLA-DR+ P815 cells. This result strongly indicates that CD4:HLA-DR binding occurs in this system and that this interaction augments T-cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1569018409,"The control of isocitrate dehydrogenase through phosphorylation is necessary for growth of Escherichia coli on acetate as the sole carbon source. To understand the mechanism by which phosphorylation inactivates isocitrate dehydrogenase, the sequence of icd, the isocitrate dehydrogenase structural gene, was determined and this information was used to construct mutants at the site of phosphorylation. Introduction of a negatively charged aspartate for the serine that is phosphorylated completely inactivates isocitrate dehydrogenase. Substitution of the serine with other amino acids results in a partially active enzyme in which both maximal velocity and interaction with substrates has been altered. Neither threonine nor tyrosine, when substituted for the serine at the phosphorylation site, is detectably phosphorylated by isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2078667106,"Activating region I of GAL4 has been defined as a region 48 amino acids long which, when attached to GAL4's DNA-binding domain, activates transcription in yeast. Here we describe mutants bearing changes in and around this highly acidic activating region. We find mutations that increase the activation function invariably increase the acidity of the region and some but not all of the mutations that decrease the activation function decrease the acidity of the region."
https://openalex.org/W1604993705,"The molecular interactions of laminin with several tumor cell lines and skin fibroblasts were investigated by radioligand binding studies and cell attachment assays using laminin, the laminin-nidogen complex, and laminin fragments as substrates and also domain-specific antibodies as inhibitors of cell attachment. The majority of cells showed a dual binding pattern for fragments 1 and 8 which originate from short-arm or long-arm structures of laminin, respectively. Both of these fragments in solution bind to suspended cells with high affinity (KD = 1-10 nM), with the receptor numbers for each fragment depending on the cell type. Competition studies and independent variation of receptor numbers demonstrated that the cell-binding structures on each fragment are different, implicating the existence of two distinct cellular receptors for laminin. The ability of these fragments to act as substrates for cell adhesion correlated with the presence of high affinity binding sites on the cells. However, only antibodies to fragment 8 were able to block cell adhesion to laminin, despite the presence of binding sites for fragment 1. A few cells had very low numbers of high affinity receptors for either fragment 1 or 8. The latter cell type was used to demonstrate that complex formation between laminin and nidogen, which binds to fragment 1 structures, reduces the potential of laminin for cell binding."
https://openalex.org/W1980202493,"Mutations at the X-linked disconnected locus of D. melanogaster lead to the failure of adult photoreceptor axons to innervate their target cells in the developing optic lobes of the third instar larva, resulting in flies that have rudimentary optic ganglia. The cascade of epigenetic events leading to the adult disconnected phenotype is caused by the misrouting of a larval pioneer nerve, Bolwig's nerve, during embryonic development. In the disconnected mutant this nerve fails to recognize and establish stable connections with its correct synaptic partners. In addition, disconnected affects both the proper aggregation and the movement of the Bolwig neurons to their final location in the embryo. Finally, similar but more subtle defects can be found in a subset of other peripheral neurons in the thoracic and abdominal segments. The different aspects of the phenotype suggest that the disconnected gene plays a role in neuronal cell recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1969324434,"The structure of the Asn102 mutant of trypsin was determined in order to distinguish whether the reduced activity of the mutant at neutral pH results from an altered active site conformation or from an inability to stabilize a positive charge on the active site histidine. The active site structure of the Asn102 mutant of trypsin is identical to the native enzyme with respect to the specificity pocket, the oxyanion hole, and the orientation of the nucleophilic serine. The observed decrease in rate results from the loss of nucleophilicity of the active site serine. This decreased nucleophilicity may result from stabilization of a His57 tautomer that is unable to accept the serine hydroxyl proton."
https://openalex.org/W1608735237,"Animal cells respond to calcium ionophore (A23187) treatment with the coordinate induction of a set of genes encoding proteins identical to the glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs). By monitoring the intracellular free calcium with the fluorescent indicator fura-2 while employing both intracellular and extracellular calcium buffers, we demonstrated that A23187 can induce the GRP94 and GRP78 genes without an increase in cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i). Induction of GRP mRNA during glucose starvation was also independent of [Ca2+]i. Instead, gene induction by A23187 was closely correlated with the depletion of intracellular calcium stores. We conclude that perturbations of sequestered calcium ions by A23187 can serve as a stimulus for gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1603828997,"The adenylate cyclase catalytic protein partially purified from rat brain membranes was activated by the stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs), forskolin, and Ca2+-calmodulin. The Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated activity was markedly, but the Gs- or forskolin-stimulated activity was essentially not, inhibited by low concentrations of the beta gamma-subunits of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein (Gi). The inhibition appeared to be competitive with calmodulin. On the other hand, the association of increasing amounts of beta gamma with the alpha of Gi, which was measured based on the ADP-ribosylation by islet-activating protein, pertussis toxin, was apparently competed by Ca2+-calmodulin. Furthermore, beta gamma bound to calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+, but not in its absence. Thus, the direct interaction of beta gamma with calmodulin is a likely mechanism involved in beta gamma-induced inhibition of the calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1543525745,"Cultured human macrophages from normal donors were examined for their capability to metabolize 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-(OH)D3). Upon exposure to recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) produced a polar 25-(OH)D3 metabolite which was purified from conditioned media and unequivocally identified as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) by UV-absorbance spectrophotometry and mass spectrometry. The BMM and PAM also synthesized a second 25-(OH)D3 metabolite which was structurally identified as 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25-(OH)2D3). The time course of 25-(OH)D3 metabolism by macrophages suggested that the production of 24,25-(OH)2D3 was stimulated by high intracellular levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and not by IFN-gamma. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 obtained from BMM and PAM promoted macrophage-like differentiation of promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells and inhibited IFN-gamma production by normal human lymphocytes. Our data suggest that locally high levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the microenvironment of IFN-gamma-stimulated BMM and PAM may modulate the function of hormone-responsive cells."

https://openalex.org/W1604624144,"Three collagen chains, 1 alpha, 2 alpha, and 3 alpha, have previously been identified in the cartilaginous extracellular matrix and have been referred to collectively as type XI collagen. The structure of type XI is poorly defined. Neither the organization of these collagen chains into trimeric molecules nor the extent of proteolytic processing has been adequately determined. Formaldehyde-derived covalent cross-links were introduced into the native molecules. As judged by velocity sedimentation, the cross-links formed were predominantly intramolecular and led to the formation of covalent trimeric molecules. Chromatographic analysis of trimers is most consistent with a heterotrimer (1 alpha, 2 alpha, 3 alpha) being the predominant form. To investigate the structure of type XI as it occurs in the matrix, sterna from chick embryos treated with beta-aminopropionitrile were solubilized without proteolysis with pepsin. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that all three chains of type XI retain non-triple-helical domains. Some heterogeneity was observed in the size of the 1 alpha chain. Metabolic labeling and long term chase experiments suggested that this heterogeneity in the size of 1 alpha may be due to slow or incomplete posttranslational proteolytic processing."

https://openalex.org/W1510741444,"Arginine 179 of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase of Salmonella typhimurium was changed to leucine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant alpha subunit was expressed in S. typhimurium, purified and crystallized as the alpha 2 beta 2 complex, and characterized by kinetic studies under steady-state reaction conditions. The rate of cleavage of indole 3-glycerol phosphate (alpha reaction) is reduced by 60% in the mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complex, whereas the rate of L-tryptophan synthesis from indole and L-serine (beta reaction) is unchanged. Thus, arginine 179 is not obligatory for catalysis, for binding of indole 3-glycerol phosphate, or for interaction of the alpha and beta 2 subunits. However, changing arginine 179 to leucine does have striking effects on ligand-dependent properties of this multienzyme complex. Ligands of the alpha subunit (DL-alpha-glycerophosphate and indole 3-propanol phosphate) which strongly inhibit the beta reaction of the native alpha 2 beta 2 complex have a slight stimulatory effect on the beta reaction of the mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Likewise, L-serine, a ligand of the beta subunit which produces a 5-fold reduction in the Km for the alpha ligand indole 3-glycerol phosphate in the native alpha 2 beta 2 complex, has no effect on the mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complex. These results suggest that arginine 179 of the alpha subunit plays a role in the reciprocal transmission of substrate-induced conformational changes which occur between native alpha and beta 2 subunits in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex."

https://openalex.org/W1590423596,"The complexion of the adenylate cyclase system and in particular, the regulation of G-proteins was examined in 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation from a fibroblast-like to an adipocyte-like phenotype. Gs alpha (the identified regulatory component of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase that mediates stimulation), measured by cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, increased by approximately 6-fold from day 0 to day 8. Gs alpha, measured by functional reconstitution, increased in specific activity by approximately 3-fold from day 0 to day 8. Both Gi alpha (the G-protein with alpha-subunit Mr 40,000-41,000 whose function is in part the mediation of inhibition of adenylate cyclase) and Go alpha (the highly abundant G-protein first isolated from bovine brain whose effector system remains to be established) measured by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation increased by approximately 4-fold over this same period. 3T3-L1 cells possess beta-subunits of G-proteins displaying Mr = 36,000 (beta 36) and Mr = 35,000 (beta 35). The increase in the beta 35 as well as beta 36 subunits was approximately 2-fold. Using quantitative immunoblotting techniques and specific antisera, the total amount of beta-subunits was determined to be 150 as compared to 70 pmol/mg of membrane protein, while the amount of Go alpha was 40 and 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein in adipocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. Since Go alpha is the most abundant G-protein alpha-subunit observed to date in both phenotypes, the overall ratio of beta- to alpha-subunits of G-proteins appears to decrease from approximately 4.7 in fibroblasts to 2.5 in adipocytes. These data suggest that in differentiation not only is the complexion of G-proteins altered but more importantly, the relative amounts of alpha- to beta-subunits are regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1521574867,"Abstract The active site arginine-143 of human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase has been replaced by lysine or by isoleucine. The mutant proteins were expressed at high levels in yeast, purified, and the amino acid substitution explored through the use of group specific reagents. The specific activities of these enzymes, measured by the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c method and by using dry weight determination to establish protein concentration, were: native enzyme, 6570 units/mg; Lys-substituted enzyme, 2840 units/mg, Ile-substituted enzyme, 708 units/mg. The active site arginine thus plays an important, but not an essential, role in the catalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1561396590,"During asparagine starvation the frequency of lysine for asparagine substitutions increases to levels that enable one to isolate and sequence mistranslated protein. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a series of derivatives of the gene encoding the coat protein of the bacteriophage MS2. The mutant set constructed has either AAU or AAC as codon three in the gene with each possible adjoining 3' base. Lysine incorporation in coat protein encoded by these genes shows that AAU is misread from 4- to 9-fold more frequently than AAC with any 3' context. Although in some cases context effects of approximately 2-fold were noted, there seems to be no simple hypothesis to explain them."
https://openalex.org/W1593169065,"Complementary DNAs that encode two forms of the alpha subunit (Gs alpha) of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein responsible for stimulation of adenylate cyclase (Gs) have been inserted into plasmid vectors for expression in Escherichia coli. Following transformation of either of these plasmids into E. coli K38, Gs alpha accumulates to 0.4-0.8 mg/liter (approximately 0.1% of total protein), as judged by immunoblot analysis with specific antisera. Based on deduced amino acid sequence, the two cDNAs should encode proteins with molecular weights of 44,500 and 46,000, respectively (Robishaw, J.D., Smigel, M. D., and Gilman, A. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9587-9590). Expression of these cDNAs in E. coli yields proteins that co-migrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the Gs alpha subunits from S49 lymphoma cell membranes, with apparent molecular weights of 45,000 and 52,000, respectively. Low levels of activity are detected in the 100,000 × g supernatant after lysis and fractionation of E. coli expressing either form of Gs alpha. Partial purification of Gs alpha from E. coli lysates yields preparations in which significant and stable activity can be assayed. Both forms of Gs alpha migrate through sucrose gradients as soluble, monodisperse species in the absence of detergent. As expressed in E. coli, both forms of Gs alpha can reconstitute isoproterenol-, guanine nucleotide-, and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in S49 cyc-cell membranes to approximately the same degree and can be ADP-ribosylated with [32P]NAD+ and cholera toxin. However, based on the specific activity of purified rabbit liver Gs, only 1-2% of the Gs alpha expressed in E. coli appears to be active. Incubation of partially purified fractions of recombinant Gs alpha with guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate and resolved beta gamma subunits isolated from purified bovine brain G proteins results in a 7-10-fold increase in Gs activity. Incubation of bovine brain beta gamma with recombinant Gs alpha also leads to a dramatic increase in observed levels of cholera toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1533232725,"We have previously reported (Samelson, L.E., Patel, M.D., Weissman, A.M., Harford, J.B., and Klausner, R.D. (1986) Cell 46, 1083-1090) that T cell activation by antigen is associated with activation of two biochemical pathways. In this scheme two protein kinases are activated by stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). These kinases phosphorylate two different chains of the TCR complex. Protein kinase C is responsible for the phosphorylation of the gamma, and, to a lesser extent, the epsilon chains of the receptor on serine residues while the activation of an unidentified tyrosine kinase leads to phosphorylation of the p21 subunit of the receptor on tyrosine residues. In addition to activation by specific antigens, T cells can be functionally activated in vitro by the addition of antibodies that bind either the antigen receptor or the Thy-1 molecule, an entity independent of the receptor. We have used antibodies directed against these molecules and show that they result in the same dual kinase activation observed with antigen stimulation. In addition we have compared the three ligands, antigen, and antibodies directed against the epsilon chain of the TCR or against Thy-1, in terms of how they couple to the two kinase pathways. Activation of phosphatidylinositol breakdown and TCR phosphorylation on serine by all three stimuli are sensitive to cAMP inhibition. In contrast, only antigen-stimulated tyrosine kinase activation is sensitive to cAMP while the two antibody reagents activate the tyrosine kinase in a manner that is entirely insensitive to cAMP inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1488193918,"Eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) was labeled in situ with [32P]orthophosphate in cultured HeLa cells and rabbit reticulocytes and purified by affinity chromatography. Tryptic digestion yielded one labeled peptide which contained predominantly serine and lysine. After treatment of the protein with citraconic anhydride to block epsilon-amino groups of lysyl residues, tryptic digestion yielded a labeled peptide whose composition was consistent with the structure Trp-Ala-Leu-Trp-Phe-Phe-Lys-Asn-Asp-Lys-Ser(P)-Lys-Thr-Trp-Gln-Ala-Asn-L eu-Arg, one of the arginyl peptides predicted from the human eIF-4E cDNA sequence. The only serine in this peptide is located at position 53 of eIF-4E. Thus, it is concluded that eIF-4E contains a single site of phosphorylation for an endogenous protein kinase, which is Ser-53 in the human eIF-4E sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2079685814,"RNA polymerase I binding to the eukaryotic ribosomal RNA gene promoter-transcription initiation factor (TIF) complex was examined by in vitro transcription and footprinting of a series of spacer mutants. Polymerase binds efficiently to the TIF-promoter complex independently of the DNA sequence in the polymerase interaction region and initiates transcription a fixed distance downstream of the TIF binding site on AT-rich templates. Methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II) footprinting confirms minimal contacts between polymerase and DNA. We infer that polymerase is directed to the promoter by a DNA sequence-independent mechanism, solely by protein-protein contacts with TIF. An initiation step subsequent to binding requires special sequence characteristics in the transcription start site region."
https://openalex.org/W1500290535,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) acts directly on the ovary to induce ovulation in hypophysectomized proestrous rats. Because plasminogen activators (PAs) are implicated in gonadotropin-induced ovulation, we have studied the effect of GnRH on ovarian PA synthesis. GnRH induced tissue-type PA (tPA) secretion by cultured rat granulosa cells, but inhibited the secretion of urokinase-type PA. These effects were blocked by co-treatment with a GnRH antagonist, suggesting that stereospecific GnRH receptors are involved. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) also induced tPA in granulosa cells but with a different time course than GnRH; the combined effect of FSH and GnRH was additive. The GnRH effect was mimicked by the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C activator, phorbol myristate acetate. In isolated cumulus-oocyte complexes and cumulus cells, GnRH treatment also increased tPA activity. In contrast, treatment of denuded oocytes with GnRH did not increase enzyme activity. After GnRH stimulation of the cumulus-oocyte complexes, tPA content in the denuded oocyte was elevated, suggesting that the cumulus cells mediate the action of GnRH to increase the oocyte enzyme levels. Hybridization experiments using a labeled rat tPA-specific DNA probe showed that both FSH and GnRH increased the level of tPA mRNA in cultured granulosa cells; the stimulatory effect of GnRH was blocked by the GnRH antagonist. Our results indicate that GnRH treatment increases tPA secretion by cultured granulosa cells and cumulus-oocyte complexes. The stimulation of enzyme activity in the granulosa cells is accompanied by increases in tPA mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1507272843,"The abundance of lactosylceramide (LacCer; Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer) in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) (about 10(9) molecules/cell) seemed inconsistent with an exclusive plasma membrane LacCer localization in these cells. Therefore, the distribution of LacCer between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments was analyzed. Binding of 125I-labeled monoclonal anti-LacCer antibody (T5A7) to intact cells indicated that only 0.1-0.2% of total LacCer was accessible to antibody. Chemical and immunochemical comparisons of organic extracts prepared from PMN cytoplasts (i.e. PMN depleted of nucleus and granules) and intact PMN demonstrated that less than 25% of PMN LacCer was plasma membrane-derived. Simultaneous particle volume and surface staining analyses suggested that selective LacCer loss from cytoplasts could not explain this result. Intracellular LacCer was demonstrated by intense staining of PMN frozen thin sections with T5A7 in indirect immunofluorescence tests. Two-color fluorescence studies using frozen thin sections of neutrophils previously surface-stained with saturating concentrations of T5A7 indicated that this staining did not reflect section artifact. Organic extracts of density gradient-fractionated PMN cavitates were analyzed by radioimmunoassay to determine whether LacCer associates with known populations of PMN granules. Antigen predominantly cosedimented with enzyme markers for primary and secondary granules rather than with plasma membrane marker. Thin layer chromatography of glycolipids extracted from these density gradient fractions identified LacCer as the only antigenic species and demonstrated that chemically detectable LacCer was primarily in granule-enriched rather than plasma membrane fractions. These data indicate that human PMN LacCer is predominantly intracellular and that the glycolipid may be a constituent of PMN lysosomal granules."
https://openalex.org/W1595478289,"Human neutrophils stimulated by ionophore A23187 incorporate [3H]acetate into platelet-activating factor and an additional product which is chromatographically similar to phosphatidylethanolamine and accounts for approximately 25% of the [3H]acetate-containing lipids. Three general approaches indicated the sn-1 moiety of the unknown phospholipid is primarily alk-1'-enyl-linked: 1) approximately 80% of the intact phospholipid as well as its derivatives was highly sensitive to hydrolysis by HCl, 2) 80% of the product which resulted from treating the unknown with phospholipase C and acetylating the free hydroxyl group at the sn-3 position, chromatographed with authentic 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2,3-diacetylglycerol, and 3) catalytic hydrogenation of the diacetylglycerol product described in 2) resulted in a product which chromatographed with alkyldiacetylglycerol and was not sensitive to strong acid. Treatment of the intact phospholipid with phospholipase A2 resulted in the release of 88% of the radiolabel into the acidified aqueous phase of the extraction mixture, indicating the moiety in the sn-2 position remained as acetate and had not been elongated to fatty acid. The head group was determined to be phosphoethanolamine based upon its complete conversion to the dinitro- and trinitrophenyl derivatives by the amine-derivatizing reagents fluorodinitrobenzene and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, respectively. From these data is was concluded that the unknown product is 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (80%), and 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (10%). Sonicates prepared from neutrophils stimulated with ionophore A23187 contained an acetyltransferase activity capable of utilizing 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and [14C]acetyl-CoA to produce the product identified as 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine."
https://openalex.org/W1505346823,"The mechanism of expression of a series of glycolipid antigens carrying the Lex determinant structure, Gal beta 1----4[Fuc alpha 1----3]GlcNAc beta 1----, and characterized by oncofetal expression in fetal colon and colonic adenocarcinomas has been studied in human fetal and adult proximal colon tissue. Results presented from TLC immunostain analysis of neutral glycolipids isolated from normal adult colonic mucosa have indicated the presence of only barely detectable quantities of both an Lex-active glycolipid that co-migrated with III3V3Fuc2nLc6 and its precursor nLc6. These structures were found in large quantities in glycolipid fractions from human adenocarcinoma tumors and human small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H69 cells. In contrast, type 1 chain-based Lea antigen structures were found in both normal mucosa and adenocarcinomas. Analysis of gangliosides of normal colonic mucosa by TLC immunostain indicated the presence of a series of type 2 chain-based gangliosides; however, sialyl-Lex was not detected. The ability of normal colonic mucosa to synthesize type 2 chain core structures was demonstrated by the presence of a beta 1----4 galactosyltransferase activity with Lc3 as an acceptor in an amount equivalent to 60-65% of the total galactosyltransferase activity. An alpha 1----3 fucosyltransferase was also found to be expressed in significant quantity in adult colonic mucosa. Kinetic studies indicated that this is most probably the alpha 1----3/4 fucosyltransferase suggested to be a product of the Lewis gene (Le). Thus, although normal adult colonic mucosa contained the enzymes to synthesize Lex and sialyl-Lex structures, these antigens were not found. Tissue immunofluorescence studies indicated that type 2 chain precursors and the alpha 1----3/4 fucosyltransferase were found in different cell populations in adult proximal colonic mucosa. However, both type 2 chain core structures and their fucosylated derivatives were found to be associated with epithelial cells of fetal colon. These results indicate that oncofetal expression of Lex antigens in fetal colonic epithelium and in adenocarcinomas but not in normal adult mucosa is due to the retrogenetic expression of type 2 chain precursors which are not found in normal adult colonic epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030984303,"The human T cell antigen-receptor γ chain, which is expressed on the surface of a subpopulation of CD3+ T lymphocytes, exhibits size polymorphism and varies in its ability to form disulfide bonds with a second polypeptide. Analysis of both genomic and complementary DNA clones encoding the human γ polypeptide shows differences in lengths of the coding portions of the two constant region genes, Cγ1 and Cγ2. A single second-exon segment is always present in the Cγ1 gene. Cγ2 alleles containing either duplicated or triplicated second-exon segments are present in the normal human population and are expressed as messenger RNAs. Furthermore, a cysteine residue, encoded by the second exon of Cγ1 and probably involved in interchain disulfide bridging, is absent in all Cγ2 second-exon segments. These differences between Cγ1 and the two alleles of Cγ2 may explain the variability in molecular weight and disulfide bonding of γ molecules expressed in different cells."
https://openalex.org/W2108321906,"In previously published studies (Kreutter, D., Caldwell, A. B., and Morin, M. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5979-5984), we demonstrated that the activation of the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C by phorbol esters was dissociable from the induction of monocytic differentiation by these agents in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. We have now compared the effects of two related diterpenes (mezerein and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and two cell-permeable diacylglycerols (1-oleoyl-2-acetoylglycerol and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol) on the induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells. Each of these agents activated protein kinase C in vitro and stimulated the phosphorylation of a number of identical proteins in intact HL-60 cells. Exposure to either of the diterpenes at nanomolar concentrations resulted in an inhibition of cell growth and the induction of qualitatively distinct types of monocytic maturation in HL-60 cells. Conversely, neither of the two diacylglycerols was found to be a potent or efficacious inducer of differentiation, as measured by increases in cell adhesion, nonspecific esterase activity, or phagocytosis, even at growth-inhibitory concentrations. However, concurrent exposure of HL-60 cells to both 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol and the calcium ionophore A23187, at concentrations which were without maturational activity when used separately, resulted in measurable increases in both protein phosphorylation and in the fraction of cells expressing a differentiated phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that specific biochemical effects associated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, in addition to the activation of protein kinase C, may be important determinants for the induction of leukemia cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1563686277,"Pyridoxine-5-P oxidase, the flavoprotein involved in the oxidation of pyridoxamine-5-P and pyridoxine-5-P to pyridoxal-5-P, has been isolated and purified to homogeneity using sheep brain tissues. Inactivation of the oxidase by bis-pyridoxal-5-P results in binding of the inhibitor to specific lysyl residues. After NaBH4 reduction of the inactivated enzyme, it was found that 1 P-pyridoxyl-pyridoxine-P residue was incorporated per enzyme dimer. After trypsin digestion of the bis-PLP modified enzyme, only one peptide absorbing at 320 nm, was separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the labeled peptide was determined by automated Edman degradation. The observations reported in this paper are relevant to the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the catalytic function of pyridoxines-5-P oxidase by the product pyridoxal-5-P. It is postulated that the catalytic function of the oxidase is modulated by binding of pyridoxal-5-P to a specific lysyl residue of the dimeric structure of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W27597112,"Tyrosinase, which usually catalyzes the conversion of o-diphenols to o-benzoquinones, catalyzed an unusual oxidative dimerization of 1,2-dehydro-N-acetyl-dopamine to a benzodioxan derivative. The identity of the product was confirmed by UV, IR spectra, and NMR studies. During the oxidation, generation of a transient reactive intermediate could be witnessed by its characteristic visible absorption spectrum. Typical phenoloxidase inhibitors such as phenylthiourea, potassium cyanide, sodium azide, and sodium fluoride drastically inhibited the above reaction. Mimosine, a known competitive inhibitor of o-diphenoloxidase activity, also inhibited the new reaction competitively, suggesting that both the observed oxidative dimerization and the conventional quinone production are catalyzed by the same active site copper of tyrosinase. Based on our earlier findings (Sugumaran, M., and Lipke, H. (1983) FEBS Lett. 155, 65-68; Sugumaran, M. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 4489-4492) that phenoloxidases can produce quinone methides from certain 4-alkylcatechols, possible mechanisms for this new reaction are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1515419365,"We have previously reported detergent (Triton X-100) solubilization of a follitropin (FSH) receptor-rich fraction from light membranes of bovine testis that responded to exogenous FSH by activation of adenylate cyclase (Dattatreyamurty, B., Schneyer, A., and Reichert, L. E., Jr. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13104-13113). Upon gel filtration of the detergent-extract through Sepharose-6B, two fractions were separated. Each specifically bound [3H]guanosine 5'-imidotriphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) and had guaninetriphosphatase (GTPase) activity. Of these, one fraction (6B-Fraction-1) also bound radioiodinated human follitropin (hFSH), indicating a coelution of the nucleotide-binding protein with receptor. The other fraction (6B-Fraction-2) did not contain detectable FSH receptor activity. Several lines of evidence suggest that 6B-Fraction-1 is a complex consisting of FSH receptor and a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, probably Ns. 1) The GTP-binding and FSH-binding activities of 6B-Fraction-1 were retained by a GTP-affinity column, and their retention by the affinity matrix could be prevented by simultaneous addition of free Gpp(NH)p. 2) When exogenous GTP was added to 6B-Fraction-1, binding of 125I-hFSH was reduced compared to controls lacking exogenous GTP. This effect of GTP was highly specific and noncompetitive, indicating that GTP did not bind to receptor. In addition, the affinity of receptor for FSH was decreased, and the rate and degree of dissociation of bound labeled FSH from receptor were increased in the presence of exogenous GTP, each in concentration-dependent manner. 3) Exposure of 6B-Fraction-1 to higher concentration of Triton X-100 reduced significantly the receptor-associated GTP-binding activity and also rendered the hormone-binding activity insensitive to GTP. 4) Treatment of highly purified testis membranes with cholera toxin plus NAD, but not pertussis toxin plus NAD, eliminated the ability of GTP to modulate the 125I-hFSH binding to receptor. 5) After cholera toxin-induced [32P]ADP-ribosylation of testis membranes, a major peak of radioactivity (presumably Ns) was coeluted with FSH receptor activity from the Sepharose-6B column. These results and the observation that the effect of GTP is noncompetitive at FSH receptor level suggest that FSH binding inhibition and the increased rate of hormone dissociation from receptor were the result of GTP interaction with a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, probably Ns, which itself was functionally associated with the FSH receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1571273279,"The gamma subunit of the human T lymphocyte T3 antigen is rapidly phosphorylated on serine residues in vivo during the initiation of T cell activation by a polyclonal mitogen (Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin), an activator of protein kinase C (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate), and an elevator of intracellular calcium (ionomycin). The sites of phosphorylation were identified by comparing tryptic peptide analyses of T3 gamma chains labeled in vivo with various synthetic peptides, corresponding to portions of the cytoplasmic domain of the gamma chain that had been labeled in vitro using purified protein kinase C. Two sites, serines 123 and 126, were phosphorylated in response to ionomycin, whereas a single site, serine 126, was phosphorylated when T lymphocytes were stimulated by P. vulgaris phytohemagglutinin or when protein kinase C was directly activated by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Immune activation of T cells via the protein kinase C pathway thus induces phosphorylation of a single site on the T3 gamma chain, namely serine 126."
https://openalex.org/W1528484209,"Agents that inhibit DNA synthesis increase the frequency of methotrexate resistance and gene amplification in cultured mammalian cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells blocked with hydroxyurea rereplicated dihydrofolate reductase gene sequences within a single cell cycle upon release from the block (Mariani, B.D., and Schimke, R.T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1901-1910). Perturbation of DNA synthesis was postulated to result in misfiring of replicon initiation, subsequent over-replication of DNA sequences, and amplification of specific genes. To test this hypothesis, we have exposed Chinese hamster ovary cells pulsed with bromodeoxyuridine to three agents that inhibit DNA synthesis and enhance gene amplification: UV irradiation, hydroxyurea, and aphidicolin. After release from the block, the progression of cells throughout the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry through simultaneous measurement of total cellular DNA content and bromodeoxyuridine-labeled DNA. Although the cell cycle effects varied depending on the agent used for the block, in all cases a subset of cells that were in S phase at the time of the block exhibited DNA histograms with greater than 4C DNA content at various times after release and prior to cell division. Cells with the excess DNA were approximately 10-fold more resistant to methotrexate compared to treated cells with normal DNA content or untreated cells. Therefore, cells in S phase at the time of the block produce excess DNA per cell prior to division, and this over-replicated DNA may be relevant to gene amplification and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1547070010,"Chronic administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol results in parotid gland hypertrophy and hyperplasia. This physiological change in the gland has recently been reported to be accompanied by a dramatic increase in the rate of synthesis and accumulation of the enzyme 4 beta-galactosyltransferase. Here, isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy of the parotid gland is shown to be blocked by the introduction of the 4 beta-galactosyltransferase modifier protein alpha-lactalbumin and also by specific antiserum to bovine 4 beta-galactosyltransferase. Partial inhibition of gland enlargement was observed stereospecifically with UDP-galactose and with the competitive acceptor glycoprotein, ovalbumin, as well. These agents did not affect the induction by isoproterenol of the biosynthesis of the proline-rich proteins nor of 4 beta-galactosyltransferase. These agents also inhibited the incorporation of thymidine by isoproterenol-stimulated parotid cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2141042894,"Transducin and rhodopsin belong to a family of guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein-coupled receptor systems that provide signal transduction mechanisms resulting in numerous metabolic responses in a variety of cell types. A simple, direct binding assay has been developed to investigate the molecular interactions between transducin and rhodopsin. The binding curves generated by these studies are sigmoidal, indicating an allosteric response. The Scatchard plots of this data display an asymptotic, bell-shaped character representative of the positive cooperative behavior. A Hill coefficient, nH = 1.92, was determined and found to be in close agreement with previous kinetic studies of allosterism described for rhodopsin's catalytic mechanism (Wessling-Resnick, M., and Johnson G.L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3697-3705). The value for Kd app was determined to be 0.05 microM. Bmax values obtained from the binding studies suggest that oligomeric complexes of rhodopsin may be involved in interactions with transducin to form multiple high affinity binding sites for the G protein. The positive cooperative behavior demonstrated in this investigation can provide insight into the molecular basis for regulation of other G protein-coupled receptor systems."
https://openalex.org/W1516240707,"Abstract The effect of the addition of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), the GTP analog which activates the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein of adenylyl cyclase (Ni), on the pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation reaction was studied in detail. Two effects were discerned: a stimulation of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin, akin to what was described for ATP and GDP in a previous report (Mattera, R., Codina, J., Sekura, R., and Birnbaumer, L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11173-11179), and a decrease in the ability of Ni to be a substrate for the activated toxin. Both effects were time-dependent with activation of the toxin being somewhat faster than inactivation of Ni. The effect of the addition of GTP gamma S on Ni was readily reversed by excess GDP and attenuated by increasing EDTA in the medium from 0.35 to 10 mM, suggesting dependence on trace concentrations of a divalent cation. It is suggested that this cation is Mg2+ on the basis that low (5-10 nM) concentrations of Mg2+ are needed for the endogenous GTPase activity of Ni (Sunyer, T., Codina, J., and Birnbaumer, L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15447-15451). Sucrose density gradient analysis of the Ni X GTP gamma S complexes with decreased susceptibility to ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin showed the same sedimentation parameters as Ni or Ni X GDP complexes, indicating that the molecule of Ni with GTP gamma S bound is heterotrimetric as opposed to dissociated into alpha i X GTP gamma S plus beta X gamma. Thus, these experiments define two conformations of heterotrimeric Ni: one -pt+, ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, and the other pt-, poorly or not ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. This latter, hitherto unrecognized conformation, is stabilized by the addition of strongly activating guanine nucleotides such as GTP gamma S and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and should be important in the train of events that lead from an inactive heterotrimeric Ni to a fully active and dissociated Ni."
https://openalex.org/W1542603018,"The effects of spermidine depletion and the effects of translation inhibition on hypusine biosynthesis were studied in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Upon depletion of cellular spermidine by treatment with DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine for 42 h or longer, both the rate of deoxyhypusine + hypusine synthesis and the content of protein-bound hypusine were significantly reduced. Cycloheximide caused complete inhibition of deoxyhypusine + hypusine synthesis in untreated cells and in cells in which the spermidine level was reduced to approximately 10% that of the untreated cells by incubation with DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine for 24 h. In contrast, the initial synthesis of deoxyhypusine + hypusine was not arrested by cycloheximide in cells depleted of spermidine by treatment with DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine for 42 h. The initial rate of deoxyhypusine + hypusine production in these spermidine-depleted cells increased 5- to 10-fold when the cellular spermidine level was restored through addition of this polyamine to the culture medium. These findings suggest that in control Chinese hamster ovary cells and in cells containing approximately 10% of the control level of spermidine, deoxyhypusine + hypusine synthesis occurs during or immediately after eukaryotic initiation factor 4D precursor translation. However, in cells during depletion of spermidine, there is an accumulation of an eukaryotic initiation factor 4D precursor that contains no hypusine or deoxyhypusine, and in these cells deoxyhypusine + hypusine synthesis is mainly regulated by the cellular level of spermidine."
https://openalex.org/W1606942984,"The effect of fructose on glycogen degradation was examined by measuring the flux of 14C from prelabeled glycogen in perfused rat livers. During 2-h refeeding of 24-h-fasted rats, newly synthesized hepatic glycogen was labeled by intraperitoneal injection of [U-14C] galactose (0.1 mg and 0.02 microCi/g of body weight). The livers of refed rats were then perfused in a nonrecirculating fashion for an initial 30 min with glucose alone (10 mM) for the following 60 min with glucose (10 mM) without (n = 5) or with fructose (1, 2, or 10 mM; n = 5 for each). When livers were exposed to fructose, release of label into the perfusate immediately declined and remained markedly suppressed through the end of perfusion (p less than 0.05). The suppression was dose-dependent; at steady state (50-70 min), label release was suppressed 45, 64, and 72% by 1, 2, and 10 mM fructose, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Suppression was not accompanied by significant changes in the activities of glycogen synthase or phosphorylase assessed in vitro. These results suggest the existence of allosteric inhibition of phosphorylase in the presence of fructose. Fructose 1-phosphate (Fru-1-P) accumulated in proportion to fructose (0.11 +/- 0.01 without fructose, 0.86 +/- 0.03, 1.81 +/- 0.18, and 8.23 +/- 0.60 mumol/g of liver with 1, 2, and 10 mM fructose, respectively; p less than 0.0001). Maximum inhibition of label release was 82%; the Fru-1-P concentration for half inhibition was 0.57 mumol/g of liver, well within the concentration of Fru-1-P attained during refeeding. We conclude that fructose enhances net glycogen accumulation in liver by suppressing glycogenolysis and that the suppression is presumably caused by allosteric inhibition of phosphorylase by Fru-1-P."
https://openalex.org/W1957208327,"Human recombinant single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (recombinant scu-PA) and a hybrid between human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and scu-PA, obtained by ligation of cDNA fragments encoding the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 1-67) of t-PA and the COOH-terminal region (amino acids 136-411) of scu-PA, were expressed in a mammalian cell system. The proteins were purified from conditioned culture media containing 2% fetal calf serum by chromatography on zinc chelate-Sepharose, immunoadsorption chromatography on an insolubilized murine monoclonal antibody directed against urokinase, benzamidine-Sepharose chromatography, and Ultrogel AcA 44 gel filtration. Between 180 and 230 micrograms of the purified proteins were obtained per liter of conditioned medium, with a yield of approximately 18% and a purification factor of 720-1900. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, the proteins migrated as single bands with approximate Mr 50,000 for recombinant scu-PA and Mr 43,000 for the t-PA/scu-PA hybrid. Following conversion to urokinase with plasmin, the proteins had a specific amidolytic activity comparable to that of natural scu-PA. Both proteins activated plasminogen directly with Km = 0.53 and 1.4 microM and k2 = 0.0034 and 0.0027 s-1, respectively. Both proteins did not bind specifically to fibrin and had a comparable degree of fibrin selectivity as measured in a system composed of a whole human 125I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot suspended in human plasma. It is concluded that this chimeric protein, consisting of the NH2-terminal finger-like domain of t-PA and the COOH-terminal region of scu-PA, has very similar enzymatic properties as compared to scu-PA, but has not acquired the fibrin affinity of t-PA."
https://openalex.org/W2103182591,"Mutant urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) genes and hybrid genes between tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and u-PA have been designed to direct the synthesis of new plasminogen activators and to investigate the structure-function relationship in these molecules. The following classes of constructs were made starting from cDNA encoding human t-PA or u-PA: 1) u-PA mutants in which the Arg156 and Lys158 were substituted with threonine, thus preventing cleavage by thrombin and plasmin; 2) hybrid molecules in which the NH2-terminal regions of t-PA (amino acid residues 1-67, 1-262, or 1-313) were fused with the COOH-terminal region of u-PA (amino acids 136-411, 139-411, or 195-411, respectively); and 3) a hybrid molecule in which the second kringle of t-PA (amino acids 173-262) was inserted between amino acids 130 and 139 of u-PA. In all cases but one, the recombinant proteins, produced by transfected eukaryotic cells, were efficiently secreted in the culture medium. The translation products have been tested for their ability to activate plasminogen after in situ binding to an insolubilized monoclonal antibody directed against urokinase. All recombinant enzymes were shown to be active, except those in which Lys158 of u-PA was substituted with threonine. Recombination of structural regions derived from t-PA, such as the finger, the kringle 2, or most of the A-chain sequences, with the protease part or the complete u-PA molecule did not impair the catalytic activity of the hybrid polypeptides. This observation supports the hypothesis that structural domains in t-PA and u-PA fold independently from one to another."
https://openalex.org/W1536791454,"We have previously demonstrated that if C62B glioma cells are prelabeled with [1-14C]arachidonate, cholinergic stimulation results in liberation of radioactive arachidonate and accumulation of radioactive phosphatidate. Cells prelabeled with [2-3H]inositol and stimulated with acetylcholine in the presence of 25 mM LiCl accumulate glycerophosphoinositol and inositol phosphates. The acetylcholine-stimulated accumulation of these products is indicative of activation of both phospholipases A2 and C. When prelabeled cells are pretreated overnight with dexamethasone prior to acetylcholine stimulation, there is preferential inhibition of those products dependent upon phospholipase A2 activity (arachidonate and glycerophosphoinositol accumulation are inhibited 77 and 63%, respectively). During the same time period when phospholipase A2-dependent products are accumulating, there is little effect on the production of phospholipase C-dependent products (acetylcholine-stimulated accumulation of phosphatidate or of inositol phosphates was inhibited by less than 10%). Treatment of C62B cells with two other glucocorticoids, betamethasone and cortisone, produced results similar to those of dexamethasone as did treatment with quinacrine, a phospholipase A2-selective inhibitor. Pretreatment of C62B cells with the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, did not alter acetylcholine-stimulated response. These results suggest that glucocorticoid treatment results in a preferential inhibition of phospholipase A2 with little effect on the generation of phospholipase C products."
https://openalex.org/W1551154640,"We have previously described that in certain parasitic protozoa, namely the trypanosomatids, the dolichol-P-P-linked oligosaccharides synthesized in vivo and transferred to protein are devoid of glucose residues and contain 6, 7, or 9 mannose units depending on the species. We have now conducted a cell-free characterization of the enzymatic patterns responsible for these phenotypes. Microsomes from Trypanosoma cruzi, Crithidia fasciculata, Leishmania enriettii, and Blastocrithidia culicis were found to synthesize dolichol-P-[14C]Man but not dolichol-P-[14C]Glc when incubated with rat liver dolichol-P and GDP-[14C]Man or UDP-[14C]Glc, thus providing for an explanation to the absence of glucosylated dolichol-P-P derivatives. Formation of dolichol-P-P-oligosaccharides was assayed in incubation mixtures containing rat liver dolichol-P, GDP-[14C]Man, microsomes, and unlabeled Man5-8GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol from bovine liver. Membranes from species synthesizing dolichol-P-P-linked Man6GlcNAc2 or Man7GlcNAc2 in vivo were found to synthesize the same compounds but not the higher homologues in the cell-free assay. Species forming Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol in vivo were found to synthesize lipid-linked Man7GlcNAc2, Man8GlcNAc2, and Man9GlcNAc2 in vitro. It is concluded that there are at least three and probably four different dolichol-P-Man-dependent enzymatic activities involved in the synthesis of dolichol-P-P-linked Man9GlcNAc2 and that microorganisms not forming that compound are devoid of all mannosyltransferases responsible for the addition of the missing residues and not only of the enzyme involved in the synthesis of the homologue higher than the oligosaccharide occurring in vivo by a single mannose unit."

The enzyme was found in the mitochondria. It was purified about 150-fold over the Euglena mitochondrial extract in a yield of 38%. The purified enzyme was homogeneous in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Spectra of the purified enzyme showed that it was a flavoprotein. The molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be 66,000 by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration and 65,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was specific to NADPH with an apparent Km of 43 microM and to hydroxocobalamin with an apparent Km of 55 microM. The enzyme did not require FAD or FMN as a cofactor. The optimum pH and temperature were 7.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1594495975,"The core protein of high buoyant density proteoglycans synthesized by chondrocytes in stage 24 chick limb bud mesenchymal cell cultures was cleaved with cyanogen bromide to produce 17 resolvable peptides on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels. Of these peptides, 10 appear to originate from the chondroitin sulfate-rich region, 2 appear to be derived from the keratan sulfate-rich region, and 5 seem to be derived from the hyaluronic acid-binding region. The peptides from the chondroitin sulfate-rich region are almost all large (200 to 64 kDa). In contrast, the peptides from the keratan sulfate-rich and hyaluronic acid-binding regions are relatively small (47 to 12 kDa). One peptide from the hyaluronic acid-binding region appears to contain mannose-rich N-linked oligosaccharides as inferred from its observed binding by concanavalin A. A different hyaluronic acid-binding region peptide and one of the keratan sulfate-rich peptides were shown to contain disulfide bonds and therefore may be involved in contributing to the tertiary structure of the hyaluronic acid-binding region. Based on these observations, a map of the chick chondrocyte proteoglycan core protein has been constructed."
https://openalex.org/W1522809445,"Reconstitution of wild-type apoaspartate aminotransferase from Escherichia coli with [4'-3H]pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate results in stereospecific release of the pro-S C-4' 3H to the solvent. The reaction follows first-order kinetics (t1/2 = 15 min at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C), its rate constant being similar to that found previously with mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase from chicken (Tobler, H.P., Christen, P., and Gehring, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7105-7108). Substituting the active site residue Lys258 by alanine via site-directed mutagenesis yields a catalytically inactive enzyme (Malcolm, B. A., and Kirsch, J. F. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 132, 915-921). This mutant enzyme fails to release any measurable 3H from bound [4'-3H]pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. The data are consistent with earlier proposals that Lys258 is indispensable for the ketimine/aldimine tautomerization, and corroborate the previous conclusion that 3H exchange from enzyme-bound pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate mechanistically corresponds to the deprotonation at C-4' of the ketimine intermediate during the transamination reaction."
