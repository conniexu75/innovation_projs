By contrast, larval growth of Pieris rapae, a crucifer specialist, is not affected even by artificially high concentrations of allylglucosinolate. Larval growth of Spodoptera eridania a generalist feeder, is inhibited by high but not by low concentrations of the compound."
https://openalex.org/W2022226531,"Seeds of 102 lines of Glycine max (L.) Merr., the soybean, were screened quantitatively for the presence of the 120,000-dalton soybean lectin. Wide variation in the content of this lectin was noted, and five lines of soybean whose seed totally lacked the lectin were identified. Roots of all five lines were effectively nodulated by several strains of Rhizobium japonicum, thus indicating that the 120,000-dalton soybean seed lectin is probably not required for the initiation of soybean-Rhizobium symbiosis."

Radiocarbon dates on associated wood twigs indicate a minimum age of 13,000 years before the present for the mastodon kill, a dating significantly older than that of the Clovis complex in North America. The El Jobo complex must have evolved independently in northern South America."
https://openalex.org/W2124038151,"Isotopic analyses of subglacially precipitated calcite from near a modern temperate glacier show that the delta(18)O (= (18)O/(16)O relative to standard mean ocean water) of the calcite records the delta(18)O of the ice from that glacier. It may therefore be possible to determine the delta(18)O of Pleistocene ice sheets on the basis of isotopic analyses of calcite formed under that ancient ice. This, in turn, would allow estimation of the delta(18)O of Pleistocene oceans and correction of the paleotemperature scale based on foraminiferal oxygen isotopic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1991880663,"An analysis of 25 photometric digital images of the moon has been carried out to obtain a single image in a new mapping parameter, the Heiligenschein exponent. The data necessarily represent a range of lunar phases, but all are within 10 hours of full moon. The new parameter characterizes the rate at which lunar features brighten as their local phase angles approach zero. Although considerable contrast is present in this parameter, there is only a small correlation with normal albedo. In particular, the large albedo difference between maria and highlands is not simply reflected in Heiligenschein differences, which are larger within each category of terrain than the difference between the Heiligenschein averages of each. A correlation with age may be present in both the maria and the highlands, but its determination will require separation into distinct geochemical provinces."
https://openalex.org/W2130695075,Spiral and meander foraging traces in the deep sea are not distributed in proportion to assumed food availability. Data collected by means of deep-sea photography failed to reveal a bathymetric gradient in behavioral complexity or sensitivity. The foraging paradigm developed by numerous trace fossil studies does not adequately predict the modern environment.

The ventral portion of the ring serves as an external spermatheca early in mating. Although sperm assimilation occurs prior to development of the dorsal ring elements, male participation is instrumental in successful ring completion."

https://openalex.org/W2004718128,"In northwest Missouri, Lithic stage flake tools struck from prepared cores have been excavated underlying a Paleo-Indian fluted point assemblage. These assemblages were in two different loesses of the last glaciation. Thermoluminescent analysis of stone tools dates the Paleo-Indian occupations at 8690 +/- 1000 B.C. and 12,855 +/- 1500 B.C.; the Lithic stage occupations must be older than 13,000 B.C. on the basis of geologic correlation, lithic analysis, and cultural stratigraphy."

https://openalex.org/W2087326564,"The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, by a simple transformation, becomes pH - pK = pA - pB, where pA and pB are the negative logarithms of acid and base concentrations. Sigmoid titration curves then reduce to straight lines; titration curves of polyelectrolytes, to families of straight lines. The method is applied to the titration of the dipeptide glycyl aminotricarballylic acid, with four titrable groups. Results are expressed as Cartesian and d'Ocagne nomograms. The latter is of a general form applicable to polyelectrolytes of any degree of complexity."

https://openalex.org/W2088956791,Researchers are investigating a vaccine to prevent pregnancy. C.A. Shivers at the University of Tennessee has prepared antibody that specifically binds to the zona pellucida (the material surrounding mammalian eggs) of hamster eggs and forms a precipitate on the surface thereby theoretically blocking the access of sperm to the egg. This has been shown effective in the test tube. Other researchers have tested antibody in the hamster rabbit mouse and rat and have found conception prevented. Most studies have used passive immunization (whereby antibodies are produced in some other animal before being injected into the test animal); however active immunization is also possible (i.e. test animals produce the antibody themselves). Before introducing the vaccine for human use researchers are attempting to insure 1st reversibility 2nd assurance that antibodies be directed only against egg antigens and 3rd that the antigen be produced from a species other than human.
