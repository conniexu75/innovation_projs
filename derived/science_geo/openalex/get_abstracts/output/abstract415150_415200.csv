https://openalex.org/W2038691856,"Nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 regulates the expression and coordinated induction of a battery of genes encoding cytoprotective and drug transporter proteins in response to chemical and radiation stress. This leads to reduced apoptosis, enhanced cell survival, and increased drug resistance. In this study, we investigated the role of Nrf2 in up-regulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and its contribution to stress-induced apoptosis and cell survival. Exposure of mouse hepatoma (Hepa-1) and human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells to antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone led to induction of Bcl-2. Mutagenesis and transfection assays identified an antioxidant response element between nucleotides -3148 and -3140 on the reverse strand of the Bcl-2 gene promoter that was essential for activation of Bcl-2 gene expression. Band/supershift and ChIP assays demonstrated binding of Nrf2 to Bcl-2 antioxidant response element. Alterations in Nrf2 led to altered Bcl-2 induction and cellular apoptosis. Moreover, dysfunctional/mutant inhibitor of Nrf2 (INrf2) in human lung cancer cells failed to degrade Nrf2, resulting in an increased Bcl-2 level and decreased etoposide- and UV/γ radiation-mediated DNA fragmentation. In addition, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Nrf2 also led to decreased apoptosis and increased cell survival. Furthermore, the specific knockdown of Bcl-2 in Nrf2-activated tumor cells led to increased etoposide-induced apoptosis and decreased cell survival and growth/proliferation. These data provide the first evidence of Nrf2 in control of Bcl-2 expression and apoptotic cell death with implications in antioxidant protection, survival of cancer cells, and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2079492290,"Cancer cells universally increase glucose and glutamine consumption, leading to the altered metabolic state known as the Warburg effect; one metabolic pathway, highly dependent on glucose and glutamine, is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads to increases in the post-translational addition of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to various nuclear and cytosolic proteins. A number of these target proteins are implicated in cancer, and recently, O-GlcNAcylation was shown to play a role in breast cancer; however, O-GlcNAcylation in other cancers remains poorly defined. Here, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate epithelium and that OGT protein and O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in prostate carcinoma cell lines. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation in PC3-ML cells was associated with reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and VEGF, resulting in inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis. OGT-mediated regulation of invasion and angiogenesis was dependent upon regulation of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1, a key regulator of invasion and angiogenesis, as reducing OGT expression led to increased FoxM1 protein degradation. Conversely, overexpression of a degradation-resistant FoxM1 mutant abrogated OGT RNAi-mediated effects on invasion, MMP levels, angiogenesis, and VEGF expression. Using a mouse model of metastasis, we found that reduction of OGT expression blocked bone metastasis. Altogether, these data suggest that as prostate cancer cells alter glucose and glutamine levels, O-GlcNAc modifications and OGT levels become elevated and are required for regulation of malignant properties, implicating OGT as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer.

Cancer cells characteristically display altered metabolism, producing ATP independent of the oxygen concentration (1Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Oncogenic alterations of metabolism.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), in a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect (2Warburg O. On the origin of cancer cells.Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9620) Google Scholar). Cancer cells have increased utilization rates of glucose and glutamine, which are established hallmarks of tumor metabolism (3Deberardinis R.J. Sayed N. Ditsworth D. Thompson C.B.

As glycolysis is much less efficient in generating ATP than is oxidative phosphorylation, increased glucose flux must occur to compensate. To serve the less efficient energy-producing glycolytic route, tumor cells increase glucose uptake; clinical tumors generally show an order of magnitude increase in uptake (5Gatenby R.A. Models of tumor-host interaction as competing populations: implications for tumor biology and treatment.J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 176: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Changes in tumor cell glucose uptake and metabolism may also alter distinct nutrient signaling pathways, including the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) 2The abbreviations used are: HBPhexosamine biosynthetic pathwayO-GlcNAcO-linked β-N-acetylglucosamineOGTO-GlcNAc transferaseMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRAPC/Canaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome.

The HBP is highly dependent on glucose and glutamine and functions as a minor branch of the glycolytic pathway, as ∼3–5% of total glucose enters this pathway (7Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R.

The rate-limiting enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase uses glutamine to convert fructose 6-phosphate into glucosamine 6-phosphate, which is then utilized further to synthesize the end product, UDP-GlcNAc (7Marshall S.

UDP-GlcNAc is required for the biosynthesis of many classes of extracellular glycopolymers, including N- and O-glycans (8Dennis J.W. Nabi I.R. Demetriou M. Metabolism, cell surface organization, and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 1229-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). UDP-GlcNAc is the obligatory substrate for O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT). This enzyme adds the O-GlcNAc moiety to the free hydroxyl of select serine and threonine residues on a diverse population of nuclear and cytosolic proteins (9Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C.

Increased O-GlcNAc cycling has been suggested to play a key role in insulin resistance, as many key substrates involved in the insulin signaling pathway are modified by O-GlcNAc (10Wells L.

Recently, we and others found that OGT and O-GlcNAcylation are elevated in breast cancer cells and that reducing OGT levels blocks breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo (16Caldwell S.A.

GlcNAcylation plays an essential role in breast cancer metastasis.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 6344-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Metabolic alterations in breast cancer cells also increase O-GlcNAc cycling, and this has profound effects on cancer phenotypes, including growth and invasion; however, reducing OGT and O-GlcNAc levels has minimal effects on growth and differentiation of immortalized mammary epithelial cells (16Caldwell S.A.

OGT regulation of breast cancer growth is dependent on regulation of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1, as reducing O-GlcNAc levels increases degradation of FoxM1. Because altered metabolism is a general hallmark of many cancers and because FoxM1 is frequently overexpressed in a number of human malignancies, including pancreatic (18Wang Z. Banerjee S. Kong D.

Here, through examination of OncomineTM microarray databases, we have found that OGT is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue compared with normal prostate epithelium and that elevated OGT levels are associated with poor clinical outcome. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that the expression of OGT and the levels of O-GlcNAc modifications are elevated in prostate cancer cell lines compared with non-transformed prostate cells. Using RNAi targeting OGT expression in the metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC3-ML, we inhibited growth, which was associated with decreased FoxM1 levels and increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. In addition, we observed a reduction in invasive phenotypes by reducing O-GlcNAcylation in PC3-ML cells, as well as a reduction in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression. We show for the first time that reducing OGT levels inhibits angiogenic potential and VEGF expression in PC3-ML cells, which is dependent on FoxM1. Finally, reducing OGT expression in human prostate cancer cells inhibits metastasis to bone. Thus, by regulating the growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of prostate cancer cells, OGT is positioned as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of human prostate cancer.

Bioluminescent PC3-ML cells were generated by stable transfection with firefly luciferase in a pWZL-Hygro vector (kindly provided by M. Murphy, Fox Chase Cancer Center). Cell lysates from 1–5 × 106 cells were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μg/ml PMSF. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using primary antibodies as indicated above. Assays were performed as described previously (16Caldwell S.A. Jackson S.R. Shahriari K.S. Lynch T.P. Sethi G.

Briefly, RWPE-1 or PC3-ML cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.25 × 104/well in 8-well chamber slides (BD FalconTM) that had been previously coated with 50 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Cells were then overlaid with the respective growth medium supplemented with 2% growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Cells were harvested and counted at the indicated times. Immunofluorescence of three-dimensional structures was performed as described (16Caldwell S.A. Jackson S.R. Shahriari K.S. Lynch T.P. Sethi G. Walker S. Vosseller K. Reginato M.J.

Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for monolayer animal cell RNA extraction. The levels of OGT, MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF, and cyclophilin A were determined using a Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR device with a Brilliant II QRT-PCR Master Mix kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data analysis was performed with the MxPro software package (Stratagene). TaqMan gene expression assay primers/probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) for cyclophilin A (Hs99999904_m1), OGT (Hs00914634_g1), MMP-2 (Hs00234472_m1), MMP-9 (Hs00234579_m1), and VEGF (Hs00173626_m1). Expression levels were normalized to cyclophilin A. Base layers consisting of growth medium containing a 1% low melting point agarose (ICS BioExpress, Kaysville, UT) made in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) were poured onto 6-well plates and allowed to solidify. Cells (1 × 104/well) were plated in triplicate on top layers consisting of growth medium containing 0.3% agarose and 5 mm HEPES. The top layer was also allowed to set and then further overlaid with 1 ml of medium. Colonies were stained after 14 days with 500 μl of 0.05% p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet overnight, and colonies measuring >50 μm were counted manually. At 48 h post-infection with control or OGT shRNA lentivirus, cells were harvested and washed with PBS. Pellets were fixed in cold 70% ethanol and maintained at −20 °C for at least 2 h. Propidium iodide (Sigma) in a solution of Triton X-100 (Sigma) and DNase-free RNase A (Fisher) was used for cell cycle distribution staining, and an FITC mouse anti-human Ki-67 kit (BD Pharmingen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol for Ki-67 staining. All data were collected and analyzed using a Guava EasyCyte Plus system and CytoSoft (version 5.3) software (Millipore). Ki-67 data are presented as the mean fluorescence intensity of gated cells, normalized to the isotype control, and are expressed as intensity relative to the appropriate control shRNA. Invasion assays were performed using BD BioCoat growth factor-reduced Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol, utilizing serum-free medium in the upper chamber and complete medium in the lower chamber over a 12-h incubation period. Invasive cells were visualized with DAPI (5 μg/ml; Sigma); cells in four fields were counted for each chamber. Endothelial tube formation assays were performed as described (18Wang Z. Banerjee S.

Antibiotic-selected PC3-ML cells stably expressing control or OGT shRNA were used to condition RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) for 24 h and passed through 0.45-μm syringe filters. Tube length was quantified using iVision-Mac (version 4.0.14) software (BioVision Technologies, Exton, PA) from digital images taken using an inverted microscope Male severe combined immunodeficient mice (5–6 weeks old) were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) and inoculated in the left cardiac ventricle with 5 × 105 PC3-ML cells stably expressing luciferase containing either OGT or control shRNA in 100 μl of serum-free DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) using a 30-gauge needle. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μl of d-luciferin solution (9 mg/ml; Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA), and bioluminescence imaging was done 30 min after the intracardiac injection to detect the distribution of prostate cancer cells; mice were imaged weekly. Images were acquired with an IVIS 200 imaging system, and results were analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences). Metastatic lesions were counted for each mouse at week 5 and averaged for both groups. All protocols involving the use of animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Fox Chase Cancer Center. To confirm the presence of PC3-ML cells in the bone metastatic regions, tissues were excised from the mice at necropsy. Tissue was prepared and analyzed by the Pathology Diagnostic Laboratory at Drexel University College of Medicine. Briefly, tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, cut at the midpoint, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Serial paraffin longitudinal sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. OGT gene expression data from four independent prostate cancer studies were obtained using the OncomineTM Database. In the four studies retrieved, we compared samples of normal prostate tissue and prostate carcinoma. These data were regraphed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and are presented as scatter plots, including the mean ± S.E. Survivorship data were additionally acquired through the OncomineTM Database; OGT expression data were stratified as either being high (above the dataset mean) or low (below the dataset mean) and regraphed to represent probability of survival at the indicated time point. Tissue-specific OGT expression data were acquired through the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus and graphed to depict average OGT expression for the indicated tissue type. All results are from at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was ascertained with Student's t test, with a p value threshold of ≤0.05. We and others have recently demonstrated that OGT and O-GlcNAc modifications are overexpressed in breast cancer (16Caldwell S.A. Jackson S.R. Shahriari K.S. Lynch T.P. Sethi G. Walker S. Vosseller K.

To determine whether OGT is overexpressed in other tumor types, we examined OGT expression using the OncomineTM Database. We found four independent microarray gene expression studies showing elevated OGT mRNA expression patterns in human prostate carcinoma compared with normal adjacent tissue samples (supplemental Fig. 1).

Here, we identified novel EPA metabolites, including 8,18-dihydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (8,18-diHEPE), 11,18-diHEPE, 12,18-diHEPE, and 17,18-diHEPE from 18-HEPE. Unlike resolvins E1 and E2, both of which are biosynthesized by neutrophils via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, these metabolites are biosynthesized by eosinophils via the 12/15-lipoxygenase pathway. Among them, two stereoisomers of 17,18-diHEPE, collectively termed resolvin E3 (RvE3), displayed a potent anti-inflammatory action by limiting neutrophil infiltration in zymosan-induced peritonitis. The planar structure of RvE3 was unambiguously determined to be 17,18-dihydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E,15E-EPE by high resolution NMR, and the two stereoisomers were assigned to have 17,18R- and 17,18S-dihydroxy groups, respectively, using chemically synthesized 18R- and 18S-HEPE as precursors. Both 18R- and 18S-RvE3 inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro at low nanomolar concentrations. These findings suggest that RvE3 contributes to the beneficial actions of EPA in controlling inflammation and related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2028029974,"The shift in marine resource management from a compartmentalized approach of dealing with resources on a species basis to an approach based on management of spatially defined ecosystems requires an accurate accounting of energy flow. The flow of energy from primary production through the food web will ultimately limit upper trophic-level fishery yields. In this work, we examine the relationship between yield and several metrics including net primary production, chlorophyll concentration, particle-export ratio, and the ratio of secondary to primary production. We also evaluate the relationship between yield and two additional rate measures that describe the export of energy from the pelagic food web, particle export flux and mesozooplankton productivity. We found primary production is a poor predictor of global fishery yields for a sample of 52 large marine ecosystems. However, chlorophyll concentration, particle-export ratio, and the ratio of secondary to primary production were positively associated with yields. The latter two measures provide greater mechanistic insight into factors controlling fishery production than chlorophyll concentration alone. Particle export flux and mesozooplankton productivity were also significantly related to yield on a global basis. Collectively, our analyses suggest that factors related to the export of energy from pelagic food webs are critical to defining patterns of fishery yields. Such trophic patterns are associated with temperature and latitude and hence greater yields are associated with colder, high latitude ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2021755623,"Background High rates of typhoid fever in children in urban settings in Asia have led to focus on childhood immunization in Asian cities, but not in Africa, where data, mostly from rural areas, have shown low disease incidence. We set out to compare incidence of typhoid fever in a densely populated urban slum and a rural community in Kenya, hypothesizing higher rates in the urban area, given crowding and suboptimal access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene. Methods During 2007-9, we conducted population-based surveillance in Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, and in Lwak, a rural area in western Kenya. Participants had free access to study clinics; field workers visited their homes biweekly to collect information about acute illnesses. In clinic, blood cultures were processed from patients with fever or pneumonia. Crude and adjusted incidence rates were calculated. Results In the urban site, the overall crude incidence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) bacteremia was 247 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation (pyo) with highest rates in children 5–9 years old (596 per 100,000 pyo) and 2–4 years old (521 per 100,000 pyo). Crude overall incidence in Lwak was 29 cases per 100,000 pyo with low rates in children 2–4 and 5–9 years old (28 and 18 cases per 100,000 pyo, respectively). Adjusted incidence rates were highest in 2–4 year old urban children (2,243 per 100,000 pyo) which were >15-fold higher than rates in the rural site for the same age group. Nearly 75% of S. Typhi isolates were multi-drug resistant. Conclusions This systematic urban slum and rural comparison showed dramatically higher typhoid incidence among urban children <10 years old with rates similar to those from Asian urban slums. The findings have potential policy implications for use of typhoid vaccines in increasingly urban Africa."

https://openalex.org/W1987061647,"Background Poorly regulated international trade in ornamental fishes poses risks to both biodiversity and economic activity via invasive alien species and exotic pathogens. Border security officials need robust tools to confirm identifications, often requiring hard-to-obtain taxonomic literature and expertise. DNA barcoding offers a potentially attractive tool for quarantine inspection, but has yet to be scrutinised for aquarium fishes. Here, we present a barcoding approach for ornamental cyprinid fishes by: (1) expanding current barcode reference libraries; (2) assessing barcode congruence with morphological identifications under numerous scenarios (e.g. inclusion of GenBank data, presence of singleton species, choice of analytical method); and (3) providing supplementary information to identify difficult species. Methodology/Principal Findings We sampled 172 ornamental cyprinid fish species from the international trade, and provide data for 91 species currently unrepresented in reference libraries (GenBank/Bold). DNA barcodes were found to be highly congruent with our morphological assignments, achieving success rates of 90–99%, depending on the method used (neighbour-joining monophyly, bootstrap, nearest neighbour, GMYC, percent threshold). Inclusion of data from GenBank (additional 157 spp.) resulted in a more comprehensive library, but at a cost to success rate due to the increased number of singleton species. In addition to DNA barcodes, our study also provides supporting data in the form of specimen images, morphological characters, taxonomic bibliography, preserved vouchers, and nuclear rhodopsin sequences. Using this nuclear rhodopsin data we also uncovered evidence of interspecific hybridisation, and highlighted unrecognised diversity within popular aquarium species, including the endangered Indian barb Puntius denisonii. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that DNA barcoding provides a highly effective biosecurity tool for rapidly identifying ornamental fishes. In cases where DNA barcodes are unable to offer an identification, we improve on previous studies by consolidating supplementary information from multiple data sources, and empower biosecurity agencies to confidently identify high-risk fishes in the aquarium trade."
https://openalex.org/W2000955709,"Despite the prevalence of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Many secreted endocrine factors and the intertissue cross-talk they mediate are known to be dysregulated in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, we describe CTRP12, a novel adipokine with anti-diabetic actions. The mRNA and circulating levels of CTRP12 were decreased in a mouse model of obesity, but its expression in adipocytes was increased by the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone. A modest rise in circulating levels of CTRP12 by recombinant protein administration was sufficient to lower blood glucose in wild-type, leptin-deficient ob/ob, and diet-induced obese mice. A short term elevation of serum CTRP12 by adenovirus-mediated expression improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, normalized hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and lowered postprandial insulin resistance in obese and diabetic mice. CTRP12 improves insulin sensitivity in part by enhancing insulin signaling in the liver and adipose tissue. Further, CTRP12 also acts in an insulin-independent manner; in cultured hepatocytes and adipocytes, CTRP12 directly activated the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway to suppress gluconeogenesis and promote glucose uptake, respectively. Collectively, these data establish CTRP12 as a novel metabolic regulator linking adipose tissue to whole body glucose homeostasis through insulin-dependent and independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2024648144,"Our previous findings indicated that androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation at serine 81 is stimulated by the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). In this report, we extended our previous study and confirmed that Ser-81 phosphorylation increases during mitosis, coincident with CDK1 activation. We further showed blocking cell cycle at G1 or S phase did not disrupt androgen-induced Ser-81 phosphorylation and AR-dependent transcription, consistent with a recent report that AR was phosphorylated at Ser-81 and activated by the transcriptional CDK9. To assess the function of Ser-81 phosphorylation in prostate cancer (PCa) cells expressing endogenous AR, we developed a ligand switch strategy using a ligand-binding domain mutation (W741C) that renders AR responsive to the antagonist bicalutamide. An S81A/W741C double mutant AR stably expressed in PCa cells failed to transactivate the endogenous AR-regulated PSA or TMPRSS2 genes. ChIP showed that the S81A mutation prevented ligand-induced AR recruitment to these genes, and cellular fractionation revealed that the S81A mutation globally abrogated chromatin binding. Conversely, the AR fraction rapidly recruited to chromatin after androgen stimulation was highly enriched for Ser-81 phosphorylation. Finally, inhibition of CDK1 and CDK9 decreased AR Ser-81 phosphorylation, chromatin binding, and transcriptional activity. These findings indicate that Ser-81 phosphorylation by CDK9 stabilizes AR chromatin binding for transcription and suggest that CDK1-mediated Ser-81 phosphorylation during mitosis provides a pool of Ser-81 phosphorylation AR that can be readily recruited to chromatin for gene reactivation and may enhance AR activity in PCa.

https://openalex.org/W2065666214,"The aim of this work was to study the similarity network and hierarchical clustering of Finnish emotion concepts. Native speakers of Finnish evaluated similarity between the 50 most frequently used Finnish words describing emotional experiences. We hypothesized that methods developed within network theory, such as identifying clusters and specific local network structures, can reveal structures that would be difficult to discover using traditional methods such as multidimensional scaling (MDS) and ordinary cluster analysis. The concepts divided into three main clusters, which can be described as negative, positive, and surprise. Negative and positive clusters divided further into meaningful sub-clusters, corresponding to those found in previous studies. Importantly, this method allowed the same concept to be a member in more than one cluster. Our results suggest that studying particular network structures that do not fit into a low-dimensional description can shed additional light on why subjects evaluate certain concepts as similar. To encourage the use of network methods in analyzing similarity data, we provide the analysis software for free use (http://www.becs.tkk.fi/similaritynets/)."
https://openalex.org/W2098863353,"Purpose Baseball requires an incredible amount of visual acuity and eye-hand coordination, especially for the batters. The learning objective of this work is to observe that traditional vision training as part of injury prevention or conditioning can be added to a team's training schedule to improve some performance parameters such as batting and hitting. Methods All players for the 2010 to 2011 season underwent normal preseason physicals and baseline testing that is standard for the University of Cincinnati Athletics Department. Standard vision training exercises were implemented 6 weeks before the start of the season. Results are reported as compared to the 2009 to 2010 season. Pre season conditioning was followed by a maintenance program during the season of vision training. Results The University of Cincinnati team batting average increased from 0.251 in 2010 to 0.285 in 2011 and the slugging percentage increased by 0.033. The rest of the Big East's slugging percentage fell over that same time frame 0.082. This produces a difference of 0.115 with 95% confidence interval (0.024, 0.206). As with the batting average, the change for University of Cincinnati is significantly different from the rest of the Big East (p = 0.02). Essentially all batting parameters improved by 10% or more. Similar differences were seen when restricting the analysis to games within the Big East conference. Conclusion Vision training can combine traditional and technological methodologies to train the athletes' eyes and improve batting. Vision training as part of conditioning or injury prevention can be applied and may improve batting performance in college baseball players. High performance vision training can be instituted in the pre-season and maintained throughout the season to improve batting parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1982906879,"Phosphatidic acid (PA) and phytosphingosine 1-phosphate (phyto-S1P) both are lipid messengers involved in plant response to abscisic acid (ABA). Our previous data indicate that PA binds to sphingosine kinase (SPHK) and increases its phyto-S1P-producing activity. To understand the cellular and physiological functions of the PA-SPHK interaction, we isolated Arabidopsis thaliana SPHK mutants sphk1-1 and sphk2-1 and characterized them, together with phospholipase Dα1 knock-out, pldα1, in plant response to ABA. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, the SPHK mutants and pldα1 all displayed decreased sensitivity to ABA-promoted stomatal closure. Phyto-S1P promoted stomatal closure in sphk1-1 and sphk2-1, but not in pldα1, whereas PA promoted stomatal closure in sphk1-1, sphk2-1, and pldα1. The ABA activation of PLDα1 in leaves and protoplasts was attenuated in the SPHK mutants, and the ABA activation of SPHK was reduced in pldα1. In response to ABA, the accumulation of long-chain base phosphates was decreased in pldα1, whereas PA production was decreased in SPHK mutants, compared with WT. Collectively, these results indicate that SPHK and PLDα1 act together in ABA response and that SPHK and phyto-S1P act upstream of PLDα1 and PA in mediating the ABA response. PA is involved in the activation of SPHK, and activation of PLDα1 requires SPHK activity. The data suggest that SPHK/phyto-S1P and PLDα1A are co-dependent in amplification of response to ABA, mediating stomatal closure in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2047936269,"The interaction of host cells with mycobacteria is complex and can lead to multiple outcomes ranging from bacterial clearance to latent infection. Although many factors are involved, the mammalian autophagy pathway is recognized as a determinant that can influence the course of infection. Intervention aimed at utilizing autophagy to clear infection requires an examination of the autophagy and signal transduction induced by mycobacteria under native conditions. With both pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria, we show that infection correlates with an increase in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity indicating that autophagy induction by mycobacteria occurs in an mTOR-independent manner. Analysis of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which respectively induce high and low autophagy responses, indicates that lipid material is capable of inducing both autophagy and mTOR signaling. Although mycobacterial infection potently induces mTOR activity, we confirm that bacterial viability can be reduced by rapamycin treatment. In addition, our work demonstrates that BCG can reduce autophagy responses to M. smegmatis suggesting that specific mechanisms are used by BCG to minimize host cell autophagy. We conclude that autophagy induction and mTOR signaling take place concurrently during mycobacterial infection and that host autophagy responses to any given mycobacterium stem from multiple factors, including the presence of activating macromolecules and inhibitory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2027543384,"It is unclear whether and how elite athletes process physiological or psychological challenges differently than healthy comparison subjects. In general, individuals optimize exercise level as it relates to differences between expected and experienced exertion, which can be conceptualized as a body prediction error. The process of computing a body prediction error involves the insular cortex, which is important for interoception, i.e. the sense of the physiological condition of the body. Thus, optimal performance may be related to efficient minimization of the body prediction error. We examined the hypothesis that elite athletes, compared to control subjects, show attenuated insular cortex activation during an aversive interoceptive challenge.Elite adventure racers (n = 10) and healthy volunteers (n = 11) performed a continuous performance task with varying degrees of a non-hypercapnic breathing load while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results indicate that (1) non-hypercapnic inspiratory breathing load is an aversive experience associated with a profound activation of a distributed set of brain areas including bilateral insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated; (2) adventure racers relative to comparison subjects show greater accuracy on the continuous performance task during the aversive interoceptive condition; and (3) adventure racers show an attenuated right insula cortex response during and following the aversive interoceptive condition of non-hypercapnic inspiratory breathing load.These findings support the hypothesis that elite athletes during an aversive interoceptive condition show better performance and an attenuated insular cortex activation during the aversive experience. Interestingly, differential modulation of the right insular cortex has been found previously in elite military personnel and appears to be emerging as an important brain system for optimal performance in extreme environments."
https://openalex.org/W1995182632,"Arrestins are a small family of proteins that regulate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Arrestins specifically bind to phosphorylated active receptors, terminating G protein coupling, targeting receptors to endocytic vesicles, and initiating G protein-independent signaling. The interaction of rhodopsin-attached phosphates with Lys-14 and Lys-15 in β-strand I was shown to disrupt the interaction of α-helix I, β-strand I, and the C-tail of visual arrestin-1, facilitating its transition into an active receptor-binding state. Here we tested the role of conserved lysines in homologous positions of non-visual arrestins by generating K2A mutants in which both lysines were replaced with alanines. K2A mutations in arrestin-1, -2, and -3 significantly reduced their binding to active phosphorhodopsin in vitro. The interaction of arrestins with several GPCRs in intact cells was monitored by a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assay. BRET data confirmed the role of Lys-14 and Lys-15 in arrestin-1 binding to non-cognate receptors. However, this was not the case for non-visual arrestins in which the K2A mutations had little effect on net BRET(max) values for the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine (M2R), β(2)-adrenergic (β(2)AR), or D2 dopamine receptors. Moreover, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of M2R interacted with wild type non-visual arrestins normally, whereas phosphorylation-deficient β(2)AR mutants bound arrestins at 20-50% of the level of wild type β(2)AR. Thus, the contribution of receptor-attached phosphates to arrestin binding varies depending on the receptor-arrestin pair. Although arrestin-1 always depends on receptor phosphorylation, its role in the recruitment of arrestin-2 and -3 is much greater in the case of β(2)AR than M2R and D2 dopamine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2015220759,"Insulin signaling pathways in the brain regulate food uptake and memory and learning. Insulin and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways are integrated and function closely together. PKC activation in the brain is essential for learning and neuronal repair. Intranasal delivery of insulin to the central nervous system (CNS) has been shown to improve memory, reduce cerebral atrophy, and reverse neurodegeneration. However, the neuronal molecular mechanisms of these effects have not been studied in depth. PKCδ plays a central role in cell survival. Its splice variants, PKCδI and PKCδII, are switches that determine cell survival and fate. PKCδI promotes apoptosis, whereas PKCδII promotes survival. Here, we demonstrate that insulin promotes alternative splicing of PKCδII isoform in HT22 cells. The expression of PKCδI splice variant remains unchanged. Insulin increases PKCδII alternative splicing via the PI3K pathway. We further demonstrate that Akt kinase mediates phosphorylation of the splicing factor SC35 to promote PKCδII alternative splicing. Using overexpression and knockdown assays, we demonstrate that insulin increases expression of Bcl2 and bcl-xL via PKCδII. We demonstrate increased cell proliferation and increased BrdU incorporation in insulin-treated cells as well as in HT22 cells overexpressing PKCδII. Finally, we demonstrate in vivo that intranasal insulin promotes cognitive function in mice with concomitant increases in PKCδII expression in the hippocampus. This is the first report of insulin, generally considered a growth or metabolic hormone, regulating the alternative isoform expression of a key signaling kinase in neuronal cells such that it results in increased neuronal survival."

Acr can react with DNA to form mutagenic α- and γ-hydroxy-1, N(2)-cyclic propano-2'-deoxyguanosine adducts (α-OH-Acr-dG and γ-OH-Acr-dG). We demonstrate here that Acr-dG adducts can be efficiently repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in normal human bronchial epithelia (NHBE) and lung fibroblasts (NHLF). However, the same adducts were poorly processed in cell lysates isolated from Acr-treated NHBE and NHLF, suggesting that Acr inhibits NER. In addition, we show that Acr treatment also inhibits base excision repair and mismatch repair. Although Acr does not change the expression of XPA, XPC, hOGG1, PMS2 or MLH1 genes, it causes a reduction of XPA, XPC, hOGG1, PMS2, and MLH1 proteins; this effect, however, can be neutralized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Acr treatment further enhances both bulky and oxidative DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. These results indicate that Acr not only damages DNA but can also modify DNA repair proteins and further causes degradation of these modified repair proteins. We propose that these two detrimental effects contribute to Acr mutagenicity and carcinogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1992630019,"The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) governs the free exchange of ions and metabolites between the mitochondria and the rest of the cell. The three-dimensional structure of VDAC1 reveals a channel formed by 19 β-strands and an N-terminal α-helix located near the midpoint of the pore. The position of this α-helix causes a narrowing of the cavity, but ample space for metabolite passage remains. The participation of the N-terminus of VDAC1 in the voltage-gating process has been well established, but the molecular mechanism continues to be debated; however, the majority of models entail large conformational changes of this N-terminal segment. Here we report that the pore-lining N-terminal α-helix does not undergo independent structural rearrangements during channel gating. We engineered a double Cys mutant in murine VDAC1 that cross-links the α-helix to the wall of the β-barrel pore and reconstituted the modified protein into planar lipid bilayers. The modified murine VDAC1 exhibited typical voltage gating. These results suggest that the N-terminal α-helix is located inside the pore of VDAC in the open state and remains associated with β-strand 11 of the pore wall during voltage gating."
https://openalex.org/W2066715566,"Differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is a fundamental aspect of normal development and vascular disease. During contraction, VSMCs modulate calcium sensitivity through RhoA/ROCK-mediated inhibition of the myosin light chain phosphatase complex (MLCP). Previous studies have demonstrated that this signaling pathway functions in parallel to increase the expression of smooth muscle genes through the myocardin-family of co-activators. MEF2C fulfills a critical role in VSMC differentiation and regulates myocardin expression, leading us to investigate whether the RhoA/ROCK signaling cascade might regulate MEF2 activity. Depolarization-induced calcium signaling increased the expression of myocardin, which was sensitive to ROCK and p38 MAPK inhibition. We previously identified protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α), a known catalytic subunit of the MLCP in VSMCs, as a potent repressor of MEF2 activity. PP1α inhibition resulted in increased expression of myocardin, while ectopic expression of PP1α inhibited the induction of myocardin by MEF2C. Consistent with these data, shRNA-mediated suppression of a PP1α inhibitor, CPI-17, reduced myocardin expression and inhibited VSMC differentiation, suggesting a pivotal role for CPI-17 in regulating MEF2 activity. These data constitute evidence of a novel signaling cascade that links RhoA-mediated calcium sensitivity to MEF2-dependent myocardin expression in VSMCs through a mechanism involving p38 MAPK, PP1α, and CPI-17."

However, the role of steatosis per se and the precise factors required in the progression to steatohepatitis or insulin resistance remain elusive. The JAK-STAT pathway is critical in mediating signaling of a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors. Mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Janus kinase 2 (L-JAK2 KO mice) develop spontaneous steatosis as early as 2 weeks of age. In this study, we investigated the metabolic consequences of jak2 deletion in response to diet-induced metabolic stress. To our surprise, despite the profound hepatosteatosis, deletion of hepatic jak2 did not sensitize the liver to accelerated inflammatory injury on a prolonged high fat diet (HFD). This was accompanied by complete protection against HFD-induced whole-body insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and an increase in β-cell mass were also present in these mice. Moreover, L-JAK2 KO mice had progressively reduced adiposity in association with blunted hepatic growth hormone signaling. These mice also exhibited increased resting energy expenditure on both chow and high fat diet. In conclusion, our findings indicate a key role of hepatic JAK2 in metabolism such that its absence completely arrests steatohepatitis development and confers protection against diet-induced systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.

https://openalex.org/W2062072104,"Earlier studies in this laboratory have shown the potential of artemisinin-curcumin combination therapy in experimental malaria. In a parasite recrudescence model in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei (ANKA), a single dose of alpha,beta-arteether (ART) with three oral doses of curcumin prevented recrudescence, providing almost 95% protection. The parasites were completely cleared in blood with ART-alone (AE) or ART+curcumin (AC) treatments in the short-term, although the clearance was faster in the latter case involving increased ROS generation. But, parasites in liver and spleen were not cleared in AE or AC treatments, perhaps, serving as a reservoir for recrudescence. Parasitemia in blood reached up to 60% in AE-treated mice during the recrudescence phase, leading to death of animals. A transient increase of up to 2-3% parasitemia was observed in AC-treatment, leading to protection and reversal of splenomegaly. A striking increase in spleen mRNA levels for TLR2, IL-10 and IgG-subclass antibodies but a decrease in those for INFγ and IL-12 was observed in AC-treatment. There was a striking increase in IL-10 and IgG subclass antibody levels but a decrease in INFγ levels in sera leading to protection against recrudescence. AC-treatment failed to protect against recrudescence in TLR2(-/-) and IL-10(-/-) animals. IL-10 injection to AE-treated wild type mice and AC-treated TLR2(-/-) mice was able to prolong survival. Blood from the recrudescence phase in AE-treatment, but not from AC-treatment, was able to reinfect and kill naïve animals. Sera from the recrudescence phase of AC-treated animals reacted with several parasite proteins compared to that from AE-treated animals. It is proposed that activation of TLR2-mediated innate immune response leading to enhanced IL-10 production and generation of anti-parasite antibodies contribute to protective immunity in AC-treated mice. These results indicate a potential for curcumin-based combination therapy to be tested for prevention of recrudescence in falciparum and relapse in vivax malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2010072564,"While oxidative stress has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the underlying pathophysiological relationship is unclear. To examine this relationship, we induced oxidative stress through the genetic ablation of one copy of mitochondrial antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) allele in mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. The brains of young (5-7 months of age) and old (25-30 months of age) mice with the four genotypes, wild-type (Sod2(+/+)), hemizygous Sod2 (Sod2(+/-)), hAPP/wild-type (Sod2(+/+)), and hAPP/hemizygous (Sod2(+/-)) were examined to assess levels of oxidative stress markers 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and heme oxygenase-1. Sod2 reduction in young hAPP mice resulted in significantly increased oxidative stress in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. Interestingly, while differences resulting from hAPP expression or Sod2 reduction were not apparent in the neurons in old mice, oxidative stress was increased in astrocytes in old, but not young hAPP mice with either Sod2(+/+) or Sod2(+/-). Our study shows the specific changes in oxidative stress and the causal relationship with the pathological progression of these mice. These results suggest that the early neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress in the hAPP/Sod2(+/-) mice may contribute to the pathological and behavioral changes seen in this animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2086569998,"Polyhomeotic (Ph), a member of the Polycomb Group (PcG), is a gene silencer critical for proper development. We present a previously unrecognized way of controlling Ph function through modulation of its sterile alpha motif (SAM) polymerization leading to the identification of a novel target for tuning the activities of proteins. SAM domain containing proteins have been shown to require SAM polymerization for proper function. However, the role of the Ph SAM polymer in PcG-mediated gene silencing was uncertain. Here, we first show that Ph SAM polymerization is indeed required for its gene silencing function. Interestingly, the unstructured linker sequence N-terminal to Ph SAM can shorten the length of polymers compared with when Ph SAM is individually isolated. Substituting the native linker with a random, unstructured sequence (RLink) can still limit polymerization, but not as well as the native linker. Consequently, the increased polymeric Ph RLink exhibits better gene silencing ability. In the Drosophila wing disc, Ph RLink expression suppresses growth compared with no effect for wild-type Ph, and opposite to the overgrowth phenotype observed for polymer-deficient Ph mutants. These data provide the first demonstration that the inherent activity of a protein containing a polymeric SAM can be enhanced by increasing SAM polymerization. Because the SAM linker had not been previously considered important for the function of SAM-containing proteins, our finding opens numerous opportunities to manipulate linker sequences of hundreds of polymeric SAM proteins to regulate a diverse array of intracellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1975705215,"Background Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important mediator in tumor-promoting inflammation. High expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been detected in the embryonic childhood tumor neuroblastoma, and treatment with COX inhibitors significantly reduces tumor growth. Here, we have investigated the significance of a high COX-2 expression in neuroblastoma by analysis of PGE2 production, the expression pattern and localization of PGE2 receptors and intracellular signal transduction pathways activated by PGE2. Principal Findings A high expression of the PGE2 receptors, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 in primary neuroblastomas, independent of biological and clinical characteristics, was detected using immunohistochemistry. In addition, mRNA and protein corresponding to each of the receptors were detected in neuroblastoma cell lines. Immunofluorescent staining revealed localization of the receptors to the cellular membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nuclear compartment. Neuroblastoma cells produced PGE2 and stimulation of serum-starved neuroblastoma cells with PGE2 increased the intracellular concentration of calcium and cyclic AMP with subsequent phosphorylation of Akt. Addition of 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2) increased cell viability in a time, dose- and cell line-dependent manner. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with a COX-2 inhibitor resulted in a diminished cell growth and viability that was reversed by the addition of dmPGE2. Similarly, PGE2 receptor antagonists caused a decrease in neuroblastoma cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that PGE2 acts as an autocrine and/or paracrine survival factor for neuroblastoma cells. Hence, specific targeting of PGE2 signaling provides a novel strategy for the treatment of childhood neuroblastoma through the inhibition of important mediators of tumor-promoting inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1984652711,"In high-density myoblast cultures S100B enhances basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling via binding to bFGF and blocks its canonical receptor, receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), thereby stimulating proliferation and inhibiting differentiation. Here we show that upon skeletal muscle injury S100B is released from myofibers with maximum release at day 1 post-injury in coincidence with satellite cell activation and the beginning of the myoblast proliferation phase, and declining release thereafter in coincidence with reduced myoblast proliferation and enhanced differentiation. By contrast, levels of released bFGF are remarkably low at day 1 post-injury, peak around day 5 and decline thereafter. We also show that in low-density myoblast cultures S100B binds RAGE, but not bFGF/FGFR1 thereby simultaneously stimulating proliferation via ERK1/2 and activating the myogenic program via p38 MAPK. Clearance of S100B after a 24-h treatment of low-density myoblasts results in enhanced myotube formation compared with controls as a result of increased cell numbers and activated myogenic program, whereas chronic treatment with S100B results in stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of differentiation due to a switch of the initial low-density culture to a high-density culture. However, at relatively high doses, S100B stimulates the mitogenic bFGF/FGFR1 signaling in low-density myoblasts, provided bFGF is present. We propose that S100B is a danger signal released from injured muscles that participates in skeletal muscle regeneration by activating the promyogenic RAGE or the mitogenic bFGF/FGFR1 depending on its own concentration, the absence or presence of bFGF, and myoblast density."

One CaM molecule binds two molecules of ER-α in a 1:2 complex. The two lobes of CaM (N-lobe, residues 1–80; C-lobe, residues 81–148) each bind to nearly the same site on dimeric ER-α (residues 292, 296, 299, 302, and 303).

Xenopus calmodulin cDNA inserted in pET3a (without any tag) and pET15b (with N-terminal His tag and thrombin cleavage site) were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein overexpression of the 148-residue full-length CaM. The CaM N-terminal lobe (CaMN, residues 1–80) construct was generated by inserting a stop codon into the full-length pET15b-CaM template. For the CaM C-terminal lobe construct (CaMC, residues 76–148), a cDNA was generated by PCR and inserted (via NdeI and BamHI) into the pET3a expression vector. A cDNA that codes for the hinge domain of human estrogen receptor α (residues 248–317, ER(248–317)) was inserted in the pGEX-2T vector containing an N-terminal GST tag and tobacco etch virus cleavage site (Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly). A cDNA that codes for a fragment of ER-α that includes both the CaM-binding and ligand-binding domains (residues 287–552, ER(285–552)) was inserted into pRSET vector containing an N-terminal His tag. Site-directed mutagenesis of full-length ER-α was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (4.Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. The transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor-α is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13097-13104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plasmid pcDNA3-myc-ER was used as template. The mutant cDNA was amplified by PCR with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase using appropriate oligonucleotides. These changes produced the single ER-α mutants W292A, L296A, and K299A, the double mutant W292A/L296A, and the triple mutant W292A/L296A/K299A.

Smaller peptide fragments of ER-α (ER(287–305) and ER(287–311)) were chemically synthesized and purchased from CHI Scientific (Maynard, MA). All DNA plasmids (except for pRSET-ER(285–552), which was transformed into C41(DE3) competent cells) were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and expressed in LB medium (unlabeled proteins) or M9 media supplemented with 15NH4Cl for 15N-labeled proteins or 15NH4Cl/13C-glucose for double-labeled proteins. CaM and CaMC were purified as described previously (22.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Ca2+-induced hydrophobic site on calmodulin.

The His-tagged purification of CaMN and ER(285–552) used the standard His tag protein purification protocol. The His tag was removed by thrombin cleavage, and cleaved proteins were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-75). ER(248–317) was purified using GST-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-75) following the removal of the GST tag by tobacco etch virus protease. All final purified protein constructs in this study were verified to be more than 95% pure based on mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE analysis. CaM binding to functional fragments of ER-α (ER(287–552), ER(248–317), and ER(287–305)) were monitored by ITC. Both CaM and peptide fragments of ER-α were exchanged into ITC buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (or Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), with or without 5 μm β-estradiol (for ER(287–552)) at pH 7.0. The buffer exchange was performed by three cycles of concentration/dilution using Amicon ultracentrifugal filters Ultracel-3K (Millipore catalog no. UFC900324, 3-kDa cutoff) or dialyzed against the ITC buffer. CaM or each lobe (300 μm) in the injection syringe was titrated into the sample cuvette containing ER-α peptide (20 μm). The titrations were carried out using MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter at 30 °C. For each titration, 20–30 injections of 5 μl of titrant were made at 5-min intervals. Data were corrected for heats of dilution from control experiments and analyzed using Origin ITC Analysis software (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). The purified CaMs (or individual lobes) were first exchanged into 10 ml of NMR buffer (20 mm Tris-d11, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 8:100% D2O, pH 7.0) and then titrated with ER(287–305) peptide solution to give a final molar ratio of 1:2 (full-length CaM) or 1:1 (each lobe). The titration mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and concentrated to 0.4 ml using Amicon ultracentrifugal filters Ultracel-3K (Millipore catalog no. UFC900324, 3-kDa cutoff) to give a final protein concentration of ∼0.5 mm. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm or a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as standard. All spectra were recorded at 310 K using Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a four-channel interface and triple-resonance cryoprobe with pulse field gradients. The 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded on a sample of 15N-labeled CaM or each lobe in the presence of unlabeled ER(287–305). All three-dimensional NMR experiments for assigning backbone and side-chain resonances (HNCACB/CBCACONH, HNCO, HBHA(CO)NH, C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, and HCCH-TOCSY) were recorded on a sample of 13C/15N-labeled CaM bound to unlabeled ER(287–305) in Tris-d11 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 8% D2O or 100% D2O, pH 7.0). NMR resonance assignments of ER(287–305) bound to 13C/15N-labeled CaM were obtained from two-dimensional 13C/15N-filtered (during F1 and F2) NOESY experiments with a 120-ms mixing time. Distance restraints for the structure calculation were obtained from detailed analysis of three-dimensional NOESY spectra (both 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC) recorded at 800 MHz on 15N-labeled and 13C/15N-labeled CaM bound to unlabeled ER(287–305). Using the same samples, 13C-edited (F1) and 13C/15N-filtered (F3) HSQC-NOESY spectra (120-ms mixing time) were recorded to obtain intermolecular NOEs between CaM and the bound ER(287–305). NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (23.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11549) Google Scholar) and analyzed with SPARKY (University of California, San Francisco). For the measurement of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of CaM bound to ER(287–305), the filamentous bacteriophage Pf1 (Asla Biotech Ltd., Latvia) was used as an orienting medium. Pf1 (10–16 mg/ml) was added to 15N-labeled CaM bound to unlabeled ER(287–305) at pH 7.0, to produce weak alignment of the complex. The extent of alignment was checked by measuring the splitting of the deuterium resonance from D2O (∼8 Hz). One-bond HN RDCs were recorded using the in-phase/anti-phase pulse sequence, with 512 complex t1 (15N) points for both the isotropic and anisotropic samples. The alignment tensor components were calculated by the PALES program. All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe package. The NMR structure of CaMN/C lobes bound to ER(287–305) was calculated on the basis of NOE distance restraints and residual dipolar couplings as described previously (17.Ikura M. Clore G.M.

The structure of ER(287–305) in the complex was estimated to be mostly helical based on NOE patterns (HN-HN connectivity) and chemical shift index (27.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. The chemical shift index. A fast and simple method for the assignment of protein secondary structure through NMR spectroscopy.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) and was calculated by Xplor-NIH (28.Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. The Xplor-NIH NMR molecular structure determination package.J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar) using 15 NOE distances, 20 dihedral angles, and 20 hydrogen bond restraints. The NMR structures of CaMN, CaMC, and ER(287–305) were then used as input for a simulated annealing protocol within HADDOCK (29.Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. HADDOCK. A protein-protein docking approach based on biochemical or biophysical information.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar) to calculate the structure of the CaM·ER-α complex using intermolecular NOE restraints (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4) and residual dipolar coupling data (supplemental Fig. S5). The structure calculation protocol consists of three stages as follows: rigid-body docking, semi-flexible simulated annealing, and refinement in explicit solvent as described previously (30.van Dijk M. van Dijk A.D. Hsu V. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. Information-driven protein-DNA docking using HADDOCK: it is a matter of flexibility.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). After rigid body docking, 200 lowest energy structures were selected for semi-flexible refinement using all the NMR experimental restraints above. The structure of ER(287–305) was set as full flexible, and the side chains of CaM that exhibit intermolecular NOEs with ER(287–305) were allowed to move in the semi-flexible annealing stage. The structures were further refined in an explicit solvent including all NMR derived restraints, followed by a final water refinement step. For the CaMN/ER(287–305) calculation, 39 intermolecular NOEs were set as unambiguous restraints. After the final water refinement, the HADDOCK calculation generated a single cluster containing 200 structures (cutoff = 2.5 Å), and the best 10 structures with lowest energy show a root mean squared deviation of 1.0 Å (CaMN). The HN-N residual dipolar couplings were included in the structure refinement, and the ensembles of 10 lowest energy structures generated from the initial simulated annealing (with RDC restraints) were used to calculate the axial and rhombic components of the alignment tensor (Da and Dr) using the PALES program (31.Zweckstetter M. NMR. Prediction of molecular alignment from structure using the PALES software.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The HN-N RDCs (total 34 1DNH RDC values in the structurally rigid region) were introduced in the semi-flexible annealing and water refinement stages as direct restraints (using the SANI statement). Ten structures having lowest energy were selected and went through another stage of refinement using all NMR experimental restraints. The 10 final structures were superimposed with a root mean squared deviation of 0.68 Å (0.70 Å for CaMN and 0.47 Å for ER(287–305)) (see Table 2 for structural statistics). A Ramachandran analysis of the ensemble revealed 80.8% of residues in the most favored regions, 18.8% in allowed regions, and only 1.2% in disallowed regions.TABLE 2Structure statistics for NMR-derived structures of CaM bound to ER(287–305)CaMN/ER-αCaMC/ER-αNMR restraintsShort range NOEs for ER(287–305)1517Dihedral angles for ER(287–305)2020Total intermolecular NOEs39521DHN RDC3438RDC Q-factoraQ-factor = root mean square (r.m.s.)

After the final water refinement, the HADDOCK calculation generated a single cluster containing 200 structures (cutoff = 2.5 Å), the best 10 structures with lowest energy were selected for further RDC refinement using total 38 1DNH RDC values in the structurally rigid region, by following the similar calculation of CaMN/ER(287–305) above. The best 10 structures after RDC refinement show a root mean squared deviation of 0.64 Å (0.61 Å for CaMC and 0.70 Å for ER(287–305)) (see Table 2 for structural statistics). A Ramachandran analysis of the ensemble revealed 93.3% of residues in the most favored regions, 6.7% in allowed regions, and 0% in disallowed regions. Thus, the NMR-derived structures of CaMN and CaMC bound to ER(287–305) both show good convergence and are well defined by the NMR restraints. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. A 0.1-ml aliquot of protein was loaded onto the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Molecular masses were analyzed by analytical size-exclusion chromatography performed in-line with a multiangle light-scattering miniDawn instrument with a 690-nm laser (Wyatt Technologies, Inc.) coupled to refractive index instrument (Optilab Rex, Wyatt Technologies, Inc.). The molar mass of chromatographed protein was calculated from the observed light scattering intensity and differential refractive index (32.Wyatt P.J.

HEK 293H cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and transfected with Myc-tagged ER-α using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following were transfected: wild type ER-α and the mutant ER-α constructs, namely W292A, L296A, K299A, W292A/L296A, W292A/L296A/K299A, and ΔCaM. After 60 h, cells were lysed with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor mixture (Thermo) and 1 mm PMSF. Cell lysates, equalized for total protein, were pre-cleared with 20 μl of glutathione beads at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with 20 μl of CaM-Sepharose at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotator. Complexes were washed five times with buffer A, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. Blots were probed with anti-Myc antibody, and antigen·antibody complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Previous studies suggested CaM binds to ER-α in the hinge domain (residues 248–317) (4.Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. The transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor-α is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13097-13104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We performed ITC binding studies on a variety of hinge domain fragments to define a minimal sequence in ER-α that exhibits functional binding to CaM (Fig. 1, supplemental Fig. S1, and Table 1). The entire hinge domain construct, ER(248–317) (residues 248–317) binds CaM with dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼2 μm, whereas a shorter construct, ER(298–317) reported previously by (4.Li L. Li Z.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13097-13104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) binds CaM with more than 10-fold lower affinity (Table 1). Therefore, ER(298–317) lacks important residue(s) needed for high affinity CaM binding. A slightly modified construct, ER(287–305) (adding 11 residues to the N-terminal end and removing 12 residues from the C terminus), binds to CaM with the same high affinity as ER(248–317) (Table 1). Our deletion analysis reveals that ER(287–305) encompasses the minimum number of residues in ER-α that bind functionally to CaM.TABLE 1ITC parameters for CaM binding to functional fragments of ER-αER(248–317) CaMER(298–317) CaMER(287–305) CaMER(287–305) CaMNER(287–305) CaMCapo·ER(287–552) CaME2·ER(287–552) CaMMolar ratio (CaM/ ER-α)1:21:21:21:11:11:21:2Kd (μm)1.9 ± 0.2>501.5 ± 0.22–51.5 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.3ΔH(kcal/mol)−14.0 ± 0.3−8 ± 4−20.6 ± 0.5−12.1 ± 0.3−8.9 ± 0.2−7.3 ± 0.2−19.9 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Quantitative analysis of the ITC binding data reveals one CaM binds to two molecules of ER(287–305) (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The same 1:2 stoichiometry was observed for CaM binding to the larger constructs, ER(248–317) or ER(287–552) (supplemental Fig. S1). The 1:2 binding suggests the two lobes of CaM (N-lobe and C-lobe) each bind to a separate molecule of ER-α as seen previously for CaM binding to glutamate decarboxylase (34.Yap K.L. Yuan T. Mal T.K. Vogel H.J. Ikura M. Structural basis for simultaneous binding of two carboxyl-terminal peptides of plant glutamate decarboxylase to calmodulin.J. Mol.

Each CaM lobe binds to ER(287–305) with a 1:1 stoichiometry and similar Kd values (Fig. 1, B and C, and Table 1). Also, the ΔH for binding of ER(287–305) to full-length CaM (21 kcal/mol) is equal to the sum of ΔH for binding of ER(287–305) to CaMN (9 kcal/mol) and CaMC (12 kcal/mol).

https://openalex.org/W2041853416,"The CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis plays an important role in human health and disease; however, the molecular mechanisms mediating CXCR4 signaling remain poorly understood. Ubiquitin modification of CXCR4 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 is required for lysosomal sorting and degradation, which is mediated by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. CXCR4 sorting is regulated by an interaction between endosomal localized arrestin-2 and STAM-1, an ESCRT-0 component. Here, we report a novel role for AIP4 and STAM-1 in regulation of CXCR4 signaling that is distinct from their function in CXCR4 trafficking. Depletion of AIP4 and STAM-1 by siRNA caused significant inhibition of CXCR4-induced ERK-1/2 activation, whereas overexpression of these proteins enhanced CXCR4 signaling. We further show that AIP4 and STAM-1 physically interact and that the proline-rich region in AIP4 and the SH3 domain in STAM-1 are essential for the interaction. Overexpression of an AIP4 catalytically inactive mutant and a mutant that shows poor binding to STAM-1 fails to enhance CXCR4-induced ERK-1/2 signaling, as compared with wild-type AIP4, suggesting that the interaction between AIP4 and STAM-1 and the ligase activity of AIP4 are essential for ERK-1/2 activation. Remarkably, a discrete subpopulation of AIP4 and STAM-1 resides in caveolar microdomains with CXCR4 and appears to mediate ERK-1/2 signaling. We propose that AIP4-mediated ubiquitination of STAM-1 in caveolae coordinates activation of ERK-1/2 signaling. Thus, our study reveals a novel function for ubiquitin in the regulation of CXCR4 signaling, which may be broadly applicable to other G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1968203430,"The t(14;18) translocation in follicular lymphoma is one of the most common chromosomal translocations. Breaks in chromosome 18 are localized at the 3'-UTR of BCL2 gene or downstream and are mainly clustered in either the major breakpoint region or the minor breakpoint cluster region (mcr). The recombination activating gene (RAG) complex induces breaks at IgH locus of chromosome 14, whereas the mechanism of fragility at BCL2 mcr remains unclear. Here, for the first time, we show that RAGs can nick mcr; however, the mechanism is unique. Three independent nicks of equal efficiency are generated, when both Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) are present, unlike a single nick during V(D)J recombination. Further, we demonstrate that RAG binding and nicking at the mcr are independent of nonamer, whereas a CCACCTCT motif plays a critical role in its fragility, as shown by sequential mutagenesis. More importantly, we recapitulate the BCL2 mcr translocation and find that mcr can undergo synapsis with a standard recombination signal sequence within the cells, in a RAG-dependent manner. Further, mutation to the CCACCTCT motif abolishes recombination within the cells, indicating its vital role. Hence, our data suggest a novel, physiologically relevant, nonamer-independent mechanism of RAG nicking at mcr, which may be important for generation of chromosomal translocations in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2006197047,"Prostaglandin D synthase (PGDS) is responsible for the conversion of PGH(2) to PGD(2). Two distinct types of PGDS have been identified: hematopoietic-type PGDS (H-PGDS) and lipocalin-type PGDS (L-PGDS). L-PGDS acts as both a PGD(2)-synthesizing enzyme and as an extracellular transporter of various lipophilic small molecules. Although L-PGDS is one of the most abundant proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, little is known about the function of L-PGDS in the central nervous system (CNS). To better understand the role of L-PGDS in the CNS, effects of L-PGDS on the migration and morphology of glial cells were investigated. The L-PGDS protein accelerated the migration of cultured glial cells. Expression of the L-pgds gene was detected in glial cells and neurons. L-PGDS protein also induced morphological changes in glia similar to the characteristic phenotypic changes in reactive gliosis. L-PGDS-induced cell migration was associated with augmented formation of actin filaments and focal adhesion, which was accompanied by activation of AKT, RhoA, and JNK pathways. L-PGDS protein injected into the mouse brain promoted migration and accumulation of astrocytes in vivo. Furthermore, the cell migration-promoting effect of L-PGDS on glial cells was independent of the PGD(2) products. The L-PGDS protein interacted with myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) to promote cell migration. These results demonstrate the critical role of L-PGDS as a secreted lipocalin in the regulation of glial cell migration and morphology. The results also indicate that L-PGDS may participate in reactive gliosis in an autocrine or paracrine manner, and may have pathological implications in neuroinflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1990621832,"Two distinct classes of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are spreading in hospitals (as hospital-acquired MRSA, HA-MRSA) and in the community (as community-acquired MRSA, CA-MRSA). Multilocus sequence type (ST) 239 MRSA, one of the most worldwide-disseminated lineages, has been noted as a representative HA-MRSA. Here, we isolated ST239 MRSA (spa type 3 [t037] and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec [SCCmec] type III.1.1.1) and its novel variant with ST239/spa351 (t030)/SCCmecIII.1.1.4 (SCCmecIII(R)) not only from hospitals but also from patients with urethritis in the community in Russia. The Russian variant (strain 16K) possessed a hybrid genome consisting of CC8 and CC30, similar to the ST239/spa3/SCCmecIII.1.1.1 HA-MRSA (TW20) genome, but with marked diversity. The 16K' CC30 section had SCCmecIII(R) carrying the dcs-carrying unit (which corresponded to the SCCmecIVc J3 joining region of ST30 CA-MRSA), lacked SCCmercury, and possessed a novel mobile element structure (MES16K) carrying the ccrC-carrying unit (with the recombinase gene ccrC1 allele 3) and drug resistance tranposons. The Russian variant included strains with a high ability to transfer its multiple drug resistance by conjugation; e.g., for strain 16K, the transfer frequency of a chloramphenicol resistance plasmid (p16K-1 with 2.9 kb in size) reached 1.4×10(-2), followed by Tn554 conjugative transfer at 3.6×l0(-4). The Russian variant, which has been increasing recently, included divergent strains with different plasmid patterns and pulsed field gel electrophoresis profiles. The data demonstrate the alternative nature of ST239 MRSA as CA-MRSA and also as a drug resistance disseminator, and its micro but dynamic evolution in Russia."
https://openalex.org/W2008877139,"It is now known that the function of the caspase family of proteases is not restricted to effectors of programmed cell death. For example, there is a significant non-apoptotic role for caspase-3 in cell differentiation. Our own studies in the developing lens show that caspase-3 is activated downstream of the canonical mitochondrial death pathway to act as a molecular switch in signaling lens cell differentiation. Importantly, for this function, caspase-3 is activated at levels far below those that induce apoptosis. We now have provided evidence that regulation of caspase-3 for its role in differentiation induction is dependent on the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) survival-signaling pathway. IGF-1R executed this regulation of caspase-3 by controlling the expression of molecules in the Bcl-2 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) families. This effect of IGF-1R was mediated through NFκB, demonstrated here to function as a crucial downstream effector of IGF-1R. Inhibition of expression or activation of NFκB blocked expression of survival proteins in the Bcl-2 and IAP families and removed controls on the activation state of caspase-3. The high level of caspase-3 activation that resulted from inhibiting this IGF-1R/NFκB signaling pathway redirected cell fate from differentiation toward apoptosis.

Caspases play a crucial role in determining the balance between life and death of a cell. Although caspases were originally known as effectors of apoptosis, recent investigations have contributed to a deeper understanding of the full spectrum of caspase function in normal cells, which includes a non-apoptotic signaling role in cell differentiation (1.Maelfait J.

However, the pathways by which caspases execute their non-apoptotic roles in cells are still largely unclear. The non-apoptotic versus apoptotic function of caspase-3 is related directly to its level of activation.

That study shows that a low level of activated caspase-3 generates two fragments of RasGAP. The C-terminal fragment has an apoptosis-promoting function, and the N-terminal fragment has anti-apoptotic properties. A high level of active caspase-3 further cleaves the N-terminal fragment in two, and these fragments together with the C-terminal fragment potentiate a pro-apoptotic pathway (10.Yang J.Y. Widmann C.

Although that study is not related to caspase-3 signaling in differentiation, it set the stage for understanding the importance of regulating the level of activation of caspase-3 for its non-apoptotic functions in the cell. Other studies have since shown such a non-apoptotic function for low level caspase-3 activation in cell differentiation through the limited cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase) (11.Larsen B.D. Megeney L.A. Parole terms for a killer: directing caspase3/CAD induced DNA strand breaks to coordinate changes in gene expression.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This pathway, discovered in skeletal muscle cells, reveals how caspase-3 can signal the initiation of cell differentiation. In this pathway, low level caspase-3 activation cleaves ICAD releasing CAD (caspase-activated DNase) at the low levels required for it to initiate a conserved genomic reprogramming that is required for differentiation initiation (4.Larsen B.D. Rampalli S. Burns L.E. Brunette S. Dilworth F.J. Megeney L.A. Caspase 3/caspase-activated DNase promote cell differentiation by inducing DNA strand breaks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4230-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this instance, the cleavage of the p21 promoter (a critical differentiation regulator) by CAD (4.Larsen B.D. Rampalli S. Burns L.E. Brunette S. Dilworth F.J. Megeney L.A. Caspase 3/caspase-activated DNase promote cell differentiation by inducing DNA strand breaks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Parole terms for a killer: directing caspase3/CAD induced DNA strand breaks to coordinate changes in gene expression.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) induces p21 expression, altering cell fate. This mechanism emphasizes the importance of regulating the level of caspase-3 activity for its non-apoptotic functions in the cell, as high levels of caspase activation induces cell death through this same ICAD/CAD pathway by leading to high levels of CAD release (11.Larsen B.D. Megeney L.A. Parole terms for a killer: directing caspase3/CAD induced DNA strand breaks to coordinate changes in gene expression.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with the non-apoptotic role for caspase-3 in differentiation of the developing lens, its level of activation is far lower than when apoptosis is induced in these cells (3.Weber G.F.

Chem. 2005; 280: 22135-22145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The factors that control the level of caspase activation for cellular processes like differentiation initiation are not known. Our studies here are focused on determining the molecular components of the pathway that regulates the level of caspase-3 activation and makes it possible for this protease to play its non-apoptotic role in signaling differentiation initiation.

In the intrinsic canonical mitochondrial death pathway, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members facilitate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, triggering the “apoptotic” signaling cascade that activates caspase-3 (12.Feinstein-Rotkopf Y. Arama E. Can't live without them, can live with them: roles of caspases during vital cellular processes.Apoptosis. 2009; 14: 980-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The reason that in the developing lens this pathway can signal lens epithelial cells to withdraw from the cell cycle and commit to fiber cell differentiation without causing apoptosis may be linked to the concomitant induction of survival proteins in both the Bcl-2 and IAP families (3.Weber G.F. Menko A.S. The canonical intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway has a non-apoptotic role in signaling lens cell differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22135-22145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), because these survival molecules have the potential to regulate the level of caspase-3 activation. We investigated likely upstream survival signals, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), that have the potential to induce expression of Bcl-2 and IAP survival proteins (13.Mitsiades C.S.

IGF-1R, a classical survival-signaling protein, is highly expressed in the zone of differentiation initiation of the embryonic lens (15.Walker J.L. Zhang L. Zhou J. Woolkalis M.J. Menko A.S.

Dyn. 2002; 223: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to have a role in signaling lens differentiation (16.Beebe D.C. Feagans D.E. Jebens H.A.

Musil L.S. FGF signaling in chick lens development.Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 394-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) is also associated with cell survival signaling and can directly regulate expression of Bcl-2 and IAP family survival proteins (20.Bernal-Mizrachi L. Lovly C.M. Ratner L. The role of NF-κB-1 and NF-κB-2-mediated resistance to apoptosis in lymphomas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although there is as yet little evidence that NFκB activation is a downstream effector of IGF-1R (13.Mitsiades C.S. Mitsiades N. Poulaki V. Schlossman R. Akiyama M. Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Treon S.P. Munshi N.C. Richardson P.G. Anderson K.C.

It plays a critical role in the expression of proteins concerned with development and the immune response, as well as cell survival (21.Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Signaling to NF-κB.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3355) Google Scholar). The prototypical and ubiquitously expressed NFκB complex is the p65/p50 heterodimer, of which the RelA or p65 subunit is indispensable for cell survival (22.Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Embryonic lethality and liver degeneration in mice lacking the RelA component of NF-κB.Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). NFκB remains in the cytoplasm when complexed with the inhibitory protein IκB. In response to an activation stimulus, IκB is degraded leaving NFκB free to translocate to the nucleus and act as a transcription factor for expression of its target genes (21.Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Signaling to NF-κB.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3355) Google Scholar). After release from IκB, NFκB is phosphorylated by PKA, creating the active form of this transcription factor (23.Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 by PKA stimulates transcriptional activity by promoting a novel bivalent interaction with the coactivator CBP/p300.Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). In this study we show that an IGF-1R-regulated NFκB survival signal regulates caspase-3 for its role as a differentiation-inducing signal in the lens, providing the first evidence of the mechanisms that control the level of caspase-3 activation in normal physiological processes. The results reveal that when the IGF-1R/NFκB survival signal is blocked, caspase-3 activation is elevated, blocking initiation of lens epithelial cell differentiation and inducing cell death by apoptosis. Lenses were isolated from embryonic day 10 (E10) chicken eggs (B&E Eggs, York Springs, PA) and microdissected into four distinct regions of differentiation as described previously (24.Leonard M. Chan Y. Menko A.S. Identification of a novel intermediate filament-linked N-cadherin/γ-catenin complex involved in the establishment of the cytoarchitecture of differentiated lens fiber cells.Dev. Biol. 2008; 319: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to yield the central anterior epithelium (EC), the equatorial epithelium (EQ), the cortical fiber zone (FP), and the central fiber zone (FC) (modeled in Fig. 3A). Primary lens cell cultures were prepared as described previously (25.Menko A.S. Klukas K.A. Johnson R.G. Chicken embryo lens cultures mimic differentiation in the lens.Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, lens cells were isolated from E9 quail lenses by trypsinization and agitation. Cells were plated on laminin and cultured in complete medium (medium 199 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin). These primary cultures mimic lens differentiation as it occurs in vivo (15.Walker J.L. Zhang L. Zhou J. Woolkalis M.J. Menko A.S. Role for α6 integrin during lens development: evidence for signaling through IGF-1R and ERK.Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For inhibitor studies these cell cultures were treated with the IGF-1R inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP; 1μm) or the NFκB SN50 inhibitor peptide (18 μm) for 24 h in complete medium. For all inhibitor experiments, control cultures were exposed to 0.1% Me2SO (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Sigma), the vehicle for PPP and the SN50 inhibitor peptide. Embryonic E10 chicken lenses were removed and cleaned free of ciliary body. These lenses were cultured in complete medium, one lens/well in a 24-well plate at 37 °C. For PPP inhibitor studies the lenses were incubated for 2 h prior to the addition of the inhibitor or DMSO for the controls. Any lenses exhibiting damage or opacity at this time point were eliminated from the study. Cells were transfected with custom-made, chicken-specific NFκB p65 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to knock down NFκB p65 expression or with a control ON-TARGETplus non-targeting pool (Dharmacon RNAi Technologies, Thermo Scientific). Before transfection, complete medium was replaced with medium 199 without serum and antibiotics. Cells were exposed overnight at 37 °C to either the NFκB p65 siRNA or the non-silencing siRNA (60 nm) premixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Then, the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated for the rest of the study in complete medium. Cells were extracted in 44.4 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm imidazole containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm H2O2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The concentration of protein was determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For most studies 15 μg of protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE on precast 8–16% Tris/glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). For detection of cl-PARP-1, X-IAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein), p-Bad Ser-112, Bad, and GAPDH in the PPP inhibitor studies, 50 μg was loaded on the gels, and in the SN50 inhibitor and siNFκB p65 knockdown experiments 30 μg was loaded on the gels. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). IGF-1R (C-20), Bcl-XL/S (L-19), Bcl-2 (N-19), NFκB p65 (C-20), p-NFκB p65 Ser-276 (SC-101749), NFκB p50 (SC-114), GAPDH (FL-335), Oct-1 (C-21), survivin (FL-142), p-Bad Ser-112 (sc-7998-R), Bad (C-7), PARP-1/2 (H-250), and c-IAP-1/2 (A-13) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to phospho-IGF-1R (44-806G) and β-actin (A5441) were purchased from Invitrogen and Sigma, respectively. Antibody to cleaved caspase-3 (catalog No. 9664), which recognizes the 17/19-kDa subunit produced by cleavage at Asp-175, was purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Antibody to X-IAP (catalog No. 610716) was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies to filensin and CP49 were generous gifts from Dr. Paul FitzGerald (University of California, Davis). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) were detected using ECL reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ECL Plus reagent (GE Healthcare). Immunoblots were scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed using Eastman Kodak 1D software. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from primary lens cell cultures using the NE-PER cell fractionation kit from Thermo Scientific according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed on extracts of cells from the equatorial region of the lens incubated sequentially at 4 °C with primary antibody to p65 and TrueBlot immunoprecipitation beads from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA). To determine co-immunoprecipitation of p50 with p65, the p65 immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (15.Walker J.L. Zhang L. Zhou J. Woolkalis M.J. Menko A.S. Role for α6 integrin during lens development: evidence for signaling through IGF-1R and ERK.Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and p50 detected using standard Western blot techniques (15.Walker J.L. Zhang L. Zhou J. Woolkalis M.J. Menko A.S. Role for α6 integrin during lens development: evidence for signaling through IGF-1R and ERK.Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For immunostaining, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with a 0.25% Triton X-100 solution. Cells were then incubated sequentially in primary antibody followed by fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). F-actin was localized with Alexa 448-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). Standard phase contrast microscopy was performed with a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope (Optical Apparatus, Ardmore, PA), and images were acquired using Image-ProPlus 6.3 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope. Z-stacks were collected, and then single optical planes (0.5 μm) were selected using the LSM Image Browser. Quantification of caspase-3 activation was performed on digitally acquired confocal images of samples immunostained with an antibody that recognizes the 17-kDa caspase-3 cleavage fragment as biomarker. This antibody does not recognize full-length caspase-3 or any other caspases. Fluorescence intensity profiles were generated across each field of cells using a Zeiss LSM Image Examiner. A cell death detection kit (In Situ Cell Death Detection, TMR red, Roche Applied Science) was used to label the fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells. For the TUNEL assay of cell cultures, the cells were fixed for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde. For the TUNEL assay of tissue sections, E10 chicken lenses were isolated, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and then permeated with a 30% sucrose solution prior to freezing. Cryosections of 20 μm were cut. TUNEL staining was performed in cultured cells and tissue sections according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclei were stained with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). TUNEL and TO-PRO-3 staining was imaged by confocal microscopy. Quantification was performed by analyzing five randomly selected fields from each sample over three independent studies, represented as the percent of total nuclei (stained with TO-PRO-3) that were TUNEL-positive. Annexin V assay was performed to analyze cell death by apoptosis using the Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 (V13241) from Invitrogen. Briefly, 10 μl of annexin V-488 dye was added directly in culture dishes with 1 ml of complete medium and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, according to manufacturer's instruction, prior to live imaging by confocal microscopy. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that a low level of caspase-3 activation is necessary for the induction of lens epithelial cell differentiation (3.Weber G.F. Menko A.S. The canonical intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway has a non-apoptotic role in signaling lens cell differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22135-22145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, there exists very little knowledge as to how caspase-3 can be regulated so that it is activated only to the low level required for its non-apoptotic role in normal developmental processes such as lens differentiation initiation. In the current study we examined whether IGF-1R was a required upstream signal in the pathway that regulates caspase-3 activation in differentiating lens epithelial cells. If so, then in the absence of IGF-1R signaling, caspase-3 activation would be unregulated and would signal cell death instead of differentiation. For this analysis, primary lens cell cultures were treated with the IGF-1R inhibitor PPP (1 μm) or its vehicle, DMSO, prior to differentiation initiation, and the cells were examined after 24 h in the presence of the inhibitor. This IGF-1R inhibitor specifically inhibits phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine residue, Tyr-1136, in the activation loop of IGF-1R preventing its activation with no off-target effects (26.Karasic T.B. Hei T.K. Ivanov V.N. Disruption of IGF-1R signaling increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis: a new potential therapy for the treatment of melanoma.Exp.

Immunoblot analysis confirmed that PPP effectively blocked activation of IGF-1R (phospho-IGF-1R (p-IGF-1R)) (Fig. 1B) with a minimal effect on IGF-1R expression and caused dramatic morphogenetic changes in the primary lens cell cultures (Fig. 1A). To investigate the link between IGF-1R and caspase-3 activation, primary lens cell cultures grown in the presence of the IGF-1R inhibitor PPP for 24 h were analyzed for the level of activation of caspase-3 with an antibody biomarker for cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 1C). This antibody detects endogenous levels of the large fragment (17/19 kDa) of activated caspase-3 resulting from cleavage at Asp-175 and does not bind to either full-length caspase-3 or any other cleaved caspases. These cultures were co-stained with a nuclear marker (TO-PRO-3) and also labeled for F-actin (fluorescent phalloidin). Profiles of fluorescence intensity of caspase-3 activation across a field of cells were generated and quantified using Zeiss LSM Image Examiner (Fig. 1C, i and ii). The results showed that blocking IGF-1R activation induced activation of caspase-3, nuclear condensation, and active remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, all indicators of the induction of apoptosis. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), an enzyme crucial for DNA repair (29.Rios J. Puhalla S. PARP inhibitors in breast cancer: BRCA and beyond.Oncology. 2011; 25: 1014-1025PubMed Google Scholar), is a direct substrate of activated caspase-3. Therefore, its proteolysis is used as a measure of the level of caspase-3 activity (30.D'Amours D. Sallmann F.R. Dixit V.M. Poirier G.G.

The aims of this study were to determine if adenomas and cancers exhibit characteristic patterns of biomarker expression and to explore whether a tissue-discovered (and validated) biomarker is differentially expressed in the plasma of patients with colorectal adenomas or cancer. Methods Candidate RNA biomarkers were identified by oligonucleotide microarray analysis of colorectal specimens (222 normal, 29 adenoma, 161 adenocarcinoma and 50 colitis) and validated in a previously untested cohort of 68 colorectal specimens using a custom-designed oligonucleotide microarray. One validated biomarker, KIAA1199, was assayed using qRT-PCR on plasma extracted RNA from 20 colonoscopy-confirmed healthy controls, 20 patients with adenoma, and 20 with cancer. Results Genome-wide analysis uncovered reproducible gene expression signatures for both adenomas and cancers compared to controls. 386/489 (79%) of the adenoma and 439/529 (83%) of the adenocarcinoma biomarkers were validated in independent tissues. We also identified genes differentially expressed in adenomas compared to cancer. KIAA1199 was selected for further analysis based on consistent up-regulation in neoplasia, previous studies and its interest as an uncharacterized gene. Plasma KIAA1199 RNA levels were significantly higher in patients with either cancer or adenoma (31/40) compared to neoplasia-free controls (6/20). Conclusions Colorectal neoplasia exhibits characteristic patterns of gene expression. KIAA1199 is differentially expressed in neoplastic tissues and KIAA1199 transcripts are more abundant in the plasma of patients with either cancer or adenoma compared to controls."
https://openalex.org/W2152844021,"Genome structural annotation, i.e., identification and demarcation of the boundaries for all the functional elements in a genome (e.g., genes, non-coding RNAs, proteins and regulatory elements), is a prerequisite for systems level analysis. Current genome annotation programs do not identify all of the functional elements of the genome, especially small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). Whole genome transcriptome analysis is a complementary method to identify ""novel"" genes, small RNAs, regulatory regions, and operon structures, thus improving the structural annotation in bacteria. In particular, the identification of non-coding RNAs has revealed their widespread occurrence and functional importance in gene regulation, stress and virulence. However, very little is known about non-coding transcripts in Histophilus somni, one of the causative agents of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) as well as bovine infertility, abortion, septicemia, arthritis, myocarditis, and thrombotic meningoencephalitis. In this study, we report a single nucleotide resolution transcriptome map of H. somni strain 2336 using RNA-Seq method.The RNA-Seq based transcriptome map identified 94 sRNAs in the H. somni genome of which 82 sRNAs were never predicted or reported in earlier studies. We also identified 38 novel potential protein coding open reading frames that were absent in the current genome annotation. The transcriptome map allowed the identification of 278 operon (total 730 genes) structures in the genome. When compared with the genome sequence of a non-virulent strain 129Pt, a disproportionate number of sRNAs (∼30%) were located in genomic region unique to strain 2336 (∼18% of the total genome). This observation suggests that a number of the newly identified sRNAs in strain 2336 may be involved in strain-specific adaptations."
https://openalex.org/W2022879242,"RAD51 mediates homologous recombination by forming an active DNA nucleoprotein filament (NPF). A conserved aspartate that forms a salt bridge with the ATP γ-phosphate is found at the nucleotide-binding interface between RAD51 subunits of the NPF known as the ATP cap. The salt bridge accounts for the nonphysiological cation(s) required to fully activate the RAD51 NPF. In contrast, RecA homologs and most RAD51 paralogs contain a conserved lysine at the analogous structural position. We demonstrate that substitution of human RAD51(Asp-316) with lysine (HsRAD51(D316K)) decreases NPF turnover and facilitates considerably improved recombinase functions. Structural analysis shows that archaebacterial Methanococcus voltae RadA(D302K) (MvRAD51(D302K)) and HsRAD51(D316K) form extended active NPFs without salt. These studies suggest that the HsRAD51(Asp-316) salt bridge may function as a conformational sensor that enhances turnover at the expense of recombinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987395470,"Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), the second most common childhood muscular dystrophy in Japan, is caused by alterations in the fukutin gene. Mutations in fukutin cause abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a cell surface laminin receptor; however, the exact function and pathophysiological role of fukutin are unclear. Although the most prevalent mutation in Japan is a founder retrotransposal insertion, point mutations leading to abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan have been reported, both in Japan and elsewhere. To understand better the molecular pathogenesis of fukutin-deficient muscular dystrophies, we constructed 13 disease-causing missense fukutin mutations and examined their pathological impact on cellular localization and α-dystroglycan glycosylation. When expressed in C2C12 myoblast cells, wild-type fukutin localizes to the Golgi apparatus, whereas the missense mutants A170E, H172R, H186R, and Y371C instead accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein O-mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) also mislocalizes when co-expressed with these missense mutants. The results of nocodazole and brefeldin A experiments suggested that these mutant proteins were not transported to the Golgi via the anterograde pathway. Furthermore, we found that low temperature culture or curcumin treatment corrected the subcellular location of these missense mutants. Expression studies using fukutin-null mouse embryonic stem cells showed that the activity responsible for generating the laminin-binding glycan of α-dystroglycan was retained in these mutants. Together, our results suggest that some disease-causing missense mutations cause abnormal folding and localization of fukutin protein, and therefore we propose that folding amelioration directed at correcting the cellular localization may provide a therapeutic benefit to glycosylation-deficient muscular dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W2033678598,"Aims Preoperative proteinuria is associated with post-operative acute kidney injury (AKI), but whether it is also associated with increased long- term mortality and end -stage renal disease (ESRD) is unknown. Methods and Results We studied 925 consecutive patients undergoing CABG. Demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively, and patients were followed for a median of 4.71 years after surgery. Proteinuria, according to dipstick tests, was defined as mild (trace to 1+) or heavy (2+ to 4+) according to the results of the dipstick test. A total of 276 (29.8%) patients had mild proteinuria before surgery and 119 (12.9%) patients had heavy proteinuria. During the follow-up, the Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that heavy proteinuria (hazard ratio [HR], 27.17) was an independent predictor of long-term ESRD. There was a progressive increased risk for mild proteinuria ([HR], 1.88) and heavy proteinuria ([HR], 2.28) to predict all–cause mortality compared to no proteinuria. Mild ([HR], 2.57) and heavy proteinuria ([HR], 2.70) exhibited a stepwise increased ratio compared to patients without proteinuria for long–term composite catastrophic outcomes (mortality and ESRD), which were independent of the baseline GFR and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that proteinuria is a powerful independent risk factor of long-term all-cause mortality and ESRD after CABG in addition to preoperative GFR and postoperative AKI. Our study demonstrated that proteinuria should be integrated into clinical risk prediction models for long-term outcomes after CABG. These results provide a high priority for future renal protective strategies and methods for post-operative CABG patients."
https://openalex.org/W2094612150,"B cells and humoral immune responses play an important role in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). A characteristic finding in patients with MS is a polyspecific intrathecal B cell response against neurotropic viruses, specifically against measles virus, rubella virus, and varicella zoster virus, also known as an MRZ reaction (MRZR). Here, we correlated from the routine clinical diagnostics individual IgG antibody indices (AIs) of MRZR with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with first MS diagnosis.MRZR was determined in 68 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or early relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Absolute AI values for measles virus, rubella virus, and varicella zoster virus were correlated with T2 lesion load and gadolinium enhancing lesions on cerebral MRI (cMRI) and cMRI combined with spinal MRI (sMRI). Measles virus AI correlated significantly with T2 lesion load on cMRI (p = 0.0312, Mann-Whitney U test) and the sum of lesions on cMRI and sMRI (p = 0.0413). Varicella zoster virus AI also showed a correlation with T2 lesion load on cMRI but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.2893).The results confirm MRZR as part of the polyspecific immune reaction in MS with possible prognostic impact on MRI and clinical parameters. Furthermore, the data indicate that intrathecal measles virus IgG production correlates with disease activity on cMRI and sMRI in patients with early MS."
https://openalex.org/W2031006393,"The GENESIS simulation platform was one of the first broad-scale modeling systems in computational biology to encourage modelers to develop and share model features and components. Supported by a large developer community, it participated in innovative simulator technologies such as benchmarking, parallelization, and declarative model specification and was the first neural simulator to define bindings for the Python scripting language. An important feature of the latest version of GENESIS is that it decomposes into self-contained software components complying with the Computational Biology Initiative federated software architecture. This architecture allows separate scripting bindings to be defined for different necessary components of the simulator, e.g., the mathematical solvers and graphical user interface. Python is a scripting language that provides rich sets of freely available open source libraries. With clean dynamic object-oriented designs, they produce highly readable code and are widely employed in specialized areas of software component integration. We employ a simplified wrapper and interface generator to examine an application programming interface and make it available to a given scripting language. This allows independent software components to be ‘glued’ together and connected to external libraries and applications from user-defined Python or Perl scripts. We illustrate our approach with three examples of Python scripting. (1) Generate and run a simple single-compartment model neuron connected to a stand-alone mathematical solver. (2) Interface a mathematical solver with GENESIS 3.0 to explore a neuron morphology from either an interactive command-line or graphical user interface. (3) Apply scripting bindings to connect the GENESIS 3.0 simulator to external graphical libraries and an open source three dimensional content creation suite that supports visualization of models based on electron microscopy and their conversion to computational models. Employed in this way, the stand-alone software components of the GENESIS 3.0 simulator provide a framework for progressive federated software development in computational neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2053736446,"Memory consolidation for a trained sequence of finger opposition movements, in 9- and 12-year-old children, was recently found to be significantly less susceptible to interference by a subsequent training experience, compared to that of 17-year-olds. It was suggested that, in children, the experience of training on any sequence of finger movements may affect the performance of the sequence elements, component movements, rather than the sequence as a unit; the latter has been implicated in the learning of the task by adults. This hypothesis implied a possible childhood advantage in the ability to transfer the gains from a trained to the reversed, untrained, sequence of movements. Here we report the results of transfer tests undertaken to test this proposal in 9-, 12-, and 17-year-olds after training in the finger-to-thumb opposition sequence (FOS) learning task. Our results show that the performance gains in the trained sequence partially transferred from the left, trained hand, to the untrained hand at 48-hours after a single training session in the three age-groups tested. However, there was very little transfer of the gains from the trained to the untrained, reversed, sequence performed by either hand. The results indicate sequence specific post-training gains in FOS performance, as opposed to a general improvement in performance of the individual, component, movements that comprised both the trained and untrained sequences. These results do not support the proposal that the reduced susceptibility to interference, in children before adolescence, reflects a difference in movement syntax representation after training."
https://openalex.org/W1993311564,"The first structural and biophysical data on the folate biosynthesis pathway enzyme and drug target, 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (SaHPPK), from the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is presented. HPPK is the second essential enzyme in the pathway catalysing the pyrophosphoryl transfer from cofactor (ATP) to the substrate (6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin, HMDP). In-silico screening identified 8-mercaptoguanine which was shown to bind with an equilibrium dissociation constant, K(d), of ∼13 µM as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). An IC(50) of ∼41 µM was determined by means of a luminescent kinase assay. In contrast to the biological substrate, the inhibitor has no requirement for magnesium or the ATP cofactor for competitive binding to the substrate site. The 1.65 Å resolution crystal structure of the inhibited complex showed that it binds in the pterin site and shares many of the key intermolecular interactions of the substrate. Chemical shift and (15)N heteronuclear NMR measurements reveal that the fast motion of the pterin-binding loop (L2) is partially dampened in the SaHPPK/HMDP/α,β-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMPCPP) ternary complex, but the ATP loop (L3) remains mobile on the µs-ms timescale. In contrast, for the SaHPPK/8-mercaptoguanine/AMPCPP ternary complex, the loop L2 becomes rigid on the fast timescale and the L3 loop also becomes more ordered--an observation that correlates with the large entropic penalty associated with inhibitor binding as revealed by ITC. NMR data, including (15)N-(1)H residual dipolar coupling measurements, indicate that the sulfur atom in the inhibitor is important for stabilizing and restricting important motions of the L2 and L3 catalytic loops in the inhibited ternary complex. This work describes a comprehensive analysis of a new HPPK inhibitor, and may provide a foundation for the development of novel antimicrobials targeting the folate biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2000361485,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by tumors of the parathyroid, enteropancreas, and anterior pituitary. The MEN1 gene encodes the tumor suppressor menin of 610 amino acids that has multiple protein partners and activities. The particular pathways that, when lost, lead to tumorigenesis are not known. We demonstrated that members of a three-generation MEN1 kindred are heterozygous for a donor splice site mutation at the beginning of intron 3 (IVS3 + 1G→A). Lymphoblastoid cells of a mutant gene carrier had, in addition to the wild-type menin transcript, an aberrant transcript resulting from use of a cryptic splice site within exon III that splices to the start of exon IV. The predicted menin Δ(184-218) mutant has an in-frame deletion of 35 amino acids but is otherwise of wild-type sequence. The transfected menin Δ(184-218) mutant was well expressed and fully able to mediate the normal inhibition of the activity of the transcriptional regulators JunD and NF-κB. However, it was defective in mediating TGF-β-stimulated Smad3 action in promoter-reporter assays in insulinoma cells. Importantly, lymphoblastoid cells from an individual heterozygous for the mutation had reduced TGF-β-induced (Smad3) transcriptional activity but normal JunD and NF-κB function. In addition, the mutant gene carrier lymphoblastoid cells proliferated faster and were less responsive to the cytostatic effects of TGF-β than cells from an unaffected family member. In conclusion, the menin mutant exhibits selective loss of the TGF-β signaling pathway and loss of cell proliferation control contributing to the development of MEN1."
https://openalex.org/W2075187700,"MenAfriVac is a new conjugate vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A developed for the African ""meningitis belt"". In Niger, the first two phases of the MenAfriVac introduction campaign were conducted targeting 3,135,942 individuals aged 1 to 29 years in the regions of Tillabéri, Niamey, and Dosso, in September and December 2010. We evaluated the campaign and determined which sub-populations or areas had low levels of vaccination coverage in the regions of Tillabéri and Niamey. After Phase I, conducted in the Filingué district, we estimated coverage using a 30×15 cluster-sampling survey and nested lot quality assurance (LQA) analysis in the clustered samples to identify which subpopulations (defined by age 1-14/15-29 and sex) had unacceptable vaccination coverage (<70%). After Phase II, we used Clustered Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (CLQAS) to assess if any of eight districts in Niamey and Tillabéri had unacceptable vaccination coverage (<75%) and estimated overall coverage. Estimated vaccination coverage was 77.4% (95%CI: 84.6-70.2) as documented by vaccination cards and 85.5% (95% CI: 79.7-91.2) considering verbal history of vaccination for Phase I; 81.5% (95%CI: 86.1-77.0) by card and 93.4% (95% CI: 91.0-95.9) by verbal history for Phase II. Based on vaccination cards, in Filingué, we identified both the male and female adult (age 15-29) subpopulations as not reaching 70% coverage; and we identified three (one in Tillabéri and two in Niamey) out of eight districts as not reaching 75% coverage confirmed by card. Combined use of LQA and cluster sampling was useful to estimate vaccination coverage and to identify pockets with unacceptable levels of coverage (adult population and three districts). Although overall vaccination coverage was satisfactory, we recommend continuing vaccination in the areas or sub-populations with low coverage and reinforcing the social mobilization of the adult population."
https://openalex.org/W2011297846,"The 26 S proteasome is a large multi-subunit protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotic cells. Proteasome assembly is a complex process that involves formation of six- and seven-membered ring structures from homologous subunits. Here we report that the assembly of hexameric Rpt ring of the 19 S regulatory particle (RP) requires nucleotide binding but not ATP hydrolysis. Disruption of nucleotide binding to an Rpt subunit by mutation in the Walker A motif inhibits the assembly of the Rpt ring without affecting heterodimer formation with its partner Rpt subunit. Coexpression of the base assembly chaperones S5b and PAAF1 with mutant Rpt1 and Rpt6, respectively, relieves assembly inhibition of mutant Rpts by facilitating their interaction with adjacent Rpt dimers. The mutation in the Walker B motif which impairs ATP hydrolysis does not affect Rpt ring formation. Incorporation of a Walker B mutant Rpt subunit abrogates the ATPase activity of the 19 S RP, suggesting that failure of the mutant Rpt to undergo the conformational transition from an ATP-bound to an ADP-bound state impairs conformational changes in the other five wild-type Rpts in the Rpt ring. In addition, we demonstrate that the C-terminal tails of Rpt subunits possessing core particle (CP)-binding affinities facilitate the cellular assembly of the 19 S RP, implying that the 20 S CP may function as a template for base assembly in human cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the ATP-bound conformational state of an Rpt subunit with the exposed C-terminal tail is competent for cellular proteasome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2078634682,"To establish a simple and quantitative live cell fusion assay for placental syncytialization, we generated stable GFP and dsRed expressing fusogenic BeWo cell lines. Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting was shown to provide a quantitative determination of forskolin (cAMP-mediated) fusion in a time and concentration dependent manner consistent with the increased secretion of beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-HCG) and appearance of multi-nucleated cells. Analyses of the fusion process demonstrated that in addition to increased cAMP levels, simultaneous reduction of intracellular calcium and inhibition of Type 1 phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling also resulted in cell fusion. Although individual blockade of calcium channel function or PI3K/Akt signaling was without effect, the combination with forskolin resulted in a potentiation of cell fusion. These data demonstrate syncytialization is a complex process that depends upon the regulation of distinct signaling inputs that function in concert with each other."
https://openalex.org/W2129683426,"Background Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an inflammatory disease that in some patients leads to exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. In industrialized countries the most common aetiology is chronic alcohol abuse. Descriptions of associated genetic alterations in alcoholic CP are rare. However, a common PNPLA3 variant (p.I148M) is associated with the development of alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC). Since, alcoholic CP and ALC share the same aetiology PNPLA3 variant (p.I148M) possibly influences the development of alcoholic CP. Methods Using melting curve analysis we genotyped the variant in 1510 patients with pancreatitis or liver disease (961 German and Dutch alcoholic CP patients, 414 German patients with idiopathic or hereditary CP, and 135 patients with ALC). In addition, we included in total 2781 healthy controls in the study. Results The previously published overrepresentation of GG-genotype was replicated in our cohort of ALC (p-value <0.0001, OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6–3.3). Distributions of genotype and allele frequencies of the p.I148M variant were comparable in patients with alcoholic CP, idiopathic and hereditary CP and in healthy controls. Conclusions The absence of an association of PNPLA3 p.I148M with alcoholic CP seems not to point to a common pathway in the development of alcoholic CP and alcoholic liver cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W2009342261,"Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) belongs to the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors. ATF2 regulates target gene expression by binding to the cyclic AMP-response element as a homodimer or a heterodimer with c-Jun. Cytoplasmic localization of ATF2 was observed in melanoma, brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer disease, prostate cancer specimens, and ionizing radiation-treated prostate cancer cells, suggesting that alteration of ATF2 subcellular localization may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We previously demonstrated that ATF2 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and it contains two nuclear localization signals in the basic region and one nuclear export signal (NES) in the leucine zipper domain (named LZ-NES). In the present study, we demonstrate that a hydrophobic stretch in the N terminus, (1)MKFKLHV(7), also functions as an NES (termed N-NES) in a chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent manner. Mutation of both N-NES and LZ-NES results in a predominant nuclear localization, whereas mutation of each individual NES only partially increases the nuclear localization. These results suggest that cytoplasmic localization of ATF2 requires function of at least one of the NESs. Further, mutation of N-NES enhances the transcriptional activity of ATF2, suggesting that the novel NES negatively regulates the transcriptional potential of ATF2. Thus, ATF2 subcellular localization is probably modulated by multiple mechanisms, and further understanding of the regulation of ATF2 subcellular localization under various pathological conditions will provide insight into the pathophysiological role of ATF2 in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1993715276,"Background The parameters RN (Newtonian resistance), G (tissue damping), and H (tissue elastance) of the constant phase model of respiratory mechanics provide information concerning the site of altered mechanical properties of the lung. The aims of this study were to compare the site of allergic airway narrowing implied from respiratory mechanics to a direct assessment by morphometry and to evaluate the effects of exogenous surfactant administration on the site and magnitude of airway narrowing. Methods We induced airway narrowing by ovalbumin sensitization and challenge and we tested the effects of a natural surfactant lacking surfactant proteins A and D (Infasurf®) on airway responses. Sensitized, mechanically ventilated Brown Norway rats underwent an aerosol challenge with 5% ovalbumin or vehicle. Other animals received nebulized surfactant prior to challenge. Three or 20 minutes after ovalbumin challenge, airway luminal areas were assessed on snap-frozen lungs by morphometry. Results At 3 minutes, RN and G detected large airway narrowing whereas at 20 minutes G and H detected small airway narrowing. Surfactant inhibited RN at the peak of the early allergic response and ovalbumin-induced increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cysteinyl leukotrienes and amphiregulin but not IgE-induced mast cell activation in vitro. Conclusion Allergen challenge triggers the rapid onset of large airway narrowing, detected by RN and G, and subsequent peripheral airway narrowing detected by G and H. Surfactant inhibits airway narrowing and reduces mast cell-derived mediators."
https://openalex.org/W2071062638,"In the absence of its cofactor tissue factor (TF), coagulation factor VIIa (FVIIa) predominantly exists in a zymogen-like, catalytically incompetent state. Here we demonstrate that conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be used to characterize structural features determining the activity of FVIIa. We isolated two classes of mAbs, which both increased the catalytic efficiency of FVIIa more than 150-fold. The effects of the antibodies were retained with a FVIIa variant, which has been shown to be inert to allosteric activation by the natural activator TF, suggesting that the antibodies and TF employ distinct mechanisms of activation. The antibodies could be classified into two groups based on their patterns of affinities for different conformations of FVIIa. Whereas one class of antibodies affected both the K(m) and k(cat), the other class mainly affected the K(m). The antibody-induced activity enhancement could be traced to maturation of the S1 substrate binding pocket and the oxyanion hole, evident by an increased affinity for p-aminobenzamidine, an increased rate of antithrombin inhibition, an increased rate of incorporation of diisopropylfluorophosphate, and an enhanced fraction of molecules with a buried N terminus of the catalytic domain in the presence of antibodies. As demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis, the two groups of antibodies appear to have overlapping, although clearly different, epitopes in the 170-loop. Our findings suggest that binding of ligands to specific residues in the 170-loop or its spatial vicinity may stabilize the S1 pocket and the oxyanion hole, and they may have general implications for the molecular understanding of FVIIa regulatory mechanisms."
