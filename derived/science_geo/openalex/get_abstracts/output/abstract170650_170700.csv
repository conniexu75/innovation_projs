https://openalex.org/W2036386995,"α-Synuclein is a major component of the fibrillary lesion known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that are the pathologic hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, point mutations in the α-synuclein gene imply α-synuclein dysfunction in the pathology of inherited forms of PD. α-Synuclein is a member of a family of proteins found primarily in the brain and is concentrated within presynaptic terminals. Here, we address the localization and membrane binding characteristics of wild type and PD mutants of α-synuclein in cultured cells. In cells treated with high concentrations of fatty acids, wild type α-synuclein accumulated on phospholipid monolayers surrounding triglyceride-rich lipid droplets and was able to protect stored triglycerides from hydrolysis. PD mutant synucleins showed variable distributions on lipid droplets and were less effective in regulating triglyceride turnover. Chemical cross-linking demonstrated that synuclein formed small oligomers within cells, primarily dimers and trimers, that preferentially associated with lipid droplets and cell membranes. Our results suggest that the initial phases of synuclein aggregation may occur on the surfaces of membranes and that pathological conditions that induce cross-linking of synuclein may enhance the propensity for subsequent synuclein aggregation. α-Synuclein is a major component of the fibrillary lesion known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that are the pathologic hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD).

In neurons that remain, abnormal filamentous aggregates called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites serve as neuropathological hallmarks of the disease (1Forno L.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

In addition to PD, α-synuclein has also been found within intracellular inclusions from a diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders, thus implicating α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of an expanding spectrum of diseases characterized as α-synucleinopathies (8Spillantini M.G.

Anokhin K.V. Saha A.R. Schmidt O. Hanger D.P. Anderton B.H. Davies A.M. Ninkina N.N. Buchman V.L. Mech. Dev. 2000; 99: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Buchman V.L. Hunter H.J.

Although α- and β-synuclein share considerable sequence similarity, only α-synuclein is found in the fibrillar lesions diagnostic of the synucleinopathies (9Galvin J.E. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Arch. Neurol. 2001; 58: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). All synuclein members share a common structural design, with the first two-thirds of the sequence organized within a series of amphipathic domains that may facilitate membrane binding (20George J.M.

Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar) and yet adopt structures rich in α-helical character upon binding to synthetic lipid membranes containing acidic phospholipids (21Davidson W.S.

Whether synucleins display these same membrane-binding properties within living cells is not clear. For example, when α-synuclein is expressed in cultured cells, it displays a predominantly cytosolic distribution under normal conditions (25Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Mackowski B. Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although a close association between synuclein and membranes has been observed in the cell bodies of transfected neurons (27McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Ribich S. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8812-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The ability of α-synuclein to associate with membranes destined for the neuronal synapse may therefore require specific lipid compositions or neuron-specific membrane-binding partners. To investigate the membrane binding capacity of α-synuclein within cells, we examined the distribution of wild type and PD mutant synucleins in both immortalized cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. We found that in cells loaded with high concentrations of fatty acids, wild type synuclein redistributed from the cytosol to the surface of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets. The PD mutant synuclein A53T (3Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A.

Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6734) Google Scholar) also redistributed to lipid droplets, whereas the PD mutant A30P (4Kruger R. Kuhn W. Muller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M. Kosel S. Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar) remained cytosolic. Lipid droplets exist in a variety of cell types and consist of a core of neutral lipid (triglycerides and cholesterol esters) surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer originally derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (28Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 29van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: F29-F34Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Their surfaces are covered with proteins including the perilipins in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells, and adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP) in other cells types (30Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brasaemle D.L.

These proteins protect the core lipids from hydrolysis by soluble intracellular lipases (32Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev.

Similarly, we found that the binding of wild type synuclein to lipid droplet surfaces altered subsequent triglyceride metabolism, whereas the expression of PD mutant synucleins had little effect. We also analyzed the conformation of α-synuclein from cells and cell extracts using a variety of cross-linking reagents. We found that α-synuclein exists mainly as small molecular weight oligomers (primarily dimers and trimers) that preferentially bound to cellular membranes. Our results suggest that the structural alterations that occur upon binding of α-synuclein to membranes may prime its oligomerization to form potentially toxic intermediates or progress into synuclein fibrils observed in brains of patients with various synucleinopathies. Human wild type as well as PD mutant synucleins were cloned into the expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Human β- and γ-synucleins were amplified by PCR from a brain cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and cloned into the expression vector pTARGET (Promega, Madison, WI). Various chimeric synuclein molecules were generated by standard PCR techniques. For expression in bacteria, wild type and PD mutant synucleins were cloned into the NcoI-XhoI site of pET41a (Novagen, Madison, WI). To generate full-length synucleins without the GST peptide, the vector was digested withNdeI-NcoI, blunt-ended, and religated by standard procedures. Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria and purified according to Jakes et al. (11Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Antibodies to synucleins included anti-α-synuclein monoclonal antibodies 202 (used 1/100, (34Giasson B.I. Jakes R. Goedert M. Duda J.E. Leight S. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci.

Cross-linking agents DSP, DMP, DMA, DTBP, and BS3 were from Pierce. Complete tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used as a source of protease inhibitors. All other reagents were from Sigma. Semi-purified bovine hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was a kind gift from Dr. Carol Sztalryd (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All cell lines used in this study were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were transiently transfected either by using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or by calcium phosphate precipitation. Stable 293 cell lines were selected in G418 but were routinely cultured following selection in its absence without loss of expression. Primary hippocampal neurons were dissociated from fetal rat brains and cultured as described (16Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of transgenic mice expressing human wild type and A53T mutant synuclein will be described elsewhere. 2S. Gispert, G.

For lipid loading, oleic acid was complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at a ratio of 6 mol of oleic acid/mol of albumin according to Braselme et al. (33Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B.

Cells were incubated overnight to increase the synthesis and storage of triglyceride. Cells were fixed and processed for immunohistochemistry as described (35Cole N.B. Ellenberg J. Song J. DiEuliis D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Lipid droplets were identified using the fluorescent neutral lipid dye BODIPY 493/503 (36Gocze P.M. Freeman D.A. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope, using either a 40× Plan-Neofluor objective (NA 1.3) or a 100× Plan-Apochromat objective (NA 1.4), and were processed as described (35Cole N.B. Ellenberg J. Song J. DiEuliis D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Triglyceride turnover was measured according to Brasaemle et al. (33Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Briefly, control 293 cells or cells stably expressing wild type or PD mutant synucleins were plated into poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well dishes (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) and grown until subconfluent. 300 μm [3H]oleic acid (5 Ci/mmol, 1 μCi/well) complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was added to cells in serum-containing medium for 16 h to generate a labeled pool of triglyceride. The medium was removed, and 6 μmtriacsin C (from a 1 mg/ml stock in Me2SO) was added in fresh culture medium without supplemental fatty acids to inhibit the reutilization of fatty acids released from hydrolyzed triglycerides (33Brasaemle D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for various periods of time, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested by gentle lifting of the cells from the dish into 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes. The cells were briefly pelleted at 800 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and an aliquot taken for protein determination by BCA assay (Pierce). The remaining samples were placed into glass vials, and the cellular lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (38Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Incorporation of radioactivity into triglycerides was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6800) of silica gel bands containing triglycerides. [3H]Oleic acid incorporated into triglycerides was expressed relative to total cellular protein. A paired Student's t test was used to assess differences in triglyceride turnover between synuclein expressing and control cells. The in vitro hydrolysis of [3H]triolein by HSL was based on Holm and Osterlund (39Holm C. Osterlund T. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 109-121PubMed Google Scholar). For each 4 ml of substrate, 5.9 mg of triolein, including 50 μCi of [3H]triolein (1.25 μCi/reaction) and 0.6 mg of phospholipid (either phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylinositol (3:1) or phosphatidylcholine alone), were mixed in a glass vial and evaporated using a gentle stream of nitrogen and processed according to Holm and Osterlund (39Holm C. Osterlund T. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 109-121PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments using gum arabic instead of phospholipids, the initial 2 ml of potassium phosphate was replaced by 2 ml of 5% gum arabic in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, according to Khoo and Steinberg (40Khoo J.C. Steinberg D. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In experiments using recombinant synuclein, the substrate was preincubated for 15 min on ice with synuclein prior to adding semi-purified HSL. The extent of triolein hydrolysis was expressed as the number of nmol of free fatty acid released per hour. Cross-linking was performed either in intact cells or in post nuclear supernatants (PNS) from cells expressing the various synucleins. Cells were grown in 6-well dishes until confluent. Cells were rinsed with PBS, gently lifted from the dishes, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, .25 m sucrose) containing protease inhibitors. For generation of a PNS, cells were broken by 12 passages through a 28-gauge syringe. Cells were centrifuged at 500 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C to pellet intact cells and nuclei, and the supernatant was collected. Specific cross-linkers were added at various concentrations, and the cells or PNS were incubated for 1–3 h on ice. To terminate the cross-linking reaction, glycine was added (100 mm final concentration) and incubated for 15 min on ice. SDS sample buffer, with or without 100 mm dithiothreitol, was then added directly to the cross-linked samples. Samples were boiled for 5 min then loaded onto gels for SDS-PAGE. To separate lipid droplets and total cell membranes from cytosol, postnuclear supernatants were prepared in buffer A as described above. The PNS was brought to 55% (w/v) sucrose (1.2 ml final) and overlaid with 2 ml of 45% (w/v) sucrose in buffer A and then with 2 ml of buffer A (8% sucrose). Centrifugation was performed in an SW55 rotor for 4.5 h at 265,000 × g at 4 °C. A tube slicer (Beckman Instruments) was used to collect lipid droplets that float to the tops of the tubes. Nine equivalent fractions were sequentially collected and analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of synuclein as well as for organelle-specific markers. It was determined that the lipid droplet marker, ADRP, fractionated only to the top of the gradient (fraction 1), whereas the endoplasmic reticulum marker, calnexin (as well as markers for the Golgi complex, lysosomes, and plasma membrane), fractionated only to the 45/8% sucrose interface (fraction 4). Neither ADRP nor calnexin (nor other membrane markers) appeared in the cytosolic fraction (fraction 9). Thus we routinely collected and analyzed only fractions 1 (lipid droplets), 4 (total cell membranes), and 9 (cytosol). For the purification and concentration of lipid droplets, material from fraction 1 was brought to 20% sucrose and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The infranatant was carefully removed and discarded. For the purification of total cell membranes, material collected from fraction 4 was diluted 4-fold in PBS and then pelleted through a 20% (w/v) sucrose-PBS cushion at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA 100.4 rotor. Membranes were resuspended in buffer A for synuclein binding experiments. To investigate the specificity of α-synuclein/membrane interactions in cultured cells, we expressed wild type α-synuclein and the PD mutant synucleins A53T and A30P in HeLa cells. Wild type and PD mutant synucleins displayed primarily cytosolic distributions, although plasma membrane staining was often observed for wild type and A53T synucleins (Fig.1, a–c). In some cells, staining for wild type and A53T synucleins also showed a ring-like appearance around phase dense structures that when labeled with the neutral lipid dye BODIPY493/503 were identified as intracellular lipid droplets (Fig. 1 a, inset). To confirm this identity, cells were incubated overnight with 300 μm oleic acid. Under these conditions, free fatty acids are esterified and stored almost exclusively as triglyceride-rich lipid droplets (38Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Wild type and A53T synucleins showed a dramatic reorganization from the cytosol to the surfaces of the droplets, forming distinct rings around the core neutral lipid (Fig. 1,d and f). There was also an increase in reticular staining characteristic of the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope from which lipid droplets are derived (29van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: F29-F34Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The PD mutant A30P showed no lipid droplet binding (Fig. 1 e), consistent with previous results suggesting the A30P mutation reduces the ability of synuclein to bind membranes (41Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Approximately 30–50% of transfected HeLa cells showed this reorganization upon lipid loading, whereas in transfected normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, this value was 80–100%. Interestingly, a higher percentage of HeLa cells expressing A53T synuclein showed lipid droplet binding (∼40–70%) compared with wild type, suggesting this PD mutant has a higher affinity for these lipid surfaces. The associations of the various synucleins with lipid droplets was independent of expression levels but could be saturated, resulting in additional cytosolic staining in highly expressing cells. Lipid droplet binding was conferred by the amphipathic domains of synuclein, since removal of the C-terminal 40 amino acids had no effect on its capacity to bind to lipid droplets (data not shown). In addition, appending an acidic FLAG epitope tag onto the N terminus of synuclein completely abrogated lipid droplet binding, whereas no effect was observed when FLAG was attached to the C terminus of synuclein (data not shown). Primary hippocampal neurons from transgenic mice expressing wild type or A53T human synuclein also demonstrated this phenomenon (Fig.2 A, left panel), which mimicked the distribution of the ubiquitously expressed lipid droplet binding-protein, ADRP (Fig. 2 A, right panel). Thus, although neurons generally do not accumulate high levels of triglycerides (42Deutsch J.W. Kelly R.B. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), wild type and A53T synucleins have the capacity to reorganize around lipid droplets in neurons under experimentally induced conditions. Interestingly, β-synuclein also bound to lipid droplets in lipid-loaded HeLa (and NRK) cells, whereas γ-synuclein remained cytosolic (Fig. 2 B). This was not due to γ-synuclein's shorter C terminus, since appending the C-terminal 14 amino acids of α-synuclein onto the C terminus of γ-synuclein did not result in lipid droplet binding (data not shown). To assess what consequence, if any, synuclein binding may have on the metabolism of lipid droplets, HeLa cells were transfected with the various synuclein constructs and lipid-loaded as above. Cells were then washed free of the oleic acid and allowed to hydrolyze the stored triglyceride. After an overnight incubation in complete medium free of excess fatty acids, cells expressing wild type synuclein retained higher levels of neutral lipid staining than either of the PD mutants (Fig. 1, g–i). This finding suggests that binding of wild type synuclein to the surface of lipid droplets reduces the hydrolysis of stored triglycerides, whereas both of the PD mutants, including the A53T mutant that binds to lipid droplets, cannot. Similarly, wild type human synuclein, but not the A53T mutant, protected lipid droplets from turnover in primary hippocampal neurons from transgenic mice (data not shown). Thus, the reduction of triglyceride turnover by wild type synuclein is not a particular property of transformed cells. Wild type synuclein apparently slowed but did not stop the rate of lipolysis, because all cells eventually metabolized their stored triglycerides. Interestingly, not all cells expressing wild type synuclein showed this protection. To gain quantitative information on the effect of wild type and mutant synucleins on triglyceride metabolism, we generated human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines stably expressing wild type and PD mutant synucleins. Similar to what was observed in HeLa cells, these cell lines showed the differential capacity of wild type versusPD synucleins to bind lipid droplets as well as to protect lipid droplet turnover when assayed with the neutral lipid dye BODIPY 493/503 (data not shown). The different cell lines were incubated overnight with [3H]oleic acid in the presence of 300 μm cold oleic acid to generate a pool of labeled triglyceride. Supplemental fatty acids were removed, and chase medium containing triacsin C was added to the cells to"
https://openalex.org/W2119043221,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is an important component of vascular homeostasis. During vascular disease, endothelial cells are exposed to excess reactive oxygen species that can alter cellular phenotype by inducing various signaling pathways. In the current study, we examined the implications of H(2)O(2)-induced signaling for eNOS phosphorylation status and activity in porcine aortic endothelial cells. We found that H(2)O(2) treatment enhanced eNOS activity and NO bioactivity as determined by the conversion of l-[(3)H]arginine to l-[(3)H]citrulline and cellular cGMP content. Concomitant with eNOS activation, H(2)O(2) also activated Akt, increased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177, and decreased eNOS phosphorylation at Thr-495. H(2)O(2)-induced promotion of eNOS activity and modulation of the eNOS phosphorylation status at Ser-1177 and Thr-495 were significantly attenuated by selective inhibitors of Src kinase, the ErbB receptor family, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K). We found that Akt activation, eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation, and eNOS activation by H(2)O(2) were calcium-dependent, whereas eNOS dephosphorylation at Thr-495 was not, suggesting a branch point in the signaling cascade downstream from PI 3-K. Consistent with this, overexpression of a dominant negative isoform of Akt inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 but not dephosphorylation of eNOS at Thr-495. Together, these data indicate that H(2)O(2) promotes calcium-dependent eNOS activity through a coordinated change in the phosphorylation status of the enzyme mediated by Src- and ErbB receptor-dependent PI 3-K activation. In turn, PI 3-K mediates eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation via a calcium- and Akt-dependent pathway, whereas eNOS Thr-495 dephosphorylation does not involve calcium or Akt. This response may represent an attempt by endothelial cells to maintain NO bioactivity under conditions of enhanced oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2049793641,"Classical cadherins mediate cell recognition and cohesion in many tissues of the body. It is increasingly apparent that dynamic cadherin contacts play key roles during morphogenesis and that a range of cell signals are activated as cells form contacts with one another. It has been difficult, however, to determine whether these signals represent direct downstream consequences of cadherin ligation or are juxtacrine signals that are activated when cadherin adhesion brings cell surfaces together but are not direct downstream targets of cadherin signaling. In this study, we used a functional cadherin ligand (hE/Fc) to directly test whether E-cadherin ligation regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Rac signaling. We report that homophilic cadherin ligation recruits Rac to nascent adhesive contacts and specifically stimulates Rac signaling. Adhesion to hE/Fc also recruits PI 3-kinase to the cadherin complex, leading to the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in nascent cadherin contacts. Rac activation involved an early phase, which was PI 3-kinase-independent, and a later amplification phase, which was inhibited by wortmannin. PI 3-kinase and Rac activity were necessary for productive adhesive contacts to form following initial homophilic ligation. We conclude that E-cadherin is a cellular receptor that is activated upon homophilic ligation to signal through PI 3-kinase and Rac. We propose that a key function of these cadherin-activated signals is to control adhesive contacts, probably via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which ultimately serves to mediate adhesive cell-cell recognition.

We propose that a key function of these cadherin-activated signals is to control adhesive contacts, probably via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which ultimately serves to mediate adhesive cell-cell recognition. Classical cadherin molecules are critical morphogenetic determinants in metazoan organisms (1Takeichi M. Current Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 2Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). E-cadherin, the prototypical epithelial cadherin, participates in tissue patterning during development and preserves epithelial organization in postembryonic life. In addition to mediating cell-cell cohesion in mature epithelia, E-cadherin has a clear role in cell-to-cell recognition. E-cadherin-expressing cells sort out from tissue culture cells that express different cadherins, while changes in cadherin expression determine tissue segregation in the embryo (1Takeichi M. Current Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). E-cadherin, like other classical cadherins, therefore plays a central role in determining how cells discriminate like from unlike. At the cellular level, there is increasing evidence that E-cadherin ligation initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events that ultimately determine cellular recognition. Conversion of initial homophilic ligation to productive, stable cell-cell adhesion appears to constitute a key step in this recognition process. Studies in migrating cells have shown that E-cadherin-expressing cells make nascent contacts with one another through punctate cadherin contacts (3Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Smith S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Adams C.L. Chen Y.-T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J.

Productive stabilization of adhesion is distinguished by the extension of these contact zones, leading cells to persist in coherent aggregates with altered migratory activity. Cells that fail to stabilize these initial contacts separate from one another and continue to migrate. Furthermore, a number of cellular mechanisms with the potential to mediate adhesive stabilization have been identified as downstream consequences of cadherin ligation. These include lateral clustering of cadherin molecules (7Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr.

Taken together, these observations raised the attractive possibility that E-cadherin binding may activate signaling pathways to coordinate the cellular cascade that leads from homophilic recognition to productive adhesion. In its simplest form, it is attractive to envisage a scenario where E-cadherin acts as a direct upstream receptor for intracellular signals that ultimately act on the effector mechanisms responsible for adhesive stabilization.

Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 14Fagotto F. Gumbiner B.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This distinction has fundamental mechanistic implications for any model of cadherin signaling. For example, gap junction communication requires E-cadherin to bring cell surfaces into contact (15Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), but connexins do not interact directly with cadherins. Ultimately, any mechanistic characterization of cadherin signaling must determine whether responses to cell-cell contact represent direct cadherin-activated signals or cadherin-dependent juxtacrine signals. Nor has it yet been determined whether cadherin-dependent signaling impacts on cell adhesion. Although PI 3-kinase and Rho GTPases have potent effects on the actin cytoskeleton, these signals exert diverse effects on cell behavior, including effects on cell growth and apoptosis, that are independent of adhesion. In the current report, we therefore aimed to test directly whether E-cadherin functions as an upstream receptor for Rac GTPase signaling and to define its functional significance for cell adhesion. To accomplish this, we developed an assay that allowed us to specifically engage E-cadherin homophilic ligation and determine its effects on cell signaling, adhesion, and cell shape. hE-CHO cells were made by stably transfecting a plasmid expressing full-length human E-cadherin (a kind gift of Dr. Cara Gottardi, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) and selecting for transfectants with 0.5 mg/ml G418. Parental CHO and hE-CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. To inhibit PI 3-kinase activity, cells were preincubated for 45 min with wortmannin (60 nm) or LY294002 (100 μm); inhibitors were maintained for the duration of the experiments. hE/Fc was purified by protein A affinity chromatography from conditioned media of CHO cells stably expressing a secreted protein consisting of the complete extracellular region of human E-cadherin fused to the Fc region of IgG (a kind gift of Drs. Carien Niessen and Barry Gumbiner, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). For storage, protein samples were buffer-exchanged into calcium-containing storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Coverslips and glass capillaries were coated with hE/Fc (50 μg/ml) and blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 5 mmCaCl2 (HBSS/Ca). For assays, parental CHO and hE-CHO cells were isolated with 0.01% (w/v) crystalline trypsin (Sigma) in HBSS/Ca. To assess adhesive activity, we utilized a previously described laminar flow assay that measures adhesion as resistance to detachment by wall shear stress under laminar flow conditions (7Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In brief, freshly isolated cells were infused into glass capillaries coated with hE/Fc and allowed to attach to the inner surface of the capillary for 15 min under stasis. Cells were then subjected to progressively increasing buffer flow rates delivered by a syringe pump (Harvard Instruments). Flow rates were increased at 1-min intervals, and the number of cells remaining attached after each interval was counted by phase-contrast microscopy and expressed as a percentage of the initial number of cells attached. To assess contact formation, freshly isolated cells were seeded onto hE/Fc-coated coverslips at a density prohibiting cell-cell contact. Spreading was quantitated by phase-contrast microscopy, expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted, and normalized to the positive controls (hE-CHO cells adherent to hE/Fc). Cells were classed as spread if they were phase gray and possessed dominant lamellipodia. Wild-type and mutant Rac1 constructs were generously provided by Dr. A. Hall (MRC Laboratory of Cell Biology), Dr. N. Hotchin (University of Birmingham), and Dr. K. Weber (Institute fur Prophylaxie, Munich). The mutant transgenes (17Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L.

GFP-p85 was a kind gift of Dr. William Gullick (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London), GFP-tK a gift from Dr. John Hancock (University of Queensland), while the GFP-Grp1-PH and GFP-dynamin 1-PH constructs were generously shared by Dr. Mark Lemmon (University of Pennsylvania). All plasmids were expressed by transient transfection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were assayed 24 h after transfection. Primary antibodies were as follows: 1) mouse monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of human E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories); 2) mouse monoclonal antibody HECD-1 against the extracellular domain of human E-cadherin (a kind gift from Drs. M. Takeichi and M. Wheelock); 3) rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against β-catenin (generously provided by Dr. B. Gumbiner); 4) mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 directed against the Myc epitope tag; 5) rabbit polyclonal antibody against the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.); 6) rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against GFP (a kind gift of Dr. J. Hancock, University of Queensland); and 7) rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against Akt and phospho-Akt (New England Biochemicals). F-actin was identified using Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h and permeabilized for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% Triton X-100. Samples were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk (in phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies, with extensive washes between antibody incubations. Coverslips were mounted in 50% glycerol, 1%n-propyl-gallate in PBS and viewed using a Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal microscope, Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal microscope, or Olympus AX70 microscope and Hamamatsu Orca camera using Metamorph imaging software. Images were assembled for presentation in Adobe Photoshop. For co-immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 (plus 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), immunoprecipitated with HECD-1 bound to Protein G beads, and blotted for E-cadherin, β-catenin, or p85. Akt activation was measured by a modification of established methods (19Jaumot M. Yan J. Clyde-Smith J. Sluimer J. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 272-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In brief, postnuclear supernatants of cell lysates were collected after low speed centrifugation and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min and separated into cytosolic (S100) and membrane-enriched (P100) fractions. Akt was immunoprecipitated from the P100 fraction; complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for either Akt or phospho-Akt. The PAK-CRIB GST fusion construct (a kind gift from Drs. J. Chernoff and M. Symons) was expressed in DH5α Escherichia coli and isolated with glutathione-agarose (Scientifix). Bacteriological plates were coated with 5 ml of nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) dissolved in methanol (1 cm2 in 30 ml) and air-dried. Membrane-covered plates were coated with hE/Fc, poly-l-lysine, or BSA only. Cells were trypsinized in the presence of calcium and sparsely seeded onto the coated plates. At various times after adhesion, cells were scraped from the plates, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed on ice in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) protease inhibitors). 20–50 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose was added to each sample and incubated for 2–3 h. The beads were washed, and associated proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-Rac mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Densitometric analyses were performed using Scion Image software. Bands of GTP·Rac were compared with those of corresponding total cellular Rac blots and normalized to the base-line values (at t = 0 min in each assay). To identify cellular events that arose as specific responses to cadherin adhesive ligation, we utilized a recombinant protein (hE/Fc) consisting of the complete ectodomain of human E-cadherin fused to the Fc region of IgG. Substrata adsorbed with hE/Fc supported cadherin-specific adhesion and contact formation (Figs.1, 4, and 5). CHO cells stably expressing E-cadherin (hE-CHO cells) adhered robustly to glass capillaries coated with hE/Fc, as assessed in laminar flow adhesion assays, which measure the resistance of cells to detachment forces (Fig. 4 A). Adhesion of hE-CHO cells was inhibited by cadherin-blocking antibodies as well as by depletion of extracellular calcium, 2Kovacs, E. M., Goodwin, M., Ali, R. G., Paterson, A. D., and Yap, A.S.

Data are means ± S.E. (n = 3). B–D, wortmannin inhibits cadherin-based cell spreading and lamellipodia formation.

Cells were incubated in the presence (insets) or absence of wortmannin (60 nm). D, phase-contrast microscopy was used to quantitate the spreading of hE-CHO and parental CHO cells on hE/Fc- or BSA-coated substrata in the presence or absence of wortmannin (60 nm). Spreading was expressed as the percentage of attached cells that had formed cadherin-based lamellipodia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5E-cadherin ligation recruits PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane.

Cadherin-negative parental CHO cells (P-CHO) were lysed from monolayers. E-cadherin immunoprecipitates and whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted for E-cadherin, β-catenin, or the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase.B, PI 3-kinase signaling is activated at the plasma membrane upon cadherin adhesive ligation. hE-CHO cells were allowed to attach to hE-Fc or to PLL for 0–30 min. Akt was immunoprecipitated from a plasma membrane-enriched (P100) fraction isolated from cell lysates by differential centrifugation. Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for Akt and phospho-Akt (pAkt). Data are representative of three separate experiments. C–F, GFP-p85 localizes at the leading edges of cadherin-based lamellipodia. hE-CHO cells transiently transfected with GFP-p85 were allowed to adhere for 60 min to hE/Fc-coated substrata (C and D) or to PLL-coated substrata (E and F) for 60 min. Cells were then fixed and stained for GFP (C and E) and cellular E-cadherin (D and F). Note the presence of both GFP-p85 and cellular E-cadherin at the leading edges of cadherin-based lamellipodia (arrowhead). In contrast, there was relatively little GFP-p85 seen immediately proximal to the leading edges (arrowhead) despite the presence of E-cadherin (arrow). Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Adhesion to hE/Fc-coated coverslips was accompanied by rapid and vigorous cell spreading, distinguished by the appearance of prominent cadherin-based lamellipodia (Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 5). Rounded cells had attached after 15 min (Fig. 1 C). Lamellipodial protrusions were apparent at 30 min (Fig. 1 E) and became more prominent in the succeeding 60 min (Fig. 1 G). Staining with Alexa488-phalloidin revealed prominent bands of F-actin at the leading edges of cadherin-based lamellipodia (Fig. 4 C) as well as long actin bundles that spanned the cells. Adhesion and spreading on hE/Fc were not affected by integrin-blocking peptides (not shown) (7Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Nor was adhesion to hE/Fc associated with assembly of focal adhesions. hE-CHO cells adherent to hE/Fc showed diffuse staining for β1 integrin (Fig.2B) and cytoplasmic distribution of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; Fig. 2 D). In contrast, adhesion of hE-CHO cells to fibronectin induced the clear recruitment of both β1 integrin (Fig. 2 A) and focal adhesion kinase (Fig. 2 C) into focal adhesions at the cell surface. Taken together, these data indicated that the adhesive and cell shape changes observed in this assay were specific responses to cadherin ligation. In particular, the appearance of cadherin-based lamellipodia correlated well with adhesion, providing a convenient assay for productive cadherin adhesion. As a first step to characterizing the relationship between E-cadherin homophilic ligation and Rac in this assay system, we compared the subcellular localization of wild-type Rac1 and the cadherin-catenin complex as cells adhered to hE/Fc-coated substrata. We used β-catenin to identify the cadherin-catenin complex, since in hE-CHO cells, β-catenin is principally found associated with E-cadherin at the plasma membrane (not shown). hE-CHO cells were transiently transfected with wild-type Myc-Rac1, and confocal microscopy was used to image the distributions of the transgene and of endogenous β-catenin at the adhesive interface (i.e. the ventral surfaces of cells adhering to hE/Fc-coated substrata). At 15 min, when cells had first attached, β-catenin was identified at the margins of contact between the cells and hE/Fc-coated substrata, as well as more diffusely in the body of the cells (Fig. 1 C). By 30 min, β-catenin was seen accumulating at the margins of lamellipodial protrusions as well as in clusters under the cell body and in lamellipodia proximal to the leading edges (Fig. 1 E). Clustering became more prominent by 90 min (Figs. 1 G and 4 B), when some residual linear β-catenin staining persisted at the leading edges and in ruffles of cadherin-based lamellipodia (Fig. 1 G). In freshly attached cells, Myc-Rac1 (Fig. 1 D) appeared to co-accumulate with β-catenin (Fig. 1 C) at the margins of adhesive contacts. As cells spread, Myc-Rac1 staining remained most prominent at the leading edges of cadherin-based lamellipodia (Fig.1 F). Strikingly, little Myc-Rac1 was seen at the adhesive interface proximal to the leading edges, despite the presence of cadherin clusters in this region (Fig. 1 E). A cytoplasmic pool of Myc-Rac1 was evident by epi-illumination microscopy (Fig.7 B). By 90 min, when cells had fully spread, co-accumulation of Myc-Rac1 and β-catenin persisted in ruffles, but less was evident at leading edges (Fig. 1, G and H). Similar localization at the leading edges of cadherin-based lamellipodia was observed in cells expressing a GFP-Rac1 construct (not shown), indicating that the localization was not due to the epitope tag. Since the leading edges of cadherin-based lamellipodia represent the sites where the margins of adhesive contact were being extended, this suggested that during adhesion Rac principally accumulated at sites where new cadherin contacts were being formed. To test the hypothesis that E-cadherin ligation can directly activate Rac signaling, we used pull-down assays (11Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 20del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.-D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) to identify changes in GTP·Rac that occurred in response to hE/Fc. A GST fusion protein containing the CRIB domain of PAK was used to isolate active, GTP-bound Rac in lysates from cells as they adhered to hE/Fc (Fig.3 A). We observed a consistent rise in GTP·Rac after hE-CHO cells attached to hE/Fc. Characteristically, this was first evident ∼10–15 min after adhesion to hE/Fc, tending to peak at 30 min. Parallel blots showed no differences in the total Rac content of the cell lysates. GTP·Rac levels did not change when cells were plated onto substrata coated with either poly-l-lysine (PLL) or BSA (Fig. 3 A). These findings therefore demonstrate that E-cadherin homophilic ligation alone is sufficient to activate Rac signaling. To assess the functional significance of such cadherin-activated Rac signaling, we then tested the effect of Rac1 mutants on cadherin-based spreading and lamellipodial formation (Fig. 3 B). Transient expression of a dominantly inhibitory N17Rac1 mutant very potently inhibited cell spreading on hE/Fc-coated substrata (Fig.3 B). Cells remained rounded after attachment and displayed no cadherin-based lamellipodia. In contrast, expression of a constitutively active (V12) mutant induced cells to form more extensive, circumferential cadherin-based lamellipodia (Fig.3 B) with clear F-actin bands at the leading edges. Therefore, in this assay system, which measures the ability of cells to form specific cadherin contacts, Rac activity was necessary for extension of the adhesive contacts after initial cadherin ligation. PI 3-kinase is a well documented upstream regulator of Rac (21Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr.

Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To begin to assess the potential role of PI 3-kinase in cadherin signaling, we first tested whether PI 3-kinase activity was necessary for cadherin-specific adhesion. We incubated cells with either wortmannin (60 nm) or LY294002 (100 μm; not shown), which are reasonably specific inhibitors of type I PI 3-kinases when used at these concentrations (24Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Wortmannin significantly inhibited E-cadherin adhesion (Fig.4 A) and largely inhibited cadherin-based cell spreading (Fig. 4, B–D). Adhesive strength was substantially reduced although not completely abolished (Fig. 4 A). The vast majority of wortmannin-treated cells remained rounded (Fig. 4 D), with no detectable lamellipodia (Fig. 4, B and C, insets). LY294002 had identical effects on adhesion and cadherin-based spreading (not shown). Taken together, these data indicated that PI 3-kinase activity, like Rac, was essential both for adhesion and for cells to extend their zones of adhesive contact after binding to hE/Fc. Pece et al.

Attachment triggers exfoliation of bacteria-laden superficial facet cells, followed by rapid reconstitution of the urothelium through differentiation of underlying basal and intermediate cells. We have used DNA microarrays to define the molecular regulators of urothelial renewal and host defense expressed in adult C57Bl/6 female mice during the early phases of infection with isogenic virulent (FimH+) or avirulent (FimH−) UPEC strains. The temporal evolution and cellular origins of selected responses were then characterized by real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analyses. Well before exfoliation is evident, FimH-mediated attachment suppresses transforming growth factor-β (Bmp4) and Wnt5a/Ca2+ signaling to promote subsequent differentiation of basal/intermediate cells. The early transcriptional responses to attachment also include induction of regulators of proliferation (e.g. epidermal growth factor family members), induction of the ETS transcription factor Elf3, which transactivates genes involved in epithelial differentiation and host defense (inducible nitric-oxide synthase), induction of modulators, and mediators of pro-inflammatory responses (e.g. Socs3, Cebp/δ, Bcl3, and CC/CXC chemokines), induction of modulators of apoptotic responses (A20), and induction of intermediate cell tight junction components (claudin-4). Both early and late phases of the host response exhibit remarkable specificity for the FimH+ strain and provide new insights about the molecular cascade mobilized to combat UPEC-associated urinary tract infection.

Mucosal defense networks are characterized by a multifaceted interplay between epithelial, inflammatory, and immune cells that works to control and eradicate pathogens encountered in the environment. Epithelial cells are typically the first host cell type to come into contact with potential microbial invaders. This places them in a unique position to contribute to innate defense.

Clin. N. Am. 1991; 75: 253-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To establish disease in the urinary tract, UPEC must bind to bladder epithelial cells. Type 1 fimbriae are extracellular organelles expressed by UPEC that are critical for this interaction (3Langermann S. Palaszynski S. Barnhart M. Auguste G. Pinkner J.S. Burlein J. Barren P. Koenig S. Leath S. Jones C.H. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1997; 276: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The distal tip of type 1 fimbriae contains FimH, an adhesin that binds to mannosylated receptors on the luminal surface of the bladder epithelium (urothelium) (4Wu X.R. Sun T.T. Medina J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Binding is followed by invasion (5Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Roth R. Parks W.C. Heuser J.

Transurethral inoculation of a FimH+ clinical isolate of UPEC (NU14) into the bladders of adult female C57Bl/6 mice results in rapid loss of the superficial facet cell layer of the urothelium. Scanning EM of mouse bladders harvested 2 h after inoculation reveals numerous bacteria attached to an intact urothelial surface. Six hours after inoculation, exfoliation of bacteria-laden superficial facet cells occurs, exposing underlying, less differentiated intermediate cells. Exfoliation is part of an innate host defense mechanism that helps clear bacteria from the bladder. Intermediate cells rapidly differentiate to superficial facet cells over the course of the next 12–48 h. After 7 days, the urothelium appears to be fully restored based on histologic criteria. In contrast, an isogenic FimH− UPEC mutant (NU14-1) fails to attach to the urothelium, is unable to colonize the bladders of adult female mice, and does not elicit exfoliation or significant inflammation (5Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Roth R. Parks W.C. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The rapid regenerative response to FimH+ UPEC-mediated injury contrasts with the slow turnover of the undamaged urothelium (estimates range up to 40 weeks) (7Jost S.P. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1989; 57: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The pseudostratified transitional urothelium normally supports a continuum of differentiation as cells move from its basal, to intermediate, to surface layers. Differentiation is associated with repeated cell fusions and increasing ploidy; basal cells are diploid, whereas the nuclei of the large superficial facet cells are octoploid or higher (8Levi P.E. Cooper E.H. Anderson C.K. Williams R.E. Cancer (Phila.). 1969; 23: 1074-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The basal layer functions as the proliferative compartment (mitotic labeling index = 0.11%) (7Jost S.P. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1989; 57: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The remarkably slow pace of renewal of the undamaged urothelium has impeded efforts to identify the molecular factors that control this process. In this report, we describe how a functional genomics-based analysis of the host response to isogenic FimH+ and FimH− UPEC infection of the mouse bladder has revealed an intricate network of molecular regulators and effectors of urothelial regeneration, pro-inflammatory responses, and barrier functions. NU14 (fimH+) and NU14-1 (fimH−) strains were grown as described (3Langermann S. Palaszynski S. Barnhart M. Auguste G. Pinkner J.S. Burlein J. Barren P. Koenig S. Leath S. Jones C.H. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1997; 276: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). 8–10-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratories) were inoculated, via transurethral catheterization, with 50 μl of a suspension of 108 colony-forming units of NU14 or NU14-1 in phosphate-buffered saline (5Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Roth R. Parks W.C. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) from bladders of mice sacrificed prior to and 1.5 or 3.5 h after inoculation (n = 10 mice/time point/bacterial strain/experiment; n = 2 independent experiments). Equivalent amounts of RNA from each mouse in each group/experiment were pooled and biotinylated cRNA targets prepared (9Lee C.K. Klopp R.G. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Each cRNA target was hybridized to Mu11K GeneChips (Affymetrix). GeneChip software was then used to compute an average fluorescence intensity across all probe sets on the GeneChips. The signal produced by each probe set on a chip was then multiplied using a “scaling factor” so that the average chip-wide intensity matched a specified intensity. As recommended by Affymetrix, we scaled the overall fluorescence intensity across each chip to an intensity of 1500 prior to conducting the pairwise chip-to-chip comparisons with GeneChip software. We followed the recommendation of the manufacturer to exclude genes whose expression changed less than 2-fold in single chip-to-chip comparisons. Several papers have established this threshold as a standard (10Claverie J.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A.

In addition, we required that the change be ≥2-fold in the same direction (increased or decreased) in FimH+ relative to FimH− UPEC-infected bladders in duplicate biological experiments. Additional groups of age-matched female C57Bl/6 mice were infected with FimH+ or FimH− UPEC strains for 6 h, 24 h, and 7 days (n = 4 animals/time point/strain). Bladder RNAs were pooled as above and used for qRT-PCR studies. For the 0-, 1.5-, and 3.5-h time points, qRT-PCR assays were performed using the same RNAs employed for the DNA microarray analysis. cDNAs, produced from the 0-, 1.5-, 3.5-, 6-, and 24-h and 7-day time points, were added to 25-μl qRT-PCRs containing 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems), 900 nm gene-specific primers (see on-line supplemental tables for a list), and 0.25 units of UDP-N-glycosidase (Invitrogen). A melting curve was used to identify a temperature where only the amplicon, and not primer dimers, accounted for the SYBR Green-bound fluorescence. Assays were performed in triplicate with an Applied Biosystems model 7700 instrument. All data were normalized to an internal standard (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA; ΔΔCT method, User Bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). Bladders from uninfected mice, plus bladders from mice sacrificed 3.5 and 6 h after inoculation with NU14 or NU14-1, were fixed in Bouin's solution (overnight, 4 °C). Bladders from each group of mice were embedded together in paraffin, and serial 5-μm thick sections were prepared. For in situ hybridization analysis, sections were deparaffinized (Trilogy kit, CellMarque), incubated (15 min, 23 °C) with proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 5 μg/ml phosphate-buffered saline), and processed according to Ref. 14Zaidi A.U.

Digoxigenin-UTP-labeled cRNA and control mRNA probes were prepared by T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase transcription of linearized plasmids containing double-stranded cDNAs encoding mouse Bmp4 (pBmp4), BmpRIa (pBmprIa; both from Brigid Hogan, Vanderbilt University), Wnt5a (pGEMwnt5a; Andrew McMahon, Harvard University), plus Dll1 (pCS2Delta, Raphael Kopan, Washington University).

Sections adjacent to those used for in situ hybridization were prepared for immunohistochemical studies by de-paraffinization with xylene, rehydration, and preincubation (15 min, 23 °C) with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline). Sections were then stained with the following antibodies: (i) mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to uroplakin III (Research Diagnostics); (ii) rabbit polyclonal antibodies to aquaporin 3 (Ref. 15Matsuzaki T.

Antigen retrieval protocols were used to detect cytokeratins 5/6 (17Riedel I. Czernobilsky B. Lifschitz-Mercer B. Roth L.M., Wu, X.R. Sun T.T. Moll R. Virchows Arch. 2001; 438: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with Cy3- or FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig or FITC-labeled donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:1000). High density oligo-based DNA microarrays, containing probe sets representing ∼11,000 mouse genes and expressed sequence tags, were used to compare gene expression in the bladders of adult female mice prior to and 1.5 and 3.5 h after exposure to isogenic FimH+ or FimH− strains of UPEC. We selected these early time points to assay how the urothelium prepares for exfoliation and subsequent replacement of its superficial facet cells. Furthermore, at these time points there is little change in the cellular composition of the urothelium; infiltration of inflammatory/immune cells is not a prominent feature of the host response until 6 h after inoculation of FimH+ UPEC (18Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Martinez J.J. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8829-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We chose DNA microarrays to initiate our analysis because (a) the outcomes of FimH+ and FimH− UPEC infection in this genetically defined mouse model are markedly divergent and predictable, and (b) there was scant prior information to guide investigation into the molecular determinants of the host response. RNA was prepared from the bladders of age-matched mice inoculated with 108 colony-forming units of either UPEC strain (n = 10 animals/group/time point). Equivalent amounts of RNA from each mouse per group per time point were pooled; cRNAs were generated and used to interrogate DNA microarrays. The biological experiment was repeated on two separate occasions so that replicate cRNAs for bladders infected with each bacterial strain at each time point could be hybridized to separate sets of microarrays. Comparisons of bladder RNAs from FimH+ versus FimH− UPEC-infected mice were performed with the FimH− UPEC microarrays designated as “Base line.” Data sets were generated by extracting all mRNAs that satisfied the following selection criteria: (a) called “Present” in either microarray (base line or partner); (b) levels changed ≥2-fold (increased or decreased) in FimH+ compared with FimH− UPEC-infected bladder RNA at the 1.5-h and/or 3.5-h time points; and (c) the increase or decrease in expression at a given time point was reproduced in duplicate experiments. A total of 56 genes satisfied all of these selection criteria. This includes five expressed sequence tags. They are grouped into functional categories in Table I. The largest category contained genes associated with cellular differentiation and proliferation. The table also presents DNA microarray-based comparisons of the expression of these 56 genes in FimH+ UPEC-infected versus uninfected bladder RNA.

Real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to independently verify the change in levels of selected mRNAs from each functional category. To define the evolution of the host response, the qRT-PCR survey was extended to bladder RNAs prepared from mice sacrificed 6 h, 24 h, and 7 days after inoculation of the two UPEC strains (n = 4 animals/time point/experiment). The 6-h time point was selected because it represents the period of exfoliation of superficial facet cells and exposure of underlying intermediate cells. The 24-h time point represents the period of generalized differentiation of intermediate to superficial facet cells. Seven days represents the time of histologic restoration of the urothelium. As described below, these analyses have revealed a host response characterized by prominent changes in expression of molecular regulators and effectors of (a) epithelial differentiation and proliferation, (b) proinflammatory and apoptotic responses, and (c) barrier function. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (Tgf-β) superfamily of secreted signaling molecules and acts as a negative regulator of differentiation in a number of cellular systems (e.g. Refs. 19Treier M. Gleiberman A.S. O'Connell S.M. Szeto D.P. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1691-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar and 20Mathura J.R., Jr. Jafari N. Chang J.T. Hackett S.F. Wahlin K.J. Della N.G. Okamoto N. Zack D.J. Campochiaro P.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 592-600PubMed Google Scholar). Bmp4 is expressed in mesenchymal cells surrounding the ureteric bud stalk in the developing urinary tract and may act as an inhibitory factor to limit the sites of ureteral branch formation (21Miyazaki Y. Oshima K. Fogo A. Hogan B.L. Ichikawa I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Bmp4 mRNA levels decline rapidly during the early phases of FimH+ UPEC infection, reaching a nadir at 6 h (Fig.1 A). In situhybridization studies revealed that Bmp4 mRNA is localized to the mesenchyme underlying the normal bladder urothelium and that FimH+ UPEC infection promotes a decline in mRNA levels within this cellular compartment (Fig. 1 B). Multilabel immunohistochemical studies indicated that bacteria are not detectable in the mesenchyme or in the overlying intermediate and basal cells (Fig. 1 C). Bmp4 binds to and signals through two serine/threonine kinase receptors, BmpRIa and BmpRIb (22ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only BmpRIa mRNA was detectable by qRT-PCR in the bladders of normal uninfected animals as well as in mice infected with either strain of UPEC. In situhybridization disclosed that BmpRIa is expressed in the urothelium. qRT-PCR and in situ studies indicated that receptor mRNA levels did not change appreciably upon exposure to the FimH+ strain (data not shown). Bmp4 binding to the receptor leads to its activation, resulting in phosphorylation of a BMP signal transducer, Smad1, and subsequent transactivation of target genes (23Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 24Graff J.M. Bansal A. Melton D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that 6 h after infection, phospho-Smad1 levels were decreased in intermediate and basal cells (Fig. 1 D), providing direct evidence for reduced signaling. The FimH− mutant produced negligible alterations in expression of components of the Bmp4 pathway (Fig. 1, A, B, and D). Genetic studies in Drosophila have demonstrated an important role for heparan sulfate proteoglycans in regulating Tgf-β/Bmp activity (25Jackson S.M. Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A. Oakes R. Kaluza V. Golden C. Selleck S.B. Development. 1997; 124: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bmp4 binds to heparin with high affinity in vitro (26Sampath T.K. Muthukumaran N. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7109-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Moreover, a loss-of-function mutation in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, glypican-3, appears to potentiate cellular responses to Bmp4 in the developing mouse limb (27Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Zupicich J. Skarnes W.C. Saunders S. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, DNA microarray and qRT-PCR analyses disclosed that FimH+ but not FimH− UPEC induces a pronounced increase in expression of heparan sulfated-glucosaminyl-3-O-sulfotransferase 1 (3-Ost1), an enzyme that catalyzes terminal modification of the heparan sulfate chain (28Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). This response peaks 6 h after infection (18-fold rise relative to uninfected bladders; Fig. 1 E). Increased 3-Ost1 expression may serve to further promote the effects of reduced Bmp4 expression in enhancing intermediate cell differentiation. The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins binds to frizzled (Fz) receptors. Two Wnt pathways are known: a “classical” pathway that signals through β-catenin and high modality group box transcription factors, and a more recently described, non-canonical pathway (29Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) where Wnt5a:Fz(3/4/6)-stimulated increases in intracellular Ca2+ leads to activation of protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) (30Sheldahl L.C.

The process involves nonspecific fragmentation, oxidative breakdown, and modification of the lipids and protein of LDL. The process yields a variety of bioactive products, including aldehyde-containing phospholipids, which can cross-react with primary amines (i.e. peptides or phospholipid head groups) to yield Schiff base products. We also demonstrate that such oxidized phospholipid products may further react through a post-oxidation chemical pathway involving aldol condensation. EO6, an IgM monoclonal autoantibody to oxidized phospholipids, blocks the uptake of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) by macrophages. Because the epitope(s) of EO6 also blocks the uptake of OxLDL, a series of oxidized phospholipids, their peptide complexes, and their aldol condensates have been synthesized and characterized, and their antigenicity has been determined. This study defines structural motifs of oxidized phospholipids responsible for antigenicity for EO6. Certain monomeric phospholipids containing short chain fatty acids were antigenic whether oxidized or not in the sn-2 position. However, oxidized phospholipids containing sn-1 long chain fatty acids were not antigenic unless the sn-2 oxidized fatty acid contained an aldehyde that first reacted with a peptide yielding a Schiff base or the sn-2 oxidized fatty acid underwent an aldol type self-condensation. Our data indicate that the phosphorylcholine head group is essential for antigenicity, but its availability depends on the oxidized phospholipid conformation. We suggest that upon oxidation, similar reactions occur in phospholipids on the surface of LDL, generating ligands for macrophage recognition. Synthetic imine adducts of oxidized phospholipids of this type are capable of blocking the uptake of OxLDL.

Specifically, polyunsaturated fatty acids are converted to fatty acid hydroperoxides, which decompose to form highly reactive breakdown products such as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal (14Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). Such reactive aldehydes can then form covalent Schiff base and Michael-type adducts with lysine residues of apoB, the protein moiety of LDL (15Esterbauer H. Jurgens G. Quehenberger O. Koller E. J.

For example, in the case of the common phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PAPC), a near terminal oxidation product would yield an aldehyde at the ε-carbon of the sn-2 oxidized arachidonic acid, yielding the reactive compound POVPC (1-palmitoyl-2-(5′-oxo)valeroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine). In turn, this reactive phospholipid, also termed a “phospholipid core aldehyde” (21Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J.

An initial characterization revealed that some of them bound to OxLDL, prepared by copper-induced oxidation, and bound also both to the isolated lipid as well as to the delipidated apoB of OxLDL (OxapoB). None bound to the lipid or apoB of native LDL. In subsequent studies, it was shown that these EO antibodies, as exemplified by EO6, specifically bound to POVPC preparations plated on microtiter wells and to NaCNBH3-reduced POVPC-bovine serum albumin (BSA) adducts. On Western blots, antibody EO6 immunostained OxapoB but not native apoB (31Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Furthermore, if the OxapoB was first subjected to saponification to remove the covalently bound phospholipid moiety at the sn-2 ester bond, then EO6 binding to OxapoB was abolished (21Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 824-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data strongly suggested that EO6 recognized the oxidized phospholipid either as the nonconjugated lipid or as a covalent adduct with lysine or lysine residues of apoB. The EO autoantibodies to oxidized phospholipid, such as EO6, and oxidized phospholipid-apoB adducts were shown to have important biological activities. For example, they effectively blocked the binding and uptake of OxLDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages (31Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition, they bound to the surface of apoptotic cells and blocked in part their phagocytosis by macrophages (32Chang M.K. Bergmark C. Laurila A. Hörkkö S. Han K.H. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the POVPC-BSA adduct was also able to compete effectively for OxLDL and apoptotic cell uptake by macrophages (31Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 32Chang M.K. Bergmark C. Laurila A.

These data strongly support the hypothesis that the epitope(s) recognized by EO6 and related autoantibodies are important biological ligands. As part of these studies we cloned the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of the EO antibodies that bind to POVPC adducts, such as EO6, and discovered that the VH/VL regions were identical to an antibody first described more than 30 years ago, the T15 natural IgA antibody (33Shaw P.X. Hörkkö S. Chang M.K. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Silverman G.J. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The T15 is of germ-line origin, which confers optimal protection to mice against lethal infection with Gram-positive bacteria such asStreptococcus pneumoniae. T15 is known to be an “anti-phosphorylcholine antibody” and binds to this moiety in the capsular polysaccharide (C-PS) present in the cell wall of many pathogens. Indeed, both T15 and EO6 have similar binding properties, and in particular, phosphorylcholine (PC) is able to fully compete for the binding of EO6 and T15 to OxLDL (33Shaw P.X. Hörkkö S. Chang M.K. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Silverman G.J. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Because the head group PC is present in both PAPC as well as in POVPC, it was not clear why EO6 and T15 would bind only to the oxidized phospholipid. Because the epitope(s) recognized by EO6 is an important biological ligand, we therefore undertook a careful analysis of the structural requirements of an oxidized phospholipid to make it antigenic for the EO antibodies, using EO6 as a model antibody. In the present study, we demonstrate that both Schiff base formation and aldol condensation are important reactions for the conversion of phospholipids containing reactive aldehydes into immunogenic products. During the aldol condensation process, the α-carbon of one aldehyde containing phospholipid adds to the carbonyl carbon of another aldehyde containing phospholipid molecule, yielding a β-hydroxy aldehyde (aldol) (34Nielsen A.T. Houlihan W.J. The Aldol Condensation: Organic Reactions. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1968: 13-15Google Scholar) which can further dehydrate, leading to an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Thus, the aldol condensation can yield intermolecular reactions between two or more aldehyde-containing phospholipids. Apparently the latter process can even occur with synthetic oxidized phospholipids stored in chloroform at −20 °C. We now examine the conditions for the formation of the aldol condensate, the stability of the oxidized phospholipids, and the effect of structural modifications on the antigenicity for EO6. All of the phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Arachidonic acid was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was obtained from Biosearch Technologies Inc. Schiff's Reagent (for detection of aldehydes on thin layer chromatography), Sigma spray reagent molybdenum blue (for detection of phosphates on thin layer chromatography), BSA, and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) were purchased from Sigma. Methyl sulfide, nonanedioic (azelaic) acid, 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide, 1,3-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, 2-methyl-2-butene, sodium cyanoborohydride, and sodium borohydride were obtained from Aldrich. Both preparative and thin layer chromatography plates were purchased from Merck (EM Science). Optima grade solvents were obtained from Fisher. Deuterated chloroform was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. EO6 is a monoclonal IgM antibody that recognizes and binds to epitopes of OxLDL (25Hörkkö S. Miller E. Dudl E. Reaven P.

It was cloned from apoE-deficient mice (EO autoantibody) and purified as described (33Shaw P.X. Hörkkö S. Chang M.K. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Silverman G.J. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To define the structural motifs of various phospholipids that are the basis for their antigenicity toward EO6, we compared the ability of various phospholipid analogues to compete with EO6 for binding to OxLDL plated on a microtiter well using competition immunoassays as described (31Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin.

Invest. 2000; 105: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). For these studies, increasing amounts of the indicated compounds were added to siliconized 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. In the case of various lipid analogs, they were added in ethanol, and the solvent was evaporated. To each tube, EO6 in PBS (1 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and an aliquot of the supernatant was taken to test its binding to OxLDL. For this assay, 50 μl of OxLDL diluted in PBS to 5 μg/ml containing 0.27 mm EDTA was added to 96-well white round-bottomed Micro-Fluor microtiter plates (Dynex Technologies) and left overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with PBS using an automated plate washer, and unoccupied sites were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA (PBS+BSA) for 30 min. After further washing, 50 μl of the EO6-containing supernatants were then applied to triplicate wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed three times with PBS. Binding of EO6 was detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris base, 0.27 mm EDTA, and 1% BSA. This was followed by a rinse with water and the addition of 25 μl of 50% LumiPhos 530 solution (Lumigen Inc.). Light emissions were measured as relative light units over 100 ms using a DYNEX Luminometer (Dynex Technologies). Data were expressed as the ratio ofB/B 0 where B represents the binding of EO6 to OxLDL in the presence, andB 0, in the absence of competitor. The aldehyde-containing phospholipids were synthesized by ozonolysis of the unsaturated, double-bond of the fatty acid of the appropriate phospholipids at −70 °C in dichloromethane for about 20 min followed by the breakup of the ozonide by adding methyl sulfide (16Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, ozone was bubbled through a solution of 25 mg of phospholipid dissolved in 3 ml dry dichloromethane at −70 °C for about 20 min followed by removal of excess ozone by bubbling dry nitrogen through the solution. Typically, the ozone-saturated dichloromethane became light blue, a color that could be used as an internal indicator. Then 0.8 ml of methyl sulfide was added, and the solution was shaken and slowly allowed to reach 4 °C over 5 h. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and lyophilized to remove the dimethyl sulfoxide formed. The precipitate was re-suspended in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) mixture and separated on preparative layer chromatography. The reduction of the aldehyde to the alcohol was accomplished utilizing an equimolar quantity of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in isopropanol at room temperature for 3 h followed by a preparative layer chromatography separation. The further oxidation of the aldehyde to the carboxylic acid was accomplished with sodium chlorite (35Bal B.S. Childers W.E., Jr. Pinnick H.W. Tetrahedron. 1981; 37: 2091-2096Crossref Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). The aldehyde was dissolved in a mixture of tert-butanol and 2-methyl-2-butene. An aqueous solution of sodium chlorite and sodium dihydrogen phosphate was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight, followed by drying the mixture under vacuum, re-dissolving it in water, acidifying with HCl to pH 5, and extracting with chloroform. The product was isolated after a preparative layer chromatographic separation. The peptide-lipid adducts were formed by incubating the aldehyde-containing lipids with the appropriate lysine-containing peptide in borate buffer at pH 7.4 to form a Schiff base between the aldehyde and the ε-amine of the lysine. The newly formed imine was reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3) to yield a secondary amine. Diacyl phospholipids that were not commercially available were synthesized by the acylation of the appropriate lysophospholipids. Typically an equimolar quantity of the appropriate fatty acid (i.e. arachidonic or linoleic acid) was esterified to the sn-2 hydroxyl of lysophospholipid using 1.1 molar eq of 1,3-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, 0.3 molar eq of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, and 0.2 molar eq of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in dry dichloromethane at 0 °C overnight. Upon discarding the urea salt via filtration, the product was separated on preparative layer chromatography. The synthetic steps are summarized in Fig.1. POVPC was prepared by oxidizing PAPC as described under “General Method for the Synthesis of Oxidized Phospholipids.” The product was separated on a silica-based preparative layer chromatography as described below. The product was identified by positive reactions with molybdenum blue reagent (36Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Schiff's reagent sprays. The Rf of the product was 0.375. The purity of the aldehyde was confirmed by mass spectroscopy (single molecular peak, m/z = 594), 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (single peak), which all were consistent with the theoretical prediction as well as previous findings (16Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these measurements, the purity of the POVPC has been estimated to be at least 99.5%. The yield of the product was 47%. P(5′-carboxy)VPC was prepared by further oxidation of POVPC with sodium chlorite as described above. The product was purified on a silica-based preparative layer chromatography as described below. Its structure and purity were confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy (m/z = 610). The yield of the product was 86%. P(5′hydroxy)VPC was prepared by reducing POVPC with NaBH4as described above. The product was purified on a silica-based preparative layer chromatography as described below. Its structure and purity were confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy (m/z = 596). The yield of the product was 94%. PONPC was prepared by ozonolysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” from 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine. The product was separated by silica-based preparative layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/water (10:5:1) as the mobile phase. The product was identified by positive reactions with molybdenum blue reagent (36Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Schiff's reagent sprays. The purity of the aldehyde was confirmed by 13C NMR, 1H NMR, reverse phase HPLC (single peak), and mass spectroscopy, which all were consistent with the prediction. Based on the experimental data, the purity of the PONPC was estimated to be at least 99.5%. The yield of the product was 56%. POVPC was incubated in methanol with lysine in the molar ratio of POVPC:Lys 10:11 for 3 h at room temperature. This yielded the Schiff base product. Reduction of the formed imine to the appropriate secondary amine was performed by the addition of NaCNBH3, and the mixture was kept overnight at 4 °C. The Schiff base product was used without further purification, whereas the reduced amine was purified by reverse phase HPLC. The following peptides containing a single lysine residue were used: Ac-Ala-Ala-Lys-Ala-Tyr (Ac-AAKAY) and Ac-Val-Ile-Asp-Ala-Leu-Gln-Tyr-Lys-Leu-Glu-Gly-Thr-Thr, the 3373–3385 fragment from the sequence of the ApoB-100 that is part of the putative LDL receptor binding site (GenBankTM accession numberP04114), yielding POVPC-AcAAKAY and POVPC-LDL peptide (the 13-mer above), respectively. The tyrosine was included in the pentapeptide to allow for spectrophotometric detection. POVPC was incubated in methanol with an equimolar amount of peptide for 4 h to give the Schiff base product, which subsequently was reduced to an amine as for POVPC-Lys. POVPC-BSA was synthesized as previously described (31Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W.

https://openalex.org/W2159948111,"Phagosomes formed by neutrophils are much less acidic than those of other phagocytic cells. The defective acidification seen in neutrophils has been attributed to consumption of protons during the dismutation of superoxide, because a large, sustained acidification is unmasked when the cells are treated with inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase. Consumption of protons transported into the phagosome by dismutation would tightly couple the activities of the NADPH oxidase and the vacuolar type H+-pump (or V-ATPase). We tested the existence of the predicted coupling using microfluorimetry and digital imaging and found that the rate of superoxide generation was independent of the activity of the H+-pump. Moreover, we failed to detect the alkalinization predicted to develop through dismutation when the pump was inhibited. Instead, two other mechanisms were found to contribute to the inability of neutrophil phagosomes to acidify. First, the insertion of V-ATPases into the phagosomal membrane was found to be reduced when the oxidase is active. Second, the passive proton (equivalent) permeability of the phagosomal membrane increased when the oxidase was activated. The increased permeability cannot be entirely attributed to the conductive H+ channels associated with the oxidase, since it is not eliminated by Zn2+. We conclude that the NADPH oxidase controls the phagosomal pH by multiple mechanisms that include reduced proton delivery to the lumen, increased luminal proton consumption, and enhanced backflux (leak) into the cytosol.

A complex and highly organized series of events takes place at sites of tissue injury to limit the extent of microbial infection. Neutrophils are crucial contributors to this host response, as they are the first line of defense against invading microorganisms. When activated by bacterial or inflammatory chemoattractants, circulating neutrophils traverse capillary walls by diapedesis and migrate to the sites of infection, where they recognize and eliminate foreign organisms (1Elsbach P. Weiss J. Immunol. Lett. 1985; 11: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Cohen M.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 18 Suppl. 2: 170-179Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis, the process of internalization of the microorganisms into a membrane-bound vacuole, is central to the microbicidal response (1Elsbach P. Weiss J. Immunol. Lett. 1985; 11: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Cohen M.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 18 Suppl. 2: 170-179Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The membrane of newly formed phagosomes displays a composition similar to that of the plasma membrane, while the phagosomal contents are initially similar to the extracellular milieu. However, shortly after sealing, the phagosome undergoes drastic remodeling by fusion with endomembrane compartments, while maintaining its approximate size through coordinated fission events. Such remodeling involves delivery into the phagosomal lumen of a variety of microbicidal agents, including lytic enzymes and cationic peptides, as well as insertion into the phagosomal membrane of proteins that also contribute to the killing and disposal of microorganisms (3Levy O. Blood. 2000; 96: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tjelle T.E. Lovdal T. Berg T. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The proteins acquired by the phagosomal membrane during maturation include the NADPH oxidase and the H+-pumping vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase). 1V-ATPaseH+-pumping vacuolar ATPaseDPIdiphenylene iodoniumpHpphagosomal pHMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered saline The NADPH oxidase, an enzymatic complex consisting of both membrane-bound and cytosolic subunits, assembles at the phagocytic membrane, where it facilitates the transfer of one electron from cytosolic NADPH to molecular oxygen. The resulting superoxide anion and the reactive oxygen metabolites generated therefrom, which include hypochlorous acid and hydroxyl radicals, are potent microbicidal agents (5Miller R.A. Britigan B.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 1-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V-ATPase catalyzes the vectorial transport of H+ into the phagosomal lumen (6Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D.

In these cells acidification of the phagosomal lumen, which has been reported to reach pH 5.5 (6Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Zhang W.J. Demaurex N. Woodside M. Tsai O. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Two lines of evidence indicate that the V-ATPase is responsible for the luminal acidification: (a) the accumulation of H+ requires cytosolic ATP (8Lukacs G.L. Rotstein O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21099-21107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (b) acidification is inhibited by specific V-ATPase inhibitors like bafilomycin and concanamycin (6Hackam D.J.

As V-ATPases are also inserted into the phagosomes of neutrophils, a comparable phagosomal acidification would be expected in these cells. Remarkably, however, phagosomal pH (pHp) in neutrophils has been reported to undergo a biphasic change; an alkalinization occurs during the first few minutes, which is then slowly followed by a modest secondary acidification to pH ∼6.5. It is unclear whether this apparent discrepancy resulted from differences in the methodology used or whether phagosomal pH is truly regulated differently in these two cell types. Segal et al. (10Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism to account for the biphasic pHp changes reported in neutrophils. The initial alkalosis was attributed to consumption of H+ during the process of dismutation of superoxide to H2O2, while the secondary acidification was proposed to reflect the ongoing activity of the V-ATPase, which becomes unmasked when the respiratory burst subsides. Consistent with this notion, in neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease patients, which lack an active NADPH oxidase, pHp was found to acidify at rates comparable with those seen in macrophages (6Hackam D.J.

Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Since the original hypothesis of Segal et al. (10Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), it has become apparent that additional H+ transport systems operate in phagocytes, which are activated in parallel with the respiratory burst. In particular, a H+ conductive pathway or “channel” was found to exist in both neutrophils and macrophages. While the molecular identity of the channel is still the subject of debate, it is generally agreed that large H+-selective currents can be mediated by this entity, which can impact on both the cytosolic and phagosomal pH. Passage of H+ through these channels could account for the inability of phagosomes to acidify rapidly and fully in neutrophils, as they do in macrophages. The objective of the present experiments was to reanalyze the determinants of the phagosomal pH of human neutrophils, with particular attention to the possible contribution of passive H+transport pathways. To this end, we used fluorescence ratio imaging to select and study single phagosomes in adherent neutrophils. This approach overcomes some of the limitations inherent in earlier studies, which may have affected their interpretation (see “Discussion”). We report that the activation of the NADPH oxidase alters pHpnot only by promoting the consumption of intraphagosomal H+(equivalents) but also by altering the permeability and fusogenic properties of the phagosomal membrane.

The Na+-free/high K+ medium contained 143 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, titrated to pH 7.3 at 37 °C. The pH 5.8 medium contained the same salts, but HEPES was substituted with MES, and pH was adjusted to 5.8. The K+-rich medium contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, and 15 mmHepes or MES or acetic acid (pH 8–6.8, 6.7–5.5, or 4.0–5.0). In all cases, the osmolarity was adjusted to 290 ± 5 mosm with the major salt. Homogenization buffer contained 250 mm sucrose plus 3 mm imidazole, adjusted to pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Neutrophils were isolated from heparinized whole blood obtained by venipuncture, using dextran sedimentation and discontinuous Percoll gradients as described (12Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1968; 97: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, neutrophils were suspended at 107 cells/ml in nominally bicarbonate-free, Hepes-buffered solution RPMI 1640 and rotated at room temperature until used (less than 4 h). Dried zymosan (10–20 mg) was suspended in PBS followed by mild sonication to disperse aggregates and then washed and resuspended in 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 9.3) at a final concentration of 50 mg/ml. Reactive fluorophores (fluorescein isothiocyanate and the succinimidyl esters of Oregon Green 514, SNAFL-1, or SNAFL-2) were dissolved in 0.1 msodium carbonate at 1 mg/ml. The labeling reaction was initiated by adding 0.1 mg of the probes to 1 mg of suspended zymosan particles. The mixture was then allowed to react for 4 h at room temperature with constant mixing. Unbound probe was removed by centrifugation, and the product was resuspended in 0.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide with three drops of PBS at pH 7.4 and sonicated to disperse the zymosan. This procedure was repeated two or three more times while adding progressively more PBS until the supernatant was completely clear. The final pellet was dissolved in PBS and frozen in aliquots. The spectral properties of the conjugates were analyzed using a thermostatted Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrofluorimeter using 5-nm slits while magnetically stirring the suspensions. Round (25-mm diameter) coverslips were coated by overnight incubation with 50 μg/ml fibronectin, followed by two washes with PBS. Neutrophils (∼106 cells) were plated onto these coverslips, which were mounted in a thermostatted Leiden holder, overlaid with Na+-rich buffer, and placed on the stage of a Leica fluorescence microscope equipped with a PL Fluotar 100×/1.3 N.A. oil immersion objective. A Sutter wheel and controller positioned the excitation filters in front of a mercury lamp. To minimize dye bleaching and photodynamic damage to the cells, a neutral density filter was used to reduce the intensity of the excitation light, and exposure time was limited to 200–600 ms. Excitation was alternated between 440 and 490 nm and directed to the cells by a 510-nm dichroic mirror. Emitted fluorescence was selected through a 535BP25 nm filter and captured with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., Princeton, NJ). Image acquisition was controlled by Metafluor software version 3.5 (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) operating on an Intel Pentium II computer. The sample was continuously illuminated at >620 nm by placing a red filter in front of the transmitted incandescent source. By placing an additional 660-nm dichroic mirror in the light path, the red light was directed to a video camera, allowing continuous visualization of cell morphology by differential interference contrast microscopy. Two independent methods of calibration were used. At the end of the experiment, a calibration curve of fluorescence ratio versus pH was obtained in situ by sequential perfusion with isotonic K+-rich medium buffered to predetermined pH values (between 7.5 and 4) containing 5 μg/ml nigericin plus 5 μm monensin. Alternatively, membranes were permeabilized gently using a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min, giving direct access to the zymosan particles. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting the extracellular pH, assumed to be identical to the phagosomal pH under these conditions, against the corresponding fluorescence ratio. Similar results were obtained using both procedures. Neutrophils were treated with or without concanamycin for 20 min at 37 °C to inhibit V-ATPases. Phagocytosis was then initiated by co-sedimenting the cells (106 cells in 0.1 ml) with opsonized zymosan particles (∼1 μg). After 5 min, 200 nm dihydrorhodamine was added. When oxidized by reactive oxygen intermediates, the nonfluorescent dihydrorhodamine is converted into the fluorescent derivative rhodamine 123. An aliquot of the cell suspension was then applied onto the coverslip, and fluorescence was observed and quantified using the optical setup described above. Superoxide production was assayed spectroscopically using the conventional cytochrome c assay as described previously (13Cohen H.J. Newburger P.E. Chovaniec M.E. Whitin J.C. Simons E.R. Blood. 1981; 58: 975-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain intact phagosomes from human neutrophils, we used a modification of the method of Griffiths and co-workers (14Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Neutrophils suspended in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 were initially treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (2.2 mm), a potent protease inhibitor, for 5 min at room temperature. Following the removal of excess inhibitor by centrifugation, the cells were resuspended at 107/ml in PBS. To induce phagocytosis, latex beads (blue-dyed, 0.8-μm diameter) were opsonized by shaking at 37 °C for 1 h with 5 mg/ml human IgG followed by a wash and suspension in PBS. Fifty μl of the bead suspension (∼5 × 107 beads) were sedimented in a microcentrifuge tube, forming a loose pellet onto which 1-ml samples of the neutrophil suspension were overlaid, together with an extra 50 μl of the bead suspension. The tubes were again subjected to centrifugation to sediment and promote the interaction between the cells and beads, thereby initiating Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis. The pellet was resuspended and sedimented twice more to increase the contact between particles and neutrophils. The final pellet was then resuspended in cold homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, at 4 °C) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a 1:100 dilution of a commercial mixture of protease inhibitors for mammalian cell extracts (Sigma). The cells collected from 10 tubes processed in parallel were broken using a French press (pressure setting: 400 p.s.i. for 5 min). Pressure was released slowly to allow dropwise collection of sample and complete breakage of the neutrophils. A drop of the supernatant was inspected under the light microscope to confirm that cell disruption occurred. The lysate was centrifuged at 1500 rpm (400 ×g) for 5 min to remove any unbroken cells. The supernatant containing the homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of 62% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, yielding a final sucrose concentration of 40%. This was then layered on top of a 62% sucrose cushion and overlaid with 35, 25, and 10% sucrose-imidazole layers. The gradient was then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, using a swinging bucket rotor. Upon completion of the centrifugation, the interface between the 10 and 25% sucrose layers containing the latex bead phagosomes was collected. The sample was diluted into 12 ml of cold PBS and sedimented at 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The pellet containing the phagosomes was finally dissolved in boiling Laemmli buffer and used for the electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Samples were resolved using SDS-PAGE using the Protean II minigel system (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were then blocked for 1 h in a buffer containing 2% milk, 0.01% Tween in PBS. The blots were next incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The following antibody dilutions were used: anti-p39 (1:1200) and CD66b (1:2000). The blots were then washed 3-fold (10 min each) with 0.01% Tween in PBS. Blots were next incubated with 1:5000 dilutions of peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (for V-ATPase) or anti-mouse IgG (for CD66b) for 1 h, followed by three 20-min washes. Finally, immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and quantified using Image J software (National Institutes of Health). To examine the pHp in situ, we utilized zymosan particles that were labeled with a combination of two pH-sensitive fluorophores: fluorescein isothiocyanate and Oregon Green 514. We took advantage of the different pK a values of these two probes (6.4 and 4.8, respectively) to extend the range of sensitivity of our measurements over >3 pH units, as illustrated in Fig.1. The dual labeled zymosan particles were opsonized with human IgG to promote Fcγ receptor-mediated internalization by neutrophils that had been allowed to adhere to fibronectin-coated coverslips. A high resolution digital imaging system that combines fluorescence ratio imaging with continuous bright field visualization was used to locate cells that interacted with particles, to discriminate between adherent and internalized particles, and to measure the pH of the resulting phagosomes. Observations made in particles that were not internalized (open circles in Fig.2, A and B) indicate that under the conditions of our experiments both the intensity at 490 nm (the pH-sensitive wavelength) and the 490/440-nm fluorescence ratio remained virtually constant for at least 15 min despite repeated exposures to the excitation light. More importantly, the fluorescence ratio was highly sensitive to the pH of the bathing medium in the pH 5–7.5 range (Fig. 2 B), as predicted from the spectral analyses of Fig. 1. The changes in fluorescence at 490 nm and in the 490/440-nm ratio that follow particle engulfment into phagosomes are illustrated by thesolid circles in Fig. 2. A sizable decrease in the 490-nm intensity and in the ratio was observed to develop during the 10–15 min after phagocytosis. In view of the sensitivity of the fluorescence to pH, this would normally be interpreted as a progressive decrease in pHp. However, subsequent calibration indicated that the pH was near neutral. In addition, it became obvious that the pH responsiveness of the probes had been drastically reduced after internalization (i.e. the dynamic range of the fluorescence ratio when pH was varied between 7.5 and 5.0 was very small, a fraction of that seen in extracellular zymosan) (see Fig. 2 B). This was not attributable to incomplete equilibration of the phagosomal pH with the extracellular medium during calibration, since identical results were obtained with ionophores and following disruption of cellular membranes with Triton X-100. It was reported earlier that fluorescein derivatives similar to the probes used here to monitor pH were susceptible to chlorination by peroxidases of phagocytic cells (15Hurst J.K. Albrich J.M. Green T.R. Rosen H. Klebanoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4812-4821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Klebanoff and co-workers (15Hurst J.K. Albrich J.M. Green T.R. Rosen H. Klebanoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4812-4821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that myeloperoxidase combines H2O2with chloride, yielding the highly reactive hypochlorous acid, which probably chlorinates the aromatic rings of fluorescein derivatives. Importantly, it was found that the fluorescence of these molecules is severely altered upon chlorination. This raised the possibility that the pH probes covalently attached to zymosan underwent chemical modification inside phagosomes upon generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, perhaps accounting for their altered dynamic range. This notion was tested using NaN3, a potent inhibitor of myeloperoxidase activity (16Nauseef W.M. Metcalf J.A. Root R.K. Blood. 1983; 61: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, the presence of NaN3 prevented the progressive fluorescence decrease noted in untreated samples (internalized particles in Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the dynamic range of the ratio as a function of pH was also maintained (Fig. 3 B). These observations indicate that chlorination of the probe can occur during phagosomal development in neutrophils and that inhibition of myeloperoxidases is essential for reliable measurements of pH by fluorescence. 2The exogenous addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase failed to prevent dye destruction, probably reflecting our inability to trap sufficient amounts of these enzymes in the phagosomal lumen to effectively preclude chlorination (data not shown). Therefore, all subsequent experiments were performed in media supplemented with NaN3. Whereas NaN3 is also an inhibitor of the respiratory chain, neutrophils have very few mitochondria and depend almost entirely on anaerobic sources for their metabolism (17Henson P.M. Oades Z.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Accordingly, their ability to ingest particles and to pump H+ was unimpaired by NaN3 (see below). Under conditions where destruction of the probe was precluded, we found that the phagosomal pH of neutrophils remains near neutral for a period of at least 20 min (e.g. Fig. 3 B). Two criteria indicate that the particles were fully internalized: (a) the addition of ammonium/ammonia to the extracellular space induced a sizable alkalinization, attributable to preferential permeation of ammonia across biological membranes, and (b) the particles were inaccessible to antibodies added extracellularly (not illustrated). It is noteworthy that, unlike Segal et al. (10Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect an alkalinization phase shortly after particle ingestion. This could conceivably be attributed to the modest sensitivity of the pH probes used in the alkaline range, since the pK a of fluorescein isothiocyanate is ∼6.4 and that of Oregon green is even lower. To facilitate detection of a possible alkalosis, the starting pH was lowered by using acidic solutions during phagocytosis. However, no initial alkalosis was recorded, whether the extracellular pH at the time of phagocytosis was 7.0 or even 6.5 (not shown). In addition, we tested another set of pH-sensitive fluorescent probes, namely SNAFL-1 and SNAFL-2. The pK a values of these dyes are considerably higher (7.8 and 7.7, respectively), making them more suitable to study pHp in the alkaline range. Nevertheless, no phagosomal alkalinization could be detected using these probes. Together, our findings indicate that in single adherent neutrophils, the phagosomal pH does not exceed the pH of the extracellular solution that is internalized along with the particle. We next proceeded to evaluate the contribution of the NADPH oxidase to the establishment of pHp. This was accomplished using DPI, a powerful inhibitor of the oxidase (18Doussiere J. Gaillard J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3694-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When neutrophils were allowed to internalize particles in the presence of DPI, a rapid and profound acidification of the phagosome was recorded (Fig. 4). In nine experiments, pHp equilibrated at 5.1 ± 0.5 within 2–8 min and remained at this level for at least 10 min. The acidification was fully dissipated by 100 mmconcanamycin (Fig. 4 A), confirming that it is generated by V-ATPases. The model proposed earlier by Segal and colleagues (10Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) suggested that H+ pumped by the V-ATPase provides the counterions for superoxide generation and the substrate for its dismutation and implied that the two processes are intimately coupled. This model predicts that impairment of the V-ATPase would result in the generation of a sizable membrane potential and/or the development of a very alkaline pH. The development of an opposing electrochemical potential would in turn reduce the activity of the oxidase. These predictions were tested experimentally. The effect of concanamycin on pHp was tested in cells where the oxidase was active. Contrary to the model described above, the V-ATPase inhibitor did not elicit an alkalinization (Fig.4 A, solid circles). Second, we measured the rate of generation of reactive oxygen intermediates using dihydrorhodamine. This reduced, nonfluorescent compound is converted to the fluorescent derivative rhodamine 123 upon oxidation. To ensure that phagosomal (as opposed to plasmalemmal) oxidase activity was being detected, we carried out experiments where phagosomes were identified by differential interference contrast microscopy, and only the oxidized products accumulated therein were simultaneously measured by digital fluorescence imaging (Fig. 4, C and D). We then compared the rate of rhodamine-123 generation in cells incubated in the presence and absence of concanamycin. As summarized in Fig.4 B, there was no significant difference in the activity of the oxidase when the pump was active versus inactive. In three experiments, the average fluorescence per phagosome, recorded after 5 min, was 424 ± 27 and 384 ± 89 units in the absence and presence of concanamycin, respectively. These findings indicate that the V-ATPase is not an important source of counterions for the electrogenic NADPH oxidase. It is noteworthy that the conversion of dihydrorhodamine to rho"

This was attributed to inhibition of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (Brown, A. M., Kristal, B. S., Effron, M. S., Shestopalov, A. I., Ullucci, P. A., Sheu, K.-F. R., Blass, J.

Lipoamide dehydrogenase, a component of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and two other mitochondrial complexes, catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from the bound dihydrolipoate of the neighboring dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase subunit to NAD+. This reversible reaction involves two reaction centers: a thiol pair, which accepts electrons from dihydrolipoate, and a non-covalently bound FAD moiety, which transfers electrons to NAD+. The lipoamide dehydrogenase reaction catalyzed by the purified pig heart enzyme is strongly inhibited by Zn2+(K i ∼0.15 μm) in both directions. Steady-state kinetic studies revealed that Zn2+ competes with oxidized lipoamide for the two-electron-reduced enzyme. Interaction of Zn2+ with the two-electron-reduced enzyme was directly detected in anaerobic stopped-flow experiments. Lipoamide dehydrogenase also catalyzes NADH oxidation by oxygen, yielding hydrogen peroxide as the major product and superoxide radical as a minor product. Zn2+ accelerates the oxidase reaction up to 5-fold with an activation constant of 0.09 ± 0.02 μm. Activation is a consequence of Zn2+binding to the reduced catalytic thiols, which prevents delocalization of the reducing equivalents between catalytic disulfide and FAD. A kinetic scheme that satisfactorily describes the observed effects has been developed and applied to determine a number of enzyme kinetic parameters in the oxidase reaction. The distinct effects of Zn2+ on different LADH activities represent a novel example of a reversible switch in enzyme specificity that is modulated by metal ion binding.

Preliminary analysis of individual subunit activities of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex indicated that the lipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH)1 displayed the greatest susceptibility to Zn2+ inhibition. LADH belongs to the family of flavin-disulfide oxido-reductases (11Williams Jr., C.H. Muller F. Chemistry and Biology of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-212Google Scholar), which include glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. LADH is an essential component of the multienzyme NADH-generating complexes α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, and also glycine decarboxylase in plants (12Bourguignon J. Merand V. Rawthorne S. Forest E. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these multienzyme complexes, LADH catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from the bound lipoate of the neighboring transferase subunit to NAD+. LADH also catalyzes the reduction of free lipoic acid by NADH and thus helps to maintain the reducing environment of mitochondria required for defense against reactive oxygen species and formation of electron-rich structures such as iron-sulfur clusters. Dihydrolipoic acid, the reduced form of lipoic acid, is a potent antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, peroxyl radicals, hypochlorous acid, and nitric oxide. Dihydrolipoic acid may also regenerate other antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and glutathione through redox cycling (13Packer L. Trischler H.J. Wessel K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 359-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Preliminary human studies indicate the efficacy of lipoic acid in treatment of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, excitotoxic amino acid brain injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, and other disorders involving free radical processes (13Packer L. Trischler H.J. Wessel K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 359-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 14Tirosh O. Sen C.K. Roy S. Kobayashi M.S. Packer L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). LADH (EC 1.8.1.4) is a homodimeric molecule, each subunit (∼52 kDa) contains two catalytic centers. FAD is responsible for NAD+/NADH reduction/oxidation and the redox-active disulfide interacts with the dihydrolipoyl cofactor that is covalently linked to the acetyl transferase component of each dehydrogenase complex. The reaction with lipoic acid/lipoamide is reversible. When the reaction occurs in the same direction as within the multienzyme complex, it is referred to as the forward reaction. When it proceeds in the direction of lipoic acid reduction by NADH, it is referred to as the reverse reaction. NAD++L(SH) 2→NADH+LS2forward NADH+LS2→NAD++L(SH) 2reversewhere LS2 and L(SH)2 are lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid, respectively. LADH also exhibits catalytic activity in the reduction of one- and two-electron organic and inorganic acceptors with NADH and in the reduction of molecular oxygen as shown below.

Gibson Q.H. Veeger C. Biochem. J. 1960; 77: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1). The latter can exist in forms containing both reducing equivalents on FAD (EFADH2), both reducing equivalents on thiols (EFAD(SH)2), or in the form, referred to as the charge-transfer complex, with one electron on a reduced thiol and the other electron shared between FAD and thiolate (EFADHSSH). The charge-transfer complex is the major form of two-electron-reduced enzyme and has a characteristic absorption shoulder at 530 nm distinguishing it from other enzyme forms (16Sahlman L. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8033-8038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies concluded that under anaerobic conditions of equimolar reduction with NADH the form with two reduced thiols contributes 22% and the charge-transfer complex contributes 34% to the total two-electron-reduced pig heart enzyme. Thus, the major form (44%) contains fully reduced FAD (17Veeger C. Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 64: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More recently it has been proposed that NAD+ release directly yields the charge-transfer complex. The enzyme form with fully reduced FAD is not thought to be significantly populated (18Maeda-Yorita K. Russell G.C. Guest J.R. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H.

Biol. 1991; 220: 975-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), our working hypothesis was that the target for Zn2+ inhibition is the reduced catalytic disulfide (see Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, we have undertaken detailed studies on the effect of Zn2+ on LADH-catalyzed reactions. The present paper demonstrates that submicromolar levels of free Zn2+ strongly inhibit lipoamide dehydrogenase activity by interaction with the catalytic disulfide. Zn2+ binding also stimulates production of reactive oxygen species by LADH. Steady-state and anaerobic transient kinetics experiments are presented that establish the mechanism of these phenomena.Figure 1A schematic view of LADH active center demonstrating a hydrophobic channel leading lipoic acid to the redox-active disulfide.

All reagents were “SigmaUltra grade,” if available. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ), HCl (ACS grade) was from J. T. Baker, Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). All solutions were prepared using distilled, deionized water with >15 MΩ/cm resistance. LADH from porcine heart from Sigma was additionally purified by fast protein liquid chromatography gel-filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 0.2 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. LADH concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε455 = 11,300m−1 cm−1 (22Matthews R.G. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3956-3964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Catalase from bovine liver (EC 1.11.1.6; 18,600 units/mg) and superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes (EC 1.15.1.1; 3,500 units/mg) were obtained from Sigma and used without further purification. All spectrophotometric measurements were performed in a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) with a 200-μl reaction mixture per well at 20 °C. The absorbance of NADH (ε340 = 6,220m−1 cm−1 (23Popov V.O. Gazarian I.G. Egorov A.M. Berezin I.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 466-471Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) was monitored. The light path was 0.43 cm. All reactions were run in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Each set of experiments was performed in triplicate. All data reported are as the means ± S.E. Reverse reaction: the final concentrations of reagents were 30 nm LADH, 0.05–0.2 mm LA, 0.01–0.1 mm NADH, 0.1–10 μm ZnCl2. To avoid severe substrate inhibition by NADH (17Veeger C. Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 64: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) the concentration range for NADH was chosen to be lower than that for LA. Forward reaction: the final concentrations were 30 nm LADH, 0.02–0.1 mm reduced LA, 0.2–2 mmNAD+, 1–12 μm ZnCl2 (final Me2SO concentration in individual wells was <1%). The study of this reaction in the presence of zinc is complicated because Zn2+ can be coordinated by thiols, such as reduced LA and DTT. In the presence of excess DTT (1 mm) no inhibition by Zn2+ was observed. To avoid chelating Zn2+ with excess of thiol reagents, LA in Me2SO was reduced with equimolar DTT dissolved in water and then diluted into a buffer solution saturated with argon in order to avoid oxidation. Aliquots of NAD+ and zinc solutions were placed into the wells, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of argon-saturated buffer containing reduced lipoamide and enzyme. Oxygen consumption was measured in a “Strathkelvin Instruments” (Glasgow, UK) multichannel apparatus model SI-928 with a Clark type electrode. Reactions were monitored in thermostatted (28 °C) glass chambers fitted with special glass stoppers that contained a small injection hole (Gilson) and equipped with a magnetic stirrer (“Instech” 2060, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The electrode was calibrated in the range 0–0.240 mm oxygen immediately prior to the experiments. Oxygen concentration was varied in the range 20–240 μmby bubbling buffer with argon to displace oxygen. The final concentrations of reagents were in the range 0.1–0.2 μmenzyme, 0.01–0.5 mm NADH, 0.01–0.25 NAD+, and 1–40 μm ZnCl2. Data analyses were performed using “Strathkelvin Instruments” software SI version 2.1. Each experiment with the oxygen electrode was performed in triplicate. The rate constants were calculated as an average from three independent sets of experiments. Anaerobic stopped-flow measurements were performed in duplicate using a High-Tech SF-61 stopped-flow rapid scan spectrophotometer (High Tech Scientific, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) installed in an anaerobic glove box operating under N2 with less than 1 ppm O2. The temperature was controlled at 22 °C with a Techne-400 circulator (Techne (Cambridge) Ltd., Duxford, Cambridgeshire, UK) with an external cooler. The enzyme solution and substrate powder were placed into the sealed serum vials and deoxygenated 1 h before being placed into the glove box. The 0.05m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, used in all experiments was deoxygenated overnight in the glove box. NADH (0.75 mm) and ZnCl2 (1.875 mm) stock solutions were prepared anaerobically under N2 in the same buffer. Initial experiments were performed in rapid-scan mode with a xenon lamp. The enzyme stock solution (15 μm) was shot against rising concentrations of NADH (7.5–60 μm) to determine the NADH concentration exhibiting the highest absorbance at 530 nm, which is characteristic of the two-electron-reduced LADH in the form of a charge-transfer complex (16Sahlman L. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8033-8038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this determination, a 1.5 molar excess of NADH over the enzyme was used to generate the maximum content of a charge transfer complex, which then was shot against varying concentrations of ZnCl2 (7.5–75 μm). The absorbance time-curves at 530 nm were fitted to exponential functions using a least-squares minimization program supplied by High-Tech Scientific. Since Tris is known to bind Zn2+ with a binding constant of ∼10−4m (24Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biological Research. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1986: 410Google Scholar), the 50 mm Tris buffer used in our experiments is expected to sequester most of Zn2+ added. The thermodynamic binding constant reported for Tris binding of Zn2+ must be corrected for pH and ionic strength before free Zn2+ can be calculated. The concentration of free Zn2+ available for enzyme binding was determined experimentally. In calculation of Zn2+ inhibition constants, a denominator of 20 was used to recalculate the available zinc concentration from the total added one (see data for details). No changes in the mechanism of LADH reaction were found within the range of 0.05–1 μm free Zn2+concentrations. The reaction continues to obey a ping-pong mechanism. In the reverse reaction, Zn2+ and LA compete for one and the same enzyme form. The addition of rising concentrations of zinc results in increased slopes and an unchanged intercept in double-reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[LA] (not shown). Competitive inhibition is confirmed by a clear single intersection point in the Dixon plot (see Fig. 2 A), corresponding to the inhibition constant of ∼0.15 μm. With respect to NADH, Zn2+ is an uncompetitive inhibitor showing parallel lines both in double-reciprocal plots and in the Dixon plot (not shown). Thus, zinc is unable to react with oxidized enzyme. The data fit the equationEo /v = 1/k o + 1/k NADH[NADH] + 1/k LA[LA](1 + [Zn]/K Zn) with k NADH = (2 ± 0.5) × 106m−1s−1, k LA = (3.0 ± 0.1) × 105m−1 s−1,k o′ = 300 ± 10 s−1, andK Zn = 0.15 ± 0.05 μm. Lipoamide and Zn2+ compete for the same enzyme form. It is possible that Zn2+ either attacks the charge-transfer complex, which then rearranges into a form with both thiols participating in Zn2+ binding or directly binds to the form with reduced thiols, shifting the equilibrium toward the above enzyme form. We can speculate that the catalytic His residue paired with a highly conserved Glu residue also participate in Zn2+coordination (Fig. 1). The inhibition mechanism can be described by Scheme FS1 with Zn2+ binding the two-electron-reduced enzyme in the form of a charge-transfer complex or in the form with reduced thiols. In the forward reaction of NAD+ reduction by reduced lipoamide, Zn2+ demonstrates uncompetitive inhibition with respect to lipoamide (not shown). This type of inhibition suggests that Zn2+ does not react with oxidized enzyme, which is consistent with the mechanism proposed in Scheme FS1. However, double-reciprocal plots of 1/v versus1/[NAD+] indicate that Zn2+ affects both slope and intercept (Fig.2 B). If the reaction follows the mechanism presented in Scheme FS1, the dependence of the forward reaction rate in double-reciprocal plots should display pure competitive inhibition with respect to NAD+ in accordance with Equation 1. Eo/v=1/k−1+1/k−3+(k−3+k4)/k−3k−4[LAred]Equation 1 +(1+[Zn]/Ki)](k−1+k2)/k−1k−2[NAD]Even if one accounts for the possible presence of oxidized lipoamide, the effect of Zn2+ in accordance with Scheme FS1will be seen only on the apparent rate constant for NAD+(slope), but not on intercepts as shown in Equation 2. Eo/v=1/k−1+1/k−3+(k−3+k4)/k−3k−4[LAred]+(1+k3[LA]/k−3Equation 2 +k3k4[LA]/k−3k−4[LAred]+[Zn]/Ki)(k−1+k2)/k−1k−2[NAD]Thus, the model presented in Scheme FS1 is not consistent with the experimental data. The effect of Zn2+ on both the rate constant for NAD+ and the rate constant for a unimolecular step suggests that Zn2+ binds to an enzyme form other than the one directly interacting with NAD+. Taking into account the existence of different forms of the two-electron-reduced enzyme (18Maeda-Yorita K. Russell G.C. Guest J.R. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11788-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we can introduce a unimolecular interconversion step into SchemeFS1 to get Scheme FS2, which satisfactorily describes the inhibition by Zn2+ for both reverse and forward reactions (see also TableI). The reverse and forward reactions exhibit equal values for the inhibition constant KZn = K i(1 +k −3/k 3), within experimental error (see Table I). The trend toward a larger inhibition constant determined for the forward reaction from Dixon plot (Fig.2 C, 0.22 ± 0.05 μm) compared with that determined for the reverse reaction (Fig. 2 A, 0.15 ± 0.05 μm) may originate from Zn2+ chelation by reduced lipoamide.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of Zn2+ inhibition of LADH reactionReverse reactionExperimental equation:E o/v = 1/k o′ + 1/k NADH[NADH] + 1/k LA[LA](1 + [Zn]/K Zn)Equation derived for Scheme FS2:E o/v = 1/k 2+ 1/k 5 + 1/k 3 + (1 +k −3/k 3 + [Zn]/K 1)(k −4 +k 5)/k 4 k 5[LA] + (k −1 +k 2)/k 1 k 2[NADH]First order rate constant,k o′ =k 2 k 3 k 5/(k 2+ k 3 + k 5),s −1300 ± 10Rate constant for NADHk NADH =k 1 k 2/(k −1 +k 2), m−1 s−1(2.0 ± 0.5) × 106Rate constant for LAk LA =k 4 k 5/(1 +k 3/k −3)(k −4+ k 5), m−1s−1(3.0 ± 0.1) × 105Inhibition constantK Zn = K i(1 +k −3/k 3), μm0.15 ± 0.05Forward reactionExperimental equation:E o/v = 1/k o′(1 + [Zn]/K Zn′), + 1/k NAD[NAD](1 + [Zn]/K Zn) + 1/k LA[LAred]Equation derived for Scheme FS2:E o/v = 1/k −1 + 1/k −4 + 1/k −3(1 + [Zn]/K i) + (k −4 +k 5)/k −4 k −5[LAred] + (1 + k 3/k −3 +k 3[Zn]/k −3 K i)(k −1+k 2)/k −1 k −2[NAD]First order rate constantk o′ =k −1 k −3 k −4/(k −1+ k −3 + k −4), s−130 ± 10Rate constant for reduced LAk LAred =k −4 k −5/(k −4+ k 5), m−1s−1(8.0 ± 1.0) × 104Rate constant for NAD+k NAD =k −1 k −2/(1 +k 3/k −3)(k −1+ k 2), m−1s−1(1.2 ± 0.2) × 104Inhibition constantK Zn(slope) = (1 +k −3/k 3)K i, μm0.22 ± 0.05K Zn′(intercept) = (1 +k −3/k −1 +k −3/k −4) K i, μm1.1 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab The charge transfer complex is clearly distinguishable from the oxidized enzyme and two-electron-reduced enzyme with reducing equivalents on both thiols (11Williams Jr., C.H. Muller F. Chemistry and Biology of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-212Google Scholar) due to a characteristic shoulder at 530 nm. The effect of Zn2+ on the spectrum of the two-electron-reduced enzyme was studied by the stopped-flow technique under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 3). ZnCl2 addition to the charge transfer complex leads to rapid disappearance of the 530-nm shoulder and an increase in absorption at 445 nm (see inset A in Fig. 3). Thus, the Zn2+·LADH complex is spectrally equivalent to the oxidized enzyme form. The rate of the spectral change at 530 nm displays linear dependence on Zn2+ concentration (inset B in Fig. 3). This indicates that the experimentally measurable step is Zn2+binding not interconversion between the charge-transfer complex and the dithiol form (Scheme FS3). The determined rate constant for Zn2+ interaction with the two-electron-reduced enzyme is (3.7 ± 0.7) × 105m−1 s−1. This value is comparable with the rate constant for the two-electron-reduced form interaction with lipoamide determined from the steady-state kinetics (3.0 ± 0.1 × 105m−1 s−1). Thus, Zn2+successfully competes with lipoamide for this enzyme form. The non-zero intercept at the ordinate axis clearly points to the reversibility of the reaction and corresponds to the rate constant for the Zn2+-complex dissociation (Scheme FS3). The dissociation rate constant k −i is equal to 0.040 ± 0.005 s−1. The equilibrium constant for Zn2+ binding calculated on the basis of stopped-flow measurementsK i = k −i/k i = 0.11 ± 0.04 μm, which is close to the inhibition constants determined from steady-state kinetics (Table I). The ratio between the inhibition constants determined from steady-state data and the binding constant determined from transient kinetics allows to estimate the ratiok −3/k 3 as 1.0 ± 0.5. Thus, the contribution of the charge-transfer complex and the form with reduced two thiols to the total pool of two-electron-reduced enzyme are comparable within experimental error. Zn2+ binding is reversible. This has been demonstrated both by dilution of assay mixtures and by EDTA addition, which completely reversed all inhibitory effects (data not shown). In addition, gel-filtration of the Zn2+-inhibited assay mixture restored the initial catalytic activity (results not shown). Activation of molecular oxygen by flavoproteins, yielding hydrogen peroxide (dehydrogenases/transhydrogenases, oxidases) and superoxide radical (electron transferases such as flavodoxin), is a well known process (25Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the flavoenzymes of the respiratory chain, the most abundant flavoprotein in the mitochondrial matrix (∼0.5% of matrix protein as calculated from Ref. 26Matuda S. Saheki T. J. Biochem. 1982; 91: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is lipoamide dehydrogenase. Production of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical catalyzed by lipoamide dehydrogenase was first reported in 1955 (27Huennekens F.M. Basford R.E. Gabrio B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 213: 951-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then confirmed in 1969 (28Massey V. Strickland S. Mayhew S.G. Howell L.G. Engel P.C. Matthews R.G. Schumanm M. Sullivan P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 36: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). More recently, identification of reaction products revealed the ratio between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to be 1:9 (29Bando Y. Aki K. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, no quantitative studies to determine the oxidase reaction mechanism have been reported. In the present work the formation of hydrogen peroxide as a major product was demonstrated by addition of catalase (Fig.4 A), which resulted in recovery of ∼50% of the consumed oxygen via disproportionation to O2 and H2O. Prior addition of catalase reduced the rate of oxygen consumption by half, providing further support that hydrogen peroxide is the major product (Fig. 4 B). Addition of SOD at the end of the reaction resulted in detectable O2recovery (Fig. 4, A and B) indicating the generation of superoxide anion radical, which is consistent with the published report (29Bando Y. Aki K. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Zn2+ addition increased the rate of oxygen consumption, but did not change the character or distribution of the products formed (Fig. 4 A). The stimulatory effect of Zn2+ was observed in the presence of NAD+, although the overall reaction showed strong product inhibition (Fig. 4 A). At lower oxygen concentration product inhibition by NAD+ was even more pronounced, but the stimulatory effect of Zn2+remained clearly evident (Fig. 4 C). The dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen concentration in double-reciprocal plots shows parallel lines both in the absence and in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig.5 A). It is also evident that Zn2+ affects the rate constants toward NADH and oxygen in a different manner. There is little or no increase in the rate constant toward oxygen in the presence of Zn2+"

This process, designated “dedifferentiation” is a major restriction in mass cell production for cell therapy or tissue engineering of destructive cartilage. When isolated chondrocytes are cultured in a monolayer at low density, the typical round chondrocyte morphology transforms into flattened fibroblast-like cells with profound changes in biochemical and genetic characteristics. Dedifferentiation of chondrocytes involves a gradual shift from the synthesis of type II to types I and III collagen. Interestingly, dedifferentiated chondrocytes that do not synthesize cartilage proteins in monolayer culture reexpress the chondrocyte differentiation phenotype when cultured three dimensionally in gels of agarose (10Benya P.D.

PKC regulates expression of cell adhesion molecules, such as N-cadherin, fibronectin, and its receptor α5β1 integrin, and hence controls progression of precartilage condensation to cartilage nodules (16Chang S.-H.

PKC-dependent regulation of chondrogenesis, including the expression of cell adhesion molecules, is exerted via MAP kinase subtype ERK-1 signaling (16Chang S.-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S.

Phosphorylation of ERK-1 (a major subtype of ERK in differentiating mesenchymal cells) was decreased during chondrogenesis, and inhibition of ERK-1 phosphorylation by PD98059 treatment enhanced chondrogenesis up to 2-fold (16Chang S.-H.

The pattern of ERK-1 phosphorylation was inversely related to the expression and activity of PKCα. Increased expression and activation of PKC was required for the down-regulation of ERK-1 activity, which correlated with induced chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells. In addition, inhibition or down-regulation of PKC (conditions that inhibit chondrogenesis) resulted in the activation of ERK-1, while inhibition of ERK-1 with PD98059 blocked the inhibitory effects of PKC down-regulation on chondrogenesis (16Chang S.-H.

Although the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation by the PKCα-dependent ERK-1 signaling pathway is clearly elucidated, the functions of PKCα and ERK-1 signaling in the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype have not been examined in detail. The present study investigates the roles of PKCα and ERK-1/-2 in the regulation of de- and redifferentiation of chondrocytes and compares these findings with the effects of these proteins on chondrocyte differentiation. We employ serial monolayer culture of chondrocytes derived from rabbit articular cartilage to study dedifferentiation and three-dimensional culture of dedifferentiated rabbit chondrocytes to examine redifferentiation. We report here that PKC and ERK-1/-2 are independent positive and negative regulators, respectively, of the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype. Micromass Culture and Chondrogenesis of Mesenchymal Cells—Mesenchymal cells were derived from the distal tips of Hamburger-Hamilton stage 23/24 chicken embryo wing buds and maintained as micromass culture to induce chondrogenic differentiation, as described previously (17Oh C.-D.

Briefly, the cells were suspended at a density of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and spotted into culture dishes as 15-μl drops. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to allow attachment and then maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin either in the absence or presence of various pharmacological reagents, as described for each experiment. Chondrogenesis was determined by examining the expression of cell-associated type II collagen by Western blot analysis and quantified by staining sulfated glycosaminoglycan with alcian blue, as described previously (17Oh C.-D.

Isolation and Monolayer Culture of Rabbit Articular Chondrocytes—Rabbit articular chondrocytes were released from cartilage slices of 2-week-old New Zealand White rabbits by enzymatic digestion. Briefly, after aseptic dissection cartilage slices were dissociated enzymatically for 6 h in 0.2% collagenase type II (381 units/mg solid) (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and single cells were obtained by collecting the supernatant after brief centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies) and were then plated on culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. The medium was changed every 1.5 days after seeding, and cells reached confluence by day ∼4–5. The confluent primary culture, designated as passage (P) 0, was subcultured up to P6 by plating cells at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. Isolated chondrocytes were cultured up to P6, and the fibroblastic cells were cultured in alginate gel beads as described originally by Guo et al. (21Guo J. Jourdian G.W. MacCallum D.K. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 19: 277-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells suspended by trypsin treatment were rinsed with washing solution (0.15 mNaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and suspended in 1.25% sodium alginate (Sigma) prepared in 20 mm HEPES and 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4, at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. The cell suspension was slowly dropped into a gelation solution (102 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After instantaneous gelation, the beads were allowed to further polymerize in the gelation solution for 10 min under gentle stirring and were then washed three times in five volumes of washing solution. Cells in alginate gel beads were cultured in complete medium for various periods and refed every other day. For recovery of cells, alginate gel beads were solubilized with two volumes of 50 mm EDTA and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was extracted with lysis buffer as described below. Differentiation, dedifferentiation, and redifferentiation of chondrocytes were determined by examining the accumulation of sulfated glycosaminoglycan by staining with alcian blue or by the expression of type II collagens studied by Western or Northern blot analysis, as described previously (18Yoon Y.-M. Oh C.-D. Kim D.-Y. Lee Y.-S. Park J.-W. Huh T.-L. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12353-12359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, for Western blot analysis micromass-cultured mesenchymal cells, freshly isolated chondrocytes, fibroblast-like chondrocytes that were passed as monolayer, and chondrocytes that had been cultured in alginate gel beads were utilized. Type II collagen was detected using antibodies purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) from whole cell lysates that were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Alternatively, type II collagen expression was determined by Northern blot analysis as described below. Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX). For each sample, equivalent amounts of total RNA (15 μg/lane) were denatured and fractionated on formaldehyde/agarose gels. RNA was then transferred to S&S Nytran N nylon membranes. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in 250 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 5% dextran sulfate, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml denatured single strand DNA for 3 and 12 h, respectively. Rabbit type II collagen transcript was probed with partial cDNA generated by reverse transcriptase PCR using RNA isolated from P0 cells. The forward PCR primer for type II collagen was 5′-GACCCCATGCAGTACATGCG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AGCCGCCATTGATGGTCTCC-3′. High-specific activity random-primed probes were prepared from the PCR product (370 bp) using the T7 QuickPrime kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as specified by the supplier. Filters were washed three times with 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates were prepared by extracting proteins using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mmNa3VO4). The proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose sheet was then blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. Type II collagen was detected using antibodies purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). PKC isoforms were detected using isoform-specific anti-PKC monoclonal antibodies for α, ε, λ/ι, and ζ (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Expression of adhesion molecules was determined using antibodies purchased from the following sources: rabbit anti-chick N-cadherin polyclonal antibody from Sigma, rabbit anti-human α-catenin polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz, and mouse β-catenin monoclonal antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories. The blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL system. Relative abundance of PKCα, pERK, and type II collagen was quantified by densitometric analysis of x-ray film using a GS-710 densitometer and Quantity One program (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Activation of ERK-1 and-2 was examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to activated, tyrosine- and threonine-phosphorylated ERK-1/-2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), as described previously (17Oh C.-D.

Following separation of proteins by electrophoresis, phosphorylation of ERK-1/-2 was determined by Western blot analysis. To introduce cDNA for wild type PKCα (22Goodnight J.A. Mischak H. Kolch W.

Transfection of the expression vector was performed as described previously (24Kim, J.-Y., Yang, M.-S., Oh, C.-D., Kim, K.-T., Ha, M.-J., Kang, S.-S., and Chun, J.-S. Biochem. J., 337, 275–280Google Scholar). The expression vector (5 μg) was introduced to cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The transfected cells, which were cultured in complete medium for 48 h, were used for further assay as indicated in each experiment. Chondrocytes at the various passages were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The fixed cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with antibodies (10 μg/ml) against type II collagen, PKCα, pERK in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. For visualizing type II collagen, PKCα, and pERK during chondrogenesis, differentiating mesenchymal cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with the corresponding antibody, and visualized by developing with VECTASTAIN ABC and DAB substrate solution kits (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Micromass culture-induced chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells was accompanied by increased expression of PKCα and decreased phosphorylation of ERK (Fig.1 A). Our previous biochemical analyses demonstrated that inhibition or down-regulation of PKCα blocked chondrogenesis, whereas inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PD98059 enhanced this process (16Chang S.-H.

In this study, expression of PKCα and phosphorylation of ERK were visualized in chondrifying mesenchymal cells. Immunocytochemical staining revealed that type II collagen was highly expressed in cells located in cartilage nodules, which are composed of differentiated chondrocytes (Fig. 1 B,left panel). Similar to the staining pattern of type II collagen, PKCα staining was strongly positive in cartilage nodule cells at day 4 (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). Staining of phosphorylated ERK was strong for the 1-day culture with a homogenous distribution pattern (data not shown), but became very weak in cells at day 4 of culture (Fig. 1 B, right panel). This may be due to a reduced amount of phosphorylated ERK at day 4, as shown by Western blot analysis. The remaining phosphorylated ERK was highly stained on the edge of cartilage nodules but completely absent inside of cartilage nodules. Thus, cells synthesizing type II collagen are strongly positive for PKCα staining, but negative for phosphorylated active ERK, supporting our previous conclusion that increased expression of PKCα and decreased ERK activity regulate chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells. We initially examined the patterns of PKCα expression and ERK activity during de- and redifferentiation of chondrocytes to determine the roles of these proteins in the maintenance of differentiated chondrocyte phenotype. Rabbit articular chondrocytes were employed to attain a homogeneous differentiated population since cells maintained as micromass culture for 5 days comprise both differentiated chondrocytes and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. Rabbit articular chondrocytes, seeded into a culture dish at a density of 5 × 104cells/cm2, reached confluence by day ∼4–5. Cells at this stage (designated “P0”) maintained typical chondrocyte morphology, with rounded and polygonal shapes. Serial subculturing of cells to P6 resulted in flattened and fibroblast-like morphology (data not shown). Type II collagen expression, determined by Northern and Western blot analyses (Fig.2 A), and accumulation of sulfated glycosaminoglycan, established by alcian blue staining (Fig.2 B), were high at P0, began to decrease at P1, and were almost undetectable at P3 and thereafter, confirming typical chondrocyte dedifferentiation by monolayer culture. PKCα levels decreased during dedifferentiation in an analogous manner to type II collagen expression and accumulation of sulfated proteoglycan (Fig. 2 A). The decrease in PKCα expression was observed throughout the culture period, although the degree of reduction was less dramatic than that observed with type II collagen or proteoglycan synthesis (Fig. 2 B). Other PKC isoforms expressed in chondrocytes, including ε, ζ, and λ/ι, did not exhibit any significant changes in expression patterns (Fig.2 A). In contrast to the pattern of PKCα expression, low-level ERK-1/-2 phosphorylation was observed in primary chondrocytes at P0, and subsequent monolayer culturing resulted in up to 15-fold increase in phosphorylation that was detectable as early as P1. However, no accompanying changes in ERK-1/-2 expression were observed (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the pattern of ERK-1/-2 phosphorylation was reverse to that of type II collagen expression. Next, we examined changes in PKCα expression and ERK phosphorylation during redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes. As shown in Fig. 3 A, when cells were cultured three dimensionally in alginate gel beads, the loss of type II collagen expression in monolayer-cultured dedifferentiated chondrocytes was reversed in all examined passages up to P6. Type II collagen expression in P4 cells cultured in alginate gel was detected as early as day 2, and increased as cells were cultured for longer periods (Fig.3 B). Similar to the expression pattern of type II collagen, PKCα expression was decreased in P4 chondrocytes and levels began to increase by day 2 on culturing in alginate gel beads. However, expression of other PKC isoforms remained unaffected on three-dimensional culture (data not shown). In contrast to PKCα, the increased levels of phosphorylated ERK-1/-2 in P4 cells in monolayer culture decreased back to concentrations observed in P0 cells in these conditions, but with no corresponding changes in ERK-1/-2 expression (Fig. 3 B). Since the respective decrease and increase in PKCα expression during de- and redifferentiation suggests a possible function in the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype, the role of this protein was examined by studying inhibition or down-regulation patterns in chondrocytes at P0. For this purpose, primary chondrocytes were treated with PKC inhibitors, GF109203X (25Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajak"

Mice with GP130 gene knocked out in a cardiac-specific manner showed the decompensation in response to pressure overload (17Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A.K. Rajewsky K., Gu, Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), suggesting that the GP130/Janus kinase/STAT pathway is critical for adaptation in response to extracellular stresses. When cardiac hypertrophy occurs, angiogenesis has been demonstrated to be essential for adaptation (18Tomanek R.J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1990; 15: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that STAT3 is required for GP130-mediated induction of VEGF, a potent angiogenic factor, in cardiomyocytes (19Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Osugi T. Hirota H. Izumi M. Yoshizaki K. Walsh K. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10561-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study (20Giordano F.J. Gerber H.-P. Williams S.-P. VanBruggen N. Bunting S. Ruiz-Lozano P., Gu, Y. Nath A.K. Huang Y. Hickey R. Dalton N. Peterson K.L. Ross J.J. Chien K.R. Ferrara N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cardiac-specific ablation of theVEGF gene resulted in failure to maintain cardiac function. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that the activation of STAT3 in cardiac myocytes plays an important role in vascular formation in the heart through the paracrine system and contributes to the maintenance of cardiac function. In this study, we aimed to clarify the biological significance of STAT3 in cardiac myocyte-vascular endothelial cell interaction. For this purpose, we generated the adenovirus vector expressing the constitutively active form of STAT3 (caSTAT3) (6Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Adenoviral transfection of caSTAT3 in cardiomyocytes leads to an increase in VEGF mRNA expression. The conditioned medium from caSTAT3-transfected cardiac myocytes promoted endothelial tubule formation, which was inhibited by anti-VEGF antibody. Next, we generated cardiac myocyte-specific transgenic mice (TG) expressing caSTAT3 under the control of α-myosin heavy chain(α-MHC) gene promoter and analyzed vascular formation in the hearts of these mice that showed the up-regulation of VEGF both in mRNA and protein level accompanied by an increase in capillary density and enhanced expression of VE-cadherin compared with those in non-transgenic littermates. These findings indicate that constitutive activation of STAT3 in cardiomyocytes promotes vascular formation in the heart, suggesting a novel function of STAT3 as a regulator of vascularization in the heart. Primary cultures of rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (13Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The ventricles of the hearts were isolated from neonatal rats and treated with trypsin and collagenase. Isolated cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in M-199 containing 10% calf serum. Cultures were then enriched with myocytes by preplating for 60 min to deplete non-myocyte population, and non-attached cells were cultured in M-199 with 10% calf serum. Immunofluorescent examination with anti-sarcomeric α-actinin antibody revealed that >90% cultured cells consisted of cardiac myocytes (data not shown). caSTAT3 cDNA was kindly provided by Drs. J. F. Bromberg and J. E. Darnell, Jr. (The Rockefeller University, New York) (6Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). The adenovirus vector expressing caSTAT3 (adeno-caSTAT3) was generated according to the protocol described elsewhere (21Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). caSTAT3 cDNA was subcloned into the multicloning site of the pACCMVpLpA vector, and pACCMVpLpA-caSTAT3 plasmid was co-transfected with JM17 plasmid into 293 cells to allow for homologous recombination. The adeno-caSTAT3 construct was cloned with the plaque formation method and amplified in 293 cells. Finally, the adenovirus vector was purified by ultracentrifugation in the presence of CsCl. Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (19Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Osugi T. Hirota H. Izumi M. Yoshizaki K. Walsh K. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K.

Chien (University of California, San Diego, CA), and the VEGF probe was generated as described previously (19Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Osugi T. Hirota H. Izumi M.

Total RNA was prepared with the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated by 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in 20× SSC. After prehybridization in a hybridization buffer (650 mmsodium chloride, 100 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, 10 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA), the membranes were hybridized with the32P-labeled probes at 42 °C for 15 h. Membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C. Isolated hearts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a Polytron homogenizer. Protein concentration was measured with BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins (30 μg) were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking in TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 2% skim milk, membranes were probed with anti-VE-cadherin, anti-Cdk4, anti-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG (Upstate Biotechnology) antibody. ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used for the detection. VEGF contents in the hearts were measured as described previously (19Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Osugi T.

The hearts from TG or non-TG mice were homogenated in lysis buffer (n = 4 each). Crude extracts were then prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and VEGF concentrations were measured by using a VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Quantikine M mouse VEGF, R&D Systems). VEGF concentrations were normalized with protein concentration assessed with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Angiogenic activities of the conditioned medium were measured with an angiogenesis kit (KURABO) according to the protocol by the manufacturer (23Bishop E.T. Bell G.T. Bloor S. Broom I.J. Hendry N.F.K. Wheatley D.N. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes (5 × 106 cells/well) were incubated with adenoviral vector-expressing β-galactosidase or caSTAT3 at a moi 20 in M-199 with 2% fetal calf serum for 12 h. After transfection, cells were washed three times and cultured in 1 ml of serum-depleted M-199 for 24 h. An equal amount of the conditioned medium from the cardiac myocyte culture was added to the basal medium of the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)/fibroblast co-culture. The medium was changed every 3 days. HUVECs were cultured in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml of anti-mouse VEGF antibody (Genzyme Techne) or non-immune IgG (Caltag Laboratories) for 9 days and stained with anti-CD31 antibody according to the protocol by the manufacturer. Capillary density was estimated with the Chalkley count method (24Fox S.B. Leek R.D. Weekes M.P. Whitehouse R.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. J. Pathol. 1995; 177: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the caSTAT3 gene, caSTAT3 TG, were generated as described previously (15Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Funamoto M. Osugi T. Yamada S. Okabe M. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). caSTAT3 cDNA was subcloned intoSalI site of pBSIISK(+)-α-MHC plasmid, a kind gift from Dr. J. Robbins (Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH) (25Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was digested with NotI to generate an 8.4-kbp DNA fragments. Transgenic mice lines were generated using BDF-1 xBDF-1 fertilized eggs as described elsewhere (26Ikawa M. Yamada S. Nakanishi T. Okabe M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The generation of transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the dominant negative form of STAT3 (dnSTAT3) was described previously (19Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E.

The care of all animals was in compliance with Osaka University animal care guidelines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (6Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar) with some modification. Whole extracts (5 μg of proteins) from non-TG or TG heart ventricles were incubated with32P-labeled m67 (5′-dGATTTCCCGTAAATCAT-3′) probe (0.5 ng) in 20 μl of reaction buffer (14 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 52 mm KCl, 4.2 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm EDTA, 12.5% glycerol). The DNA-protein complex was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed with Vecstatin ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the protocol by the manufacturer. Four transgenic mice and four of their non-transgenic littermates (10–12-weeks-old) were sacrificed, and their hearts were isolated immediately. The hearts were frozen, and 10-μm sections were prepared with a Microm HM500MS (Zeiss) and fixed with ice-cold acetone. After blocking with 2% rabbit serum in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated first with anti-CD31 antibody (PharMingen) and then with biotinylated secondary antibody and finally with a preformed avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex. Sections were developed in peroxidase substrate solution. To achieve a high frequency of the transfection in cardiac myocytes (27Kirshenbaum L.A. MacLellan W.R. Mazur W. French B.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), adenovirus vector was generated as described previously (21Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The structure of the adeno-caSTAT3 is shown in Fig. 1 A. Mutations at positions 661 and 663 induce the conformational changes in the STAT3 molecule, leading to the formation of activated STAT3 (6Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Adenovirus vector expressing β-galactosidase was used as a control. Cells were incubated with adenovirus vectors for 12 h and cultured in serum-depleted medium for 8 h. Total RNA was prepared and Northern blotted for VEGF mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1 B, transfection of caSTAT3 resulted in an increase in VEGF mRNA expression. A higher level of VEGF mRNA expression was also detected in caSTAT3-transfected cardiomyocytes even at moi 2 but not in β-galactosidase-transfected cells at moi 20, indicating that VEGF mRNA up-regulation is unlikely to result from the artificial effects of adenovirus infection. To examine the functional relevance of up-regulation of VEGF in caSTAT3-transfected cells, we examined the angiogenic activities in the culture medium from the caSTAT3-transfected cardiomyocytes. The conditioned medium was prepared from cardiomyocyte culture transfected with adenoviral vector-expressing β-galactosidase or adeno-caSTAT3 and added to the basal medium of HUVEC/fibroblast co-culture. Tubule formation was examined by staining with anti-CD31 antibody. As shown in Fig.2, the conditioned medium from caSTAT3-transfected cardiomyocytes promoted tubule formation, which was inhibited by two-thirds by anti-mouse VEGF antibody but not by non-immune IgG. We generated transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of caSTAT3 (Fig. 3). Three transgenic lines were obtained that showed an approximate 10-fold increase in STAT3 protein expression compared with endogenous STAT3 in non-TG littermates. All the transgenic lines showed a similar phenotype. Using an oligonucleotide probe containing the STAT3 binding motif, electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the protein extract from caSTAT3 TG hearts showed enhanced DNA binding activity in the absence of extracellular stimuli such as leukemia inhibitory factor (11Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani K. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Anti-STAT3 antibody inhibited DNA-protein complex formation, and the DNA-protein complex was supershifted by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.3 C). These results show that caSTAT3 transgene product functions in vivo as a constitutively active STAT3 in cardiomyocytes without extracellular stimuli. To analyze the expression of VEGF mRNA in caSTAT TG hearts, total RNA from the hearts of TG mice (n = 3) and from those of non-TG littermates (n = 3) (5-weeks-old) were Northern blotted for VEGF. As shown in Fig.4 B, VEGF mRNA expression in caSTAT3 TG increased by 49 ± 13% (p < 0.05) compared with that in non-TG hearts. We next measured VEGF protein in the hearts from transgenic mice. Crude protein extracts were prepared from TG mice (n = 4) and from non-TG mice (n = 4), and VEGF concentrations were measured with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.4 C, VEGF protein was also up-regulated in caSTAT3 TG hearts in comparison with that in non-TG hearts. To examine the biological activities of STAT3 as a regulator of vessel formation in vivo, we examined the capillary density of hearts from TG and non-TG littermates by immunostaining with anti-CD31 antibody. To avoid inaccurate estimation because of angling of the sections, the sections were cut perpendicularly to the major axis, and the number of CD31-positive vasculatures in the endocardium were counted at the papillary muscle level. As shown in Fig.5, capillary density was increased by 17% in caSTAT3 TG hearts (n = 4) compared with non-TG hearts (n = 4) (3928 ± 415 and 3360 ± 97, respectively, p < 0.05). For quantitative evaluation of the vasculature in the hearts, immunoblot analyses of VE-cadherin, an endothelial-specific component, and of Cdk4, an internal control, were performed. VE-cadherin expression was enhanced in caSTAT3 TG hearts but not in dnSTAT3 TG (Fig. 6 A). Using densitometer, we quantified the relative intensity of the bands for VE-cadherin in caSTAT3 TG heart extracts in comparison with that in non-TG heart extracts. As shown in Fig. 6 B, caSTAT3 TG hearts (n = 3) showed an increase in VE-cadherin protein expression by 47 ± 7% compared with non-TG hearts (n = 3) (p < 0.01). In this study, we provided evidence that cardiac myocyte-specific activation of STAT3 mediates vascular formation in the heart. In detail, adenoviral gene transfer of caSTAT3 induced VEGF mRNA. The conditioned medium from caSTAT3-transfected cardiomyocytes showed angiogenic activities, which were inhibited by anti-VEGF antibody. We generated cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing caSTAT3 and demonstrated that VEGF mRNA is induced in caSTAT3 TG hearts and that VE-cadherin expression is increased in caSTAT3 TG hearts, which is consistent with the increase in capillary density. Previously, we demonstrated that STAT3 regulates VEGF production in cardiomyocytes (19Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Osugi T. Hirota H. Izumi M. Yoshizaki K. Walsh K. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10561-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consistently, in the current study, cardiomyocytes transfected with caSTAT3 showed enhanced expression of VEGF mRNA. To clarify the biological significance of STAT3 as a regulator of vascularization, we generated an adenoviral construct expressing caSTAT3 and analyzed the angiogenic activities in the conditioned medium from caSTAT3-transfected cardiomyocytes by means of endothelial tubule formation assay. The conditioned medium from caSTAT3-transfected cardiomyocytes was found to promote endothelial tubule formation, whereas anti-VEGF antibody inhibited caSTAT3-mediated angiogenic activity significantly. Although it remains unclear why anti-VEGF antibody could not produce the complete inhibition, these data indicated that activation of STAT3 in cardiac myocytes stimulated angiogenic paracrine system and that VEGF is one of the important angiogenic paracrine factors from cardiomyocytes. To examine the effects on caSTAT3 on vascular formation in vivo, we generated cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing caSTAT3 that showed an increase in VEGF mRNA expression in the hearts by 49 ± 13% at the age of 5-weeks-old, similar to the results from the in vitro assay. Later at 20-weeks-old, the expression of VEGF mRNA in the caSTAT3 TG hearts was reduced to the same level as that in non-TG hearts (data not shown). Asα-MHC promoter starts to be activated remarkably in the ventricles at the age of 2 weeks (28Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1995; 78: 504-509Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), VEGF mRNA is induced transiently and might be negatively regulated, possibly by endogenous negative regulators such as protein inhibitor of activated STAT (29Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analyses with anti-CD31 antibody revealed that capillary density increased in caSTAT3 TG hearts, demonstrating that vessel growth is promoted in caSTAT3 TG hearts. Because capillary density estimation might be influenced by hypercontraction during sample preparation, we estimated vessel formation by quantifying the expression of VE-cadherin, which is an endothelial-specific component and is essential for endothelium maintenance (30Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.-G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oosthuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. Ruiter M.C. Groot A.G. Poelmann R. Lupu F. Herbert J.-M. Collen D. Dejana E. Cell. 1999; 98: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). VE-cadherin was up-regulated in caSTAT3 TG hearts by 47% in comparison with non-TG hearts, providing the corroborative evidence that vasculature is enriched in caSTAT3 TG hearts. Moreover, VE-cadherin induction is specific for the activation of STAT3, because VE-cadherin expression did not increase in the dnSTAT3 TG hearts. These findings indicate that STAT3 is a positive modulator of vascular formation in the hearts. Our study has demonstrated that the promotion of vascular formation in caSTAT3 TG hearts is accompanied by VEGF induction. Theoretically, causality could be proved by generating VEGF gene-ablated mice overexpressing caSTAT3. However, at the present time, the feasibility of such an experimental procedure is severely limited, because VEGF gene-ablated mice are characterized by the embryonic lethality (31Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L. Gertsenstein M. Fahrig M. Vandenhoeck A. Harpal K. Eberhardt C. Declercq C. Pawling J. Moons L. Collen D. Risau W. Nagy A. Nature. 1996; 380: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar), and because cardiac-specific ablation of the VEGF gene itself leads to cardiac abnormality (20Giordano F.J. Gerber H.-P. Williams S.-P. VanBruggen N. Bunting S. Ruiz-Lozano P., Gu, Y. Nath A.K. Huang Y. Hickey R. Dalton N. Peterson K.L. Ross J.J. Chien K.R. Ferrara N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that STAT3 could regulate vessel growth through systems other than the VEGF paracrine pathway. Coronary vessel growth is a critical event in the adaptation to left ventricular hypertrophy (18Tomanek R.J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1990; 15: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Tomanek R.J. Schalk K.A. Marcus M.L. Harrison D.G. Circ.

Among various kinds of angiogenic growth factors, VEGF is thought to play an important role in the regulation of vessel formation in the heart, because VEGF paracrine pathway of cardiac myocytes is needed to maintain cardiac function (20Giordano F.J. Gerber H.-P. Williams S.-P. VanBruggen N. Bunting S. Ruiz-Lozano P., Gu, Y. Nath A.K. Huang Y. Hickey R. Dalton N. Peterson K.L. Ross J.J. Chien K.R. Ferrara N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, cardiac-specific ablation of GP130 gene results in heart failure in conjunction with inactivation of STAT3 during pressure overload-induced hypertrophy (17Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A.K.

The results presented here are also reminiscent of oncogenic activities of STAT3, because tumor growth is accompanied by tumor angiogenesis (36Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). STAT3 is required for cellular transformation by v-src(37Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell J.J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), whereas constitutive activation of STAT3 is sufficient for tumorigenesis (6Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1, a negative regulator of the Janus kinase/STAT pathway, is silenced by methylation in human hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating that STAT3 activation is responsible for oncogenesis in some cases of human hepatoma (38Yoshikawa H. Matsubara K. Qian G.-S. Jackson P. Groopman J.D. Manning J.E. Harris C.C. Herman J.G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 29-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The totality of findings presented here suggests that activated STAT3 could well transduce angiogenic signals as well as cell-proliferative and -cytoprotective signals, thus leading to the formation of feeding arteries in growing tumors. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that cardiac-specific activation of STAT3 promotes vascular formation in the hearts. Therefore, we suggest a novel function of STAT3 namely as a positive modulator of vessel growth. We thank J. Hironaka for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1964106770,"Besides the regulation of hematopoiesis, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces the expression of a functional program in cultured endothelial cells (ECs) related to angiogenesis and to the their survival in bone marrow microenvironment. ECs express the specific GM-CSF receptor that signals through the recruitment and the activation of Janus kinase (JAK)2 (Soldi et al., Blood 89, 863-872, 1987). We now report that GM-CSF in vivo induces angiogenesis and activates JAK-2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-3. This cytokine has an angiogenetic activity in chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) without recruitment of inflammatory cells and induces vessel sprouting from chicken aorta rings. When added to CAM, subnanomolar concentrations of GM-CSF cause a rapid phosphorylation in tyrosine residues of JAK-2 persisting at least for 10 min. Furthermore, we show that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-3, but not STAT-5, also are phosphorylated for 30 min after GM-CSF stimulation. AG-490, a JAK-2 inhibitor, reduced in a dose-dependent manner the angiogenic effect of GM-CSF in CAM. These findings provide the first evidence that the JAK-2/STAT-3 pathway is activated in vivo and participates in vessel formation triggered by GM-CSF."

They were functionally expressed in yeastCOQ2 disruptant and showed a strict substrate specificity for geranyl diphosphate as the prenyl donor, in contrast to ubiquinone biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting that they are involved in the biosynthesis of shikonin, a naphthoquinone secondary metabolite. Regulation of their expression by various culture conditions coincided with that of geranyltransferase activity and the secondary metabolites biosynthesized via this enzyme. This is the first established plant prenyltransferase that transfers the prenyl chain to an aromatic substrate.

This is the first established plant prenyltransferase that transfers the prenyl chain to an aromatic substrate. The prenylation reaction of aromatic substrates is involved in the biosynthesis of diverse molecules that play important roles in various biological activities in bacteria to mammals, e.g. electron transport via ubiquinone and plastoquinone (1Grunler J. Ericsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 259-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In higher plants, such prenylation largely contributes to the diversification of aromatic secondary metabolites, with regard to both their chemical structures and biological activities. For instance, some prenylated flavonoids act as phytoalexins that are involved in plant defense mechanisms (2Tahara S. Ibrahim R.K. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 1073-1094Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Morandi D.

Due to these interesting properties, intensive biochemical studies have been conducted to identify plant prenyltransferases which catalyze the transfer of prenyl diphosphate to an aromatic ring to generate a prenylated derivative, such as flavones (7Yamamoto H.

Planta. 1998; 205: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, there has been no report on the identification of the genes that encode such prenyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites.Shikonin, a red naphthoquinone derivative, is a secondary metabolite that specifically occurs in boraginaceous plants, and is the active principle of the medicinal plant Lithospermum erythrorhizon(17Tabata M. Plant Tissue Culture Lett. 1996; 13: 117-125Crossref Google Scholar). Since this compound and its derivatives exhibit antibacterial activity, their functions as phytoalexins have also been reported (18Brigham L.A. Michaels P.J. Flores H.E.

Matsuoka H. Ujihara T. Sato F. Plant Biotechnol. 1999; 16: 335-342Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This enzyme plays a critical role in the regulation of shikonin biosynthesis in cell cultures of L. erythrorhizon, i.e. up- and down-regulation of this enzyme activity directly affects the production of shikonin (21Heide L. Nishioka N. Fukui H. Tabata M. Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 1873-1877Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Gaisser S. Heide L. Phytochemistry. 1996; 41: 1065-1072Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity is strongly suppressed by light irradiation, ammonium ion, and the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (23Yazaki K. Matsuoka H. Shimomura K. Bechthold A. Sato F. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas this activity is enhanced with the addition of oligogalacturonide (OG) (24Tani M. Takeda K. Yazaki K. Tabata M. Phytochemistry. 1993; 34: 1285-1290Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and methyl jasmonate (MJ) (25Yazaki K. Takeda K. Tabata M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 776-782Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to the medium. It has also been reported using a partially purified enzyme that this protein is ER membrane-bound and shows strict substrate specificity for geranyl (C10) diphosphate for the chain length of the prenyl donor (16Mühlenweg A. Melzer M., Li, S-M. Heide L. Planta. 1998; 205: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is in clear contrast to the mitochondrial polyprenyltransferase for ubiquinone biosynthesis (26Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We attempted to isolate the cDNA of geranyltransferase fromL. erythrorhizon as a model, since these characteristic properties should be advantageous for identifying the gene product.In this report, we describe the isolation of two cDNAs for the prenyltransferase, designated LePGT-1 and -2 ( L . e rythrorhizonp-hydroxybenzoate:geranyltransferase) from L. erythrorhizon cultured cells, and functional expression of the gene products in yeast. A direct correlation between this gene expression and shikonin accumulation shows that they are involved in the secondary metabolism.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we cloned and performed structural analyses of two cDNAs that encode geranyl diphosphate:4-hydroxybenzoate 3-geranyltransferase from cultured L. erythrorhizon cells (Fig. 1). Heterologous expression in yeast showed that both gene products exhibit enzyme activity to transfer the geranyl moiety to an aromatic substrate 4HB, and in particular they show exclusive specificity for the C10 substrate GPP (Fig. 3), which are critical points for determining that these enzymes are responsible for shikonin biosynthesis (16Mühlenweg A. Melzer M., Li, S-M. Heide L. Planta. 1998; 205: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Each organism has a specific chain length for prenyl moiety of ubiquinone molecule, and the side chain is usually penta- to decaprenyl residue, i.e. ubiqiunone-5 to -10. It is very unlikely that the diprenyl-4HB, which is the specific product of LePGTs, is converted to ubiquinone having geranyl residue as the prenyl chain. To exclude the possibility that LePGTs might be involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in vivo, complementation studies were also done. The yeast COQ2 disruptant was transformed with LePGT-1 or -2, but the transformants failed to grow on glycerol medium, whereas the COQ2-containing plasmid, as a positive control, complemented the phenotype of disruptant (Fig. 2). Similarly, the plant ortholog AtPPT-1 also showed the same complementation inCOQ2-disrupted fission yeast. 2K. Okada, personal communication. These results strongly support our conclusion that the LePGT cDNAs are not involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in L. erythrorhizon.The K m values of LePGT-1 to both substrates are apparently different from those of LePGT-2. As theK m values of native LePGT were reported to be 18.4 μm for 4HB and 13.8 μm for GPP (16Mühlenweg A. Melzer M., Li, S-M. Heide L. Planta. 1998; 205: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which are similar to those of LePGT-1 (10.3 and 5.1 μm, respectively), but a direct comparison is not appropriate, because theK m values of native enzyme were determined with a partial purified protein, and thus it may be a mixture of LePGT-1 and -2. It is not clear whether these two gene products play different roles in vivo, but their expression patterns in L. erythrorhizon are very similar (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). They might be expressed in different cell types in root tissue.LePGT polypeptides are predicted to have 8 or 9 transmembrane domains based on a hydropathy analysis by Kyte and Doolittle and a program on CBS servers (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-1.0/). There are two obvious hydrophilic loops where the NDXXD motif and GX(K/Y)STAL motif are localized. They are presumed to be the binding sites for the substrate, i.e. the former is for prenyl diphosphate as seen in prenyl diphosphate synthases, and the latter is probably important for the aromatic substrate (39Melzer M. Heide L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More detailed analyses are needed to define the differences in the structure that contribute to the strict substrate specificity of LePGT for GPP.The phylogenetic tree is shown in Fig. 7. Bacterial polyprenyltransferases tend to form a cluster, whereas eukaryotic polyprenyltransferases do not. This is at least partly attributable to the divergence of the mitochondrial sorting signal sequence in each molecular species. In particular, a plant ortholog of LePGT, Arabidopsis polyprenyltransferase, seems to be more divergent than those of unicellular eukaryotes and Caenorhabditis elegans (46Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Although the mitochondrial targeting signal is absent in LePGT polypeptides, they may be derived from such prenyltransferase for ubiquinone biosynthesis. It is presumed that during evolution they lost the mitochondrial signal to localize in the ER membrane, which is advantageous both for the biosynthesis and secretion of shikonin out of cells, and gained substrate specificity for GPP. Since most organisms need ubiquinone to survive in the wild,Lithospermum cells should also have another 4HB:prenyltransferase localized in mitochondria. In fact, four to five bands were observed in the genomic Southern blot (data not shown).Northern analyses revealed that the modes of regulation of gene expression were completely consistent with that of geranyltransferase activity using both positive and negative regulators (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). The other biosynthetic genes involved in shikonin biosynthesis, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (45Yazaki K. Kataoka M. Honda G. Severin K. Heide L. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1995-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and 4-coumarate CoA ligase (47Yazaki K. Ogawa A. Tabata M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1319-1329PubMed Google Scholar) which may be also involved in lithospermic acid B production in this plant (48Yamamoto H. Inoue K. Yazaki K. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), did not show such a close correlation with shikonin accumulation. This indicates that LePGTs play a pivotal role in the regulation of shikonin biosynthesis at the gene expression level. Due to these attractive properties, LePGTs are suitable for use as model genes to study the molecular mechanism of dark-inducible secondary metabolism, and also its regulation by auxins and elicitors in higher plants.In contrast to prenyltransferases involved in chain elongation of prenyl diphosphate, those involved in 4HB prenylation have not yet been subjected to molecular analyses. LePGTs isolated in this study are the first cDNAs that encode plant prenyltransferases which catalyze the transfer of the prenyl moiety to an aromatic substrate. They could be very powerful tools for characterizing prenylation of the aromatic moiety at a molecular level, e.g. identification of the 4HB-binding site. An interesting feature of these prenyltransferases is their clear preference for GPP as the substrate; this should be further characterized using chimeric enzymes with prenyltransferases that show broad substrate specificity, such as 4HPT. From a biotechnological point of view, these cDNAs are expected to be useful for genetic engineering of shikonin production (49Sommer S. Koehle A. Yazaki K. Shimomura K. Bechthold A. Heide L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), since geranylation is a “bottle-neck” reaction in shikonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, as heterologous probes, these cDNAs may lead to breakthroughs in molecular genetic studies on the secondary metabolism of cannabinoid and prenylated flavonoids and coumarins, which involve prenyltransferase reactions. The prenylation reaction of aromatic substrates is involved in the biosynthesis of diverse molecules that play important roles in various biological activities in bacteria to mammals, e.g. electron transport via ubiquinone and plastoquinone (1Grunler J. Ericsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 259-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).

Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). The other biosynthetic genes involved in shikonin biosynthesis, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (45Yazaki K. Kataoka M. Honda G. Severin K. Heide L. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1995-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and 4-coumarate CoA ligase (47Yazaki K. Ogawa A. Tabata M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1319-1329PubMed Google Scholar) which may be also involved in lithospermic acid B production in this plant (48Yamamoto H. Inoue K. Yazaki K. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), did not show such a close correlation with shikonin accumulation. This indicates that LePGTs play a pivotal role in the regulation of shikonin biosynthesis at the gene expression level. Due to these attractive properties, LePGTs are suitable for use as model genes to study the molecular mechanism of dark-inducible secondary metabolism, and also its regulation by auxins and elicitors in higher plants.In contrast to prenyltransferases involved in chain elongation of prenyl diphosphate, those involved in 4HB prenylation have not yet been subjected to molecular analyses. LePGTs isolated in this study are the first cDNAs that encode plant prenyltransferases which catalyze the transfer of the prenyl moiety to an aromatic substrate. They could be very powerful tools for characterizing prenylation of the aromatic moiety at a molecular level, e.g. identification of the 4HB-binding site. An interesting feature of these prenyltransferases is their clear preference for GPP as the substrate; this should be further characterized using chimeric enzymes with prenyltransferases that show broad substrate specificity, such as 4HPT. From a biotechnological point of view, these cDNAs are expected to be useful for genetic engineering of shikonin production (49Sommer S. Koehle A. Yazaki K. Shimomura K. Bechthold A. Heide L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), since geranylation is a “bottle-neck” reaction in shikonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, as heterologous probes, these cDNAs may lead to breakthroughs in molecular genetic studies on the secondary metabolism of cannabinoid and prenylated flavonoids and coumarins, which involve prenyltransferase reactions. In this study, we cloned and performed structural analyses of two cDNAs that encode geranyl diphosphate:4-hydroxybenzoate 3-geranyltransferase from cultured L. erythrorhizon cells (Fig. 1). Heterologous expression in yeast showed that both gene products exhibit enzyme activity to transfer the geranyl moiety to an aromatic substrate 4HB, and in particular they show exclusive specificity for the C10 substrate GPP (Fig. 3), which are critical points for determining that these enzymes are responsible for shikonin biosynthesis (16Mühlenweg A. Melzer M., Li, S-M. Heide L. Planta. 1998; 205: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Each organism has a specific chain length for prenyl moiety of ubiquinone molecule, and the side chain is usually penta- to decaprenyl residue, i.e. ubiqiunone-5 to -10. It is very unlikely that the diprenyl-4HB, which is the specific product of LePGTs, is converted to ubiquinone having geranyl residue as the prenyl chain. To exclude the possibility that LePGTs might be involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in vivo, complementation studies were also done. The yeast COQ2 disruptant was transformed with LePGT-1 or -2, but the transformants failed to grow on glycerol medium, whereas the COQ2-containing plasmid, as a positive control, complemented the phenotype of disruptant (Fig. 2). Similarly, the plant ortholog AtPPT-1 also showed the same complementation inCOQ2-disrupted fission yeast. 2K. Okada, personal communication. These results strongly support our conclusion that the LePGT cDNAs are not involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in L. erythrorhizon. The K m values of LePGT-1 to both substrates are apparently different from those of LePGT-2. As theK m values of native LePGT were reported to be 18.4 μm for 4HB and 13.8 μm for GPP (16Mühlenweg A. Melzer M., Li, S-M. Heide L. Planta. 1998; 205: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which are similar to those of LePGT-1 (10.3 and 5.1 μm, respectively), but a direct comparison is not appropriate, because theK m values of native enzyme were determined with a partial purified protein, and thus it may be a mixture of LePGT-1 and -2. It is not clear whether these two gene products play different roles in vivo, but their expression patterns in L. erythrorhizon are very similar (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). They might be expressed in different cell types in root tissue. LePGT polypeptides are predicted to have 8 or 9 transmembrane domains based on a hydropathy analysis by Kyte and Doolittle and a program on CBS servers (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-1.0/). There are two obvious hydrophilic loops where the NDXXD motif and GX(K/Y)STAL motif are localized. They are presumed to be the binding sites for the substrate, i.e. the former is for prenyl diphosphate as seen in prenyl diphosphate synthases, and the latter is probably important for the aromatic substrate (39Melzer M. Heide L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More detailed analyses are needed to define the differences in the structure that contribute to the strict substrate specificity of LePGT for GPP. The phylogenetic tree is shown in Fig. 7. Bacterial polyprenyltransferases tend to form a cluster, whereas eukaryotic polyprenyltransferases do not. This is at least partly attributable to the divergence of the mitochondrial sorting signal sequence in each molecular species. In particular, a plant ortholog of LePGT, Arabidopsis polyprenyltransferase, seems to be more divergent than those of unicellular eukaryotes and Caenorhabditis elegans (46Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Although the mitochondrial targeting signal is absent in LePGT polypeptides, they may be derived from such prenyltransferase for ubiquinone biosynthesis. It is presumed that during evolution they lost the mitochondrial signal to localize in the ER membrane, which is advantageous both for the biosynthesis and secretion of shikonin out of cells, and gained substrate specificity for GPP. Since most organisms need ubiquinone to survive in the wild,Lithospermum cells should also have another 4HB:prenyltransferase localized in mitochondria. In fact, four to five bands were observed in the genomic Southern blot (data not shown).

Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate provokes the mobilization of intracellular-stored Ca2+ to increase the intracellular level of free Ca2+, whereas diacylglycerol serves as an endogenous activator of protein kinase C (2Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). The family of phosphatidylinositol-PLC isozymes is divided into subtypes based on the presence of functional domains and sequence similarities. These subtypes include four well described PLC-β isoforms, two PLC-γ isoforms, four PLC-δ isoforms (3Carpenter G. Ji Q.-S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and one recently reported PLC-ε isoform (4Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V.

Of these, only the γ isoforms are known to be activated by receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, whereas the β isoforms are effectors of G protein-coupled receptors. The cellular regulation of the δ isoforms is unknown, whereas the ε isoform is thought to interact with Ras through an uncertain mechanism. Although catalytic subdomains X and Y are common to all phosphatidylinositol-PLC isoforms, PLC-γ isoforms uniquely contain two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain. The two SH2 domains facilitate an association of PLC-γ isozymes with and phosphorylation by receptor tyrosine kinases, whereas the function of the SH3 domain is not yet defined (3Carpenter G. Ji Q.-S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PLC-γ1 promotes mitogenic responses to growth factors is not understood (3Carpenter G. Ji Q.-S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), although it has been demonstrated recently that PLC-γ1 is necessary to promote the induction of immediate early genes by growth factors (7Wang Z.

Hoffmeyer A. Jackson C.W. Cleveland J.L. Murray P.J. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) have been analyzed by targeted disruption in mice. Only the homozygous disruption of Plcg1 orPlcβ3 results in embryonic lethality. Plcβ3 produces lethality at E2.5 prior to implantation (12Wang S. Gebre-Medhin S. Betsholtz C. Stålberg P. Zhou Y. Larsson C. Weber G. Feinstein R. Öberg K. Gobl A. Skogseid B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereasPlcg1 results in lethality soon after E9.0 apparently because of a generalized growth failure. Heterozygous Plcg1 embryos are not detectable different from wild-type embryos. Interestingly, mice genetically deficient in Plcg2 have a mild phenotype consisting of depressed B cell numbers and impaired mast cell function (11Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y.

The PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 isoforms differ mainly in their patterns of expression. The γ1 isoform is ubiquitously expressed in most all tissues (13Rhee S.G. Kim H. Suh P.G. Choi W.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas the γ2 isoform is selectively expressed in the spleen and thymus (14Homma Y. Takenawa T. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ADrosophila PLC-γ gene has been reported previously (15Thackeray J.R. Gaines P.C. Ebert P. Carlson J.R. Development. 1998; 125: 5033-5042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exhibits a loss-of-function phenotype called “small wing,” which includes diminished wing size with altered blood vessel morphogenesis. As described in this manuscript, we have determined whether development of the hematopoietic and vascular systems are impaired in mice that are deficient in Plcg1 as a possible reason for the observed embryonic lethality. We have also examined the expression of the PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 isoforms and their tyrosine phosphorylation status in these early embryos. Targeting of thePlcg1 gene described previously (10Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) results in the deletion of exons encoding the X catalytic subdomain in addition to both SH2 domains. Plcg1 heterozygotes were interbred in a 129SV× CD1 genetic background. Plcg1 heterozygous female mice were caged with a Plcg1 heterozygous male mouse overnight. When the females were examined early next morning, the appearance of the vaginal plug was designated as day 0.5 of gestation (16Hogan R. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 24-26Google Scholar). At the indicated times of gestation, pregnant female mice were anesthetized and sacrificed. The embryos were removed, photographed, and dissected under a dissecting microscopy to obtain the yolk sac and embryo body. A small piece of yolk sac was then removed for genotyping as described previously (10Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To produce embryonic single cells, the yolk sac or embryo body was digested for 3 h at 37 °C with intermittent agitation with collagenase (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.1% in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium and magnesium but with 20% fetal bovine serum (17Wong P.M.C. Chung S.-W. Reicheld S.M. Chui D.H.K. Blood. 1986; 67: 716-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, the digestion mixture was allowed to settle for 5 min before the supernatant-containing disaggregated embryonic single cells was harvested. The erythroid colony formation assays were performed as described previously (18Gregory C.J. Eaves A.C. Blood. 1977; 49: 855-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gregory C.J. Eaves A.C. Blood. 1978; 51: 527-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disaggregated embryonic cells were seeded in a six-well plate with culture medium containing α-minimal essential medium, 0.8% (w/v) methylcellulose, 30% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. For the CFU-E assay, 2 units/ml of erythropoietin (EPO) was added, and for the BFU-E assay, 10 ng/ml of interleukin-3 and 100 ng/ml of stem cell factor were added in addition to 2 units/ml of EPO. All cytokines were purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. CFU-E colonies were counted at ∼3 days of culture, whereas BFU-E and granulocyte/macrophage colonies were counted at 7–10 days of culture. Colony-type determination was based on size, morphology, and color as described previously (18Gregory C.J. Eaves A.C. Blood. 1977; 49: 855-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gregory C.J. Eaves A.C. Blood. 1978; 51: 527-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented on the CFU-E assay were obtained from one litter at E7.5 and four litters at E8.5 that includes 16+/+ embryos, 42−/+ embryos, and 13−/− embryos. The data presented in the BFU-E assay are the average of two litters at E8.0 and E8.5 representing 9+/+ embryos, 13−/+ embryos, and 5−/− embryos. Whole mount immunostaining was performed essentially as described previously (20Kume T. Jiang H. Topczewska J.M. Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2470-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed three times with PBS, dehydrated in a graded series of methanol/PBS, and then stored in 100% methanol at −20 °C until use. Subsequently, embryos were bleached in 6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 1 h and then rehydrated in a reverse series of methanol dilutions. The embryos were then blocked in antibody dilution buffer (3% skim milk, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS). The embryos were stained with mouse PECAM-1 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen) or Flk-1 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Multiple embryos (at least three) of each genotype were stained, and a representative example was presented. For immunohistofluorescent Ter119 staining, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and then embedded. Cryostat sections were cut at 10 μm, dried in air, and fixed again with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The section was blocked with 3% skim milk, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with a phycoerythrin-conjugated Ter119 antibody (PharMingen) and restained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as a nuclear counterstain. For β-galactosidase staining, embryos derived by TV-II targeting were fixed and stained as described previously (10Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The TV-II vector contained an in-frame LacZ reporter cassette, which after recombination encoded a β-galactosidase fusion protein with the amino terminus of PLC-γ1 and was expressed from the Plcg1 promoter (10Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For the analysis of PLC-γ1distribution, the whole mount embryos were fixed again, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. The embryos were then sectioned (7 μm) and stained with eosin as a nuclear counterstain. Yolk sacs, embryo bodies, or whole embryos were lysed in TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.2) supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture tablets at 1 tablet/10 ml (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 mm Na3VO4. Crude lysates were classified by centrifugation. For Western blotting, lysate aliquots (100 μg of protein) were subjected to gel electrophoresis (7.5% SDS-PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics), and probed with the indicated antibody to PLC-γ1 (21Arteaga C.L. Johnson M.D. Todderud G. Coffey R.J. Carpenter G. Page D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or PLC-γ2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.). Bound antibody was detected by ECL. For immunoprecipitation, clarified lysates (500 μg of protein) were precipitated with PLC-γ1 or PLC-γ2 antibodies. Subsequently, the samples were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), stripped, and reprobed with PLC-γ1 or PLC-γ2 antibodies. Individual yolk sacs or embryo bodies were transferred to an Eppendorff tube containing 50 μl of ice-cold PBS in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O. The PBS solution was then removed from the tube, and 50 μl of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 2 units/μl of RNase inhibitor, 5 mmdithiothreitol) was added and incubated on ice for 60 min. Lysed tissue mixtures were stored at −80 °C. For RT-PCR, the lysed tissue mixture was thawed and centrifuged 16,000 × g for 10 min. 5 μl of the supernatant was then transferred to a RT-PCR tube and was reverse transcribed to first-strand cDNA using a SuperScript II kit (GIBCOBRL) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Nested PCR was carried out under standard conditions (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The partial mouse PLC-γ2 cDNA sequence was kindly provided by James N. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The first pair of primers was sense primer 5′-GGAGCTGAAGACCATCTTGCC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GACTTTGTTCAGATCCTGAG-3′. These primers were predicted to amplify a cDNA 305 bp in length. The second pair of primers was sense primer 5′-AAGTTTCTCAAGGACAAGCTGG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TTGGAAGTCCTGCAGGTAG-3′. These primers were predicted to amplify a cDNA 201 bp in length within the first 305-bp fragment. A pair of primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was chosen as the internal standard. The sense primer for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was 5′-CAGAACATCATCCCTGCATCC-3′ defined by bases 650–670, and antisense primer was 5′-ATAGGGCTCTCTTGCTCAGTG-3′ defined by bases 1079–1100. These primers were predicted to amplify a cDNA 451 bp in length. Another control had no reverse transcriptase added to the reaction to verify that the RT-PCR products for Plcg2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were amplified from mRNA and not from genomic DNA. As previously reported, Plcg1−/− embryos undergo severe growth retardation beginning approximately at embryonic day 9.0 (10Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), although the heart remains beating at E9.5 but not at E10.5. Hence, embryonic lethality occurs between E9.5 and 10.5. Close inspection of carefully preserved E9.0 embryos reveals that blood islands are readily detectable in the wild-type embryo yolk sac but are not detectable in the yolk sac of Plcg1 null embryos (Fig.1). These observations suggest that the development of critical elements of the embryonic blood formation is impaired in the absence of PLC-γ1. To determine whether the absence of PLC-γ1 during mouse embryogenesis interferes with the formation of mature erythroid cells, the erythropoietin-dependent CFU-E assay was employed. Cells from collagenase-digested yolk sacs or embryo bodies ofPlcg1+/+, Plcg1−/+, and Plcg1−/− embryos (approximately E8.0) were incubated with erythropoietin for ∼3 days, and the number of erythroid colonies produced was determined. As shown in Fig.2 A, erythroid colonies were readily produced with cells obtained from the yolk sacs ofPlcg1 wild-type and heterozygous embryos, but no detectable colonies were produced with yolk sac cells from Plcg1 nullizygous embryos. In this assay, significant numbers of erythrocyte colonies were not detectable in assays that used only the embryo body. To detect an earlier erythroid progenitor and to assess the presence of progenitors for a non-erythrocyte lineage, the BFU-E assays were conducted. Whole embryos, i.e. embryo body plus yolk sac (E8.0–E8.5) were disaggregated, and the cells incubated for at least 7 days with multiple cytokines (EPO, interleukin-3, and stem cell factor). Subsequently, the numbers of erythroid colonies, granulocyte/macrophage colonies, and mixed colonies of both types were counted (Fig. 2 B). The results of this assay show that under BFU-E assay conditions, the number of erythroid colonies was significantly decreased (∼80%) with cells obtained fromPlcg1 nullizygous embryos but not entirely absent as in the CFU-E assay. This suggests that erythroid progenitors in reduced numbers are present in Plcg1 nullizygous embryos. Also, the formation of granulocyte/macrophage colonies in the BFU-E assay was not significantly impaired by the Plcg1−/− genotype. The data obtained from the CFU-E and BFU-E assays in vitroindicate the near absence of erythroid progenitors inPlcg1−/− embryos. To establish this in the embryos more directly, the presence of the erythroid progenitor marker Ter119 (23Kina T. Ikuta K. Takayama E. Wada K. Majumdar A.S. Weissman I.L. Katsura Y. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 109: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) was examined by immunofluorescence staining of yolk sac sections from E9.5 Plcg1+/+ and Plcg1−/− embryos. As shown in Fig. 3, Ter119 was readily detectable on blood islands within the yolk sac of wild-type embryos but was undetectable in the yolk sac of Plcg1 nullizygous embryos, indicative of significantly diminished primitive erythropoiesis. The results of Ter119 staining in Plcg1 wild-type and nullizygous embryo body were similar to that observed in the yolk sac (data not shown). The morphologic absence of blood island in Plcg1−/− embryos (Fig. 1) could be because of a lack of erythropoiesis and/or the failure of the embryos to develop endothelial cells or to undergo endothelial morphogenesis. Therefore, wild-type and Plcg1-deficient embryos were examined by immunohistochemistry for the presence of an endothelial marker, the adhesion molecule PECAM-1. As shown in Fig.4, PECAM-1 was readily detected in vessels of the yolk sac, allantois, and embryo body from wild-type embryos at E8.5. However, no PECAM-1 staining was detectable inPlcg1 nullizygous embryos. Endothelial and hematopoietic development is dependent on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor system (24Daniel T.O. Abrahamson D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have determined whether the VEGFR-2/flk-1 molecule is expressed in Plcg1-deficient embryos. As shown in Fig.5, VEGFR-2/flk-1 reactivity was detected in blood vessels of the yolk sac and embryo body of Plcg1+/+ embryos, but no staining was detected in the yolk sac ofPlcg1−/− embryos, and only very weak staining was detected in the embryo body. However, VEGFR-2/flk-1 staining was present in the allantois of embryos regardless of the Plcg1 genotype, indicating that some cells expressing this receptor are present in the mutant embryos. Quinn et al. (25Quinn T.P. De Peters K.G. Vries C. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7533-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) have reported that the non-endothelial cells in the stroma of the umbilical cord express very high levels of flk-1 at E12.5. Also, Millauer et al. (26Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar) have described Flk-1 expression in the mesenchyme of the allantois at E8.5. The Flk-1 expression observed in this region ofPlcg1 null embryos most probably represents non-endothelial expression that is independent of Plcg1. The results noted above imply that PLC-γ1 is expressed in both yolk sac and embryo body by E9.5. This is demonstrated in Fig. 6 by whole mount β-galactosidase staining of a Plcg1 heterozygous embryo (E9.5) that is derived from a TV-II-targeted disruption of the Plcg1 allele, which results in the expression of a fusion protein containing the amino terminus of PLC-γ1 and β-galactosidase expressed from the Plcg1 promoter (10Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, β-galactosidase staining of the yolk sac demonstrates widespread expression of the enzyme. Abundant expression is also present in the embryo body, particularly in the first brachial arch, midline dorsal aorta, limbs, and allantois as noted previously (10Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Also, enzyme expression in the vasculature is readily apparent. In Plcg1−/− embryos, β-galactosidase staining was present in the yolk sac and embryo body, but no staining of the vasculature was apparent (data not shown). For more detailed analysis of PLC-γ1 distribution in embryos, the same Plcg1 heterozygous embryo (Fig. 6, A andB) was sectioned and stained with eosin. As shown in Fig. 6 C, β-galactosidase is expressed widely in almost all embryonic tissues, particularly in the gut, endothelium of the dorsal aorta, amnion, plus the endoderm and mesothelium of the yolk sac. The expression of PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 was also examined by Western blotting of E9.5 embryos. As shown in Fig.7 A, PLC-γ2 was detected in both Plcg1+/+ and Plcg1−/− whole embryos, whereas as expected, PLC-γ1 was only present in the wild-type embryos. Subsequently, wild-type yolk sacs and embryo bodies were separately analyzed for the expression of PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 (Fig.7 A). Both γ1 and γ2 isoforms are present in the yolk sacs and embryo bodies of these wild-type embryos. Because both PLC-γ1 isozymes are expressed in E9.5 embryos and yolk sacs, each isozyme was tested for the presence of phosphotyrosine by immunoprecipitation with the appropriate γ isozyme antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. The presence of phosphotyrosine would indicate that the isozyme is biochemical activated in embryonic tissue by an unknown tyrosine kinase. As shown in Fig. 7 B, lanes 1 and 2, tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-γ1 was detectable in both the yolk sac and embryo body. As a gel marker for this analysis (lanes 3 and 4), we also immunoanalyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in control and epidermal growth factor-treated mouse embryo fibroblasts. When the same embryonic material was analyzed for PLC-γ2, no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (data not shown), although the data in Fig. 7 A show that a significant level of PLC-γ2 is present in these tissues. These results indicate that PLC-γ1, but not PLC-γ2, is activated in the yolk sac and embryo body at this point in gestation. Finally, RT-PCR was employed to assess the expression of PLC-γ2 mRNA in both Plcg1wild-type and nullizygous embryos. RT-PCR instead of Western blotting was employed to assess γ2 expression because of the small size of the Plcg1−/− embryos. The results shown in Fig. 8indicate that regardless of the Plcg1 genotype, PLC-γ2 mRNA is expressed in the embryo body. However, the expression of this mRNA in the yolk sac was only detected in Plcg1+/+ embryos. Hence, the expression of PLC-γ2 mRNA in the yolk sac is dependent on the presence of PLC-γ1. The circulatory system is the first and most essential organ system to begin functioning during embryonic development. In various ways and at slightly different gestational times (E7.0–E11.0), the deletion of a number of signal transduction pathway components produce lethality by abrogating development of this system (24Daniel T.O. Abrahamson D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the instance of Plcg1 gene disruption, both erythroid progenitors and endothelial cells are not detectable by a variety of assays. Hence, growth cessation and lethality in Plcg1 nullizygous embryos can reasonably be ascribed to the loss of these essential components of the circulatory system. The hemangioblast is considered an early precursor for both the endothelial lineage and erythroid lineage as well as non-erythroid hematopoietic cells (27Keller G. Lacaud G. Robertson S. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In some signal transduction knockouts,e.g. VEGFR-2/Flk-1 (28Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar, 29Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), not only are the endothelial and erythroid lineages absent, non-erythroid hematopoietic lineages also are not present. In the case of Plcg1 nullizygous embryos, non-erythroid granulocyte/macrophage colonies are detected in the BFU-E assay in amounts comparable to Plcg1 wild-type embryos. Also, in the BFU-E assay that detects an earlier erythroid progenitor than the CFU-E assay (18Gregory C.J. Eaves A.C. Blood. 1977; 49: 855-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gregory C.J. Eaves A.C. Blood. 1978; 51: 527-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a small number of erythroid colonies are detected in Plcg1−/− embryos. Hence, it seems that hemangioblasts are present in Plcg1−/− embryos, and that the observed deficiency in endothelial and erythroid cells may occur subsequent to the hemangioblast as committed precursors arise to the various lineages, which comprise the differentiated components of the circulatory system. PLC-γ1 could be essential for the development, proliferation, or survival of these early progenitors, and its absence could influence different lineages to different extents. In contrast, analysis of cell fate mapping experiments has conducted that erythroid and endothelial cells may not share a common progenitor such as the hemangioblast during mouse development (30Kinder S.J. Tsang T.E. Quinlan G.A. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Tam P.P. Development. 1999; 126: 4691-4701PubMed Google Scholar). In this case,Plcg1 may be required for the development of two independent lineages. VEGF receptors are known to interact with PLC-γ1 (31Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and the loss of these receptors particularly VEGFR-1/Flt-1 (33Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) or VEGFR-2/Flk-1 (28Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C.

Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) produces an embryonic lethal phenotype between E8.5 and E9.5, close to that presented for Plcg1−/− embryos. Hence, it is possible that PLC-γ1 is an essential VEGFR substrate in the development of early endothelial and erythroid progenitors but is not a critical substrate in VEGFR-dependent formation of non-erythroid lineages. A comparison of E9.5 embryos null for Plcg1 (10Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) or VEGFR-2/Flk-1 (28Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar) or VEGFR-1/Flt-1 (33Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) suggests that Plcg1 deficiency produces a more deleterious phenotype than the loss of either receptor. The phenotype of mice doubly deficient in VEGF receptors has not been described. Hence, at this point in development, PLC-γ1 may be a required substrate for both VEGF receptors and/or another receptor kinase(s). However, because the loss of the VEGF-1/Flt-1 receptor kinase activity does not impair mouse development (34Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), the latter possibility seems more probable. In Plcg1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts, there is an increased susceptibility to apoptosis induced by either anokis 2A. Chattopadhyay and G. Carpenter, submitted for publication. or oxidative stress (35Wang X. McCullough K.D. Wang X.-J. Carpenter G. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28364-28371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Also, the overexpression of PLC-γ1 in PC12 cells is reported to attenuate ultraviolet C-induced apoptosis (36Lee Y.H. Kim S. Kim J. Young Kim K. Kim M.J. Ryu S.H. Suh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems possible that in early endothelial and erythroid progenitors, PLC-γ1 may have a role in signaling pathways for cell survival and/or cell proliferation. It was perhaps surprising that the loss of the gene for PLC-γ2 produced a relatively mild phenotype (11Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E. Hoffmeyer A. Jackson C.W. Cleveland J.L. Murray P.J. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) given the selective expression of this isoform in the spleen and thymus. Our data show that both PLC-γ isoforms are present at E9.5 in the yolk sac where erythrogenesis and vasculogenesis are initiated as well as the embryo body. Hence, it might be expected that the two isoforms would be functional-redundant, but obviously they are not. This observation could be explained if two isoforms interact selectively with different activated receptors tyrosine kinases based on the specificity differences of their respective SH2 domains. For example, reported studies (37Downing J.R. Margolis B.L. Zilberstein A. Ashmun R.A. Ullrich A. Sherr C.J. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3345-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) indicate that PLC-γ1 does not associate with the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, but that PLC-γ2 does associate with this receptor (38Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 39Shirane M. Sawa H. Kobayashi Y. Nakano T. Kitajima K. Shinkai Y. Nagashima K. Negishi J. Development. 2001; 128: 5173-5180PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that in these early embryos, PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 are in fact expressed in different cell types within the yolk sac and embryo body. Interestingly, our data show that PLC-γ2 mRNA is not detected in the yolk sac of Plcg1 nullizygous embryos, whereas it is found in the embryo body the same embryos and in both the yolk sac and embryo body of Plcg1 wild-type embryos. This finding could be interpreted to indicate that within the yolk sac, PLC-γ1 positive cells, which do not express PLC-γ2, give rise to cells that express both isoforms. Hence, the loss of Plcg1 function in some selected lineages may result in the absence of both γ isoforms. Such a scenario could also explain why the loss of Plcg2 dose not provoke a more severe phenotype. Following review of this manuscript, an analysis of Plcg1−/− chimeric mice has demonstrated the necessity of Plcg1 for hematopoiesis and renal development (39Shirane M. Sawa H. Kobayashi Y. Nakano T. Kitajima K. Shinkai Y. Nagashima K. Negishi J. Development. 2001; 128: 5173-5180PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2068005229,"Type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), the primary inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), is found in plasma and platelets. PAI-1 circulates in complex with vitronectin (Vn), an interaction that stabilizes PAI-1 in its active conform. In this study, we examined the binding of platelet-derived Vn and PAI-1 to the surface of isolated platelets. Flow cytometry indicate that, like P-selectin, PAI-1, and Vn are found on the surface of thrombin- or calcium ionophore-activated platelets and platelet microparticles. The binding of PAI-1 to the activated platelet surface is Vn-dependent. Vn mediates the binding of PAI-1 to platelet surfaces through a high affinity (<i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> of 80 nm) binding interaction with the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of vimentin, and this Vn-binding domain is expressed on the surface of activated platelets and platelet microparticles. Immunological and functional assays indicate that only −5% of the total PAI-1 in platelet releasates is functionally active, and it co-precipitates with Vn, and the vimentin-enriched cytoskeleton fraction of activated platelet debris. The remaining platelet PAI-1 is inactive, and does not associate with the cytoskeletal debris of activated platelets. Confocal microscopic analysis of platelet-rich plasma clots confirm the co-localization of PAI-1 with Vn and vimentin on the surface of activated platelets, and platelet microparticles. These findings suggest that platelet vimentin may regulate fibrinolysis in plasma and thrombi by binding platelet-derived Vn·PAI-1 complexes."

Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the role of MyD88, IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and TAK1 in the activation of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, we sought to further elucidate the role of Ras on this pathway, and we show here that Ras and Rap act at a point downstream of MyD88, IRAK, IRAK-2, and TRAF6, but upstream of MKK3 and MKK6. In addition we show an association of active Ras with IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, and TAK1, suggesting that Ras may be involved in the assembly of this multiprotein complex.DISCUSSIONAlthough IL-1 is a well known activator of p38 MAPK, the signaling cascade leading to p38 MAPK activation by IL-1 has not been fully elucidated. The small G protein Ras has been shown to play a key role in the activation of p38 MAPK by multiple stimuli, including hemopoietic cytokines, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor (15Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 42Rausch O. Marshall C.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and we recently demonstrated that Ras plays an important role in the activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1, with Rap having an inhibitory role (34Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we have attempted to further elucidate the cascade leading from IL-1RI to the activation of p38 MAPK, and to determine the roles and relative positions of Ras and the negative regulator Rap on this pathway.Dominant negative mutants of the IL-1 signaling components MyD88, IRAK, IRAK-2, and TRAF6 all inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1. Furthermore, overexpressing wild type versions of these proteins caused an increase in p38 MAPK activity. These proteins therefore participate in both NF-κB and p38 MAPK activation by IL-1. p38 MAPK was activated by overexpressing constitutively active RasVHa, and this activation was inhibited by overexpressing dominant negative MKK3(A) or MKK6(A). This suggests that Ras activates p38 MAPK from a point in the pathway that occurs upstream of these kinases. Dominant negative MyD88, IRAK, IRAK-2, and TRAF6 were unable to inhibit the activation of p38 MAPK by RasVHa. Accordingly, overexpression of dominant negative RasN17 not only inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1, but also inhibited the activation caused by overexpressing wild type MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6, but not MKK3 and MKK6. Taken together, these results show that IL-1 activates p38 MAPK on a pathway involving MyD88, IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, Ras, MKK3, and MKK6, with Ras participating at a point downstream of TRAF6 but upstream of MKK3 and MKK6.Our study also suggests that the inhibitory effect of Rap on p38 MAPK activation by IL-1 occurs at the same level as that of Ras, since active RapV12 blocked the effect of MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6 but not MKK3 or MKK6. Of the dominant negative versions of these proteins, only MKK3 and MKK6 inhibited the stimulatory effect of dominant negative RapN17. Rap activation by IL-1, which we have previously demonstrated occurs at a later time point to Ras (34Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), may be responsible for the transient activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that transfecting cells with dominant negative RapN17 led to a prolonged activation profile of p38 MAPK in response to IL-1. The basis for the inhibitory effect of Rap is not clear. Rap has been shown to interfere with p42/p44 MAPK activation by Ras (44Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and in a recent study by Mochizuki et al. (45Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurukawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), the activation of Rap by epidermal growth factor was found to occur in the center of the cell, as opposed to the plasma membrane, where Ras activation occurs. The authors therefore suggested a mechanism whereby Rap1 may interfere with Ras signaling by retaining Ras effectors away from the site of active Ras, reducing the effect of Ras on downstream events. This may also be the case in IL-1 signaling.Precisely how IL-1 is activating Ras and Rap is also not known. The best studied mechanism of Ras activation is in growth factor signaling where ligands cause receptors to autophosphorylate, and bind SH2 domains of adapters such as Grb2, which recruits guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ras (46Izquierdo Pastor M. Reif K. Cantrell D. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 47Inouye K. Mizutani S. Koide H. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3737-3740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When activated, the effector domain of Ras interacts with the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (48Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), which then interacts with the downstream kinases MKK 1 and MKK 2 (49Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), leading to p42/p44 MAP kinase activation. Although IL-1 signaling differs from growth factor signaling in that no receptor tyrosine phosphorylation has been found (50Bird T.A. Woodward A. Jackson J.L. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we and others have previously shown that IL-1 activates Ras. Caunt et al. (51Caunt C.J. Kiss-Toth E. Carlotti F. Chapman R. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6280-6288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have implicated the focal adhesion complex in Ras activation by IL-1 consistent with studies demonstrating that IL-1RI and IRAK are recruited into focal adhesions (52Huang W.Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23509-23515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ras may then activate a MAPKKK which would lead to activation of MKK3 and/or MKK6. MAPKKKs that have been shown to play a role in p38 MAPK signaling include PAK (31Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), TAK1 (32Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Recent findings by Wang et al. (11Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar) illustrate that signaling pathways elicited by IL-1 may not be of a simple linear fashion, but rather dependent on the formation of a multiprotein complex. In their study they show that the signaling activity of a complex consisting of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 is directly dependent on TRAF6 and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex (composed of Ubc13 and Uev1A). Furthermore, the direct phosphorylation of MKK6 at Ser207 and Thr211 by ubiquitinated TAK1 has been demonstrated. Takaesu et al. (41Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have recently shown that IL-1 can induce the association of a complex consisting of IRAK, TRAF6, TAB2, and TAK1. In this study we found that RasVHa (which is in the GTP-bound state) but not RasN17 (which is GDP-bound) associates with IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, and TAK1, indicating that Ras is in the multiprotein complex formed in response to IL-1. We are currently investigating whether Ras plays a role in the formation of this multiprotein complex, promoting activation of TAK-1 by Traf-6, Ubc13, and Uev1A. Our evidence that dominant negative Ras could partially block p38 activation by TAK1, and that dominant negative TAK1 could partially block p38 activation by active Ras would imply a co-dependence between the proteins in this pathway. The inability of either dominant negative protein to fully inhibit the response of corresponding active forms is not clear, but suggests that in the case of dominant negative TAK1, other MAPKKKs can still activate MKK3/6 in response to Ras. This is currently under investigation. Another example of redundancy in the pathway would be in the failure of lethal toxin (which inactives Ras), to inhibit degradation of IκB, as shown in a previous study (34Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The would suggest that although TAK1 may be involved in this process, an alternative route to the IKK complex must exist in IL-1-treated cells, as treatment with lethal toxin would be expected to block TAK1 activation. This is also being studied further.In conclusion, our study illustrates a novel signaling pathway leading to the activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1. The pathway involves MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, Ras, TAK1, MKK3, and MKK6, with a negative down-regulatory role for Rap, occurring at the level of Ras on the pathway. The study suggests that Ras takes part in the formation of a multiprotein signaling complex made up of IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, Ras, and TAK1, which conveys the signal leading to the activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1. As a central proinflammatory mediator, interleukin 1 (IL-1)1 induces the expression of multiple genes involved in the inflammatory process. The signaling pathway leading to the activation of the transcription factor NFκB by IL-1 has been studied in great detail (reviewed in Ref. 1O'Neill L.A.J. Greene C. Jnl. Leuk. Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). IL-1 binds to the Type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), after which the receptor forms a complex with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) (2Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7727-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This triggers the recruitment of the adapter protein MyD88, which associates with IL-1RI through its carboxyl-terminal Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Once recruited, MyD88 interacts with 2 IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, IRAK and IRAK-2 (4Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z.

Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). IRAK then becomes phosphorylated, dissociates from MyD88, and becomes associated with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (8Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar) which is preassembled in a complex with TAK1-binding protein (TAB)-2 (9Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), constitutively associated with TAB1 (10Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), then associates with the TRAF6·IRAK complex, whereby TRAF6 in a ubiquitination-dependent manner triggers the phosphorylation and activation of TAK1 (11Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). TAK1 can then activate two kinase cascades: one leads to the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the other cascade leads to the activation of the IκB kinase complex, and ultimately to the activation of NFκB (12Song H.Y.

Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Activated p38 MAPK phosphorylates transcription factors in the nucleus that are responsible for the regulation of immediate-early genes. The p38 MAPK pathway also activates the transcription factors CREB, ATF1, ATF2, CHOP, and MEF-2C (15Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J.

CITED4 physically interacts with all TFAP2 isoforms in vitro and strongly co-activates all TFAP2 isoforms in Hep3B cells. Co-activation of TFAP2 requires amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal residues of CITED4. In HepG2 cells, CITED4 is significantly weaker than CITED2 for TFAP2C co-activation. These results suggest that CITED4 may function as a co-activator for TFAP2.

CREB-binding protein cysteine-histidine-rich domain 1 of p300 CREB-binding protein/p300 interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail transcription factor AP-2 hemagglutinin glutathioneS-transferase cytomegalovirus The transcriptional co-activators and histone acetyltransferases p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP)1 are recruited to gene promoters by diverse DNA-bound transcription factors, resulting in the activation of gene transcription (reviewed in Ref. 1Goodman R.H.

CITED2 is a growth factor and hypoxia-inducible gene and can itself inhibit hypoxia signaling by blocking the interaction between the hypoxia-induced factor HIF-1α and the CH1 domain of p300/CBP (7Bhattacharya S.

Using gene knockout and protein interaction studies, we have recently established that Cited2 is required for normal embryonic development and functions as a co-activator for TFAP2 (16Bamforth S. Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I.R. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Cited2 are characterized by severe cardiac malformations, adrenal gland agenesis, neural crest defects, and exencephaly. CITED2 physically interacts with and co-activates TFAP2 isoforms, and transactivation by TFAP2 is defective in cells lackingCited2. Because TFAP2A and TFAP2B mutations result in neural tube, cardiac, and neural crest defects (17Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn-Dujowich D. McMahon A.P. Flavell R.A.

In this report we describe human CITED4, a novel member of the CITED family that we have identified by searching expressed sequence tag data bases. Like CITED2, CITED4 binds both CBP/p300 and TFAP2, and it can function as a TFAP2 co-activator. Standard molecular biology protocols were used for all procedures (22Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology.3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The GenBankTM expressed sequence tag data base was searched using the program TBLASTN for sequences resembling the p300-binding domain of CITED2 (7Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A partial clone encoding a novel peptide (IMAGE number 1866039) was identified and obtained from the MRC-HGMP (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Further data base searches during the course of this study showed that the CITED4 sequence was contained in Homo sapiens chromosome 1 clone RP5-1066H13 map location 1p33–34.2 (GenBankTMaccession numbers AL158843 and NT_028052). The human CITED4 open reading frame is from residues 59344–59898 on the reverse strand ofAL158843. Fugu genomic sequences were identified by BLAST searches at fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk. The FCITED1 open reading frame is from residues 11508–12107 on the forward strand of T006209. The FCITED3 open reading frame is from residues 1283–1961 on the reverse strand of T007827. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using DNASTAR (CLUSTAL) software. A human genomic PAC library (RPCI1; obtained from Medical Research Council-Human Genome Mapping Project) was screened with a 32P-labeled insert of the IMAGE clone. A single clone (409-K1) was obtained, and mapped. A 6-kbXbaI fragment that hybridized with a CITED4 cDNA probe was subcloned into pBluescript and partially sequenced. Fluorescencein situ hybridization was performed using the PAC clone as described previously (23Senger G. Ragoussis J. Trowsdale J. Sheer D. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 64: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Primer extension was performed as described previously (22Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology.3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) using total RNA extracted from ECV304 cells (RNeasy kit; Qiagen) and a 32P-labeled antisense primer, 5′-CCACTACTGCGCACCTTG. Dideoxy chain termination sequencing reactions were performed following the instructions of the manufacturer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and we used the unlabeled primer and the human CITED4 genomic clone as template. Reactions were electrophoresed on a sequencing gel. CITED4 expression vectors were constructed by polymerase chain reaction in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), with or without an amino-terminal HA epitope tag. The expression of CITED4 and CITED4Δ (lacking residues 138–184) was assayed by Western blotting and found to be similar (data not shown). Mammalian two-hybrid plasmids were generated using pCMXGAL4N and pCMXVP16N (gifts from R. Evans, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions were generated in pGEX4T1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Maltose-binding protein-CITED4 fusions were generated in pMALC2 (New England Biolabs). Details of plasmid construction are available upon request. GST-CITED2 has been described previously (7Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M.

GAL4-luciferase and pCMV-lacZ were gifts from R. Evans. p3xAP2-Bluc, pcDNA3-TFAP2A, pRSV-TFAP2B, and pcDNA3-TFAP2C have been described previously (16Bamforth S. Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I.R. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody to human CITED4 was raised by immunizing rabbits with GST-CITED4 fusion protein. The antibody did not cross-react with CITED2 (data not shown). Anti-p300/CBP antibodies have been described previously (26Eckner R. Ludlow J.W. Lill N.L. Oldread E. Arany Z. Modjtahedi N. DeCaprio J.A. Livingston D.M. Morgan J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3454-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). PAB419 and 9E10 are monoclonal antibodies against SV40 T-antigen and the myc epitope, respectively. Immunoprecipitations were performed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor (Roche), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described previously (7Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), using 1.8 or 1.2 mg of ECV304 whole cell lysate (Fig. 3, A and B,respectively). Western blots used anti-CITED4 polyclonal serum (1:500 dilution), anti-p300/CBP monoclonal antibodies AC26 and RW128, and 12CA5 anti-HA epitope monoclonal antibody as described previously (7Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma T-5293) to confirm equal loading. The anti-CITED4 polyclonal antibody was used for immunostaining at 1:250 dilution, essentially as described previously (7Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For the peptide blocking experiment, purified maltose-binding protein-CITED4 peptide (0.03 μg/μl) was added at the primary antibody incubation step. Nuclei were counterstained with TOPRO (Molecular Probes). Cells were mounted in Vectamount (Vector Laboratories) and visualized using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Data from TOPRO (blue) and FITC (green) channels were sequentially accumulated. Total RNA was isolated from cells at 80% confluence using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). ECV304 and HEK293 cells were gifts from Keith Channon (Oxford, United Kingdom). The breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2 B, right panel) were gifts from Adrian Harris (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Oxford, United Kingdom). Northern blots used Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) that were stained with methylene blue to visualize 28 and 18S RNA species following the instructions of the manufacturer. Multiple tissue Northern blots were obtained from CLONTECH. Blots were probed with a 400-nucleotide EcoNI fragment from the IMAGE clone. GST fusions were generated, and binding reactions were performed as described previously (7Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well and transfected the following day using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfection mixtures contained 1 μl of FuGENE 6 and up to 0.5 μg of total plasmid per well. pCMX-lacZ (100 ng) was co-transfected in all experiments, luciferase and lacZ activities were measured as described, and the ratio of luciferase to lacZ activity (relative luciferase activity) was calculated (22Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology.3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The amounts of DNA used per transfection refer to the amounts added per well of a 24-well plate. We identified a novel member of the CITED family (CITED4) by searching expressed sequence tag data bases and obtained a genomic clone as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Comparison of expressed sequence tag cDNA and genomic sequences indicated that the CITED4 gene contained a single exon (Fig. 1 A). CITED4 was mapped to chromosome 1p34–1p35 using fluorescence in situhybridization (Fig. 1 B). This is consistent with the published mapping of the CITED4-containing clone RP5-1066H13 to map location 1p33–34.2 (see GenBankTM accession numberAL158843). The transcriptional start site (+1) was mapped using primer extension analysis on total RNA isolated from ECV304 cells (Fig. 1,C and D). The predicted open reading frame begins at +251, in the context of the sequence 5′-GCCGCCATGG (Fig.1 C). This corresponds to a consensus Kozak sequence (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar) and predicts the synthesis of a 184-amino acid polypeptide (Fig.1 E). The CITED4 peptide contains a carboxyl-terminal domain motif that is conserved (65% identity over the 32 amino acids) in all CITED peptides (Fig. 1 E) and corresponds to the previously described p300/CBP binding motif in CITED2 (7Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This domain is contained within CR2 (9Yahata T. de Caestecker M.P. Lechleider R.J. Andriole S. Roberts A.B. Isselbacher K.J. Shioda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8825-8834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Shioda T. Fenner M.H. Isselbacher K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 204: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Unlike CITEDs 1, 2, and 3, CITED4 does not appear to contain a distinct CR1 motif. However, a short amino-terminal sequence is conserved in CITEDs 4, 2, and 3, defining a new motif, CR3 (Fig. 1 E). By searching the puffer fish (fugu) genome data base, we also identified sequences corresponding to CITED1 and CITED3 (Fig. 1, E andF), but we were unable to identify a CITED4 homologue. Phylogenetic analysis of all CITED family members identified to date confirms that CITED4 forms a distinct group (Fig.1 F). Northern hybridization detected a single CITED4 transcript of 1.8 kb in almost all human tissues tested (Fig.2 A). CITED4 transcript levels were highest in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. CITED4 transcripts were also detected at high levels in ECV304 cells (a bladder cell line with endothelial characteristics (29Brown J. Reading S.J. Jones S. Fitchett C.J. Howl J. Martin A. Longland C.L. Michelangeli F. Dubrova Y.E. Brown C.A. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)) and in certain breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-468 (Fig.2 B)). Endogenous CITED4 protein (migrating at 24.5 kDa) was detected by Western blotting in a number of cell lines including ECV304 (data not shown; Fig. 3, A andB). Immunostaining followed by confocal microscopy in ECV304 cells revealed that the cellular levels of endogenous CITED4 protein varied considerably (Fig. 2 C). In most cells, it was localized predominantly in the nucleus, and in others, it was localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Antibody specificity was confirmed in these experiments by blocking the signal with a bacterially expressed CITED4 peptide generated as a maltose-binding protein fusion (Fig. 2 D). Immunoprecipitates from untransfected ECV304 cell lysates were Western blotted to detect co-immunoprecipitated proteins. Anti-p300/CBP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) contained co-immunoprecipitated CITED4 (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, lane 3). Immunoprecipitation reactions using control primary antibodies (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, lanes 4 and 5), no primary antibody (lane 6), or no cell lysate (lane 2) did not contain CITED4. Conversely, anti-CITED4 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) contained co-immunoprecipitated p300/CBP (Fig. 3 B, top panel, lane 2). p300/CBP proteins were not co-precipitated with the pre-immune serum (Fig. 3 B, top panel, lane 3) or in the absence of a primary immunoprecipitating antibody (lane 4). Vectors expressing human full-length CITED2 (as a positive control), CITED4, or its truncated form were used to synthesize 35S-labeled proteins by coupled in vitro transcription-translation. These peptides were tested for interaction with a GST-p300-CH1 fusion protein (containing p300 residues 300–528; Fig.4 A). In vitro, full-length CITED4 specifically interacted with the CH1 domain of p300 as strongly as CITED2 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8 and 7, respectively). The carboxyl-terminal region of CITED4, extending between residues 138 and 184, is required for p300-CH1 binding because a CITED4 mutant lacking this domain did not bind (Fig. 4 A, lane 9). To identify p300 domains necessary for interaction with CITED4 in vivo, we used a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4 B). In these experiments, GAL4-p300-CH1 strongly and specifically activated a GAL4-luciferase reporter gene when co-transfected with VP16-CITED4, indicating a two-hybrid interaction. No activation was observed with GAL4-p300-CH1Δ, which contains a mutant CH1 domain, or with VP16-CITED4Δ, which lacks CITED4 residues 138–184 (Fig.4 B). Using different GAL4-p300 fusion expression constructs (Fig. 4 C), a strong interaction between CITED4 and p300 was found to occur only when the p300-CH1 domain is preserved, implying that the p300-CH1 domain is necessary and sufficient for efficient binding of CITED4. Plasmids expressing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to CITED4 and to CITED4Δ were co-transfected with a GAL4-luciferase reporter gene. GAL4-CITED4 strongly activated the transcription of reporter (Fig. 4 D), but the deletion of the residues 138–184 of CITED4 (GAL4-CITED4Δ) resulted in a complete loss of transactivation. CITED4 thus contains an intrinsic carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain, which corresponds to the domain required for the interaction with p300-CH1. Because CITED2 physically and functionally interacts with TFAP2 isoforms, we asked whether CITED4 would do so as well. Vectors expressing human TFAP2 isoforms were used to synthesize 35S-labeled proteins by coupled in vitro transcription-translation. These peptides were tested for interaction with GST-CITED1, GST-CITED2, or GST-CITED4 fusion proteins (Fig. 5). As shown previously, TFAP2 isoforms specifically and strongly interacted with GST-CITED2 (16Bamforth S. Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I.R. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). They also interacted, although to a lesser extent, with GST-CITED4 and interacted very weakly with GST-CITED1. The physical interaction of CITED4 with TFAP2 isoforms suggested that CITED4 might also function as a TFAP2 co-activator. To test this, Hep3B cells (a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line that has low levels of endogenous TFAP2 and CITED4) were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter cloned downstream of TFAP2 binding elements (p3xAP2-Bluc; Fig. 6 A). Transfection of vectors expressing TFAP2 isoforms activated this reporter. Co-transfection of CMV-CITED4 resulted in further activation of the reporter. The fold co-activation by CITED4 was 6.25-fold for TFAP2C, 15-fold for TFAP2A, and 21-fold for TFAP2B. CMV-CITED4 did not activate the reporter in the absence of TFAP2. CMV-CITED4Δ, which lacks the transactivation and CBP/p300-binding domain (residues 138–184), did not co-activate TFAP2 despite being expressed at a similar level (Fig. 6 E; data not shown). We next investigated the role of the CITED4 amino terminus (Fig.6 B). Here we used constructs expressing CITED4 peptides with a HA epitope tag fused to the amino terminus. CMV-HA-CITED4-(2–184) co-activated TFAP2A strongly, as compared with vector control. However, CMV-HA-CITED4-(21–184) failed to co-activate TFAP2A despite being expressed to the same level (Fig. 6 F). Thus, residues 2–20 of CITED4 are essential for its co-activation function. In keeping with the results observed for CITED4Δ (Fig. 6 A), CMV-HA-CITED4-(2–137) did not co-activate TFAP2A. We next attempted to determine the relative abilities of CITED4 and CITED2 to co-activate TFAP2 isoforms in Hep3B cells. In these assays, CITED4 appeared to be a significantly stronger co-activator of all three TFAP2 isoforms, especially of TFAP2A and TFAP2B (Fig. 6 C). In the above experiments, although we used identical amounts of transfected CITED plasmid, it was possible that equivalent amounts of CITED peptides were not being produced. Because amino-terminal HA-tagged CITED peptides behave like the respective untagged peptides, we tested whether HA-CITED4 was produced at a higher level than HA-CITED2. We transfected HA-tagged CITED2 and CITED4 plasmids into Hep3B cells and examined protein expression by Western blotting (Fig. 6 E). The expression of HA-CITED4 was indeed significantly greater than that of HA-CITED2. We next examined the relative abilities of CITED2 and CITED4 to co-activate TFAP2 isoforms in HepG2, another human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. In these cells, unlike the situation in Hep3B cells, we found that CITED4 is a relatively weak co-activator when compared with CITED2 (Fig. 6 D) despite having a relatively higher expression level (Fig. 6 G). This is especially true for TFAP2C, for which CITED2 appears to be a particularly good co-activator. We identified human CITED4 by searching expressed sequence tag data bases with a domain of CITED2 that binds p300. This domain is a signature of the CITED family and is conserved in the carboxyl terminus of CITED4, implying that it should be a family member. The human CITED4 gene maps to chromosome 1p34–1p35. This region is syntenic with mouse chromosome 4. Like the murine gene, 2T. Yahata, H. Takedatsu, S. L. Dunwoodie, I. Swingler, H. Sun, J. Hur, K. R. Coser, K. J. Isselbacher, J. Shioda, submitted for publication. human CITED4 is encoded by a single exon. This remarkably simple structure is reminiscent of CITED2, where the entire open reading frame of the p35srj isoform is contained within a single exon (8Leung M.K. Jones T. Michels C.L. Livingston D.M. Bhattacharya S. Genomics. 1999; 61: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and of CITED1, where the open reading frame is contained within 2 exons (30Fenner M.H. Parrish J.E. Boyd Y. Reed V. MacDonald M. Nelson D.L. Isselbacher K.J. Shioda T. Genomics. 1998; 51: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together with the presence of conserved regions at the amino and carboxyl termini of the CITED proteins, this suggests that the members of the CITED family have likely arisen by gene duplication and sequence divergence from an ancestral gene. CITED family members have only been found in jawed vertebrates to date, and because CITED1 and CITED3 homologues are present in the puffer fish genome, this putative gene duplication and divergence likely took place before the evolution of jawed vertebrates. In keeping with the hypothesis that CITED4 is a CBP/p300-interacting protein, naturally occurring CITED4-p300/CBP complexes were detected in untransfected cells using monoclonal antibodies to p300/CBP and polyclonal antibodies to CITED4, implying that the two proteins interact under physiological conditions. Using in vitro and mammalian two-hybrid protein interaction assays, the CITED4 carboxyl terminus domain (residues 138–184) was found to be necessary for the interaction with p300. Similarly, the CH1 domain of p300 is both necessary and sufficient for the interaction with CITED4. Like other CITED members, CITED4 can function as a transcriptional activator when recruited to a promoter, and its carboxyl-terminal p300-binding domain is necessary for the transactivation function. These results support the idea that CITED4 is a novel p300/CBP-binding transactivator protein and confirm that it is a member of the CITED family. CITED4 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with some variability in expression level, indicating that it likely has a functional role in most tissues. High expression was also detected in certain breast cancer lines. The possible significance of this is discussed below. Although CITED4 protein can be detected in the cytoplasm in certain cells, it is predominantly nuclear in other cells. In the absence of a specific nuclear localization signal, this indicates that it might be complexed at least some of the time with exclusively nuclear proteins. The variability in CITED4 protein expression in individual cells suggests that it may be regulated through the cell cycle. We have previously shown that the CITED2 peptide physically interacts with and co-activates all TFAP2 isoforms. Moreover,Cited2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts had a specific defect in TFAP2 transactivation (16Bamforth S. Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I.R. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The data presented above indicate that like CITED2, CITED4 also physically interacts with TFAP2 isoforms. These interactions are likely to be transient because we have not, to date, been able to detect stable complexes of endogenous CITED peptides with TFAP2 isoforms. We have also not been able to detect an interaction between CITED4 and TFAP2 isoforms using the yeast two-hybrid system (J. J. E. and H. C. H.; data not shown). The reason for this is not clear but may indicate the requirement for other factors that are not present in yeast cells. Alternatively, the fusion of the GAL4 activation domain to the amino terminus of CITED4 (which is necessary for TFAP2 co-activation) may sterically hinder the interaction between CITED4 and TFAP2. We have found that CITED4 functionally interacts with TFAP2 isoforms by co-activating them very strongly in Hep3B cells. TFAP2 co-activation requires residues 2–20 (encompassing the CR3 motif) and also requires residues 138–184, a region that contains the carboxyl-terminal CBP/p300-binding domain, and part of CR2. Indeed, CITED4 actually appears to be a better co-activator when compared with CITED2 in these cells. This may be due to higher levels of protein expressed by the transfected CITED4 plasmid. On the other hand, in HepG2 cells, CITED4 is substantially weaker than CITED2 with regard to TFAP2 co-activation, despite relatively higher levels of protein expression. One explanation for these results is the existence of cell type-specific TFAP2 co-activation by CITED peptides. This implies that certain unique factors or pathways may be present in Hep3B cells that allow CITED4 to function as a strong co-activator. These factors may be lacking in HepG2 cells. Possible candidates are the products of the hepatitis B virus genome, which is stably integrated in Hep3B cells, and other known TFAP2 co-activators, such as PC4 and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (31Kannan P. Yu Y. Wankhade S. Tainsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Kannan P. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HepG2 cells may contain a factor that suppresses CITED4 function or enhances CITED2 function. These results also suggest the existence of TFAP2 isoform specificity. Thus, in both Hep3B and HepG2 cells, CITED2 appears to co-activate TFAP2C more powerfully than TFAP2A or TFAP2B isoforms, whereas CITED4 displays little or no isoform specificity. The basis for this putative isoform specificity is unclear at present. However, it provides a potential mechanism for modulating TFAP2 isoform function in different tissues and in response to different upstream signaling events. High levels of murine CITED4 are found in adult mammary tissues during pregnancy and lactation and during the prolactin-inducedin vitro differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. 2T. Yahata, H. Takedatsu, S. L. Dunwoodie, I. Swingler, H. Sun, J. Hur, K. R. Coser, K. J. Isselbacher, J. Shioda, submitted for publication. High levels of CITED4 are also found in certain breast cancer cell lines. TFAP2 isoforms are expressed in breast cancers, where they regulate the transcription of the neuregulin/heregulin receptors ErbB3 and ErbB2, estrogen receptor, and transforming growth factor α (33Wang D.

The level of γ-secretase activity controls the amount of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) formation from the APP intermediate fragment C99 (see Fig.1 A). Familial AD-associated mutations in PS lead to a specific increase in production of the more fibril-prone Aβ42 variant (1Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar), a peptide species linked to the early pathological changes seen in AD (2Iwatsubo T. Odaka A.

Buxbaum J.D. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2000; 283: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to develop pharmaceutical approaches that reduce the level of γ-secretase activity acting on APP. However, a complicating factor for this approach is that PS also controls cleavage of Notch receptors (4De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar), which are critical for many functions during development and in the adult organism. γ-Secretase inhibitors aimed at reducing Aβ formation might thus also affect Notch cleavage and have unwanted side effects. Therefore, high throughput screening assays that record γ-secretase cleavage of both APP and Notch would be useful for the identification of novel APP-specific γ-secretase inhibitors. In this study we present a novel cell-based reporter gene assay for monitoring γ-secretase cleavage on APP.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn this report we describe a new sensitive and quantitative assay for γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP. To generate a reporter APP protein, from which γ-secretase cleavage can be recorded, we incorporated a Gal4 DNA-binding/VP16 transactivation (GVP) domain into the C99 form of APP (Fig. 1 A), which is an immediate substrate for γ-secretase in vivo(5Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the resulting hybrid protein, hereafter referred to as C99-GVP, liberates the C-terminal region, including the GVP moiety, which is translocated to the nucleus due to the nuclear localization signals in GVP. In the nucleus, GVP specifically signals through a UAS-luciferase reporter gene by virtue of the strong transactivation domain and specific binding to a UAS promoter (Fig. 1 A). The assay has several attractive features. First, it should be specific for γ-secretase cleavage since the GVP moiety is inserted only 13–15 amino acid residues C-terminal of the γ-secretase cleavage sites, thus minimizing unspecific cleavage events. Second, it should be very sensitive since VP16 is a strong transactivation domain on the UAS promoter. Third, it will record the total γ-secretase cleavage activity, i.e. γ-cleavage generating both Aβ40, the more abundant Aβ variant (6Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar), and the pathogenic Aβ42 species as well as minor cleavage products generated by processing at adjacent residues will be measured simultaneously. This is a marked improvement over current γ-secretase assays that rely primarily on analyzing secreted Aβ species with specific antibodies while excluding the large, and structurally distinct (7Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), intracellular pool of Aβ. Moreover, the C99-GVP construct harbors the native APP cytoplasmic tail, ensuring correct intracellular trafficking by the sorting signals contained within the tail (8Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally, the assay records cleavage only from the C99-GVP protein and is thus insensitive to the levels of endogenous γ-secretase substrates in the cell.We first examined the specificity of the C99-GVP assay by recording γ-cleavage in cells expressing different combinations of PS genes. After transfection of C99-GVP into HEK293 cells, which express endogenous levels of wild-type PS1 and PS2, a strong activation of the UAS-luciferase gene was observed (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, transfection of C99-GVP into BD8 cells, which lack PS1 and PS2 expression, did not activate the reporter gene (Fig. 1 B), indicating that cleavage is completely dependent on the presence of PS proteins. To test the assay for PS1 and PS2 individually, we transfected expression constructs of PS1 and PS2 into the BD8 cells and measured the cleavage of C99-GVP. This resulted in strong reporter gene activation in both cases, demonstrating that both PS1 and PS2 are capable of mediating γ-cleavage of C99-GVP (Fig. 1 B). These results are in agreement with recent reports fromDrosophila in which a similar construct was successfully used for genetic analysis of PS-controlled γ-cleavage (10Struhl G. Greenwald I. Nature. 1999; 398: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar).To address whether the assay was quantitative, we transfected different amounts of PS1 into BD8 cells. The level of reporter gene activation increased with the amount of PS expressed, primarily in the range from 10 pg to 10 ng of added PS1 plasmid DNA (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, above 10 ng, only a minor increase in cleavage activity was observed. This may suggest that the production of the activated form of PS required for cleavage is limiting (i.e. by adding too much PS, the proteolytic machinery generating the N- and C-terminal PS fragments is saturated) or, alternatively, that a component other than PS in the active γ-secretase complex is the rate-limiting determinant of cleavage (11Yu G. Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Holmes E. Zhang D.M. Milman P. Fraser P.E. Haass C. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested whether the assay responded quantitatively to the addition of two known γ-secretase inhibitors, MW167 (12Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and L-685,458 (13Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Addition of both MW167 and L-685,458 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in γ-secretase activity (Fig. 1 D).As discussed above, γ-secretase inhibitors that do not discriminate between APP and Notch cleavage may have dangerous side effects if used in a therapeutic setting. Both APP and Notch are cleaved at defined sites in the intramembraneous region, and thus it should be possible to use a very similar GVP-based assay to monitor γ-secretase-mediated cleavage (site 3 cleavage) of Notch (Fig.2 A). We have recently shown that a truncated Notch receptor that acts in a ligand-independent constitutive manner (14Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and harbors the GVP moiety inserted immediately C-terminal of the site 3 cleavage site (Notch ΔE-GVP) is cleaved specifically in the presence of PS in cultured cells. 2Y. Taniguchi, H. Karlström, J. Lundkvist, T. Mizutani, A. Otaka, M. Vestling, A. Bernstein, D. Donoviel, U. Lendahl, and T. Honjo, submitted. We show here that Notch ΔE-GVP, like C99-GVP, can respond in a graded fashion to varying amounts of PS (Fig.2 B) and γ-secretase inhibitors (Fig. 2 C). As in the case for C99-GVP, addition of PS1 above 10 ng does not significantly increase Notch cleavage efficiency. In addition, preliminary experiments suggest that expression of increasing amounts of Notch ΔE results in a dose-dependent attenuation of the processing of C99-GVP (data not shown). These data further demonstrate the similarities in processing between APP and Notch.Figure 2Processing of Notch ΔE-GVP is PS-dependent and susceptible to γ-secretase inhibitors. A, overview of the ligand-induced processing events of the Notch receptor and the γ-secretase assay. Notch ΔE is a truncated form of a Notch receptor, which is cleaved at site 2 and site 3 in a ligand-independent constitutive manner. Following cleavage at the γ-secretase site (site 3) the intracellular domain containing the GVP domain translocates to the nucleus and initiates luciferase expression from the UAS promoter. B, PS proteins are required for Notch ΔE-GVP processing. Cleavage of Notch ΔE-GVP in BD8 cells was analyzed in the presence of different amounts of transfected PS1-encoding cDNA. As for C99-GVP (Fig. 1 C), only a very minor increase in γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of the Notch ΔE-GVP substrate was observed above 10 ng of transfected PS1-encoding cDNA.

C, γ-secretase inhibitors inhibit processing of Notch ΔE-GVP. As for C99-GVP, both MW167 and L-685,458 caused a dose-dependent decrease in γ-secretase activity. The experiment was repeated at least three times with duplicates of each treatment. Data are presented as percent activity where 100% activity corresponds to the reporter gene activity obtained in the absence of γ-secretase inhibitors.

The IC50 value for MW167 was calculated to be ∼50 μm, which is slightly higher than the previously reported value of 20 μm(20Berezovska O. Jack C. McLean P. Aster J.C. Hicks C. Xia W. Wolfe M.S. Kimberly W.T. Weinmaster G. Selkoe D.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This discrepancy in IC50 values probably reflects the different methodologies used in the two investigations. L-685,458 inhibited C99-GVP and Notch ΔE-GVP processing with an IC50 value of 200 nm. The IC50 for C99-GVP was comparable to the IC50 reported for L-685,458 in intact cells (48–775 nm depending on the cell line used and whether secreted Aβ40 or Aβ42 was measured) (13Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, the similarity of the data obtained in this study and other reports confirm the validity of the C99-GVP reporter gene assay to address γ-secretase activity on APP.To learn whether the assay was capable of recording differences between Notch and APP processing, we used artificial missense mutations in PS that affect two aspartate residues at positions 257 and 385 thought to be involved in the PS active site that have been shown to differentially alter APP and Notch processing (17Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We generated single or double aspartate to alanine mutants at positions 257 and 385 in PS1 and tested the effects in the C99 and Notch GVP assays in the PS-deficient BD8 cells (Fig. 3). Transient expression of the D257A, D385A, and D257A/D385A mutants into BD8 cells resulted in no detectable signaling from the C99-GVP reporter construct. In contrast, the D385A mutant rescued 15% of the signaling for Notch ΔE-GVP, while the other two mutants did not activate the reporter gene. This finding is interesting in light of previous data. Our data on APP processing support the original finding by Wolfe and co-workers (18Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) that the aspartate residues are critical in PS-mediated cleavage of APP but disagree with data from Haass et al.(17Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The D385A mutant has in all previous reports been shown to inhibit Notch processing in a potent way (17Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The residual cleavage activity of the D385A PS1 mutant in our assay was therefore unexpected but may reflect the sensitivity of the GVP-based assay and that it was conducted in a PS-null background, avoiding possible interference of wild-type, endogenously expressed PS. Moreover, recent data have emerged that challenge the view that PS proteins are direct executors of the γ-secretase cleavage (19Armogida M. Petit A. Vincent B. Scarcello S. Alvez Da Costa C. Checler F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 2Y. Taniguchi, H. Karlström, J. Lundkvist, T. Mizutani, A. Otaka, M. Vestling, A. Bernstein, D. Donoviel, U.

Note that the expression of none of the mutants resulted in any detectable processing from either the C99-GVP or the Notch ΔE-GVP construct, except for the D385A mutant, which rescued cleavage from the Notch ΔE GVP construct by 15%.

The APP assay is highly sensitive and quantitative and can simultaneously record all γ-secretase-mediated cleavages. The fact that the GVP-based assays for APP and Notch are based on transfected cells also render these assays suitable for large scale testing of multiple compounds for γ-secretase inhibition in an unbiased high throughput fashion. In principle, it should be possible to screen several thousands of compounds for their effect on γ-secretase activity in a few days. The observation that these assays can score differences in processing between APP and Notch makes the assays very attractive as tools to identify novel γ-secretase modulators that differentially affect APP and Notch processing.

However, a complicating factor for this approach is that PS also controls cleavage of Notch receptors (4De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar), which are critical for many functions during development and in the adult organism. γ-Secretase inhibitors aimed at reducing Aβ formation might thus also affect Notch cleavage and have unwanted side effects. Therefore, high throughput screening assays that record γ-secretase cleavage of both APP and Notch would be useful for the identification of novel APP-specific γ-secretase inhibitors. In this study we present a novel cell-based reporter gene assay for monitoring γ-secretase cleavage on APP. presenilin Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein amyloid β-peptide Gal4/VP16 upstream activation sequence presenilin Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein amyloid β-peptide Gal4/VP16 upstream activation sequence RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn this report we describe a new sensitive and quantitative assay for γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP. To generate a reporter APP protein, from which γ-secretase cleavage can be recorded, we incorporated a Gal4 DNA-binding/VP16 transactivation (GVP) domain into the C99 form of APP (Fig. 1 A), which is an immediate substrate for γ-secretase in vivo(5Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the resulting hybrid protein, hereafter referred to as C99-GVP, liberates the C-terminal region, including the GVP moiety, which is translocated to the nucleus due to the nuclear localization signals in GVP. In the nucleus, GVP specifically signals through a UAS-luciferase reporter gene by virtue of the strong transactivation domain and specific binding to a UAS promoter (Fig. 1 A). The assay has several attractive features. First, it should be specific for γ-secretase cleavage since the GVP moiety is inserted only 13–15 amino acid residues C-terminal of the γ-secretase cleavage sites, thus minimizing unspecific cleavage events. Second, it should be very sensitive since VP16 is a strong transactivation domain on the UAS promoter. Third, it will record the total γ-secretase cleavage activity, i.e. γ-cleavage generating both Aβ40, the more abundant Aβ variant (6Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar), and the pathogenic Aβ42 species as well as minor cleavage products generated by processing at adjacent residues will be measured simultaneously. This is a marked improvement over current γ-secretase assays that rely primarily on analyzing secreted Aβ species with specific antibodies while excluding the large, and structurally distinct (7Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), intracellular pool of Aβ. Moreover, the C99-GVP construct harbors the native APP cytoplasmic tail, ensuring correct intracellular trafficking by the sorting signals contained within the tail (8Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally, the assay records cleavage only from the C99-GVP protein and is thus insensitive to the levels of endogenous γ-secretase substrates in the cell.We first examined the specificity of the C99-GVP assay by recording γ-cleavage in cells expressing different combinations of PS genes. After transfection of C99-GVP into HEK293 cells, which express endogenous levels of wild-type PS1 and PS2, a strong activation of the UAS-luciferase gene was observed (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, transfection of C99-GVP into BD8 cells, which lack PS1 and PS2 expression, did not activate the reporter gene (Fig. 1 B), indicating that cleavage is completely dependent on the presence of PS proteins. To test the assay for PS1 and PS2 individually, we transfected expression constructs of PS1 and PS2 into the BD8 cells and measured the cleavage of C99-GVP. This resulted in strong reporter gene activation in both cases, demonstrating that both PS1 and PS2 are capable of mediating γ-cleavage of C99-GVP (Fig. 1 B). These results are in agreement with recent reports fromDrosophila in which a similar construct was successfully used for genetic analysis of PS-controlled γ-cleavage (10Struhl G. Greenwald I. Nature. 1999; 398: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar).To address whether the assay was quantitative, we transfected different amounts of PS1 into BD8 cells. The level of reporter gene activation increased with the amount of PS expressed, primarily in the range from 10 pg to 10 ng of added PS1 plasmid DNA (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, above 10 ng, only a minor increase in cleavage activity was observed. This may suggest that the production of the activated form of PS required for cleavage is limiting (i.e. by adding too much PS, the proteolytic machinery generating the N- and C-terminal PS fragments is saturated) or, alternatively, that a component other than PS in the active γ-secretase complex is the rate-limiting determinant of cleavage (11Yu G. Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Holmes E. Zhang D.M. Milman P. Fraser P.E. Haass C. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested whether the assay responded quantitatively to the addition of two known γ-secretase inhibitors, MW167 (12Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and L-685,458 (13Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Addition of both MW167 and L-685,458 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in γ-secretase activity (Fig. 1 D).As discussed above, γ-secretase inhibitors that do not discriminate between APP and Notch cleavage may have dangerous side effects if used in a therapeutic setting. Both APP and Notch are cleaved at defined sites in the intramembraneous region, and thus it should be possible to use a very similar GVP-based assay to monitor γ-secretase-mediated cleavage (site 3 cleavage) of Notch (Fig.2 A). We have recently shown that a truncated Notch receptor that acts in a ligand-independent constitutive manner (14Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and harbors the GVP moiety inserted immediately C-terminal of the site 3 cleavage site (Notch ΔE-GVP) is cleaved specifically in the presence of PS in cultured cells. 2Y. Taniguchi, H. Karlström, J. Lundkvist, T. Mizutani, A. Otaka, M. Vestling, A. Bernstein, D. Donoviel, U. Lendahl, and T. Honjo, submitted. We show here that Notch ΔE-GVP, like C99-GVP, can respond in a graded fashion to varying amounts of PS (Fig.2 B) and γ-secretase inhibitors (Fig. 2 C). As in the case for C99-GVP, addition of PS1 above 10 ng does not significantly increase Notch cleavage efficiency. In addition, preliminary experiments suggest that expression of increasing amounts of Notch ΔE results in a dose-dependent attenuation of the processing of C99-GVP (data not shown). These data further demonstrate the similarities in processing between APP and Notch.Both γ-secretase inhibitors displayed similar potency in inhibiting Notch ΔE-GVP and C99-GVP processing. The IC50 value for MW167 was calculated to be ∼50 μm, which is slightly higher than the previously reported value of 20 μm(20Berezovska O. Jack C. McLean P. Aster J.C. Hicks C. Xia W. Wolfe M.S. Kimberly W.T. Weinmaster G. Selkoe D.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This discrepancy in IC50 values probably reflects the different methodologies used in the two investigations. L-685,458 inhibited C99-GVP and Notch ΔE-GVP processing with an IC50 value of 200 nm. The IC50 for C99-GVP was comparable to the IC50 reported for L-685,458 in intact cells (48–775 nm depending on the cell line used and whether secreted Aβ40 or Aβ42 was measured) (13Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, the similarity of the data obtained in this study and other reports confirm the validity of the C99-GVP reporter gene assay to address γ-secretase activity on APP.To learn whether the assay was capable of recording differences between Notch and APP processing, we used artificial missense mutations in PS that affect two aspartate residues at positions 257 and 385 thought to be involved in the PS active site that have been shown to differentially alter APP and Notch processing (17Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We generated single or double aspartate to alanine mutants at positions 257 and 385 in PS1 and tested the effects in the C99 and Notch GVP assays in the PS-deficient BD8 cells (Fig. 3). Transient expression of the D257A, D385A, and D257A/D385A mutants into BD8 cells resulted in no detectable signaling from the C99-GVP reporter construct. In contrast, the D385A mutant rescued 15% of the signaling for Notch ΔE-GVP, while the other two mutants did not activate the reporter gene. This finding is interesting in light of previous data. Our data on APP processing support the original finding by Wolfe and co-workers (18Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) that the aspartate residues are critical in PS-mediated cleavage of APP but disagree with data from Haass et al.(17Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The D385A mutant has in all previous reports been shown to inhibit Notch processing in a potent way (17Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The residual cleavage activity of the D385A PS1 mutant in our assay was therefore unexpected but may reflect the sensitivity of the GVP-based assay and that it was conducted in a PS-null background, avoiding possible interference of wild-type, endogenously expressed PS. Moreover, recent data have emerged that challenge the view that PS proteins are direct executors of the γ-secretase cleavage (19Armogida M. Petit A. Vincent B. Scarcello S. Alvez Da Costa C. Checler F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 2Y. Taniguchi, H. Karlström, J. Lundkvist, T. Mizutani, A. Otaka, M. Vestling, A. Bernstein, D. Donoviel, U.

Note that the expression of none of the mutants resulted in any detectable processing from either the C99-GVP or the Notch ΔE-GVP construct, except for the D385A mutant, which rescued cleavage from the Notch ΔE GVP construct by 15%.

The APP assay is highly sensitive and quantitative and can simultaneously record all γ-secretase-mediated cleavages. The fact that the GVP-based assays for APP and Notch are based on transfected cells also render these assays suitable for large scale testing of multiple compounds for γ-secretase inhibition in an unbiased high throughput fashion. In principle, it should be possible to screen several thousands of compounds for their effect on γ-secretase activity in a few days. The observation that these assays can score differences in processing between APP and Notch makes the assays very attractive as tools to identify novel γ-secretase modulators that differentially affect APP and Notch processing.

https://openalex.org/W1997993932,"A quadruple mutant of sperm whale myoglobin was constructed to mimic the structure found in Ascaris suumhemoglobin. The replacements include His(E7) → Gln, Leu(B10) → Tyr, Thr(E10) → Arg, and Ile(G8) → Phe. Single, double, and triple mutants were characterized to dissect out the effects of the individual substitutions. The crystal structures of the deoxy and oxy forms of the quadruple mutant were determined and compared with that of nativeAscaris hemoglobin. Tyr(B10) myoglobin displays low O2 affinity, high dissociation rate constants, and heterogeneous kinetic behavior, suggesting unfavorable steric interactions between the B10 phenol side chain and His(E7). In contrast, all mutants containing the Tyr(B10)/Gln(E7) pair show high O2 affinity, low dissociation rate constants, and simple, monophasic kinetic behavior. Replacement of Ile107 with Phe enhances nanosecond geminate recombination singly and in combination with the Tyr(B10)/Gln(E7)/Arg(E10) mutation by limiting access to the Xe4 site. These kinetic results and comparisons with nativeAscaris hemoglobin demonstrate the importance of distal pocket cavities in governing the kinetics of ligand binding. The ∼150-fold higher O2 affinity of Ascarishemoglobin compared with that for Tyr(B10)/Gln(E7)-containing myoglobin mutants appears to be the result of favorable proximal effects in theAscaris protein, due to a staggered orientation of His(F8), the lack of a hydrogen bonding lattice between the F4, F7, and F8 residues, and the presence of a large polar Trp(G5) residue in the interior portion of the proximal heme pocket. A quadruple mutant of sperm whale myoglobin was constructed to mimic the structure found in Ascaris suumhemoglobin. The replacements include His(E7) → Gln, Leu(B10) → Tyr, Thr(E10) → Arg, and Ile(G8) → Phe. Single, double, and triple mutants were characterized to dissect out the effects of the individual substitutions. The crystal structures of the deoxy and oxy forms of the quadruple mutant were determined and compared with that of nativeAscaris hemoglobin. Tyr(B10) myoglobin displays low O2 affinity, high dissociation rate constants, and heterogeneous kinetic behavior, suggesting unfavorable steric interactions between the B10 phenol side chain and His(E7). In contrast, all mutants containing the Tyr(B10)/Gln(E7) pair show high O2 affinity, low dissociation rate constants, and simple, monophasic kinetic behavior. Replacement of Ile107 with Phe enhances nanosecond geminate recombination singly and in combination with the Tyr(B10)/Gln(E7)/Arg(E10) mutation by limiting access to the Xe4 site. These kinetic results and comparisons with nativeAscaris hemoglobin demonstrate the importance of distal pocket cavities in governing the kinetics of ligand binding. The ∼150-fold higher O2 affinity of Ascarishemoglobin compared with that for Tyr(B10)/Gln(E7)-containing myoglobin mutants appears to be the result of favorable proximal effects in theAscaris protein, due to a staggered orientation of His(F8), the lack of a hydrogen bonding lattice between the F4, F7, and F8 residues, and the presence of a large polar Trp(G5) residue in the interior portion of the proximal heme pocket. More than 50 years ago, Davenport (1Davenport H.E. Roughton F.J.W. Kendrew J.C. Haemoglobin. Butterworths Scientific Publications, Ltd., London1949: 295-300Google Scholar) showed that the ultrahigh affinity of Ascaris suum hemoglobin for O2 is due to a remarkably small rate constant for O2 dissociation (≤0.01 s−1). In 1994, De Baere et al. (2De Baere I. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Kloek et al. (3Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Frieden C. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2377-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the structural cause of the low dissociation rate was electrostatic stabilization of bound O2 by two hydrogen bonds, a very strong one with Tyr(B10) and a weaker one with Gln(E7). These conclusions were based on the effects of Tyr(B10) → Phe and Gln(E7) → Leu mutations on the rate of O2 dissociaton from recombinant Ascaris heme domain I. In an attempt to test these conclusions and to mimic the high O2 affinity, Leu(B10) → Tyr, His(E7) → Gln, and Thr(E10) → Arg mutations were introduced into sperm whale myoglobin (4Travaglini-Allocatelli C.

The site-directed mutagenesis studies on mammalian myoglobin were also carried out to examine pathways for ligand movement inside the protein using laser photolysis techniques. At low temperatures, the large Tyr(B10) side chain prevents rebinding of photolyzed CO, which can then migrate into internal cavities within the protein and be visualized by x-ray cystallography (5Brunori M. Vallone B. Cutruzzolà F. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Berendzen J. Chu K. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2058-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The effects of multiple mutations at the E7 and B10 positions are also important for designing safer and more efficient hemoglobin-based blood substitutes. Replacements of Leu(B10) with large aromatic amino acids have been used to inhibit NO scavenging by recombinant myoglobins and hemoglobins (7Eich R.F., Li, T. Lemon D.D. Doherty D.H. Curry S.R.

Most workers believe that the hypertensive side effect caused by infusion of extracellular hemoglobins in animal models and in humans is due to interference with NO signaling in blood vessel walls.

This paper collates all of the previous data and describes the ligand binding properties of the double YQ and quadruple YQRF mutants. The previous Y, Q, R, F, QR, and YQR mutants were used as controls. The functional results are correlated with the deoxygenated and oxygenated crystal structures of YQRF myoglobin and those reported previously for A. suum hemoglobin (13Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The results are discussed in relation to pathways of ligand migration within globins and to general protein engineering principles. The F mutation clearly inhibits movement of ligands away from the distal pocket and into the Xe4 binding site, regardless of the nature of other distal pocket amino acids (11Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5177-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Ishikawa H. Uchida T. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biophys.

The YQRF series myoglobin mutants exemplify the successes and problems associated with rational protein design. Unlike the individual Y and Q mutants, the YQ double mutant shows a marked decrease in the rate of O2dissociation, providing an example of positive interactions between side chains that are in close proximity to each other. None of the YQ-containing Mb 2Mbmyoglobin 2Mbmyoglobin mutants has an oxygen affinity as high as that of Ascarishemoglobin. Detailed comparison of the structure of nativeAscaris Hb and that for the YQRF Mb mutant suggests four key differences that account for the >150-fold difference in O2 equilibrium constants. First, the side chains of Gln(E7) and Tyr(B10) in Ascaris Hb and in YQR Mb are closer to bound O2 than in the YQRF mutant. Second, the distal cavity immediately adjacent to the bound ligand is larger inAscaris Hb, and return to the iron is less hindered, although further migration into the protein interior is prevented. Third, in Ascaris Hb, Leu(G5) is replaced with a more polar Trp residue in the cavity underneath the C ring of the heme inAscaris Hb. Fourth, the proximal His(F8) side chain inAscaris Hb adopts a more favorable staggered orientation with respect to the pyrrole nitrogen atoms. All of these differences have been shown to enhance ligand affinity, increase geminate recombination, and lower dissociation rate constants in myoglobin and leghemoglobin model systems (15Egeberg K.D.

The quadruple mutant was checked by automated nucleotide sequencing. The site-directed YQRF mutant, together with the other six recombinant Mbs investigated, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (4Travaglini-Allocatelli C.

O2association time courses were measured by laser photolysis of MbO2 samples using a 300-ns excitation pulse from a Phase-R model 2100B dye laser as described by Rohlfs et al. (10Rohlfs R.J.

The myoglobin samples were prepared by adding a trace of dithionite to the oxidized or partially reduced protein, which was then run through a G-25 column equilibrated with various high concentrations of O2 (1 atm of O2 to 1 atm of N2 for anaerobic conditions). Samples from the column were withdrawn with a gas-tight syringe and inserted into a sealed cuvette (1-mm path length) previously equilibrated with the same partial pressure of O2. O2 dissociation rate constants were determined by analyzing time courses for ligand replacement in a stopped-flow spectrometer. In these experiments, MbO2 (10 μm) at various free [O2] values was mixed with buffer equilibrated with 1 atm of CO (10Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D.

Sample time courses are shown in Fig. 1 A, and the O2 dissociation rate constants were calculated from kO2 =r obs(1 + k′O2[O2]/k′CO[CO]) (22Gibson Q.H. Roughton J.F.W. Proc. R. Soc.

CO association rate constants were measured by stopped-flow, rapid mixing techniques in which the reduced deoxygenated protein was mixed with various concentrations of CO and by laser photolysis methods using a MbCO sample. Dissociation rate constants for CO were determined by analyzing stopped-flow time courses in which bound CO was displaced with high concentrations of NO (10Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E.

The equilibrium constants for O2 and CO binding were calculated from the ratio of the association and dissociation rate constants. NO association rate constants were measured by laser photolysis of ferrous nitrosyl samples (24Carver T.E. Rohlfs R.J. Olson J.S. Gibson Q.H. Blackmore R.S. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. J. Biol.

Time courses for geminate recombination of O2 and NO were followed at 436 nm after photolysis by a 9-ns flash (532 nm) from a YAG laser as described by Scott et al. (14Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11909-11917Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Experiments with xenon were carried out in a stainless steel pressure cell, with a gas volume of ∼4 ml and a path length of 1 mm. After data had been collected with samples in air alone, the cell was connected to a xenon tank via short metal tubes and filled with gas up to 12 atm of pressure. Laser spectroscopy has been used successfully to study the dynamics of ligand migration in Mb. At room temperature, O2 and NO serve as useful probes to study the events that occur after photolysis laser on nanosecond and picosecond time scales (26Olson J.S. Phillips G.N., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17593-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 27Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20155-20158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CO is much less reactive, and as a result, the amount of internal recombination is ≤∼10% before ligand escape from the protein occurs. The side path scheme shown in SchemeFS1 has been used successfully to interpret time courses for internal geminate rebinding in wild-type and mutant sperm whale myoglobins (11Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5177-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 16Carlson M.L. Regan R. Elber R., Li, H. Phillips G.N., Jr. Olson J.S. Gibson Q.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10597-10606Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Photodissociation of the ligand is associated with an ultrafast “jump” from the bound position to a location parallel to the heme plane and directly below the side chain of Leu(B10) (see Ref. 28Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Phillips G.N., Jr. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1994; 371: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). At room temperature, ligands then either rebind from this position on picosecond time scales or migrate further into the protein. If further migration occurs, then internal rebinding becomes a slower process, since the ligands must to return to the iron from more remote positions (25Gibson Q.H. Regan R. Elber R. Olson J.S. Carver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22022-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On nanosecond time scales, the ligand may occupy any one of several rapidly interconverting positions. The more rapid and dominate nanosecond phase shows rate constants in the range of ∼5–100 μs−1. This phase is due to ligand rebinding from positions in the distal pocket above the porphyrin ring in the space circumscribed by Leu(B10), Phe(CD1), His(E7), Val(E11), and Ile(G8), including the initial “docking” site seen at low temperature. This collection of ligand positions is designated as the primary or “B” nanosecond state in Scheme FS1. The slower phases at room temperature show rate constants on the order of 1 to 0.1 μs−1 and have been assigned to ligands rebinding from more interior positions. These locations are often designated as secondary docking sites. State C in Scheme FS1represents a collection of these more remote ligand positions, which have been identified as the Xe binding pockets based on molecular dynamics simulations (6Brunori M.

YQRF deoxy-Mb was obtained by soaking the crystals in a solution of mother liquor containing sodium dithionite. Oxy and CO derivatives were obtained by soaking fully reduced crystals in a mother liquor solution equilibrated with each gas, separately. X-ray diffraction data were collected from frozen crystals at 120 K, using 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Data collection was performed at the synchrotron ELETTRA in Trieste (Italy), using the MAR imaging plate system. 1° oscillation images were collected, and the data were processed with DENZO/Scalepack (32Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). The refinement was accomplished using the maximum likelihood program REFMAC (32Otwinowsky Z. Minor W.

Graphical display and addition of water molecules were performed using Xtalview (33CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar). Rate constants for O2, CO, and NO binding were measured for Mb mutants containing all four Y, Q, R, and F replacements and various combinations. Overall rate constants and geminate recombination parameters for O2, CO, and NO binding are reported in Tables Table I, Table II, Table III for the complete set of eight mutants and Ascaris Hb. The single Q mutation causes a 10-fold increase in the O2 dissociation rate constant, kO2, and a 50% increase in the association rate constant,k′ O2 (Fig.1, Table I). The increase in kO2 is due to a decrease in the strength of hydrogen bonding to the bound ligand, and the increase in k′O2 is due to the enhanced flexibility of the E7 side chain and the partial loss of distal pocket water (34Quillin M.L. Arduini R.M. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The single R and F mutations cause small decreases in both k′O2and kO2, with little change in O2 affinity. As shown in Fig. 1, the single Y mutation causes complex kinetic behavior (see also Ref. 9Gibson Q.H. Regan R. Olson J.S. Carver T.E. Dixon B. Pohajdak B. Sharma P.K. Vinogradov S.N. J. Biol.

About 50% of Y Mb molecules show very large oxygen dissociation rate constants, and the other 50% show lower, more normal kO2 values (Fig.1 A). After laser photolysis, the Y single mutant shows ∼50% rapid bimolecular O2 rebinding, with a rate constant similar to that observed for wild-type and Q Mb, and ∼50% slow rebinding, with a rate constant that is ∼10-fold smaller (Fig.1 B).Table IO 2 binding to Mb mutants in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 20 °CProteink′O2k O2K O2μm −1 s −1s −1μm −1Wild-type Mb17151.1Y25 (∼50%)1-aThe single L29Y mutant shows multiple phases for both O2 association and dissociation.

Roughly 30–50% of the reaction occurs quickly, and the remaining phases are ∼5–100 times slower. The equilibrium constants assume that the larger k′O2 value corresponds with the larger k O2value; if not, then the K O2 values could range between 0.0001 and 1 μm−1.

Remarkably, the double YQ mutant shows 5- and 10-fold lower association and dissociation rate constants, respectively, than those of the wild-type protein or either of the corresponding single mutants. The O2 affinities of Q Mb and Y Mb are 5–100-fold lower, respectively, than that for wild-type myoglobin, whereas the O2 affinity of the YQ double mutant is 2-fold higher (TableI). Clearly, the effects of the single mutations are not additive for either the kinetic barriers or the equilibrium free energy changes. The time courses for the Y mutant indicate multiple conformations for the Tyr(B10) and His(E7) side chains in both the deoxygenated and the ligand-bound states. In the case of association (Fig. 1 B), one set of conformers show barriers to oxygen binding that are about the same as those seen in wild-type myoglobin, whereas the remaining conformers show much higher barriers. In the case of dissociation (Fig. 1 A), an even larger range of rate constants (∼20,000 to 10 s−1) is seen, suggesting no, weak, and strong hydrogen bonding to bound O2. Unfortunately, a detailed structural interpretation is impossible because crystals have not been obtained for the single Y mutant, presumably as a result of this conformational heterogeneity. The simple kinetic behavior observed for the YQ, YQR, and YQRF multiple mutants indicates single or very rapidly interconverting conformations for the Tyr(B10) and Gln(E7) side chains. As discussed previously for the YQR mutant (4Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Brancaccio A. Vallone B. Brunori M.

These features are observed in both the deoxy-Mb and MbO2 crystal structures of the YQR and YQRF mutants (see Ref. 6Brunori M. Cutruzzolà F. Savino C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Vallone B.

In this case, the effects of the single Q and R mutations are additive. The R mutation decreases k′O2 and kO2 by about 20–30% with little change in net affinity when introduced into either Q, YQ, or wild-type Mb (Table I). The F mutation also has the same relative effect on the O2 binding properties of the wild-type protein and the YQR triple mutant: 20–50% decreases in"

It is likely that fine tuned coordinated regulation of these functions is achieved through specific RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions. In a search for cis-acting elements important for the tertiary structure of the 5′-untranslated region of HIV-1 genomic RNA, we identified, by ladder selection experiments, a short stretch of nucleotides directly downstream of the poly(A) signal that interacts with a nucleotide sequence located in the matrix region. Confirmation of the sequence of the interacting sites was obtained by partial or complete inhibition of this interaction by antisense oligonucleotides and by nucleotide substitutions. In the wild type RNA, this long range interaction was intramolecular, since no intermolecular RNA association was detected by gel electrophoresis with an RNA mutated in the dimerization initiation site and containing both sequences involved in the tertiary interaction. Moreover, the functional importance of this interaction is supported by its conservation in all HIV-1 isolates as well as in HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus. Our results raise the possibility that this long range RNA-RNA interaction might be involved in the full-length genomic RNA selection during packaging, repression of the 5′ polyadenylation signal, and/or splicing regulation.

Despite numerous studies aimed to probe the structure of the 5′-unstranslated region of HIV-1 genomic RNA, very little is known about its tertiary structure in vitro as well as in the virion. It is likely that specific RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions allow fine tuned coordinated regulation of the different functional sites in this region and permit the compaction of the genomic RNA in a 120-nm particle. Recent articles reported that the leader region of HIV-1 RNA can adopt a compactly folded structure (32Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and that a conformational RNA switch could regulate various functions in the viral life cycle (5Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In a search for cis-acting elements important for the tertiary structure of the 5′-unstranslated region of HIV-1 genomic RNA, we used ladder selection experiments to identify a short stretch of nucleotides directly downstream of the poly(A) signal that interacts with a nucleotide sequence located in the matrix coding region. We report that site-directed mutagenesis disrupting either of these sequences inhibits the long distance interaction. Similarly, antisense oligonucleotides efficiently inhibit the interaction. The functional significance of this long range pseudoknot is further supported by phylogenetic sequence analysis that revealed conservation of this interaction in the genome of all HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV isolates. Site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was conducted according to the manufacturer (Stratagene), using plasmid DNAs pJCB and pJCB DIS(−) containing the 615 first nucleotides of HIV-1 Mal isolate, with a wild-type or mutated DIS sequence, respectively (24Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27486-27493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primers 5′-CTTAAGCCTCAATAAACGAAGCCTTGAGTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCACTCAAGGCTTCGTTTATTGAGGCTTAAG-3′ (antisense) were used to amplify plasmid pJCB, giving rise to plasmid pB-CG77, bearing a four-nucleotide substitution (underlined) in the polyadenylation region. On the other hand, the primer pair 5′-AACATTTAGTATGGGCTTCGAGGGAGCTGGAAAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTTTCCAGCTCCCTCGAAGCCCATACTAAATGTT-3′ (antisense) was used to amplify pJCB to give plasmid pB-UU460 with a four nucleotide substitution in the matrix coding region. Plasmid pB-CG77/UU460 containing both substitutions was obtained by amplification of pB-CG77. Thermocycling was for 1 min at 95 °C, followed by 16 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 8 min at 68 °C. The same procedure was applied to plasmid pJCA (24Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27486-27493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing region 305–615 of HIV-1 genomic RNA to obtain plasmid pA-UU460. All nucleotide positions refer to the transcription start site of HIV-1 RNAs. All mutations were checked by sequencing of the corresponding plasmids. Three sense primers containing the promoter for the T7 RNA polymerase (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG, TAATACGACTCACTATAGGTGTGTGCCCATCTGTTGTGTG-3′, and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTCTGGTAACTAGAGATCCC-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-GGCGTACTCACCAGTCGCCGC-3′) were used to amplify regions 1–102, 100–311, and 123–311 of HIV-1 genomic RNA, respectively. Plasmids pJCB, pJCB DIS(−), pB-CG77, pB-UU460, and pB-CG77/UU460 were linearized withPvuII prior to in vitro transcription to generate wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RNAs encompassing nucleotides 1–615. Plasmids pJCB, pJCB DIS(−), and pB-CC77 were also linearized withAflII, XbaI, and RsaI to generate HIV-1 RNA-(1–62), RNA-(1–152), and RNA-(1–311), respectively. RNA-(305–615) and RNA-(305–615) UU460 were obtained by in vitro transcription of pJCA and pA-UU460, respectively, linearized with SmaI. RNA fragments 1–102, 100–311, and 123–311 were obtained by in vitro transcription of templates generated by PCR. In vitro transcription was for 2 h at 37 °C with bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase under previously described conditions (37Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Transcription was followed by treatment for 30 min with RNase-free DNase I (Q-Biogen), phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. RNAs were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) on a TSK G2000 (Bio-Rad) column in a buffer containing 200 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.5), 1% (v/v) methanol. Transcripts were concentrated in a Centricon 50 (Amicon) unit, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in water prior to use. RNAs were either 5′-end-labeled for 30 min at 37 °C with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase, 3′-end-labeled overnight at 4 °C with [32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase, or randomly labeled during transcription for 2 h at 37 °C with [α-32P]ATP (38Jossinet F.

For 5′-end labeling, RNAs with free 5′-OH groups were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 4 mm ApG (Sigma) and 1 mm NTPs as previously described (38Jossinet F. Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Hermann T. Skripkin E. Lodmell J.S. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, wild-type or mutant unlabeled RNAs and their labeled counterparts (3–5 nCi, 0.01–0.04 μg) were diluted in Milli-Q water (Millipore Corp.) alone or with their corresponding unlabeled partners at 400 nm final concentration, heated for 2 min at 90 °C, and chilled on ice for 2 min. After the addition of 2 μl of 5-fold concentrated binding buffer (final concentration: 50 mmsodium cacodylate (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2), the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and analyzed at 4 °C on 1% (w/v) agarose gels in 45 mmTris-borate (pH 8.3), 0.1 mm MgCl2. Gels were fixed for 10 min in 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid and dried for 40 min under vacuum at room temperature. RNA monomers and shifted RNA species were visualized after autoradiography or by using a BAS 2000 BIO-Imager (Fuji). To determine the thermal stability of the long range interaction, samples were incubated 30 min at 30 °C, and then the temperature was gradually increased by 7 °C steps. After a 5-min incubation at the appropriate temperature, an aliquot was loaded on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel after the addition of glycerol (20% final concentration) and run as previously described. Monomers and shifted RNA species were visualized after ethidium bromide staining and quantified with the MacBas (Fuji) software. The melting temperature of the shifted RNA,T m , was defined as the temperature at which the fraction of shifted RNA was reduced by 2-fold, as compared with its value at 37 °C. In a standard experiment, 400 nm 1–156 or 1–615 RNAs was dissolved in 8 μl of water, heated for 2 min at 90 °C, chilled on ice, and renatured for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl. After renaturation, the samples were cooled at room temperature for 10 min before treatment with RNase T2 (15 min at 37 °C; 0.002 units/μl). The positions of RNase hydrolysis were detected by primer extension with avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase as previously described (2Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.-L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). 5′- and 3′-end-labeled RNA molecules (400 nm) were submitted to limited alkaline hydrolysis in 50 mm NaCO3 (pH 8.9) during 4 min at 90 °C. Alkali ladders were neutralized with 300 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.6), ethanol-precipitated, and used in the mobility shift assay with the adequate nonhydrolyzed RNA partner (400 nm). Monomers and shifted RNA molecules were cut out from the 1% low melting agarose gel and extracted with phenol (v/v) for 15 min at 50 °C. After ethanol precipitation, RNA fragments were resuspended in 4 μl of formamide-containing loading buffer and separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis on an 8% acrylamide gel. RNase T1 (G-specific) and RNase U2 (A-specific) sequencing reactions were run in parallel to detect the borders of the selected population of RNA fragments. After autoradiography, films were scanned, and densitograms of the lanes corresponding to the initial alkali ladder and the selected RNA fragments were obtained with the program QuantityOne (Bio-Rad). Synthetic DNA oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to positions 313–334, 335–366, 367–394, 395–420, and 441–460 of the HIV-1 Mal sequence were used in the mobility shift assay. Briefly, the antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (400 nm or 1.6 μm) was first incubated with 400 nm of 3′-end-labeled RNA-(305–615) in the binding buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. The RNA-oligonucleotide complexes were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with an equimolar amount of RNA-(1–311) DIS(−) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fraction of monomer and shifted RNA molecules were quantified using a BAS 2000 BIO-Imager (Fuji) as previously described (24Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9501-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To better understand the HIV-1 RNA folding and to identify potential long distance contacts, we synthesized a set of HIV-1 RNAs differing by their length by in vitrotranscription with T7 polymerase (Fig. 2 A). We analyzed the shift induced by labeled RNA-(305–615) on this set of RNAs by native agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 B). As expected from previous studies (24Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27486-27493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RNA-(305–615) is unable to dimerize (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Unexpectedly, we observed a significant mobility shift when labeled RNA-(305–615) was incubated with unlabeled RNA-(1–311) (Fig.2 B, lane 5). Indeed, several shifted species could be observed, probably because this region of the HIV-1 leader RNA contains the DIS hairpin structure (nucleotides 265–287). Indeed, the number and position of the shifted bands indicated that they most likely corresponded (from the bottom to the top of the gel) to one RNA-(305–615) molecule bound to monomeric RNA-(1–311), and one or two RNA-(305–615) molecules bound to dimeric RNA-(1–311). In keeping with this interpretation, only one shifted band was observed when labeled RNA-(306–615) was incubated with an unlabeled RNA-(1–311) bearing point mutations in the DIS loop that prevented DIS-mediated RNA dimerization (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). When labeled RNA-(305–615) was incubated with unlabeled RNA-(1–615) or RNA-(1–615) DIS(−), only very weak shifted bands were detected (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). Our interpretation of this result is that the interaction between the sequences located upstream and downstream of the SD site was intramolecular in RNA-(1–615) (and RNA-(1–615) DIS(−)). Thus, the downstream site of the long RNA efficiently competed with the homologous site of the truncated RNA-(305–615) for binding to the upstream site, reducing the level of the intermolecular interaction with RNA-(305–615). Taken together, these results suggest that the long distance interaction is independent of the RNA dimerization process and that this interaction requires two elements apart from the SD site that interact with each other through intramolecular base pairing in RNA-(1–615). To further characterize the long distance interaction, we next analyzed RNA mobility shift by using a truncated version of the 1–615 RNA. To avoid dealing with multimeric complexes on agarose gels (Fig. 2 B, lane 5), we used dimerization-deficient RNAs (DIS(−); see “Experimental Procedures”). Both RNAs starting at positions 100 and 123 were unable to shift RNA-(305–615) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 10 and 11). A similar result was obtained with RNA-(1–62) (Fig. 2 B, lane 7). On the contrary, RNA-(1–102) and RNA-(1–152) gave a shift with a yield comparable with the one obtained with RNA-(1–311) DIS(−) (Fig.2 B, lanes 8 and 9). These results indicated that one of the sequences required for the interaction was located between nucleotides 62 and 102, corresponding to the poly(A) hairpin loop (Fig.1 B). Similar experiments were conducted using unlabeled 3′-truncated RNAs starting at position 123 or 305 with labeled RNA-(1–311) DIS(−). They allowed us to delimit the 3′ interacting domain downstream of nucleotide 415 (data not shown). To estimate the number of base pairs involved in the long range interaction, we performed thermal denaturation experiments of the complex formed by RNA-(1–311) DIS(−) and RNA-(305–615) (Fig.2 C). The T m of this complex is 43–45 °C. This value is fully comparable with the T m obtained with the DIS hairpin of HIV-1, where the two RNA monomers are able to interact through six Watson-Crick base pairs (24Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27486-27493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to map more precisely the 5′ and 3′ borders of the RNA domains that form the long distance interaction, we performed ladder selection experiments. In these experiments, the RNA subfragments, obtained from a pool of RNAs generated by mild alkaline hydrolysis of either 5′- or 3′-end-labeled RNA-(1–311) or RNA-(305–615), were selected for their capability to retain binding to their unlabeled RNA partner (Fig.3 A). After extraction of the bound RNA fragments from the agarose gel (see “Experimental Procedures”), selected molecules were analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3 A), and the selection boundaries were determined from the densitograms of the initial and selected RNA species. The boundaries were identified as the starting points of a strong continuous selection. Peaks corresponding to isolated selected fragments, such as those observed at position 134 in Fig. 3 B and positions 434, 436, and 447 in Fig.3 C, were not taken into account, since they most likely reflect artifactual selections due to aberrant folding of these RNA fragments. When the 1–311 ladder was used in the mobility shift assay with unlabeled RNA-(305–615), the size of the retained RNA subfragments varied from full-length down to position U84 for 5′-end-labeled fragments and position C70 for 3′-end-labeled RNAs (Fig. 3 B). These positions (positions 70–84) defined the boundaries of a region that should be sufficient for binding RNA-(305–615). Interestingly enough, this region corresponds to the poly(A) hairpin loop and seemed even more efficiently selected when the whole poly(A) hairpin was present (Fig.3 B, higher selection from position 100), indicating that the selection probably involved structural motif recognition. When the 305–615 ladder was used in our selection experiments (Fig.3 C), we showed that the region potentially sufficient to interact with RNA-(1–311) was delimited by nucleotides A408 to G462 (Fig. 3 C). Surprisingly, this region is located in the Matrix coding sequence of the gag gene. The secondary structure of this region shown in Fig. 1 is only tentative, and with the exception of stem 413–421/490–498, the rest of this RNA domain may form loops and metastable helices particularly rich in AU pairs (2Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.-L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Thus, this region might either possess a low level of structural organization or fold into alternative structures in equilibrium with each other. The results described above indicate that a sequence located in the poly(A) hairpin loop and the 5′-end of the matrix coding region trigger the formation of the RNA shift. Thus, we focused our analysis on these two domains and looked for complementary sequences. Indeed, we identified two putative seven-nucleotide sequences that could potentially interact through Watson-Crick base pairing. The first is located immediately downstream of the poly(A) signal (77GCUUGCC83), whereas the second corresponds to nucleotides 457GGCAAGC463. To test the first sequence, we performed enzymatic RNA structure probing using truncated transcripts containing or not containing the TAR and poly(A) hairpin structures (RNAs 1–156 and 123–615) (Fig.4). These RNAs have been tested for their potential interaction, and a clear shift was detected by mobility shift assay (data not shown). The susceptibility of RNA-(1–156) toward RNase T2 was tested when incubated alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of RNA-(123–615) and compared with RNA-(1–615). In RNA-(1–156), the whole poly(A) hairpin loop was accessible to digestion by RNase T2 (Fig. 4, lane 1). However, the sequence in the loop immediately downstream of the poly(A) signal (77GCUUGCC83) clearly became protected upon incubation with increasing amounts of RNA-(123–615) (Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 4). As one would expect, RNA-(1–615), which contains the two putative sequences involved in the long distance intramolecular interaction, showed no reactivity of these nucleotides toward RNase T2. These data reinforces the hypothesis that nucleotides 77–83 constitute the 5′ interaction site. It is worthy of note that the RNase T2 accessibility of the poly(A) hairpin loop was independent of the integrity of the DIS loop (data not shown). Assays to test the downstream sequence were un"

Two previous investigations reported on the expression of the yjbR gene product (up to 3.9% of total soluble proteins in crude extract) and on its purification and partial characterization in Escherichia coli (2Nishiya Y.

The purified protein is a homotetrameric flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of various amines (e.g. sarcosine, N-ethylglycine and glycine) and d-amino acids (e.g. d-alanine, d-proline, d-valine, etc.). GO seems to partially share substrate specificity with various flavooxidases, such as d-amino-acid oxidase (DAAO) (EC1.4.3.3) and sarcosine oxidase (SOX), and also appears to be stereospecific in oxidizing the d-isomer of the amino acids tested. 2V. Job, G. Molla, M. S. Pilone, and L.

Only a modest similarity is observed with the sequences of monomeric sarcosine oxidase (MSOX) (EC 1.5.3.1), pipecolate oxidase (PIPOX) (EC 1.5.99.3) and DAAO ord-aspartate oxidase (DASPO) (EC 1.4.3.1) (18–21% identity). 2V. Job, G. Molla, M. S. Pilone, and L. Pollegioni, submitted for publication. DAAO (containing 1 mole of non-covalently bound FAD per 40 kDa monomer) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of neutral and (with a lower efficiency) basic d-amino acids to give the corresponding α-keto acids, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (4Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Acidic d-amino acids are oxidized by DASPO.N-Methyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) (EC 1.5.3.1) is a monomeric flavoenzyme (42 kDa) from E. coli containing FAD covalently linked to a cysteine residue (5Wagner M.A. Kanna P. Schuman Jorns M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5588-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PIPOX is a mammalian enzyme similar in size to MTOX and to the β subunit of MSOX (44 kDa) and also contains a single covalently bound flavin (6Mihalik S., J. McGuinnes M. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4822-4830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sarcosine oxidases have been isolated from several bacteria and belong to two different classes of enzymes: heterotetrameric (TSOX) and monomeric (MSOX) enzymes. All bacterial SOXs catalyze the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine to yield glycine, hydrogen peroxide, and formaldehyde (7Wagner M.A. Schuman Jorns M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The heterotetrameric SOXs contain four different subunits (from 10 to 100 kDa) and also contain non-covalently bound FAD, non-covalently bound NAD+, and covalently bound FMN, which is linked to the β subunit (42–45 kDa). The monomeric SOXs are similar in size to the β subunit of TSOX and contain covalently bound FAD. Only TSOXs use tetrahydrofolate as a substrate, and, in this regard, they resemble mammalian SDH and DMGDH (7Wagner M.A. Schuman Jorns M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In mammals, these two enzymes catalyze the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine in the mitochondria. They are monomeric enzymes (97 and 96 kDa, respectively) containing a single, covalently bound flavin and are considered to be the two main folate-containing enzymes in rat liver mitochondria. Furthermore, these enzymes are linked to the electron transport chain and form 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (8Cook R.J. Misono K.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12998-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).This paper focuses on characterizing the substrate-binding site and the properties of the prosthetic group in recombinant GO. We identify the products of the reaction catalyzed by GO on a number of substrates, as well as compounds that act as inhibitors and which have proved useful in probing the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. The main goal of this project is to elucidate the structure-function relationships in GO, with the ultimate aim of clarifying the modulation of the substrate specificity in enzymes active on similar compounds.DISCUSSIONThe results reported in the present work indicate that the recombinant GO from B. subtilis is a flavoenzyme containing 1 mol of a non-covalently bound FAD/45-kDa protein monomer. The observation that adding exogenous FAD does not modify the activity of GO indicates a strong binding of the flavin to the apoprotein. It also shares some of the typical properties of the class of flavoprotein oxidases, namely the ability to form a reversible flavin-adduct with sulfite and the (partial) thermodynamic stabilization of the red anionic semiquinone upon photoreduction (23Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The amount of flavin anionic semiquinone stabilized by GO during photoreduction represents near-complete formation of this form (∼95%). Its (in)stability in the presence of benzyl viologen points to a kinetic stabilization of the EFlseq form. The K d for the binding of sulfite to GO is in the range usually observed with flavoprotein oxidases (≈10–40 μm). The midpoint redox potential determined with GO (−298 mV) is close to that of free FAD (−207 mV FAD), and similar to that of other flavoenzymes in the oxidase family (32Stankovich M.T. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 401-422Google Scholar). This result confirms a strict correspondence between a higher stability of the red, anionic flavin semiquinone and a tighter binding of sulfite (as a general rule, the nucleophilic attack to the N(5) position of FAD by sulfite is facilitated by the localization and stabilization of a negative charge on the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus) (24Massey V. Müller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell L.G. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Khanna and Schuman Jorns (31Khanna P. Schuman Jorns M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that, using lactate oxidase, glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, α-glycerophosphate oxidase, and FAD a linear relationship is observed when log k on is plotted against logK d (slope −0.95). The values determined for GO match this relationship nicely and can be similarly explained by the fact that the observed variation in K d is largely due to changes in k on (in all the flavoproteins tested, the only exception being MTOX, a similar rate of complex dissociation, k off = 0.2–0.02 s−1, was determined).The pK a value for the deprotonation of the flavin N(3)-H position was determined from the pH dependence of the visible spectrum of oxidized enzyme. For GO, a pK a ≈10.6 was determined, a value higher than the corresponding value for free FAD (10.0) and for mammalian DAAO (9.4) (22Massey V. Ganther H. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) but similar to that determined for yeast DAAO (33Pollegioni L. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This change can be interpreted by assuming that different microenvironments affect the properties of the N(1)-C(2)=O and N(3)-H flavin positions, and which could be proven if the structure of GO (currently under solution) was compared with that of the known crystal structure of R. gracilis (27Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and mammalian DAAO (34Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 35Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In fact, the three-dimensional structure of RgDAAO demonstrates that a net negative charge close to the N(3)-H position is not present (27Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), as otherwise observed for many other flavooxidases (36Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).GO catalyzes the deaminative oxidation of a wide range of amino acids (see also Ref. 2Nishiya Y. Imanaka T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) 2V. Job, G. Molla, M. S. Pilone, and L. Pollegioni, submitted for publication. to form the corresponding α-keto acid. GO distinguishes from MSOX and MTOX since it catalyzes the deamination of amino acids (MSOX and MTOX catalyze the oxidative demethylation), shows a high pK a for flavin N(3)-H ionization, and reacts easily with sulfite (both MSOX and MTOX show an apparent kinetic barrier against sulfite complex formation). For all these properties GO resembles DAAO, although the sequence homology is lower with DAAO and DASPO than with SOX and MTOX. 2V. Job, G. Molla, M. S. Pilone, and L. Pollegioni, submitted for publication. The DAAO active site must clearly be larger than that of GO to accommodate the bulky side chains of its substrates (all the neutral and basicd-amino acids). The key role of bulky side chains of the active site residues of GO may be to promote the proper positioning of small-sized substrates in the active site with respect to the N(5) flavin position. Even the non-covalent link of the FAD co-factor is a characteristic that combines GO, DAAO, and DASPO and represents a main difference to MSOX, MTOX, PIPOX, SDH, and DMGDH. In fact, the conserved histidine residue (His-45) in MSOX, MTOX, and PIPOX aligns with the histidine that serves as the covalent FAD attachment site in SDH and DMGDH, although it is not the site of flavinylation (which is Cys-308 and Cys-319 in MSOX and PIPOX, respectively) (37Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Schuman Jorns M. Mathews F.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In GO such a histidine is not conserved (Ala-46 is present).In this study we have also identified a number of active site ligands that are useful in ongoing kinetic and crystallographic studies. The tightest binding is observed with glycolate (K d = 0.6 mm), a compound closely similar to the substrate glycine, which also acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to sarcosine. These results are consistent with the proposal that the enzyme has a single binding site for substrate and ligand near the non-covalently bound FAD coenzyme (ligand binding causes the perturbation of the visible absorption spectrum of the flavin). Analysis of the binding data (Table V) and the kinetic parameters (Table IV) suggests that the GO active site preferentially accommodates amines of small size such as glycine and sarcosine. The highK m values determined for d-alanine and the inability to bind dimethylglycine indicates a steric hindrance in the binding of compounds with a tetrahedric center or with three substituents larger than an H atom. The presence of a carboxylic group is not mandatory for binding and catalysis, as demonstrated by comparison of the V max and K m values determined with ethylglycinate and N-ethylglycine. Analogously, the amino group is not mandatory for the binding and for the activity (in thioglycolate the amino group of glycolate is replaced by a –SH group). Analysis of the binding data for linear aliphatic acids suggests that each methylene group contributes very little to binding energy (0.2–0.4 kcal/mol). Interestingly, no compounds have been found that bind GO and give spectral perturbations resembling those of charge-transfer complexes.Expression and purification of relatively large amounts of recombinant GO from E. coli cells and the characterization of its flavin and substrate specificity will enable us to address the catalytic mechanism and structure-function relationships of this novel oxidase in further detail in the near future. Finally, the similarities in kinetic properties of GO, DAAO, and DASPO paired with the differences in their primary structures and overall biochemical behavior reported here suggest a case of converging evolution.

Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Acidic d-amino acids are oxidized by DASPO.N-Methyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) (EC 1.5.3.1) is a monomeric flavoenzyme (42 kDa) from E. coli containing FAD covalently linked to a cysteine residue (5Wagner M.A. Kanna P. Schuman Jorns M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5588-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PIPOX is a mammalian enzyme similar in size to MTOX and to the β subunit of MSOX (44 kDa) and also contains a single covalently bound flavin (6Mihalik S., J. McGuinnes M. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4822-4830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sarcosine oxidases have been isolated from several bacteria and belong to two different classes of enzymes: heterotetrameric (TSOX) and monomeric (MSOX) enzymes. All bacterial SOXs catalyze the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine to yield glycine, hydrogen peroxide, and formaldehyde (7Wagner M.A. Schuman Jorns M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The heterotetrameric SOXs contain four different subunits (from 10 to 100 kDa) and also contain non-covalently bound FAD, non-covalently bound NAD+, and covalently bound FMN, which is linked to the β subunit (42–45 kDa). The monomeric SOXs are similar in size to the β subunit of TSOX and contain covalently bound FAD. Only TSOXs use tetrahydrofolate as a substrate, and, in this regard, they resemble mammalian SDH and DMGDH (7Wagner M.A. Schuman Jorns M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In mammals, these two enzymes catalyze the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine in the mitochondria. They are monomeric enzymes (97 and 96 kDa, respectively) containing a single, covalently bound flavin and are considered to be the two main folate-containing enzymes in rat liver mitochondria. Furthermore, these enzymes are linked to the electron transport chain and form 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (8Cook R.J. Misono K.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12998-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This paper focuses on characterizing the substrate-binding site and the properties of the prosthetic group in recombinant GO. We identify the products of the reaction catalyzed by GO on a number of substrates, as well as compounds that act as inhibitors and which have proved useful in probing the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. The main goal of this project is to elucidate the structure-function relationships in GO, with the ultimate aim of clarifying the modulation of the substrate specificity in enzymes active on similar compounds. DISCUSSIONThe results reported in the present work indicate that the recombinant GO from B. subtilis is a flavoenzyme containing 1 mol of a non-covalently bound FAD/45-kDa protein monomer. The observation that adding exogenous FAD does not modify the activity of GO indicates a strong binding of the flavin to the apoprotein. It also shares some of the typical properties of the class of flavoprotein oxidases, namely the ability to form a reversible flavin-adduct with sulfite and the (partial) thermodynamic stabilization of the red anionic semiquinone upon photoreduction (23Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The amount of flavin anionic semiquinone stabilized by GO during photoreduction represents near-complete formation of this form (∼95%). Its (in)stability in the presence of benzyl viologen points to a kinetic stabilization of the EFlseq form. The K d for the binding of sulfite to GO is in the range usually observed with flavoprotein oxidases (≈10–40 μm). The midpoint redox potential determined with GO (−298 mV) is close to that of free FAD (−207 mV FAD), and similar to that of other flavoenzymes in the oxidase family (32Stankovich M.T. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 401-422Google Scholar). This result confirms a strict correspondence between a higher stability of the red, anionic flavin semiquinone and a tighter binding of sulfite (as a general rule, the nucleophilic attack to the N(5) position of FAD by sulfite is facilitated by the localization and stabilization of a negative charge on the flavin N(1)-C(2)=O locus) (24Massey V. Müller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell L.G. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Khanna and Schuman Jorns (31Khanna P. Schuman Jorns M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that, using lactate oxidase, glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, α-glycerophosphate oxidase, and FAD a linear relationship is observed when log k on is plotted against logK d (slope −0.95). The values determined for GO match this relationship nicely and can be similarly explained by the fact that the observed variation in K d is largely due to changes in k on (in all the flavoproteins tested, the only exception being MTOX, a similar rate of complex dissociation, k off = 0.2–0.02 s−1, was determined).The pK a value for the deprotonation of the flavin N(3)-H position was determined from the pH dependence of the visible spectrum of oxidized enzyme. For GO, a pK a ≈10.6 was determined, a value higher than the corresponding value for free FAD (10.0) and for mammalian DAAO (9.4) (22Massey V. Ganther H. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) but similar to that determined for yeast DAAO (33Pollegioni L. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This change can be interpreted by assuming that different microenvironments affect the properties of the N(1)-C(2)=O and N(3)-H flavin positions, and which could be proven if the structure of GO (currently under solution) was compared with that of the known crystal structure of R. gracilis (27Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and mammalian DAAO (34Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 35Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In fact, the three-dimensional structure of RgDAAO demonstrates that a net negative charge close to the N(3)-H position is not present (27Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), as otherwise observed for many other flavooxidases (36Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).GO catalyzes the deaminative oxidation of a wide range of amino acids (see also Ref. 2Nishiya Y. Imanaka T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) 2V. Job, G. Molla, M. S. Pilone, and L. Pollegioni, submitted for publication. to form the corresponding α-keto acid. GO distinguishes from MSOX and MTOX since it catalyzes the deamination of amino acids (MSOX and MTOX catalyze the oxidative demethylation), shows a high pK a for flavin N(3)-H ionization, and reacts easily with sulfite (both MSOX and MTOX show an apparent kinetic barrier against sulfite complex formation). For all these properties GO resembles DAAO, although the sequence homology is lower with DAAO and DASPO than with SOX and MTOX. 2V. Job, G. Molla, M. S. Pilone, and L. Pollegioni, submitted for publication. The DAAO active site must clearly be larger than that of GO to accommodate the bulky side chains of its substrates (all the neutral and basicd-amino acids). The key role of bulky side chains of the active site residues of GO may be to promote the proper positioning of small-sized substrates in the active site with respect to the N(5) flavin position. Even the non-covalent link of the FAD co-factor is a characteristic that combines GO, DAAO, and DASPO and represents a main difference to MSOX, MTOX, PIPOX, SDH, and DMGDH. In fact, the conserved histidine residue (His-45) in MSOX, MTOX, and PIPOX aligns with the histidine that serves as the covalent FAD attachment site in SDH and DMGDH, although it is not the site of flavinylation (which is Cys-308 and Cys-319 in MSOX and PIPOX, respectively) (37Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Schuman Jorns M. Mathews F.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In GO such a histidine is not conserved (Ala-46 is present).In this study we have also identified a number of active site ligands that are useful in ongoing kinetic and crystallographic studies. The tightest binding is observed with glycolate (K d = 0.6 mm), a compound closely similar to the substrate glycine, which also acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to sarcosine. These results are consistent with the proposal that the enzyme has a single binding site for substrate and ligand near the non-covalently bound FAD coenzyme (ligand binding causes the perturbation of the visible absorption spectrum of the flavin). Analysis of the binding data (Table V) and the kinetic parameters (Table IV) suggests that the GO active site preferentially accommodates amines of small size such as glycine and sarcosine. The highK m values determined for d-alanine and the inability to bind dimethylglycine indicates a steric hindrance in the binding of compounds with a tetrahedric center or with three substituents larger than an H atom. The presence of a carboxylic group is not mandatory for binding and catalysis, as demonstrated by comparison of the V max and K m values determined with ethylglycinate and N-ethylglycine. Analogously, the amino group is not mandatory for the binding and for the activity (in thioglycolate the amino group of glycolate is replaced by a –SH group). Analysis of the binding data for linear aliphatic acids suggests that each methylene group contributes very little to binding energy (0.2–0.4 kcal/mol). Interestingly, no compounds have been found that bind GO and give spectral perturbations resembling those of charge-transfer complexes.Expression and purification of relatively large amounts of recombinant GO from E. coli cells and the characterization of its flavin and substrate specificity will enable us to address the catalytic mechanism and structure-function relationships of this novel oxidase in further detail in the near future. Finally, the similarities in kinetic properties of GO, DAAO, and DASPO paired with the differences in their primary structures and overall biochemical behavior reported here suggest a case of converging evolution.

ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins regulate PI(4,5)P2 synthesis, and here we have examined whether this is due to direct activation of Type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) 5-kinase or indirectly by phosphatidate (PA) derived from phospholipase D (PLD) in HL60 cells. ARF1 and ARF6 are both expressed in HL60 cells and can be depleted from the cells by permeabilization. Both ARFs increased the levels of PIP2 (PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,5)P2, or PI(3,4)P2 isomers) at the expense of PIP when added back to permeabilized cells. The PIP2 could be hydrolyzed by phospholipase C, identifying it as PI(4,5)P2. However, the ARF1-stimulated pool of PI(4,5)P2 was accessible to the phospholipase C more efficiently in the presence of phosphatidylinositol transfer protein-α. To examine the role of PLD in the regulation of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis, we used butanol to diminish the PLD-derived PA. PI(4,5)P2 synthesis stimulated by ARF1 was not blocked by 0.5% butanol but could be blocked by 1.5% butanol. Although 0.5% butanol was optimal for maximal transphosphatidylation, PA production was still detectable. In contrast, 1.5% butanol was found to inhibit the activation of PLD by ARF1 and also decrease PIP levels by 50%. Thus the toxicity of 1.5% butanol prevented us from concluding whether PA was an important factor in raising PI(4,5)P2 levels. To circumvent the use of alcohols, an ARF1 point mutant was identified (N52R-ARF1) that could selectively activate PIP 5-kinase α activity but not PLD activity. N52R-ARF1 was still able to increase PI(4,5)P2 levels but at reduced efficiency. We therefore conclude that both PA derived from the PLD pathway and ARF proteins, by directly activating PIP 5-kinase, contribute to the regulation of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis at the plasma membrane in HL60 cells.

Many proteins have binding sites for PI(4,5)P2, and these include a subset of PH domains, ENTH domains, and basic patches of sequence, which facilitates their association to PI(4,5)P2-containing membranes. Signaling, endocytosis and exocytosis all occur at the plasma membrane, where the majority of the cellular PI(4,5)P2 is localized (14Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr.

Thus, the opposing requirement for PI(4,5)P2 as a substrate for signaling purposes and as an intact lipid for cellular function at the plasma membrane demands that the availability of PI(4,5)P2 is regulated.Synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane requires both activation of the lipid kinases as well as a supply of PI, which is synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum. During hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by phospholipase C, a soluble lipid transfer protein, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) is required to make substrate available on demand for hydrolysis and spares the resident pool of PI(4,5)P2 (21Cunningham E.

The major pathway for PI(4,5)P2 synthesis is by sequential phosphorylation of PI by a PI 4-kinase to PI(4)P followed by a PIP 5-kinase. Three PI 4-kinase enzymes (α, β, and γ) have been identified. PI 4-kinase α is a 230-kDa protein localized at the endoplasmic reticulum and PI 4-kinase β is a 92-kDa protein localized mainly at the Golgi and in the cytosol (24Balla T. Downing G.J. Jaffe H.

The most active PI 4-kinase is the Type II p55 isoform (PI 4-kinase γ), which is localized at the plasma membrane and secretory granules and accounts for the majority of global PI 4-kinase activity in mammalian cells (29Kauffmann-Zeh A.

There are three isoforms of PIP 5-kinases, α, β, and γ, which are differentially expressed and can all be activated by PA in vitro (32Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Wada T. Yazaki Y. Asano T.

It had been reported that PIP 5-kinase purified from red blood cells could be activated more than a 100-fold by PA when PI(4)P alone was used as substrate (33Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies report activation by PA of between 2- and 3-fold only (20Jones D.R. Sanjuan M.A. Merida I.

The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but in the additional presence of ARF proteins, a further stimulation of the lipid kinase activity is observed (28Jones D.H. Morris J.B. Morgan C.P. Kondo H. Irvine R.F. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H.

ARF1 has also been found to directly stimulate PIP 5-kinase α in the absence of PA when the substrate PI(4)P was provided in the vesicle mixture as a minor component (PC:PI(4)P, 10:1). (28Jones D.H. Morris J.B. Morgan C.P. Kondo H. Irvine R.F. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, from the in vitro analysis, it is clear that PIP 5-kinase activity can be regulated by inputs from either ARF proteins, PA alone, or by ARF proteins in synergy with PA, depending on the composition of the lipid vesicles used in the assay.ARF1 has been shown to stimulate PI(4,5)P2 production in permeabilized cells (7Fensome A.

Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ARF1 is also a direct activator of phospholipase D, it is not clear whether the effect of ARF1 on PI(4,5)P2 synthesis is a direct result of PIP 5-kinase activation or an indirect result of PA production or both. ARF1 also stimulates PI(4,5)P2 production in purified Golgi membranes, and in this case it was demonstrated that ARF1 sequentially activated PI 4-kinase β and PIP 5-kinase α directly and that PA derived from PLD was not required (27Godi A. Pertile P., Di Tullio G. Iurisco C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 28Jones D.H. Morris J.B. Morgan C.P. Kondo H.

Alcohols were unable to inhibit PIP2 synthesis, and second, PLD activity was not enriched in this compartment. This was taken as evidence that PLD-derived PA was not required. In contrast, in two separate studies using purified lysosomes and Golgi membranes, it was reported that butanol blocked PI(4,5)P2 synthesis and attributed this to a requirement for PA derived from the PLD pathway (35Arneson L.

In this study we have analyzed the mechanism of ARF protein-stimulated PI(4,5)P2 synthesis in HL60 cells.DISCUSSIONPIP2 functions at the plasma membrane serving as a substrate for phospholipase C and PI 3-kinase as well as an intact signaling molecule for endocytosis, exocytosis, and for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In this study we have analyzed the role of ARF proteins in regulating PIP2 levels in HL60 cells. HL60 cells contain ARF1 and ARF6 proteins, which are freely soluble, as demonstrated by their ability to exit from the permeabilized cells. Binding of GTP or GTPγS catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors is required for activation of the ARF proteins, and this stabilizes its association with target membranes. Thus, when GTPγS was present during the permeabilization, both ARF1 and ARF6 became membrane-associated (Fig. 1 A). In a previous study conducted in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it was demonstrated that ARF1–5 were cytosolic and could be recruited to membranes with GTPγS but that ARF6 was stably membrane-bound and, moreover, restricted to the plasma membrane (47Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang Cj Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies using overexpression identify that ARF6 localizes to and regulates a plasma membrane-endosome-trafficking pathway (48D'Souza-Schorey C., Li, G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 49Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

In some cells, ARF6 is both cytosolic and membrane-bound, and like ARF1, its distribution is regulated by its GTPase cycle (51Yang C.Z. Heimberg H. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mueckler M.M. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4006-4011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 52Gaschet J. Hsu V.W. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the cell type, the distribution of the membrane-bound form versus the cytosolic form must be variable to account for the differences observed, and in the case of the HL60 cells, the membrane-bound pool is insignificant.We report here that the addition of either ARF1 or ARF6 to permeabilized HL60 cells is able to reconstitute the synthesis of PIP2 (because ARF1 or ARF6 are equally effective at stimulating PIP2 synthesis, we have routinely used ARF1 rather than ARF6 because ARF6 is more difficult to purify, unstable, and has a tendency to aggregate). That the PIP2 synthesized by the addition of ARF1 is available for hydrolysis by a plasma membrane-located PLCβ2 would suggest that not only ARF6 but also ARF1 could function at the plasma membrane at least in the permeabilized cells used here. Although ARF6 has an established function in the endosomal recycling to the plasma membrane as discussed above, ARF1 is involved in trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi and endosomal systems. At the Golgi, ARF1 functions to recruit a number of coat proteins including GGAs, coatomer, and adaptor protein 2/clathrin (54Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), PI 4-kinase β, and PIP 5-kinase α (27Godi A. Pertile P., Di Tullio G. Iurisco C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 28Jones D.H. Morris J.B. Morgan C.P. Kondo H. Irvine R.F. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, when purified Golgi are primed with ARF1, synthesis of both PIP and PIP2 is observed due to ARF1 activation of PI 4-kinase β and PIP 5-kinase α (27Godi A. Pertile P., Di Tullio G. Iurisco C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 28Jones D.H. Morris J.B. Morgan C.P. Kondo H. Irvine R.F. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the permeabilized cells, ARF1 decreases PIP levels and causes an increase in PIP2levels, a phenomenon that is different from what ARF1 has been shown to do in purified Golgi fractions. This would suggest that in the permeabilized cells, the changes monitored in PIP2 levels by ARF1 are exclusively due to activation of PIP 5-kinase α at the plasma membrane, where a pre-existing pool of PIP is used as a substrate.This conclusion is further supported by the use of brefeldin A. At the Golgi, activation of ARF1 is dependent on the high molecular weight ARF-guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which are sensitive to brefeldin A (54Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 55Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends in Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). At the plasma membranes the low molecular weight family of ARF-guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which include ARNO, cytohesin, and EFA6, are resistant to brefeldin A (55Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends in Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A, however, has no effect on ARF1-stimulated PIP2synthesis (data not shown), again supporting the notion that ARF1 very likely stimulates PIP2 synthesis at the plasma membrane. Finally, if ARF1 was functioning to activate PIP2 synthesis at the Golgi in the permeabilized cells, it would be necessary for the PIP2 to be transported to the plasma membrane where it can be utilized as a substrate for the PLC. However, GTPγS inhibits constitutive vesicular transport out of the Golgi (56Miller S.G. Moore H.-P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results support the conclusion that the major effect of ARF1 on the PIP2 levels is at the plasma membrane rather than the Golgi in permeabilized cells. It is highly possible that ARF1 also influences phosphoinositide levels at the Golgi, but this effect may be masked by the more extensive changes taking place at the plasma membrane. Thus ARF1 can function at the plasma membrane as an activator of lipid-metabolizing enzymes in permeabilized cells. It is possible that this may not be its normal function and that in permeabilized cells, ARF1 compensates for ARF6 at the plasma membrane.How Does ARF Increase PIP2 LevelsTwo possible regulators of PIP 5-kinase activity at the plasma membrane are PA and ARF or a combination of both. PA is produced via ARF regulation of PLD activity at the plasma membrane (16Whatmore J. Morgan C.P. Cunningham E. Collison K.S. Willison K.R. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the question can be restated as to whether ARF activates PIP kinase directly or indirectly via PA-derived PLD. We used butanol to reduce the amount of PA produced by the PLD pathway and observe that under conditions of maximal transphosphatidylation, PIP2 synthesis is unaffected. We also observed that 0.5% butanol did not completely stop PA production (see Fig. 6 and Ref. 40Geny B. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, these data were not conclusive to exclude PA as an activator of PIP 5-kinase activity.In two recent studies, a requirement for PA-derived PLD was demonstrated for PIP2 synthesis based on the use of 1.5% butanol (35Arneson L. Kunz J. Anderson R.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17794-17805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Siddhanta A. Backer J.M. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12023-12031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We confirmed that 1.5% butanol was indeed inhibitory for PIP2 synthesis. However, this concentration of butanol is far in excess of what is required for maximal transphosphatidylation, which is 0.5%. We also note that PIP levels are reduced substantially by 1.5% butanol. Phosphoinositides play an important role in maintaining Golgi structure and function, and thus, the effects of 1.5% butanol could be attributed to depletion of PIP levels rather than PA as suggested previously (36Siddhanta A. Backer J.M. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12023-12031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More importantly, we show here that 1.5% butanol actually inhibits the activation of PLD. Thus the observed inhibition of PIP2 synthesis reported earlier and also shown in this paper cannot be attributed to a requirement for PA-derived from the PLD. Instead, the inhibition of PIP2 synthesis observed could be due to effects on other lipid-metabolizing enzymes.To circumvent the use of alcohols in HL60 cells and obtain a more definitive answer, we identified N52R-ARF1 mutant that could selectively activate PIP 5-kinase activity in vitro but was unable to activate PLD. This mutant was still active in the synthesis of PIP2 in permeabilized HL60 despite being unable to activate PLD. However, PIP2 synthesis was reduced by 45%, illustrating that PA-derived from PLD pathway can make an important contribution to the activation of PIP 5-kinase.From the in vitro studies of PIP 5-kinase activation, ARF proteins could either activate PIP 5-kinase directly (28Jones D.H. Morris J.B. Morgan C.P. Kondo H. Irvine R.F. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or require PA as a co-stimulus (34Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The in vitro studies used vesicle preparations that do not reflect the lipid composition that PIP 5-kinase would encounter in cells. The studies using permeabilized cells circumvent this problem, since the activation of the enzyme is studied in its “native” membrane environment. These studies allow us to conclude that ARF proteins can activate PIP 5-kinase without being entirely dependent on PA generated from the PLD pathway, and second, PA can further enhance the ARF effect and, therefore, make a contribution to the activity of PIP 5-kinase. Whether PA is capable of activating PIP 5-kinase α independently of ARF in cells awaits the identification of ARF mutants, which can selectively activate PLD but not PIP 5-kinase activity. Fig. 11summarizes the ARF-regulated pathways that lead to the synthesis of PIP2 in HL60 cells. ARF1 alone is capable of stimulating PIP 5-kinase activity that can be further stimulated by PA derived from PLD activity. However, we cannot totally exclude a role for PA in the activation of PIP 5-kinase because of the presence of a pre-existing basal pool of PA. The PIP2 produced by this pathway is only marginally available for hydrolysis by PLC but can be accessed by the PLC provided that PITPα is present. We conclude that ARF proteins regulate PIP2 synthesis both directly and indirectly by generation of PA and, second, that the PITP determines the availability of PIP2 for PLC hydrolysis. The data suggest the presence of multiple pools of PIP2 at the plasma membrane. In this context it is interesting to note that ARF6-induced actin-dependent motility of particles was inhibited by 0.3% butanol, indicating a role for PA-derived PLD (57Schafer D. D'Souza-Schorey C. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 892-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, anti-PIP2 antibodies did not block actin-dependent particle mobility, leading the authors to conclude that PI(4,5)P2 was not required. This is a surprising conclusion as many studies have now shown the importance of PIP2 in actin dynamics (4Sechi A.S. Wehland J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3685-3695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is highly possible that the anti-PIP2 antibodies cannot easily access the newly synthesized PIP2 stimulated by ARF6, and a different approach may be required to probe the requirement for PI(4,5)P2 in actin assembly.Alcohols are the only tool currently available in modulating PA levels generated from PLD activation and remain a useful tool provided that the concentrations used are kept within limits and consideration is taken that transphosphatidylation is incomplete (discussed in Cockcroft (58Cockcroft S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). Several recent studies report success in the use of catalytically inactive PLD mutants as dominant-negative PLDs. For example, it has been reported that catalytically inactive PLD mutants could inhibit insulin-stimulated PLD activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase (59Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C.

In the Gram-negative bacteria, the efficient and correct formation of disulfide bonds, mostly in periplasmic proteins, requires the activity of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (1Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the genes encoding several such enzymes have been studied, namely bdbA,bdbB, and bdbC (2Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 24531-24538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It was shown that BdbB and BdbC play roles in the folding of secreted proteins at the cell surface and that BdbC was required for the development of competence for genetic transformation. Transformation in B. subtilis requires a unique set of gene products that mediate the binding and uptake of macromolecular DNA (reviewed in Ref. 3Dubnau D. Lovett C.M., Jr. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A.

These include the products of the comGoperon and of comC, which encode proteins with similarity to components of the type II secretion machinery of Gram-negative bacteria as well as to proteins required for the assembly of type IV pili. ComC is a signal peptidase that cleaves several N-terminal residues from ComGC, ComGD, ComGE, and ComGG, all of which are similar to type IV prepilins. The ComG and ComC proteins are essential for the binding of transforming DNA to the competent cell, although they do not themselves appear to be DNA binding proteins. Instead, the pilin-like ComG proteins, which are translocated to the cell wall and the exterior surface of the membrane after processing, appear to permit contact between transforming DNA and the membrane-localized DNA receptor ComEA (4Provvedi R. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ComGC contains an intramolecular disulfide bond and that a minor fraction of ComGG molecules exist as dimers, stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds (5Chung Y.S. Breidt F. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The expression of the genes encoding these transformation proteins is regulated by a complex signal transduction mechanism that culminates in the synthesis of ComK, a factor required for the transcription of the DNA transport genes (6Van Sinderen D. Luttinger A. Kong L. Dubnau D. Venema G. Hamoen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In fact, the transcription of comC and of thecomG operon is completely dependent on ComK. When the genome sequence of B. subtilis was published in 1997, it represented the first complete sequence of a Gram-positive bacterium (7Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Nature. 1997; 20: 249-256Crossref Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). Well before the completion of the genome sequence, a program was initiated aimed at the analysis of B. subtilisgenes with unknown function. This B. subtilis Systematic Gene Function Analysis Project was started at the end of 1995 in both Europe and Japan and involved some 30 research laboratories. So far, about 1300 mutants have been tested; some 30 previously unknown essential genes have been identified, and well over 500 mutant strains have been assigned single or multiple phenotypes. 1The Micado data base is available on the World Wide Web at locus.jouy.inra.fr/cgi-bin/genmic/madbase_home.pl. 1The Micado data base is available on the World Wide Web at locus.jouy.inra.fr/cgi-bin/genmic/madbase_home.pl. Among other phenotypes, these mutant strains have been analyzed for DNA recombination and competence. In the present paper, we describe the identification of a novel operon required for the late stages of competence development in B. subtilis. Disruption of the first gene in this operon, yvgV, resulted in a complete loss of transformability. Interestingly, the YvgV protein shows significant similarity to several known DsbG-like thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, which catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins that are exported from the cytoplasm (8Andersen C.L. Matthey D.A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The second gene in the operon is the above mentioned bdbC (2Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 24531-24538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By analogy to bdbC and two other genes for proteins implicated in Bacillusdisulfide bond formation (i.e. bdbA andbdbB) (2Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 24531-24538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the yvgV gene has been renamedbdbD. We show here that both BdbC and BdbD are essential for the stability of disulfide bond-containing transformation proteins and for the secreted protein PhoA. Accordingly, we hypothesize that these typical thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases act as a redox pair, required for the functionality of the DNA-binding and uptake machinery ofB. subtilis.

After adjustment of the pH to 7.0 and sterilization, the following components were added to complete the minimal medium used in transformation experiments (per 50 ml): 0.5% glucose, 0.02% casamino acids (Difco), 1.4 mg/mll-tryptophan, and 2.2 mg/ml ferric ammonium citrate. TY broth consisted of the following (per liter): 10 g of trypton (Difco), 5 g of yeast extract (Difco), and 10 g of NaCl, pH 7.4. Where necessary, media were supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. Ampicillin and kanamycin (Km) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and were used at 50 μg/ml (Escherichia coli) and 50 μg/ml (both E. coli and B. subtilis), respectively. Erythromycin was from Sigma and was used at 150 and 0.4 μg/ml for E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively; chloramphenicol and spectinomycin were purchased from Sigma and routinely used at 5 μg/ml (B. subtilis) and 100 μg/ml (both E. coli and B. subtilis), respectively. Chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis was isolated according to Ref. 9Bron S. Venema G. Mutat. Res. 1972; 15: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar. Minipreparations of plasmid DNA from E. coli were obtained by the alkaline lysis method (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Southern blot analyses were performed using the nonradioactive ECL labeling and detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Strain BFA1074 was constructed as follows. A 233-bp fragment (coordinates 3437442–3437675 on the B. subtilis 168 genome sequence (7Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A.

Nature. 1997; 20: 249-256Crossref Scopus (3088) Google Scholar) of thebdbD gene (coordinates 3437127–3437795, complementary strand), was amplified by PCR using primers carrying a BamHI (5′-cgc ggatCC ATA CTT CTT CAG ATG CAA G-3′) and a HindIII (5′-gcc gaagctTCC GGA CAG CCG TCT ATC-3′) restriction site, respectively. The fragment was subsequently digested with both BamHI andHindIII and ligated intoBamHI-HindIII-digested pMutin2mcs. The resulting plasmid, pSC5, was used to transform competent B. subtilis 168 cells; selection of transformants was performed on TY plates containing erythromycin (0.4 μg/ml). Two of the resulting transformants were selected and analyzed by PCR and Southern hybridization to verify that integration had occurred at the desired site. With one of these, the expected PCR fragments and hybridization patterns were obtained (not shown); this strain was designated BFA1074. Complementation of insertions in eitherbdbC or bdbD was achieved by placing the individual genes under control of the xylose-inducible promoter present on pX (11Kim L. Mogk A. Schumann W. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).

These fragments were subsequently cloned into the SpeI and BamHI sites of pX, and the resulting constructs were integrated in single copy in the amyE locus of the B. subtilis chromosome. These constructs were designated XbdbD (laboratory collection number BV2007) and XbdbC, respectively. B. subtilis cells were tested for transformability as follows. Typically, seven mutants were analyzed in parallel, plus the wild-type strain 168 as a control. Cells were grown to competence essentially as described in Ref. 9Bron S. Venema G. Mutat. Res. 1972; 15: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and were transformed with chromosomal DNA of strain BRB689 (amyQ + CmR; collaboration with the group of M. Sarvas, Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland). Transformability was expressed as the percentage of CmRtransformants of the total viable count. The strains constructed in the present studies were also tested for competence by transformation with chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis OG1 (trp +) and selection on minimal agar without tryptophan or by transformation with the plasmid pKTH10 and selection of KmR transformants. To monitor the srfAexpression and surfactin synthesis, cells were transformed with chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis 168sfp+(KmR). The ability of B. subtilis strains to repair DNA damage was used as a measure for homologous recombination. To this purpose, resistance to mitomycin C was determined by transfer of colonies to solid media with 60 ng/ml of this mutagen. As a control for mitomycin C sensitivity, theaddAB knock-out mutant 8GK0 (ΔaddAB) (12Meima R. Haijema B.J. Venema G. Bron S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which does not grow in the presence of 60 ng/ml mitomycin C, was used. The assay for alkaline phosphatase activity in growth media and the calculation of PhoA units (perA 600) were performed as described in Ref.13Nicholson W.L. Setlow P. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M.

To assay cellular β-galactosidase levels, overnight cultures were diluted in fresh medium to an optical density at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.05, and samples were taken at hourly intervals for A 600 readings and β-galactosidase activity determination. The β-galactosidase assay and the calculation of β-galactosidase units (perA 600) were performed as described in Ref. 2Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol.

The presence of proteins in cell lysates was checked by SDS-PAGE, followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subsequent detection of the proteins using appropriate polyclonal antibodies. Membrane and protoplast supernatant fractions were prepared as described previously (14Provvedi R. Chen I. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

Chemiluminescent detection of bound antibodies was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences).

Multiple alignments were performed using ClustalW (available on the World Wide Web at www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/).

Of all B. subtilis Systematic Gene Function Analysis Project mutants tested, only one (BFA1074) exhibited a complete loss of transformability (TableII). In this particular strain, the chromosomal integration vector pMutin2mcs (17Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) was inserted in the bdbD gene (Fig. 1). To verify that the competence defect of strain BFA1074 was due to inactivation of bdbD, we transformed the parental strain 168 with chromosomal DNA of BFA1074 and tested the resulting erythromycin-resistant strain for transformability. This strain exhibited the same complete loss of transformability as the original strain BFA1074 (results not shown), confirming that the defect was indeed caused by the pMutin2mcs insertion inbdbD.Table IITransformability of strains carrying mutations in the bdbDC operonStrainRelevant genotypeTransformabilityViable countCmR coloniesFrequencyPercentage of 168× 10 6× 10 3%168Parental strain761.602.1 × 10−3100bdbCbdbC∷pMutin2mcs68000bdbD(BFA1074)bdbD∷pMutin2mcs72000bdbD(BFA1074)bdbD∷pMutin2mcs129000 + 100 μm IPTGbdbC is transcribedBFA1075yvbF∷pMutin2mcs873.313.8 × 10−3181BFA1076yvbG∷pMutin2mcs851.381.6 × 10−377BFA1078yvbJ∷pMutin2mcs893.313.7 × 10−2177BFA1079yvbK∷pMutin2mcs871.541.7 × 10−381BFA1081yvbT∷pMutin2mcs952.782.9 × 10−3139BFA1090ypqA∷pMutin2mcs1173.981.6 × 10−381Transformability was expressed as the percentage of CmRtransformants of the total viable count.

The BFA1075, BFA1076, BFA1078, BFA1079, BFA1081, and BFA1090 strains represent randomly selected control strains from the BSFA collection. As inferred from the genome sequence (7Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Nature. 1997; 20: 249-256Crossref Scopus (3088) Google Scholar), bdbD forms an operon-like structure with the downstream bdbC gene (Fig.1 A), which has been implicated in secretion and competence development (Table II) (2Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 24531-24538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The bdbDC operon is flanked by two transcriptional terminators, and bdbD andbdbC are separated by four nucleotides. A putative ςA-type promoter (TTGCGA-17 bp-TTTAAA) was found upstream of bdbD with the −35 sequence overlapping the proximal arm of the upstream terminator. Consistent with these indications thatbdbD and bdbC form an operon, the expression profiles of both genes (determined with transcriptional lacZgene fusions provided by integrated pMutin2mcs plasmids; see Fig. 1 B) were nearly identical, irrespective of the growth medium used (minimal or TY medium; data not shown). Based on computer-assisted analyses, the BdbD protein has a cleavable amino-terminal signal peptide. Thus, it seems likely that, upon translocation, this protein is proteolytically released from the membrane by one of the type I signal peptidases ofB. subtilis (18Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the predicted mature part of BdbD contains a CXXC motif, which is typical for thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases involved in the formation or isomerization of disulfide bonds. These enzymes include thioredoxins, protein-disulfide isomerases, and the periplasmic DsbA, DsbC, DsbG, and DsbE proteins of E. coli (1Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 20Bardwell J.-C.A. Mcgovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In fact, BdbD shows the highest levels of amino acid sequence similarity to DsbA from another Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus(Fig.2) 2A. Dumoulin, direct submission to GenBankTM, accession number AAG41993. and with the DsbG protein of Chlamydia trachomatis (22Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C.J. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L.

In addition, we observed sequence similarity, albeit more limited, with DsbG of E. coli as well as the DsbA proteins of Haemophilus influenzae (23Tomb J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10252-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar),Neisseria meningitidis (24Tettelin H. Saunders N.J. Heidelberg J. Jeffries A.C. Nelson K.E. Eisen J.A. Ketchum K.A. Hood D.W.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A further characteristic of several thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (but not of DsbA of S. aureus), namely a conserved Phe residue at position −5 relative to the CXXC motif (8Andersen C.L. Matthey D.A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Creighton T.E. Freedman R.B. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 790-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), is also present in the predicted BdbD protein. Thus, like the adjacentbdbC gene (2Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 24531-24538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar), bdbD specifies a typical thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase. As the mutant strain BFA1074 was obtained through the integration of pMutin2mcs in bdbD, the competence defect of this strain may be due to a polar effect on the expression ofbdbC rather than to the disruption of bdbDitself. To test this possibility, the transformability of thebdbD mutant strain BFA1074 was tested in the presence of IPTG 3IPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d- galactopyranoside in order to inducebdbC transcription from the Pspac promoter of the integrated pMutin2mcs (see Fig. 1 B). As shown in Table II, IPTG-induced expression of bdbC did not restore the transformability of BFA1074, and therefore, the competence-null phenotype seemed to be caused by disruption of the bdbD gene itself. To verify this, bdbC or bdbD was ectopically expressed in the amyE locus under control of a xylose-inducible promoter, resulting in the construct XbdbCor XbdbD, respectively. These constructs were then combined with the bdbC or bdbD mutations, and the transformability of the resulting strains was tested. As shown in TableIII, competence was almost completely restored by the xylose-induced ectopic expression of bdbC in the bdbC-XbdbC strain. In fact, competence of the latter strain was even restored in the absence of xylose induction, which must be attributed to leakiness of the xylose-inducible promoter (see Ref. 18Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, no complementation of the competence defect was observed when expression of one or both of the genes was lacking. This was the case for the following strains:bdbD-XbdbD (BdbC− in the absence of IPTG), bdbC-XbdbD (under all conditions BdbC−), or bdbD-XbdbC (under all conditions BdbD−), irrespective of the presence of xylose (Table III).

Residence of the endogenous Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase of C6-2B glioma cells in cholesterol-enriched caveolae is essential for its regulation by CCE (Fagan, K. A., Smith, K. E., and Cooper, D. M. F. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 26530–26537). In the present study, we established that depletion of cellular cholesterol ablated the regulation by CCE of a Ca2+-stimulable adenylyl cyclase, AC8, heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. We considered the possibility that a calmodulin-binding domain in the N terminus of AC8, which is not required for in vitro regulation by Ca2+, might play a targeting role. Deletion and mutation of the N terminus did attenuate the enzyme's sensitivity to CCE without altering its in vitro responsiveness to Ca2+/calmodulin. Both N terminus-deleted AC8 and wild type AC8 were expressed at the plasma membrane, as shown by imaging analysis of green fluorescence protein-tagged constructs. However, not only wild type AC8 but also the CCE-insensitive mutants occurred in caveolar fractions of the plasma membranes, even though a Ca2+-insensitive adenylyl cyclase, AC7, was excluded from caveolae. Finally, the AC8 mutants were no more responsive to nonphysiological elevation of Ca2+ than the wild type. We conclude that (i) not all adenylyl cyclases reside in caveolae, (ii) the calmodulin-binding domain in the N terminus of AC8 does not play a role in caveolar targeting, (iii) the N terminus does play a role in associating AC8 with factors that confer sensitivity to CCE, and (iv) residence of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases in caveolae is essential but not sufficient for regulation by CCE.

The two major second messenger signaling systems, cyclic AMP and Ca2+, are tightly integrated at a number of levels. The earliest opportunity at which Ca2+ can influence the cAMP pathway is of course at the level of synthesis, via direct effects on adenylyl cyclases (ACs). 1ACadenylyl cyclaseCCEcapacitative Ca2+ entryTGthapsigarginMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinGFPgreen fluorescence protein2-APB2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borateMBSC25 mm4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm Na2CO3, and 2 mmEDTA, pH 8TTBSTris-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20 1ACadenylyl cyclaseCCEcapacitative Ca2+ entryTGthapsigarginMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinGFPgreen fluorescence protein2-APB2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borateMBSC25 mm4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm Na2CO3, and 2 mmEDTA, pH 8TTBSTris-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20 Of the currently known mammalian adenylyl cyclases, four are either stimulated or inhibited by physiological increases in [Ca2+] i (1Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In nonexcitable cells, this regulation by [Ca2+] i is orchestrated by a strict dependence on the entry of Ca2+ that is triggered by the emptying of internal Ca2+ stores, the so-called capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) (2Putney J.W., Jr. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Other means of elevating [Ca2+] i , such as release from stores or ionophore-mediated entry, are ineffective (3Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

The dependence of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases on regulation by CCE led to the suggestion that adenylyl cyclases and Ca2+ entry channels were functionally colocalized (5Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Caveolae are plausible platforms for such “functional domains.” These cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich regions of the plasma membrane are marked by the protein caveolin. Their unique lipid composition renders them insoluble in nonionic detergents at low temperature (6Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar), a property that has been exploited in their isolation. These and other cholesterol-rich, detergent-insoluble regions of the plasma membrane, collectively referred to as lipid rafts, have been postulated to be a coordination point for a variety of signaling molecules (6Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 7Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Smith K.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26530-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This localization is required to ensure the regulation of AC6 by CCE because disruption of the caveolae by cholesterol depletion ablates the Ca2+ inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity; restoration of the cell cholesterol restores the regulation by CCE (8Fagan K.A. Smith K.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26530-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclases from other sources, including AC6, when heterologously expressed in cardiac myocytes, also occur in caveolae (9Rybin V.O., Xu, X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the present study, we wished to determine whether the Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, AC8, which we had previously shown to be dependent on CCE for its regulation by Ca2+ (4Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), would also be targeted to caveolae when heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. To assess whether there was an obligate association between residence in caveolae and susceptibility to regulation by CCE, we evaluated a number of mutations of AC8 with decreased sensitivity to CCE and asked whether the mutant forms were also targeted to caveolae. A calmodulin-binding domain plays a role in targeting nitric oxide synthase to caveolae (17Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We had previously identified two calmodulin-binding sites in AC8, one at the C terminus that was critical in mediating the in vitroresponsiveness to Ca2+ and one at the N terminus that appeared to be of no obvious regulatory significance (18Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently, we evaluated the possibility that the noncatalytically significant calmodulin-binding domain in the N terminus of AC8 might play a targeting role. We explored two mutations in the N terminus domain of AC8 that displayed refractory responses to CCE, although inin vitro assays, the mutants displayed equivalent stimulation by Ca2+ as wild type AC8. Imaging revealed that a GFP-tagged, N terminus-deleted AC8 was expressed at the plasma membrane, similar to wild type AC8. However, to our surprise, fractionation of the plasma membrane into caveolar and noncaveolar regions revealed that not only the wild type AC8 but also CCE-insensitive AC8 mutants were located in caveolae. A heterologously expressed, Ca2+-insensitive adenylyl cyclase, AC7, was not targeted to caveolae. Furthermore, mutant forms of AC8 were no more susceptible to high, nonspecific elevations in [Ca2+] i than wild type AC8. These results show that (i) not all adenylyl cyclases are targeted to caveolae, (ii) the targeting mechanism for recruiting AC8 to caveolar domains does not involve the calmodulin-binding domain in the N terminus, and (iii) most importantly, localization in caveolae is not sufficient for the regulation of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases by CCE, although it is necessary. Thapsigargin, forskolin, ionomycin, and SKF96365 were from Calbiochem. Fura-2/AM and pluronic F-127 were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). [2-3H]Adenine, [α-32P]ATP, and [3H]cAMP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. All other reagents were from Sigma. HEK293 cells were maintained in 13 ml of minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gemini) in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were plated on 100-mm dishes at ∼70% confluence 1 day before transfection with 2 μg of cDNA using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used 2 days after transfection. HEK293 cells (10 × 106 cells/ml) were loaded with fura-2/AM (2 μm) plus 0.02% pluronic acid in serum-free F-10 medium containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature, as described previously (4Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and used for [Ca2+] i measurements in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorometer, as described previously (19Fagan K.A. Schaack J. Zweifach A. Cooper D.M.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with EGTA (0.1 mm) followed by the addition of thapsigargin (TG; 100 nm) or ionomycin (100 mm) and [Ca2+] o , as indicated. Calcium entry channel inhibitors, SKF96365 (50 μm) or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB; 100 μm; Ref. 20Kukkonen J.P. Lund P.E. Akerman K.E. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), were also added as indicated. The 340/380 nm emission ratios were converted to [Ca2+] using the standard formula (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The deletion mutant 8M1, which results in the deletion of the first 106 amino acids of AC8, was constructed by cutting pcDNA3/AC8 plasmid with BspI, blunting the end with T4 DNA polymerase, cutting it again with NotI, and subcloning the fragment into the EcoRI (blunted with T4 DNA polymerase) and NotI sites of pcDNA3/Hisb (Invitrogen) in frame. 8M34 was constructed using QuikChange mutagenesis, in which WQT (amino acids 38–40) and RFI (amino acids 49–51) were switched to AAA. Both WQT (amino acids 38–40) and RFI (amino acids 49–51) are located in the N-terminal putative calmodulin-binding domain. Therefore, calmodulin would not be expected to bind to the N terminus of 8M34. The mutated cDNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing. cAMP accumulation was measured in intact cells expressing different AC8 constructs as described previously (18Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, cells were preincubated for 10 min with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin at a final concentration of 100 nm. cAMP accumulation was measured over a 1-min period beginning with the addition of forskolin along with other reagents as indicated. Assays were terminated by the addition of 5% (w/v final concentration) trichloroacetic acid. Markers were added to monitor recovery of cAMP and ATP. The [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP content of the supernatant was quantified as described previously (22Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Accumulation of cAMP is expressed as the conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP. Results are presented as the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Cellular cholesterol was depleted as described previously (8Fagan K.A. Smith K.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26530-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, attached HEK293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation in serum-free F-10 media plus 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD; 15 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. After cholesterol depletion, cells were washed, and either cAMP accumulation or [Ca2+] i measurements were carried out, as described above. Determination of adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro was performed as described previously (23Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on isolated transfected HEK293 cell membranes (24Guillou J.-L. Nakata H. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35539-35545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The adenylyl cyclase activity of the HEK293 cell membranes was measured in the presence of the following components: 12 mmphosphocreatine, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mm cAMP, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 70 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 0.04 mm GTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, 1 μm calmodulin, and 20 μm forskolin, as indicated. Free Ca2+ concentrations were established from a series of CaCl2 solutions buffered with 200 μm EGTA in the assay (23Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the computer program BAD4 (25Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6980-6986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated with sodium lauryl sulfate (0.5%); [3H]cAMP was added as a recovery marker, and the [32P]cAMP formed was quantitated as described previously (22Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Isolation of noncaveolar membranes and low density caveolar membranes was performed by a modification of an earlier protocol (26Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers M.G., Jr. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Three confluent flasks of transfected HEK293 cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of cold sodium carbonate solution (500 mmNa2CO3; 150 mm NaCl; 2 mm EDTA, pH 11) and sonicated with a single 3-s burst on a Fisher model 60 sonicator at 50% power. The suspension was transferred to a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer and homogenized with 12 strokes. The sucrose concentration was adjusted to 40% by the addition of 2 ml of 60% sucrose in 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline containing sodium carbonate (MBSC). The extract was placed below a 5–30% discontinuous sucrose gradient prepared in cold MBSC and centrifuged in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, two distinct light scattering bands were visible at ∼20% sucrose and 35–40% sucrose. Each of these bands was removed, dispersed in 11 ml of cold MBSC, and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 6 h at 4 °C to pellet the membranes. The pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of 1% SDS, sonicated for 3 s at 50% power, and frozen until use. The protein concentration of each pellet was determined by the BCA assay kit (Pierce). AC8-specific antibody was kindly provided by Drs. J. J. Cali and J. Krupinski. The polyclonal caveolin antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and the T7 tag monoclonal antibody was from Novagen. Proteins were resolved with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity was determined after blocking the membranes in TTBS plus 5% milk for 1 h, followed by incubation for 2 h in primary antibody diluted 1:15,000 in TTBS plus 1% milk. After several washes in TTBS, signal detection was achieved using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and film detection. Caveolin immunoreactivity was determined after the membranes were blocked in TTBS plus 3% milk overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with primary antibody diluted 1:2500 in 1% milk for 3 h. Signal detection was achieved as described above. The T7-tagged AC7 immunoreactivity was determined after a 30-min block in 3% bovine serum albumin followed by a 1-h incubation in primary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in 1% bovine serum albumin. After several washes in TTBS, signal detection was achieved using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody from Promega with enhanced chemiluminescence and film detection. The inhibition of the endogenously expressed AC6 in C6-2B cells by CCE is dependent on the residence of AC6 in cholesterol-rich, caveolin-containing domains of the plasma membrane (8Fagan K.A. Smith K.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26530-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, as a prelude to probing the molecular determinants for residence in caveolae and susceptibility to regulation by CCE, we wished to determine whether the heterologously expressed, Ca2+-stimulable AC8 displayed a similar requirement of caveolar residence for Ca2+ regulation by CCE. As a first step, we asked whether disruption of caveolae by depleting cellular cholesterol attenuated the ability of CCE to stimulate AC8. Initially, it was important to determine the effects, if any, of cholesterol depletion on CCE in HEK293 cells. Cellular cholesterol was depleted or not depleted with MβCD as previously applied to C6-2B cells (8Fagan K.A. Smith K.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26530-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and CCE was examined (Fig. 1 A). The cells were pretreated with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor TG to passively deplete the internal Ca2+ stores. This process primes the cells for CCE (27Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Both the untreated and MβCD-treated cells yielded very similar [Ca2+] i rises (∼580 nm at 360 s; subsequent cAMP accumulation assays are measured over a 1-min period corresponding to the 300–360-s interval). Therefore, CCE triggered by TG depletion of Ca2+ stores does not appear to be affected by cholesterol depletion, as we had previously found in C6-2B cells (8Fagan K.A. Smith K.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26530-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Next, the ability of CCE to stimulate AC8 in untreated and MβCD-treated cells was compared (Fig. 1 B). CCE yielded a robust stimulation of AC8 in the absence of MβCD treatment, ranging from an approximate 3-fold stimulation with the addition of 1 mm [Ca2+] o to an approximate 5.5-fold stimulation with the addition of 4 mm[Ca2+] o . This result contrasts with the ability of CCE to stimulate AC8 after cholesterol depletion, which yielded an approximate 1.2-fold stimulation with the addition of 1 mm[Ca2+] o and a maximal stimulation of ∼2-fold upon the addition of 4 mm [Ca2+] o . Thus, the heterologously expressed, Ca2+-stimulable AC8 behaves like the endogenously expressed, Ca2+-inhibitable AC6 in its inability to be fully regulated by CCE after cholesterol depletion. These data indicate not only that residence of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases in cholesterol-rich domains is required for their regulation by CCE but also that intrinsic to their structure are the molecular determinants for this localization. Consequently, mutants of AC8 could be analyzed to explore the region(s) of the molecule that contributes to this localization. The Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, AC8, contains a calmodulin-binding domain in the N terminus of the protein, which is not required for the regulation of the enzyme by Ca2+ in vitro (18Gu C.

Because a calmodulin-binding domain appeared to play a role in targeting nitric oxide synthase to caveolae (17Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), we evaluated the possibility that the equivalent domain in the N terminus of AC8 might play a similar role. Constructs were generated containing point mutations in the AC8 N terminus calmodulin-binding domain (8M34) or a deletion of the first 106 amino acids of the AC8 N terminus (8M1), which includes the helical calmodulin-binding domain between amino acids 34 and 51 (Fig. 2; Ref. 18Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These mutants were heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and compared with wild type AC8 in terms of their sensitivity to Ca2+ in vitro (Fig. 3 A). This assay illustrated that both mutants could be stimulated in the same concentration range as the wild type enzyme, with very similar overall activity. The sensitivity of these AC8 constructs to regulation by CCE was next compared in intact HEK293 cells. The results demonstrated that whereas the two mutants retained some ability to be stimulated by CCE, this stimulation was greatly reduced compared with that seen with the wild type AC8 (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Activity and expression of the wild type and mutant AC8 constructs. A, in vitro adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in membranes isolated from HEK293 cells expressing either the wild type AC8 (●), 8M1 (▪), or 8M34 (▴) in the presence of forskolin (20 μm), calmodulin (1 μm), and the indicated free Ca2+concentrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as the adenylyl cyclase activity relative to 0 [Ca2+] for each construct and are representative of four experiments with similar results. The K a for activation by Ca2+ of the three constructs was 0.5 ± 0.22, 0.67 ± 0.34, and 0.72 ± 0.39 μm, respectively (n = 4). B, in vivocAMP accumulation was measured in whole cells transfected with either AC8 (●), 8M1 (○), or 8M34 (▾) in response to increasing CCE, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were pretreated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 μm), EGTA (0.1 mm), and TG (100 nm) 10 min before a 1-min assay starting with the addition of forskolin (10 μm) and [Ca2+] o (0.1–10 mm, as indicated). Data are expressed as the fold stimulation compared with the Ca2+-free (forskolin alone) condition (percentage of conversion of [3H]ATP to [3H]cAMP in the presence of forskolin alone was 0.47 ± 0.02 (AC8), 0.36 ± 0.02 (8M1), and 0.52 ± 0.05 (8M34)). C, Western blot of AC8, 8M1, and 8M34 transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (the same batch of transfected cells was used in the experiments shown inA−C). Data are representative of four separate experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the possibility that altered expression might account for the reduction in the mutants' sensitivity to CCE, Western blotting was performed on membranes prepared from the same batches of transfected cells used in the in vitro and in vivo assays. Both the 8M1 and 8M34 mutants and the wild type are expressed in equivalent amounts (Fig. 3 C). Another possible explanation for the decrease in sensitivity of the mutants to stimulation by CCE is that a significant portion of the mutant proteins is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum due to deletion of the N terminus. To evaluate this possibility, imaging was performed to compare GFP-tagged wild type and the N terminus-deleted 8M1 construct. Both constructs were expressed equivalently at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). Previous work had shown that the Ca2+-inhibitable cyclase, AC6, must be localized in caveolar regions of the plasma membrane to maintain its sensitivity to CCE (8Fagan K.A. Smith K.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26530-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because AC8 is Ca2+-sensitive and shows a similar perturbation of CCE-mediated regulation upon cholesterol depletion (see Fig. 1), we wished to determine whether it was also targeted to caveolae. Upon separating plasma membranes into caveolar and noncaveolar fractions, we found that the vast majority of the AC8 immunoreactivity was localized to caveolar membranes (Fig.5 A, top panel), as indicated by comigration with caveolin immunoreactivity (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel). We next examined the localization of the two mutants within the plasma membrane. Quite unexpectedly, the immunoreactivity of both 8M1 and 8M34 was also largely confined to caveolar membranes (Fig.5 A). Because these adenylyl cyclase constructs were so poorly regulated by CCE, we wondered whether all adenylyl cyclase species were targeted to caveolar regions of the plasma membrane, regardless of their susceptibility to CCE. We examined the membrane localization of AC7, an adenylyl cyclase that is not regulated by changes in [Ca2+] i . HEK293 cells were transfected with AC7 cDNA, and membranes were fractionated as described above. AC7 immunoreactivity was clearly excluded from caveolae (Fig.5 B). Thus, it is not a general property of adenylyl cyclases to occur in caveolae. This result also implies that the targeting mechanism of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases to caveolae must lie in a region other than the first 106 amino acids of the N terminus. Wild type AC8 is highly dependent on CCE rather than release from internal stores or ionophore-mediated Ca2+ entry (4Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the mutations that rendered AC8 unresponsive to CCE might have made the enzyme responsive to more substantial, albeit non-CCE-mediated, rises in [Ca2+] i . The Ca2+ entry through CCE channels in HEK293 cells is modest, as demonstrated previously. This entry is blocked by treatment with the CCE inhibitors 2-APB (20"
https://openalex.org/W2109822459,"Relaxin (RLX) is a reproductive hormone with vasodilatatory properties on several organs, including the heart. RLX-induced vasodilatation appears to depend on the stimulation of endogenous NO production. Here, we investigate whether RLX acts on rat coronary endothelial (RCE) cells in vitro by inducing changes of NO generation and, if so, to clarify the possible mechanism of action. RCE cells were treated for 24 h with vehicle (controls) or RLX, alone or in association with inhibitors of NO synthesis or dexamethasone, which inhibits transcription of NO synthase gene. In some experiments, inactivated RLX was given in the place of authentic RLX. Expression of NO synthase isozymes II and III was analyzed by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and RT-PCR. NO production was evaluated by the Griess reaction for nitrite and the NO-sensitive fluorophore DAF-2/DA. Agonist-induced changes of intracellular Ca2+ transient were studied with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorophore Fura 2-AM. RLX was found to up regulate NOS II mRNA and protein and to stimulate intrinsic NO generation, likely through the activation of a dexamethasone-sensitive transcription factor, and to decrease agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ transient. Conversely, RLX had negligible effects on NOS III expression. By these biological effects, RLX may afford significant protection against cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2112625658,"Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue is the result of translocation of insulin-regulated glucose transporters (GLUT4) from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. Here we report that GLUT4 in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were located predominantly in caveolae invaginations: by immunogold electron microscopy of plasma membranes, 88% of GLUT4 were localized to caveolae structures and this distribution within the plasma membrane was not affected by insulin. By immunofluorescence microscopy, a major part of GLUT 4 was colocalized with caveolin. The total amount of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane increased 2.2-fold in response to insulin as determined by immunogold electron or immunofluorescence microscopy. GLUT4 were enriched in caveolae fractions isolated without detergents from plasma membranes of rat adipocytes. In these fractions, GLUT4 were largely confined to caveolin-containing membranes of the caveolae preparation isolated from insulin-stimulated cells, determined by electron microscopy. Insulin increased the amount of GLUT4 2.7-fold in this caveolae fraction. Caveolae were purified further by immunoisolation with antibodies against caveolin. The amount of GLUT4 increased to the same extent in the immunopurified caveolae as in the cruder caveolae fractions from insulin-stimulated cells. We conclude that insulin induces translocation of GLUT4 to caveolae."
https://openalex.org/W1980869115,"The Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 play a major role in regulating the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We recently identified CdGAP, a novel GTPase-activating protein with activity toward Rac1 and Cdc42. CdGAP consists of a N-terminal GAP domain, a central domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. Here we show that through a subset of its Src homology 3 domains, the endocytic protein intersectin interacts with CdGAP. In platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells, intersectin co-localizes with CdGAP and inhibits its GAP activity toward Rac1.

Our data suggest that the central domain of CdGAP is required for CdGAP-intersectin interaction. Thus, we propose a model in which intersectin binding results in a change of CdGAP conformation involving the proline-rich domain that leads to the inhibition of its GAP activity.

The Rho family of GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 regulates multiple cellular processes including proliferation, motility, adhesion, and intracellular membrane trafficking (1Bishop A.L.

However, the best characterized function for these proteins is the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). For example, treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with lysophosphatidic acid or bombesin induces RhoA activation leading to the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, whereas growth factors activate Rac1 promoting the formation of an actin meshwork at the cell periphery producing lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (4Ridley A.J.

Rho GTPases act as molecular switches that cycle between inactive, GDP-bound and active, GTP-bound states. This GDP/GTP cycle is regulated by at least three families of proteins including guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 1GAPGTPase-activating proteinSH3Src homology 3 domainPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorCdGAPCdc42 GTPase-activating proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffer salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanateEVempty vector 1GAPGTPase-activating proteinSH3Src homology 3 domainPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorCdGAPCdc42 GTPase-activating proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffer salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanateEVempty vector (9Van Aelst L.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors activate Rho GTPases by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP in response to extracellular stimuli, whereas guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors appear to stabilize the inactive, GDP-bound form of the protein.

Most proteins of the RhoGAP family contain additional protein- or lipid-binding motifs that likely serve to regulate their GAP activity and/or subcellular localization (11Ahmed S. Lee J. Kozma R.

In addition to its N-terminal GAP domain, CdGAP contains a central domain and five consensus Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding sites located within a large C-terminal proline-rich domain whose functions are still unknown (10Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of CdGAP, we sought to identify binding partners of its C-terminal proline-rich domain. This led to the identification of the endocytic scaffolding protein intersectin as a CdGAP-binding partner. Intersectin is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and cell signaling (14Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F.

It contains two N-terminal Eps15 homology domains, a central helical region, and five C-terminal SH3 domains (termed SH3A-E) (17Guipponi M. Scott H.S. Chen H. Schebesta A. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E.

CdGAP co-localizes with intersectin in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated fibroblasts. Moreover, intersectin inhibits CdGAP activity in PDGF-stimulated cells and in GAP assays in vitro. Surprisingly, intersectin is still able to interact with a CdGAP mutant lacking the C-terminal proline-rich domain. We found that the central domain of CdGAP is required to mediate CdGAP-intersectin interaction. However, the ability of intersectin to inhibit CdGAP activity requires the C-terminal proline-rich domain. Our data demonstrate that intersectin directly inhibits CdGAP activity, probably through a change of CdGAP conformation involving the C-terminal proline-rich domain. cDNAs encoding for mouse CdGAP N terminus (residues 3 to 662) and C terminus (residues 600–820) were subcloned into pRK5Myc and pCR2.1 expression vectors, respectively, as previously described (10Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CdGAP C terminus encoding cDNA was excised from pCR2.1 using NheI/XbaI and subcloned into NheI/XbaI-digested pRK5MycCdGAP-(3–662) resulting in pRK5MycCdGAP-ΔK2. Lysine residue missing at position 2 of the protein was added by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 5′-CGGGATCCAAGAACAAGGGTGCCAAG and 5′-GAAGATCTGGGCATTGATC as forward and reverse primers and pRK5MycCdGAP-ΔK2 vector as template. pRK5MycCdGAP was obtained by ligating pRK5MycCdGAP-ΔK2, digested withBamHI/BglII, and dephosphorylated using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase withBamHI/BglII-digested PCR product. CdGAP-ΔPRD and CdGAP-GAP mutants were generated by PCR using pRK5MycCdGAP as a template, 5′-CTGGCCCTGGTGTGGGCCCC as forward primer, 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTCAGAAAGAAAACTCTTC and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTCACCTGAGGAGGTTTGG as reverse primers, respectively.

Both PCR products and pGEX4T3 vector were digested withBamHI/EcoRI and ligated together.

The PCR product was subcloned intoNotI/BamHI sites of pBSint. The resulting FLAG-tagged intersectin was excised withNotI/SalI, made blunt at their 5′ end using T4 DNA polymerase, and subcloned into the SmaI/SalI sites of pRK5. All DNA fragments generated by PCR were sequenced. Glutathione S- transferase (GST) fusion proteins encoding the individual SH3 domains of intersectin, amphiphisin I and II were described previously (18Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L.

GST fusion proteins encoding the individual SH3 domains of Nck and Src were kindly provided by Dr. Louise Larose (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). COS-7 and Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics, and maintained at an atmosphere of 10% CO2. Anti-CdGAP antibodies were obtained by immunization of rabbits with CdGAP proline-rich domain (amino acids 515 to 820) fused to the GST. Anti-CdGAP antibodies were used at 1/500 dilution in immunofluorescence. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Nicole Beauchemin (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) and used at 1/200 in immunofluorescence and 1/1000 in immunoblotting. Mouse (Upstate Biotechnology) and rabbit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) anti-FLAG antibodies were used, respectively, at 1/300 and 1/200 in immunofluorescence. Recombinant Rac1, CdGAP-ΔGAP, CdGAP-PRD, and the SH3 domains of intersectin, Nck, Src, amphiphysin I and amphiphysin II were produced in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (23Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The recombinant Rac1 was released from the beads by cleavage with human thrombin (Calbiochem). Thrombin was removed by adding 10 μl ofp-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 15 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation using the Centricon YM-10 (Amicon). GST and GST-SH3 domains were eluted from the beads with 5 mmreduced glutathione (Sigma). To biotinylate recombinant proteins, GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed with PBS and incubated 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Beads were washed extensively with PBS and proteins were eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). Biotinylated proteins were immobilized on streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Corp.) and glutathione washed out with PBS. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and the purity of protein preparations was visualized on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). COS-7 cells were transfected by DEAE-dextran method as described previously (24Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). 5 μg of pRK5MycCdGAP, -CdGAP-ΔPRD, -CdGAP-GAP, -CdGAPΔGAP, or -CdGAP-PRD were used per 100-mm dish. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES-OH (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 1000 × g max. 1 mg of the resulting postnuclear supernatant was incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C with 30 μg of GST fusion proteins and glutathione-Sepharose beads. For competition assays, 1 mg of resulting postnuclear supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of biotinylated GST or GST-SH3D proteins in the presence or absence of 3 or 14 μm GST fusion proteins and immobilized on streptavidin-Sepharose beads. For direct binding, 5 μg of GST-CdGAPΔGAP or -CdGAP-PRD were incubated with 5 μg of biotinylated GST fusion proteins coupled to streptavidin-Sepharose beads. Samples were washed 3 times in 20 mm HEPES-OH (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, submitted to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis using anti-Myc or anti-CdGAP antibodies. Subconfluent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared as described previously (10Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pRK5MycCdGAP or -CdGAP-ΔPRD were microinjected at 0.04 mg/ml into the nucleus of 100 cells together with 0.16 mg/ml pRK5 or pRK5Flagintersectin. During the microinjection, cells were maintained at 37 °C with an atmosphere of 5–9% CO2. After microinjection, cells returned to the incubator for a further 2 h before treatment with extracellular factors. Two hours after microinjection, Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with 3 ng/ml PDGF (Calbiochem) for 10 min at 37 °C and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. All following steps were carried out at room temperature, and coverslips were rinsed in PBS between each step. Cells were permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100, and free aldehyde groups were reduced with 0.5 mg/ml NaBH4 for 10 min. Except for actin staining, cells were incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer (10 mm phosphate, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100) containing 10% normal goat serum. Cells were incubated for 45 min in 5% normal goat serum blocking buffer containing the primary antibodies, followed by incubation with a second fluorescein isothiocyanate or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma). For actin staining, the incubations have been done in PBS. Actin was stained using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted by inverting them onto mowiol 4-88 mountant (Calbiochem) containing p-phenylenediamine (Sigma) as an antibleach agent. After 16 h at room temperature, cells were examined on a Zeiss 63 × 1.4 oil immersion objective. Fluorescence images were recorded using a digital camera (DVC) and analyzed with Northern Eclipse software (Empix imaging). COS-7 cells were transfected with pRK5MycCdGAP together with either pRK5 or pRK5Flagintersectin by the DEAE-dextran method as described above. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 1000 ×g max. 1 mg of postnuclear supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-FLAG antibodies followed by a 2-h incubation with 10 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Corp.). Samples were washed 3 times in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies. COS-7 cells were transfected with pRK5, pRK5MycCdGAP, pRK5MycCdGAP-PRD, or pRK5MycCdGAP-ΔPRD by DEAE-dextran method as described above. 48 h post-transfection, Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above using anti-Myc antibodies. Samples were washed 3 times in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, twice in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and used for the in vitroGAP assay as following. The amount of immunoprecipitated CdGAP is estimated on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE by comparison with different amount of purified bovine serum albumin. According to this estimation, immune complexes corresponding to 500 ng of immunoprecipitated CdGAP were resuspended in 24 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm GTP, 0.86 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. At the same time, 2 μg of recombinant Rac1 was incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol) in 20 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA for 10 min at 30 °C. GTP-loaded Rac1 was kept on ice after addition of 20 mmMgCl2. 3 μl of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rac1 was incubated at 20 °C with the immune complexes. After 0, 3, 6, and 9 min incubation, 4-μl mixtures were diluted in 1 ml of cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), and filtered through pre-wetted nitrocellulose filters. Filters were washed with 10 ml of cold buffer A, dried, and counted. CdGAP consists of a N-terminal GAP domain, a central domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain containing five consensus SH3-binding motifs (PRD1–5) (Fig. 2 A). To identify SH3 domain-containing protein(s) that bind to CdGAP, lysates of COS-7 cells expressing Myc-tagged CdGAP were incubated with SH3 domains from a variety of proteins including intersectin (SH3A-E), amphiphysin I, amphiphysin II, Nck (SH3–1-3), and Src, each expressed as GST fusion proteins and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Myc-tagged CdGAP binding to the fusion proteins was detected by Western blot using anti-Myc antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 A, GST-SH3A, -B, and -D of intersectin interact with CdGAP whereas the eight other SH3 domains do not. Moreover, Myc-tagged CdGAP co-immunoprecipitates with FLAG-tagged intersectin from lysates of COS-7 cells overexpressing both proteins (Fig. 1 B). Control anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells expressing only Myc-tagged CdGAP shows no CdGAP precipitation (Fig.1 B). Therefore, intersectin interacts specifically bothin vitro and in cells with CdGAP through its SH3A, -B, and -D domains.Figure 1Intersectin interacts with CdGAP through its SH3A, -B, and -D domains. A, protein lysates from COS-7 cells expressing Myc-tagged CdGAP were incubated with either 30 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of intersectin (SH3A, -B, -C, -D, and -E), amphiphysin I (SH3 Amp. I), amphiphysin II (SH3 Amp. II), Nck (SH3–1, -2, and -3), or Src (SH3 Src) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. 10 μg of starting material (SM) and SH3-associated proteins were submitted to SDS-PAGE and CdGAP was detected by immunoblotting analysis using anti-Myc antibodies (IBαMyc). Ponceau S staining (PS) shows the level of GST fusion protein in each sample.B, lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with Myc-tagged CdGAP encoding vector together with either an EV or a vector expressing FLAG-tagged intersectin (Flag-int) were submitted to immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibodies (IPαFlag). Starting material (SM) and immunoprecipitated proteins (IP) were submitted to SDS-PAGE and CdGAP and intersectin were detected by immunoblotting using anti-Myc (IBαMyc) and anti-Flag (IBαFlag) antibodies, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the interaction of CdGAP with the SH3 domains of intersectin, we generated truncated CdGAP mutants lacking either the GAP domain (CdGAP-ΔGAP) or the proline-rich domain (CdGAP-ΔPRD). CdGAP-GAP corresponds to the N-terminal GAP domain whereas CdGAP-PRD consists of the proline-rich domain only (Fig.2 A). Lysates of cells expressing Myc-tagged forms of these mutant proteins were incubated with GST or GST-SH3A, -B, or -D of intersectin. Despite robust expression, both CdGAP-PRD and CdGAP-GAP mutants did not bind to GST-SH3A, -B, or -D of intersectin (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, CdGAP-ΔPRD and CdGAP-ΔGAP bound to the three SH3 domains but not to GST alone, suggesting that the central domain of CdGAP is important to mediate the interaction between CdGAP and intersectin-SH3 domainsin vitro. We conclude that the CdGAP proline-rich and the N-terminal GAP domains are neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate the interaction between CdGAP and intersectin-SH3 domains in vitro. To determine whether intersectin-SH3 domains interact directly with CdGAP, CdGAP-ΔGAP and CdGAP-PRD were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Purified proteins were incubated with biotinylated GST, GST-SH3A, -B, or -D and immobilized on streptavidin-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig.3, CdGAP-ΔGAP but not CdGAP-PRD binds strongly to the SH3D and to a lesser extent to the SH3A of intersectin. No significant interaction has been observed with GST or the SH3B of intersectin. These results indicate that both SH3A and -D of intersectin interact directly with CdGAP. These data also confirm that the central domain of CdGAP is required to mediate the direct interaction between CdGAP and intersectin. Surprisingly, no consensus SH3-binding motifs are present in the central domain. Recent studies have identified non-PXXP SH3-binding domains (25Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), however, CdGAP does not contain any of these motifs. We conclude that intersectin interacts with the central domain of CdGAP using a novel SH3-binding domain that remains to be identified. Microinjection of CdGAP into serum-starved fibroblasts inhibits the Rac1-dependent formation of lamellipodia induced by PDGF (10Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether intersectin regulates CdGAP activity toward Rac1 in vivo, we microinjected serum-starved, subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells with vectors encoding intersectin, CdGAP, or both vectors. As expected, PDGF-induced membrane ruffling is abolished in ∼70% of CdGAP expressing cells (Fig.4, A, B, and H). However, in ∼80% of cells co-expressing CdGAP and intersectin, lamellipodia was formed (Fig. 4, C-H). Moreover, CdGAP and intersectin co-localize at lamellipodia (Fig. 4, E-G). Expression of intersectin alone had no effect on the actin cytoskeleton in either conditions of serum starvation or PDGF stimulation (Fig.4 H, data not shown). Thus, intersectin inhibits in vivo the GAP activity of CdGAP toward Rac1 in PDGF-stimulated cells. To further investigate the mechanism by which intersectin inhibits CdGAP activity, we used a modified in vitro GAP assay. [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rac1 was incubated with Myc-tagged CdGAP immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cell lysates in the presence or absence of GST or GST-SH3 domains of intersectin. The GTPase stimulating activity was estimated by measuring the ratio of Rac1-bound radioactivity in the absence versus the presence of CdGAP using a nitrocellulose filter assay (Fig.5 A). Consistent with the previously reported GTPase stimulating activity of CdGAP toward Rac1 (10Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), only 10% GTP remains bound to Rac1 after a 3-min incubation with immunoprecipitated CdGAP compared with 60% of GTP bound to Rac1 incubated with the immune complex from lysates of cells transfected with empty vector (EV). Interestingly, in the presence of GST-SH3D of intersectin, the amount of GTP remaining bound to Rac1 was increased from 10 to 45% whereas no significant effect was observed in the presence of GST or GST-SH3A or -B of intersectin. Moreover, when [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rac1 was incubated with immunoprecipitated CdGAP in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST fusion proteins, the inhibition of CdGAP activity was saturable and reached a plateau at 10 μm GST-SH3D (Fig.5 B). However, increasing concentrations of either GST or GST-SH3A, -B of intersectin did not affect significantly the GTPase stimulating activity of CdGAP. When [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rac1 was incubated with immunoprecipitated CdGAP-PRD lacking the GAP domain, the remaining amount of GTP bound to Rac1 was comparable to the control (EV) and was not influenced by the presence of either GST or GST-SH3D (Fig.5 C). These data indicate that the proline-rich domain of CdGAP does not co-immunoprecipitate an exogenous GAP activity toward Rac1 and that intersectin-SH3D does not inhibit the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rac1. Together, these results demonstrate that the SH3D but not SH3A or SH3B of intersectin is sufficient to inhibit specifically and directly CdGAP activity toward Rac1 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. To better understand the in vitro inhibition of CdGAP activity by the SH3D domain only, we used competition assays to assess the possibility that intersectin-SH3 domains may interact with different sites on CdGAP. GST and GST-SH3D were biotinylated, immobilized on streptavidin-Sepharose beads, and incubated with lysates of COS-7 cells expressing Myc-tagged CdGAP in the presence or absence of GST-SH3A, -SH3B, -SH3D, or -SH3 (Src). Competition assays with GST-SH3D or -SH3 (Src) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The inhibition of the binding of CdGAP with biotinylated-GST-SH3D is expressed as a percentage of the positive control. As shown in Fig. 6, no significant inhibition of the interaction CdGAP/SH3D was observed in the presence of the SH3B domain of intersectin or the SH3 domain of Src. These data suggest that the SH3B domain is not able to compete the CdGAP-SH3D interaction and correlate well with our results suggesting that the SH3B domain binds indirectly to CdGAP. On the other hand, the SH3A domain of intersectin is able to compete efficiently the interaction CdGAP/SH3D although at a lower extent than the SH3D domain. Since the SH3A domain was not able to inhibit the in vitroCdGAP activity, these results suggest that SH3A binds with a lower affinity to the same site within CdGAP as SH3D. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that SH3A and SH3D bind to a different site within CdGAP and that the interaction of SH3A with CdGAP may interfere with the CdGAP-SH3D interaction. To characterize the regulation of CdGAP activity by intersectin, vectors encoding for CdGAP-ΔPRD, intersectin, or both vectors were microinjected into serum-starved, subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells before stimulation with PDGF. As expected, CdGAP-ΔPRD retains full enzymatic activity and inhibits PDGF-induced lamellipodia formation in ∼70% of microinjected cells (Fig.7, A, B, and H). Interestingly, intersectin was not able to inhibit the GAP activity of CdGAP missing the proline-rich domain, since PDGF-induced lamellipodia was abolished in ∼70% of cells expressing both CdGAP-ΔPRD and intersectin (Fig. 7, C-H). Double staining for CdGAP-ΔPRD and intersectin reveals a distribution of both proteins in the perinuclear compartment as well as in small-punctuated structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, E-G). We conclude that the proline-rich domain of CdGAP is required for the down-regulation of CdGAP activity by intersectin. To further investigate the role of the proline-rich domain in the regulation of CdGAP activity by intersectin, [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rac1 was incubated with immunoprecipitated CdGAP-ΔPRD or the immune complex from lysates of cells transfected with the empty vector in the presence or absence of GST or GST-SH3D (Fig. 5 C). Consistent with the results obtained in vivo, CdGAP-ΔPRD stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rac1 in vitro and no significant variation of CdGAP-ΔPRD activity was observed in the presence of GST-SH3D. This indicates that the proline-rich domain of CdGAP is also required for intersectin-SH3D-mediated inhibition of CdGAP activityin vitro. To date, the regulation of RhoGAP proteins is poorly understood. Nevertheless, the large number of RhoGAPs identified as well as their ubiquitous expression suggests that their activities may be restricted to discrete sites within the cell and/or that these activities may be tightly regulated (27Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea is the presence of protein- or lipid-binding modules within most proteins of the RhoGAP family. In the present study, we investigated the role of the proline-rich domain of CdGAP, which has five putative SH3-binding motifs. We show that the SH3 domain-containing protein intersectin, a major component of the endocytic machinery, interacts with CdGAP and inhibits its GAP activity toward Rac1 both in vivo andin vitro. The CdGAP proline-rich domain is absolutely required for the regulation of CdGAP activity by intersectin. However, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate the interaction between CdGAP and intersectin-SH3 domains in vitro. We demonstrate that the central domain of CdGAP is required to mediate the direct interaction between CdGAP and intersectin. We propose that intersectin regulates CdGAP activity by inducing a conformational change involving the C terminus proline-rich domain of CdGAP (Fig.8). Our data demonstrate that intersectin interacts specifically with CdGAP through its SH3A, -B, and -D domains. However, only the SH3D domain was sufficient to inhibit CdGAP activity in vitro. We show that CdGAP interacts directly with SH3D and SH3A domains whereas no direct interaction with SH3B has been detected. These results may explain why, in our experimental conditions, no inhibition of CdGAP activity has been observed in the presence of the SH3B domain. Our data also suggest that SH3A may bind to the same site within CdGAP as SH3D although at a lower affinity. This may account for the inability of SH3A to inhibit CdGAP activity in vitro. However, it is also possible that SH3A and SH3D interact on different sites within CdGAP and that the interaction of SH3A with CdGAP interfere with CdGAP-SH3D interaction. We also show that the proline-rich domain of CdGAP is required bothin vivo and in vitro for the regulation of its GAP activity by intersectin. Even though no significant binding was observed between intersectin-SH3A, -B, and -D and CdGAP-PRD mutantin vitro, in the molecular context of the full-length CdGAP protein, the proline-rich domain of CdGAP may be able to interact with intersectin. Thus, the requirement of CdGAP proline-rich domain for the regulation of CdGAP activity by intersectin may either be a consequence of a low affinity interaction between intersectin-SH3D domain and CdGAP proline-rich domain, or of a structural implication of this domain in the conformational change of CdGAP induced by intersectin. Thus, we propose a model in which the binding of intersectin-SH3D domain induces a folding of CdGAP C-terminal proline-rich domain that inhibits its GAP activity (Fig. 8). Among all the RhoGAP proteins identified thus far, few examples of a tight regulation of their GAP activity have been described. N-chimaerin GAP activity has been shown to be directly regulated by phospholipids and phorbol ester in vitro (11Ahmed S. Lee J. Kozma R. Best A. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10709-10712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ahmed S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim H.H. Smith P. Lim L. Biochem.

In contrast, p190RhoGAP activity is thought to be indirectly regulated in vivo through its interaction with p120RasGAP since this interaction stimulates its GAP activity toward RhoA in fibroblasts but not in vitro (12McGlade J. Brunkhorst B. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Settleman J. Dedhar S. Rozakis-Adcock M. Chen L.B. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3073-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30Haskell M.D. Nickles A.L. Agati J.M., Su, L. Dukes B.D. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1699-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that p120RasGAP may regulate p190RhoGAP by targeting it to the membrane without modulating its intrinsic GAP activity. PSGAP, a novel pleckstrin homology and SH3 domain containing RhoGAP protein was shown to be regulated in vivo through its interaction with the proline-rich tyrosine-kinase 2. However, since this regulation has not been assessed in vitro (13Ren X.R., Du, Q.S. Huang Y.Z., Ao, S.Z. Mei L. Xiong W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it is still unknown whether proline-rich tyrosine-kinase 2 directly regulates PSGAP activity or not. In the present study, we demonstrate that intersectin inhibits CdGAP activity both in vivo and in vitro, thus indicating that intersectin interaction modulates CdGAP intrinsic activity. Hence, our data provide the first demonstration of a direct regulation of RhoGAP activity mediated through a protein-protein interaction. The endocytic scaffolding protein intersectin has been recently described as a signaling protein (14Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R.

It is a major partner of mSos1, a guanine exchange factor for Ras and Rac1, and is thought to play an important role in the epidermal growth factor activation of Ras (14Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29894-29899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of intersectin in fibroblasts has been shown to activate mitogenic signaling pathways (16Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of CdGAP by intersectin also demonstrates the important role played by intersectin as a signaling molecule and extends its signaling properties to the regulation of Rho GTPases and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Consistent with this latter role, the brain-specific alternative spliced variant of intersectin, named intersectin-long, contains a C-terminal extension with Dbl homology, pleckstrin homology, and C2 domains (17Guipponi M. Scott H.S. Chen H. Schebesta A. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 53: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Through its Dbl homology domain, intersectin-long functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42 in vitro (38Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Moreover, injection of the Dbl homology domain of intersectin-long in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts causes actin assembly leading to filopodia formation (38Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CdGAP has a GAP activity toward Cdc42, is highly expressed in brain (10Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and co-immunoprecipitates together with intersectin-long from COS-7 cells overexpressing both proteins (data not shown). Hence, the role of intersectin-long and CdGAP interaction on their respective activities toward Cdc42 is of great interest and will provide additional proof of the major role of intersectin as a scaffolding protein orchestrating Cdc42-induced signaling pathways through the recruitment and regulation of specific Cdc42 GAP, guanine nucleotide exchange factor. In addition to its newly identified role as a signaling molecule, intersectin has been well described as a key player of the endocytic machinery (18Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L.

Thus, the possible implication of CdGAP activity regulation toward Rac1 by intersectin in this cross-talk is under investigation and may provide a molecular mechanism by which the endocytic machinery may regulate Rac1 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2086358562,"RAD51B and RAD51C are two of five known paralogs of the human RAD51 protein that are thought to function in both homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. This work describes the in vitro and in vivo identification of the RAD51B/RAD51C heterocomplex. The RAD51B/RAD51C heterocomplex was isolated and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from insect cells co-expressing the recombinant proteins. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation of the RAD51B and RAD51C proteins from HeLa, MCF10A, and MCF7 cells strongly suggests the existence of an endogenous RAD51B/RAD51C heterocomplex. We extended these observations to examine the interaction between the RAD51B/RAD51C complex and the other RAD51 paralogs. Immunoprecipitation using protein-specific antibodies showed that RAD51C is central to a single large protein complex and/or several smaller complexes with RAD51B, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3. However, our experiments showed no evidence for the inclusion of RAD51 within these complexes. Further analysis is required to elucidate the function of the RAD51B/RAD51C heterocomplex and its association with the other RAD51 paralogs in the processes of homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair."
https://openalex.org/W2127741213,"The integrin α7β1 occurs in several cytoplasmic (α7A, α7B) and extracellular splice variants (α7X1, α7X2), which are differentially expressed during development of skeletal and heart muscle. The extracellular variants result from the alternative splicing of exons X1 and X2, corresponding to a segment within the putative ligand binding domain. To study the specificity and affinity of the X1/X2 variants to different laminin isoforms, soluble α7β1 complexes were prepared by recombinant coexpression of the extracellular domains of the α- and β-subunits. The binding of these complexes to purified ligands was measured by solid phase binding assays. Surprisingly, the alternative splice variants revealed different and specific affinities to different laminin isoforms. While the α7X2 variant bound much more strongly to laminin-1 than the α7X1 variant, the latter showed a high affinity binding to laminins-8 and -10/11. Laminin-2, the major laminin isoform in skeletal muscle, was recognized by both variants, whereas none of the two variants were able to interact with laminin-5. A specific blocking antibody inhibited the binding of both variants to all laminins tested, indicating the involvement of common epitopes in α7X1β1 and α7X2β1. Because laminin-8 and -10/11 as well as α7X1 are expressed in developing skeletal and cardiac muscle, these findings suggest that α7X1β1 may represent a physiological receptor with novel specificities for laminin-8 and -10.

While the α7X2 variant bound much more strongly to laminin-1 than the α7X1 variant, the latter showed a high affinity binding to laminins-8 and -10/11. Laminin-2, the major laminin isoform in skeletal muscle, was recognized by both variants, whereas none of the two variants were able to interact with laminin-5. A specific blocking antibody inhibited the binding of both variants to all laminins tested, indicating the involvement of common epitopes in α7X1β1 and α7X2β1. Because laminin-8 and -10/11 as well as α7X1 are expressed in developing skeletal and cardiac muscle, these findings suggest that α7X1β1 may represent a physiological receptor with novel specificities for laminin-8 and -10. The laminin-binding integrin α7β1 is the major laminin receptor of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells (for review, see Ref. 1Burkin D.J. Kaufman S.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), but it has also been detected in some human melanoma cells (2Kramer R.H. McDonald K.A. Vu M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15642-16549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glioblastoma cells (3von der Mark H. Duerr J. Sonnenberg A. von der Mark K. Deutzmann R. Goodman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23593-23601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, it is located predominantly in myotendinous and in neuromuscular junctions (4Bao Z.Z. Lakonishok M.

Dyn. 1996; 207: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence from several laboratories indicates that α7β1 integrin is involved in laminin-induced migration of skeletal myoblasts (7Yao C.-C. Ziober B.L. Sutherland A.E. Mendrick D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25598-25603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) on laminin-1 and -2 was considerably enhanced after transfection with α7 integrin expression vectors. The critical role of α7 integrins in muscle function became evident after inactivation of both alleles of the α7 geneitga7 in mice. Deficient mice developed a novel form of myopathy, accompanied by disruption of the myotendinous junctions (12Mayer U. Saher G. Faessler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. von der Mark H. Miosge N. Poeschl E. von der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Subsequently, human patients were identified with similar defects associated with mutations in the Itga7 gene (13Hayashi Y.K. Chou F.L. Engvall E. Ogawa M. Matsuda C. Hirabayashi S. Yokochi K. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. Kaufman S.J. Ozawa E. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Tsukahara T. Wang J.Z. Hoffman E.P. Arahata K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The α7 integrin subunits are expressed in two cytoplasmic and two extracellular splice variants in human and mouse tissues (14Ziober B.L., Wu, M.P. Waleh N. Crawford J. Lin C.-S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26773-26783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19019-19024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of which is developmentally regulated. The cytoplasmic variant α7B is expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle, skeletal myoblasts, and embryonic and adult skeletal muscle, whereas the α7A variant is expressed only in mature skeletal muscles but not in cardiac muscle (6Velling T. Collo G. Sorokin L. Durbeej M. Zhang H. Gullberg D. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The extracellular variants α7X1 and α7X2 result from alternative splicing of exons coding for a region between the homology repeats III and IV, located in the putative β-propeller domain of α7 (17Ziober B.L. Chen Y. Kramer R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and represent part of the putative ligand binding site. The X1 and X2 splice variants are expressed in equal amounts in mouse skeletal myoblasts and adult heart, whereas in adult skeletal muscle, mainly the α7X2 splice variant can be found (14Ziober B.L., Wu, M.P. Waleh N. Crawford J. Lin C.-S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26773-26783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specific roles of these splice variants are still unclear. After experimental clustering of acetylcholine receptors on the surface of α7X1- or α7X2-transfected C2C12 myotubes by laminin-1, only the α7X2 was detected within the acetylcholine receptor clusters (18Burkin D.J., Gu, M. Hodges B.L. Campanelli J.T. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both splice variants bind to laminin-1- and laminin-2-coated surfaces when expressed in HEK293 cells; however, α7X1B promoted cell migration only on laminin-2, and α7X2B stimulated motility on both substrates (10Schoeber S. Mielenz D. Echtermeyer F. Hapke S. Poeschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further, the cell-specific environment seems to have a critical impact on binding (10Schoeber S. Mielenz D. Echtermeyer F. Hapke S. Poeschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Ziober B.L. Chen Y. Kramer R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although α7β1 integrins bind to laminin-1 and its E8 fragment in vitro (3von der Mark H. Duerr J. Sonnenberg A. von der Mark K. Deutzmann R. Goodman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23593-23601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kramer R.H. Mai P.V. Cheng Y.-F. Ramos D.M. Timpl R. Waleh N.

Laminin-2 appears to be the major α7β1 ligand in skeletal muscle in vivo; however, nothing is known about α7β1 interactions with other laminin isoforms that also occur in myogenic tissues, such as laminin-8 (23Frieser M. Nockel H. Pausch F. Roder C. Hahn A. Deutzmann R. Sorokin L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and laminin-10 (21Ringelmann B. Roder C. Hallmann R.

Laminin-8, composed of α4, β1, and γ1 chains, and laminin-10 (α5, β1, γ1), which were originally identified in endothelial cell basement membranes (21Ringelmann B. Roder C. Hallmann R. Maley M.

Biochem. 1994; 223: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), are also expressed in muscle fiber basement membranes during embryogenesis. Both isoforms are down-regulated during development, remaining at the neuromuscular junction in the mature tissues where they combine with laminin β2 and γ1 chains to form laminin-9 and -11, respectively (21Ringelmann B. Roder C. Hallmann R. Maley M. Davies M. Grounds M. Sorokin L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Sorokin L.M.

The 200–240-kDa α4 chain that forms laminin-8 together with β1 and γ1 subunits (29Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) was localized in fetal and newborn neuromuscular junctions and the endoneurium of intramuscular nerves but disappears in mature muscle, whereas it remains in the capillary endothelium (21Ringelmann B. Roder C. Hallmann R. Maley M. Davies M. Grounds M. Sorokin L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, laminin α4 and α5 chains reappear to compensate for the lack of laminin-2 in basement membranes of newly formed myotubes in focal lesions in the dy/dymice (21Ringelmann B. Roder C. Hallmann R. Maley M. Davies M. Grounds M. Sorokin L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recent data show that laminins-8 and -10 are up-regulated in the basement membranes of newly formed myotubes during regeneration of normal adult muscle (28Sorokin L.M. Maley M.A. Moch H. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Cadalbert L. Karosi S. Davies M.J. McGeachie J.K. Grounds M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 500-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In order to define the affinity and specificity of α7β1 integrin and its extracellular splice variants for different laminins, soluble α7X1β1 and α7X2β1 complexes were expressed recombinantly in HEK293 cells, and affinities for laminin isoforms were analyzed using a solid phase binding assay. The extracellular domains of integrin β1 and α7 formed heterodimers and were secreted to the culture medium. Surprisingly, X1 and X2 variants showed distinct binding affinities for different laminin isoforms. The X2 splice variant showed a high affinity binding to laminin-1 and its E8 fragment but did not bind laminins-8 and -10/11. The X1 variant, in contrast, specifically recognized laminin-8 and -10, and to a lesser extent, it also recognized laminin-1. Both X1 and X2 showed similar affinities for laminin-2, whereas laminin-5 was not recognized by either splice variant. Because striking similarities exist between the expression patterns of the α7X1β1 splice variant and laminins-8 and -10, we assume that α7X1β1 represents a potential receptor for laminin-8 and -10 during early steps in embryogenesis. Laminin-1 was purified from the murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (30Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and laminin-2 was extracted from mouse heart muscle and purified as described previously (31Paulsson M. Saladin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18726-18732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin-5 was prepared from human SSC25 cells (32Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. J. Eble, University of Münster, Germany). Bovine laminin-8 was isolated from conditioned medium of bovine aortic endothelial cells endothelial cells as described in Ref. 23Frieser M. Nockel H. Pausch F. Roder C. Hahn A. Deutzmann R. Sorokin L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar. Laminin-10/11 was purified from human placenta by affinity chromatography using the anti-α5 antibody, 4C7 (33Sixt M. Hallmann R. Wendler O. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Sorokin L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18878-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Collagen I and fibronectin were purchased from Sigma. The cloning of the murine α7BX2 variant was described earlier (9Echtermeyer F. Schöber S. Pöschl E. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2071-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with the full-length cDNA corresponding to positions 14–3829 of GenBankTM accession number GB:NM_008398. An additional RGS-His6 tag (Qiagen) was introduced at the C-terminal end of the extracellular domain (position 3280) using a PCR-based strategy, resulting in the construct pUC18/α7X2-E-His. The extracellular domain of the X1 variant of α7B was generated by a reverse transcription-PCR fusion strategy using overlapping primers corresponding to the X1-specific sequence (14Ziober B.L., Wu, M.P.

Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in combination with N- and C-terminal primers. The resulting 1060-bp N-terminal fragment was cloned and fused with the C-terminal half containing the RGS-His6 resulting in pUC18/α7X1-E-His. The plasmid pBSmintβ1-N contains the full-length cDNA of the murine β1A cDNA (a kind gift of S. Johansson and R. Faessler), and sequences coding for the C terminus of the ectodomain were amplified by PCR using Vent Polymerase (Biolabs) with an additional Strep-tag sequence, SAWRHPQFGG (34Schmidt T.G. Koepke J. Frank R. Skerra A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), introduced at the C terminus at position 2278. The 0.44-kb fragment, corresponding to positions 1880–2278 (GenBankTM accession number GB:mmintbr), was cloned and fused via an internal BglII site with the N-terminal HhaI-BglII fragment (positions 57–1910) of pBSmintβ1-N, resulting in pBS/β1-E-Strep. All clones were verified by restriction mapping and sequencing. The inserts from pUC18/α7X1-E-His and pUC18/α7X2-E-His, coding for His-tagged α7 ectodomains, were isolated byXbaI/HpaI digestion and recloned in the corresponding sites of the vector pCMVsis (35Gorman C. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar), resulting in pCMV/α7X1-E-His and pCMV/α7X1-E-His. The insert from pBS/β1-E-Strep was recloned in the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by the use ofKpnI/XbaI, resulting in pcDNA/β1-E-Strep. Constructs were transfected to HEK293 cells by calcium-phosphate co-precipitation as described previously (9Echtermeyer F. Schöber S. Pöschl E. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2071-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, pcDNA/β1-E-Strep was mixed in a molar ratio of 1:10–1:20 with 10–20 μg of either pCMVsis/α7X1-E-His or alternatively, pCMVsis/α7X2-E-His. 106 cells were transfected, and G418-resistant clones were selected and expanded. Resistant clones were tested for expression and secretion of soluble integrins by analyzing the cell culture supernatant by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antiserum (242) specific for α7 (9Echtermeyer F. Schöber S. Pöschl E. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2071-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and an anti-β1 antibody (kindly provided by J. Eble, University Münster). Transfected HEK293 cells were grown to confluency and incubated for a further 2 days in serum-free medium. Medium was harvested, 0.04% sodium azide was added, and the samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Inc.). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose, equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, was added, and the suspension was incubated for 1–16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose was washed with equilibration buffer containing 5 mm imidazole and finally eluted with 50 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The eluted material was concentrated in a Centricon 30 ultrafiltration unit (Amicon Inc.), washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 1TBSTris-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayLNlaminin and adjusted to 1 mm MnCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2(TBS/Mn/Mg). Up to 1.5 mg/liter of purified complexes could be isolated from conditioned media. Tris-buffered saline enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay laminin Extracellular matrix proteins in TBS were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorb, Nunc) at 4 °C overnight. The efficiency of coating with different laminin variants was tested by the binding of 125I-labeled proteins and showed comparable and concentration-dependent binding of all laminin isoforms to the plastic surface (33Sixt M. Hallmann R. Wendler O. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Sorokin L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18878-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All the following steps were performed at room temperature. After coating, plates were washed with TBS/Mn/Mg, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS/Mn/Mg for 1 h. Soluble α7β1 integrin was diluted with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS/Mn/Mg, added to the coated plates, and incubated for 2 h. The plates were washed three times with TBS/Mn/Mg, and bound receptor was detected using either mouse monoclonal anti-mouse α7 antibody, 3C12 (10Schoeber S. Mielenz D. Echtermeyer F. Hapke S. Poeschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or a rabbit polyclonal anti-rat β1 antibody (36Gullberg E. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12686-12694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 h and washing with TBS/Mn/Mg, secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit) coupled to horseradish peroxidase was applied and incubated for 1 h. ABTS substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for detection, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. All measurements were performed in duplicates or triplicates. Mean value and standard deviation are shown for one out of three–five typical experiments. Calculations of K d values were done by methods based on Scatchard plot or saturation plot analysis according to Ref. 37Hamilton R.G. Adkinson N.F. Kemeny D.M. Challacombe S.J. ELISA and Other Solid Phase Immunoassays. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1988: 57-84Google Scholar. For quantitation of the α7β1ectodomains, calibration curves were generated using a sandwich ELISA. Microtiter plates were coated with 50 μg/ml of the monoclonal anti-α7 antibody 3C12 (10Schoeber S. Mielenz D. Echtermeyer F. Hapke S. Poeschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and serial dilutions of purified recombinant ectodomains were added. Bound α7β1 complexes were detected by the same anti-β1 antibody used during solid phase assays. The calibration curves were linear up to 0.1 μg of isolated complexes.K d values were calculated according to Ref. 37Hamilton R.G. Adkinson N.F. Kemeny D.M. Challacombe S.J. ELISA and Other Solid Phase Immunoassays. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1988: 57-84Google Scholar from experiments where saturation of binding could be achieved. To study the affinity and specificity of the α7 integrin splice variants, X1 and X2, the extracellular domains were coexpressed together with β1 integrin after deletion of the transmembrane and cytoplasmatic domains. A (His)6-tag coding sequence was fused to the C termini of the truncated α7X1 and α7X2 variants to facilitate their purification. After cotransfection into HEK293 cells, stable clones that secreted soluble α7X1β1 or α7X2β1 integrin heterodimers were identified by immunoblotting of supernatants. Soluble α7X1β1 and α7X2β1 complexes were purified from the cell culture medium using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). The chain composition of the purified complexes was tested by immunoblotting using specific antibodies to α7 and β1subunits (Fig. 1, B and C). The estimated sizes for the soluble α7X1 (97 kDa) and α7X2 (95 kDa) subunits corresponded with the calculated sizes of the expressed domains, whereas the diffuse band obtained with the β1subunit (110–120 kDa) is indicative for a high level of glycosylation. Although most clones produced and secreted β1 chains in excess, both truncated subunit chains appeared in comparable amounts after purification, although the presence of small amounts of single chains cannot be excluded (Fig. 1 A). Mn2+ was added to purified complexes and was always present during experiments. The absence of Mn2+ resulted in a loss of stability of the α7β1 complexes; thus Mn2+ could not be replaced by other divalent anions. Up to 1.5 mg of soluble complexes were isolated from 1 liter of conditioned medium. The binding of the α7X1β1 and α7X2β1 variants to laminin-1 was investigated by a solid phase binding assay on microtiter dishes coated with purified laminin-1 at varying concentrations (2.5–20 μg/ml). Bound receptor was detected by antibodies specific for the α7 (not shown) or the β1 chain (Fig.2 A). The binding was saturable and revealed a higher affinity of α7X2β1 for laminin-1 as compared with α7X1β1. The difference was further substantiated by calculations of the K d values using Scatchard plot and saturation plot analysis (37Hamilton R.G. Adkinson N.F. Kemeny D.M. Challacombe S.J. ELISA and Other Solid Phase Immunoassays. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1988: 57-84Google Scholar). Amounts of bound ectodomain complexes were calculated from calibration curves established by a sandwich ELISA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The affinity of α7X1β1 for laminin-1 (K d : ∼17 × 10−9m) is significantly lower than the affinity of the α7X2β1 variant for the same ligand (K d : ∼3 × 10−9m). Corresponding differences were also seen after the binding of variable concentrations of soluble receptors of α7X1β1 and α7X2β1 to constant concentrations (10 μg/ml) of laminin-1 (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, α7X2β1 showed a significantly higher affinity for the E8 fragment of laminin-1 than the X1 splice variant (Fig. 3). In contrast, both complexes bound to laminin-2 to a comparable extent at high concentrations (100 nm) of receptors (Figs. 2 A and 3), which is in agreement with a previous study where we found comparable levels of binding of α7X1- and α7X2- expressing HEK293 cells to laminin-2 (10Schoeber S.

Low concentrations of receptor revealed a higher affinity of α7X1β1 for LN-2 (Fig.2 B). Neither α7X1β1 nor α7X2β1 bound to laminin-5 (Fig. 3), which is recognized by α3β1 and α6β4 (32Eble J.A.

The presence of EDTA completely inhibited the binding of receptor variants to all laminins (data not shown).Figure 3Binding of soluble α7X1β1(open boxes) and α7X2β1(filled boxes) complexes to different laminins. Laminins-1, -2, -5, -8, and -10/11, the E8 fragment of LN-1, fibronectin (FN), collagen I (COL-I), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were coated, and the binding of soluble receptors was determined by ELISA.

Only the α7X1β1 complex, but not the α7X2 variant, bound to these laminins (Fig. 3). The affinity of α7X1β1 for laminin-8 (K d : ∼2 × 10−9m) is comparable with the affinity of α7X2β1for laminin-1. At similar coating concentrations of laminin isoforms, the binding of α7X1β1 to laminins-8 and -10/11 was considerably higher than to laminin-1 (Fig. 3). This was confirmed in a binding assay on microtiter plates coated with serial dilutions of laminins (Fig. 2 A) assuming comparable coating efficiency as shown recently (33Sixt M. Hallmann R.

The α7-specific antibody 6A11 was previously shown to inhibit α7β1-mediated adhesion of transfected HEK293 cells (10Schoeber S. Mielenz D. Echtermeyer F. Hapke S. Poeschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The addition of this blocking antibody inhibited the binding of α7X2 to laminin-1 as well as α7X1 to laminins-1, -8, and -10/11 (Fig.4), indicating that common interaction sites are involved in ligand binding of both splice variants. In this study, we present for the first time evidences for differential specificity of the extracellular splice variants of α7 integrin for laminin isoform ligands. Laminins as biologically active components of basement membranes have been shown to regulate cell adhesion and spreading, cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Many in vitro studies on the biological roles of laminin have been performed using laminin-1, predominantly found in embryonic and fetal tissues but absent from many adult tissues including skeletal muscle (20Schuler F.

Basement membranes surrounding embryonic myofibers also contain laminins-8 and -10, which are down-regulated at this site with development. A number of β1 integrins, including α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α6β1, and α7β1, have been shown to be involved in cellular interactions with laminins, but only α6β1 and α7β1bind exclusively to laminins: α7β1recognizes laminin-1 and -2 (10Schoeber S.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The integrin α-subunits α3, α6, and α7 are structurally highly homologous, lack I-domains at the N terminus, and are expressed as two extracellular splice variants (X1, X2). Alternative cytoplasmatic domains (A, B) are also generated by differential splicing of integrin α6and α7 genes. However, little was known about the affinity of α7X1 and α7X2 splice variants for laminin isoforms. The α7X1β1 and α7X2β1 integrin complexes used in this study were prepared as recombinant, soluble ectodomains lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. Despite the absence of these domains, the extracellular domains of α7X1 or α7X2 subunits formed stable heterodimeric complexes with the truncated β1 subunit, which apparently retained their native structure and ligand binding capacity. Heterodimerization of α7 and β1 subunits was proven by immunoprecipitation of the complexes with antibodies to α7, as well as by affinity chromatography of the tagged α7X1 or α7X2 subunits. Obviously, the extracellular domains of α7X1/αX2 and β1 contain sufficient structural information for their assembly into stable heterodimers. Alternatively, soluble α3β1 heterodimers devoid of cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains have been prepared by couplingjun and fos leucine zippers to the C termini of subunits to stabilize the complex (32Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In that case, the use of dimerization domains stabilized the complex and also allowed binding studies in the presence of different cations. The essential addition of Mn2+ for the stabilization of the soluble α7β1 complexes points into this direction. The method used in this study may be useful for the detailed analysis of receptor-ligand interactions by mutagenesis studies and epitope mapping. The binding of α7X1β1 to laminin-8 and -10/11, as well as the interaction of both variants to laminin-1 and -2, could be completely inhibited by the α7 blocking antibody, 6A11, which was shown previously to block α7X2-mediated binding of cells to laminin-1/E8 fragment (10Schoeber S. Mielenz D. Echtermeyer F. Hapke S. Poeschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This indicates that the ligand binding of α7X1/α7X2 variants with laminin isoforms share common epitopes in the extracellular domain, whereas specificity is defined by the X1/X2 region located between homology repeats III and IV in the β-propeller of the α7 chain (44Oxvig C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4870-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the blocking effects of the antibody may result from steric hindrance or by allosteric effects. The soluble α7X2β1 showed a higher affinity for laminin-1 and laminin-1/E8 fragment than the α7X1β1 complex. In accordance with this finding, α7BX2-transfected HEK293 cells are characterized by an increased motility on laminin-1 as compared with α7BX1-transfected cells, although adhesion rates were about equal for both splice variants (10Schoeber S. Mielenz D. Echtermeyer F. Hapke S. Poeschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After prolonged attachment times, however, both α7BX1- and α7BX2-transfected cells may have reached saturation in adhesion to laminin-1. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that the cellular environment of β1 integrins greatly affects their affinity and specificity of binding. Thus, the interpretation of the role of distinct integrins in cell adhesion may be obscured by the presence of other integrins on the cell surface. For example, Zioberet al. (17Ziober B.L. Chen Y. Kramer R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that α7X1-transfected MCF7 cells bound laminin-1 only after activation with the β1-activating antibody, TS/16, whereas α7X1-transfected HT1080 cells constitutively bound laminin-1. These data indicated a conformational dependence of the laminin binding site in the α7X1 extracellular domain, which can be regulated by β1 antibodies and by divalent cations, in particular Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+. Recently, antibody studies indicated laminin-induced conformational changes of α7 integrins in muscle cells (45Blanco-Bose W.E. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). α7β1 integrins bind only to native laminins and require the C-terminal portions of laminin α-, β-, and γ-chains in their native trimeric conformation for binding (19Kramer R.H. Mai P.V. Cheng Y.-F. Ramos D.M. Timpl R. Waleh N. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 46Goodman S.L. Risse G. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,47Aumailley M. Timpl R. Sonnenberg A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Since the laminin β1 and γ1 chains are identical in laminins-1, -2, -8, and -10, differences in the laminin α-chains must account for the different affinities of the α7X1 and α7X2 variants for these laminins. There is only moderate sequence homology between the C-terminal portions of laminin α4 and α5 chains that comprise the globules of laminin-8 or -10/11, respectively. The degree of homology between laminin α4 and α5 is not higher than that between laminin α4 and α2 or α1 chains; it is therefore surprising that the α7X2 integrin recognizes laminin-1 and-2 but not laminin-8 and -10/11, while α7X1 recognizes all four laminins, although at different affinities. Neither α7X1nor α7X2 bind to laminin-5, however, which contains the laminin α3 chain. Further studies on the integrin-binding epitopes of the laminin isoforms will be necessary for the characterization of the structural basis of specificity for interactions with integrins. The question remains whether the absence of the cytoplasmic domains from the soluble complexes may affect the affinity and specificity of the extracellular domains to their ligands. There is no precedence, however, for a direct impact of the cytoplasmic domains of α-subunits on the ligand binding specificity or affinity of β1integrins. The cytoplasmic domains of α-subunits are involved in the transduction of extracellular signals to the cytoskeleton and intracellular signaling pathways regulating cellular responses (48Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 49Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain of α7 integrin has been shown to have no effect on the adhesion of transfected HEK293 cells to laminins-1 or -2, but it does alter cell migration and phosphorylation reactions (52Mielenz D. Hapke S. Poeschl E. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13417-13426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It remains to be elucidated whether the laminin isoform-specific interactions of the soluble α7X1β1 and α7X2β1 variants reflect their affinitiesin vivo or whether they are modulated in vivodepending on the cell type in which they are expressed, similar to the cases of α7β1 (17Ziober B.L. Chen Y. Kramer R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or α2β1 (53Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cell type-dependent modulation of binding affinities, however, was seen in tumor cells or after ectopic expression of integrins in cell lines. So far, cells expressing only the α7X1 splice variant have not been identified, but attempts are in progress to identify and to isolate such cells from muscle tissue to verify the affinity of the X1 splice variant for laminin-8 and -10. The specific affinity of the α7X1β1 variant for laminins-8 and -10/11 suggests that α7X1 may play a potential role in developing mouse skeletal muscle and also during situations associated with the reexpression of these laminins in regenerating muscle (21Ringelmann B. Roder C. Hallmann R. Maley M. Davies M. Grounds M. Sorokin L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). α7β1 integrin is also strongly expressed in smooth muscle that lines the walls of arterioles. In view of the widespread distribution of laminin-8 and -10/11 in embryonic muscle including the sarcolemma, neuromuscular junctions, and the endoneurium, it seems more likely that the α7X1 integrin splice variant is involved in heterologous cellular interactions in these locations. Therefore, the data presented may indicate that α7X1β1 represents a potential receptor for laminins-8 and -10 during early embryogenesis, whereas α7X2β1 in later stages is mainly involved in the functions of skeletal and heart muscle."

Previously, we have shown that MS-275, a synthetic inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), specifically induces the expression of theTβRII gene and restores the TGF-β signaling in human breast cancer cell lines. However, little is known about the mechanism by which inhibition of HDAC activates TβRII expression. MS-275 treatment of cells expressing a wild-type TβRIIpromoter/luciferase construct resulted in a 10-fold induction of the promoter activity. DNA transfection and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the induction of the TβRIIpromoter by MS-275 requires the inverted CCAAT box and its cognate binding protein, NF-Y. In addition, a DNA affinity pull-down assay indicated that the PCAF protein, a transcriptional coactivator with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, is specifically recruited to the NF-Y complex in the presence of either MS-275 or trichostatin A. Based on these results, we suggest that treatment with the HDAC inhibitor induces TβRII promoter activity by the recruitment of the PCAF protein to the NF-Y complex, interacting with the inverted CCAAT box in the TβRIIpromoter.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 931-934PubMed Google Scholar) that MS-275, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, induces the accumulation of acetylated histones in the chromatin of the TβRII gene and that this induction is associated with an increase of TβRII mRNA in human breast cancer cell lines, contributing to the restoration of TGF-β signaling. In this study, we have expanded upon this early observation and examined the molecular mechanism of the induction of the TβRII gene by MS-275 treatment in human breast cancer cell lines. We first show that the inverted CCAAT box and its cognate binding protein, NF-Y, play an important role in the induction of TβRII gene expression. Second, we found that PCAF, a protein with an intrinsic HAT activity, is recruited to the NF-Y complex upon treatment with MS-275, leading to the increase of TβRII gene expression. These findings demonstrate the mechanism by which the TβRIIgene, which is transcriptionally repressed by hypoacetylation, is induced by an HDAC inhibitor. The human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and ZR-75, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red with 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum and were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. MS-275, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, was provided by Mitsui Pharmaceuticals (16Saito A. Yamashita T. Mariko Y. Nosaka Y. Tsuchiya K. Ando T. Suzuki T. Tsuruo T. Nakanishi O.A. Proc. Natl.

MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells were transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, for transient transfection, cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. The following day cells were transfected with the indicatedTβRII promoter construct (1.0 μg/well) or cotransfected with 1.0 μg of a TβRII promoter construct and 1.0 μg of PCAF expression vector. Cells were incubated for 24 h prior to treatment with MS-275 and treated for 24 h before harvesting. For stable transfection, either pGL3-basic, pTβRII−102/+2-luc, or pTβRII −102/+2M4-luc (Fig. 4) was cotransfected with pCIneo (Promega) plasmids into MCF-7 cells using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 2 days, stable transfectants were selected using G418 (800 μg/ml; Calbiochem) for 3 weeks. Resultant colonies were picked for further analysis. Luciferase assay was performed with commercially available reagents and normalized relative to protein concentration as determined by the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Deletion mutants of the TβRII promoter in this study were cloned into the promoterless luciferase vector (pGL3-basic) using HindIII and SacI sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of the region from −102 to −50 as shown in Fig. 4 was performed by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCAF expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Nakatani. Total RNAs were isolated with the Triazol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT was performed using the SuperScript kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the PCR reaction, the PCR reagent system kit from Invitrogen was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the luciferase primers were 5′-TCAAAGAGGCGAACTGTGTG-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCGTCATCGTCTTTCC-3′. As a control, β-actin primers were 5′-TTCGCGGGCGACGATGCCCCCCGGGCCGTC-3′ and 5′-AGGATGCCTCTCTTGCTCTG-3′. The luciferase and β-actin cDNAs were amplified in separate PCR reactions. Samples that lacked RT were also amplified to control for the presence of any contaminating genomic DNA. Preparation of nuclear extracts, EMSA, and antibody supershift assay were performed as described previously (18Park S.H. Birchenall-Roberts M.C., Yi, Y. Lee B.Y. Lee D.G. Bertolette D.C., Fu, T. Ruscetti F. Kim S.-J. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were cultured with and without either MS-275 (0.5 μm) or trichostatin A (TSA; 0.3 μg/ml) for 24 h and harvested to prepare nuclear extracts. For EMSA, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the CCAAT box region (−100 to −62) (18Park S.H. Birchenall-Roberts M.C., Yi, Y. Lee B.Y. Lee D.G. Bertolette D.C., Fu, T. Ruscetti F. Kim S.-J. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase and purified using a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. To perform a competition assay, unlabeled oligonucleotides were used as competitors. For the antibody supershift assay, the reactions were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with 0.5 μg of antibody at 4 °C. The anti-NF-YA and anti-NF-YB antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). A DNA affinity pull-down assay using M280 magnetic beads (Dynal) was performed as previously described by Sasaki et al. (19Sasaki S. Lesoon-Wood L.A. Dey A. Kuwata T. Weintraub B.D. Humphrey G. Yang W.-M. Seto E. Yen P.M. Howard B.H. Ozato K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5389-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Four copies of the region from −100 to −67 containing the CCAAT box were cloned into pUC18 and biotinylated by PCR, using a biotin-labeled M13 reverse primer and a non-biotin-labeled M13 forward primer. The purified PCR fragments (40 μg) were conjugated to 10 mg of M280 magnetic beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Dynal). DNA-conjugated beads (50 μl) were mixed with 1.0 mg of MCF-7 nuclear extracts in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) for 4 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The suspension was precipitated with a magnetic plate (Dynal MPC-S), washed in binding buffer three times, and reprecipitated with centrifugation. The bound proteins were eluted with 20 μl of BC500 buffer as described by Sasaki et al. (19Sasaki S. Lesoon-Wood L.A. Dey A. Kuwata T. Weintraub B.D. Humphrey G. Yang W.-M. Seto E. Yen P.M. Howard B.H. Ozato K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5389-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-NF-YB and anti-PCAF antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Because MS-275 increased the accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 in the TβRIIpromoter and induced expression of TβRII mRNA in human breast cancer cell lines (15Lee B.Y. Park S.H. Kim J.W. Sausville E.A. Kim H.T. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Kim S.-J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 931-934PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether the histone deacetylase inhibitors MS-275, TSA, and sodium butyrate (NaBu) activateTβRII promoter activity in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell. TβRII/luciferase reporter construct (pTβRII−219/+35-luc), showing the strongest response to MS-275, and control vector pGL3-basic were transiently transfected and treated with MS-275 (0.5 μm), TSA (0.3 μg/ml), and NaBu (2 mm) for 24 h. As shown in Fig.1 a, TβRIIpromoter activity was dramatically increased about 60- to 70-fold after treatment with MS-275 or TSA and about 30-fold after treatment with NaBu. No significant induction in promoter activity of the control vector (pGL3-basic) was found after treatment with the inhibitors. These results were consistent with the previous report that the HDAC inhibitor, MS-275, induces TβRII gene expression at a transcriptional level. Several reports have shown that only promoters that are integrated into the chromosome could be regulated by HATs and HDACs, whereas several other reports have shown that the activity of transiently transfected promoters could be efficiently modulated by HATs and HDACs (20Bartsch J.

Sakai T. Pardee A.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5712-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed stable cell lines expressing theTβRII promoter/reporter gene to examine whether theTβRII promoter/reporter gene stably integrated into chromosomal DNA is also regulated by HATs and HDACs. The MCF-7 cell line was transfected with either the TβRII/luciferase reporter constructs (pTβRII−102/+2-luc or pTβRII−102/+2M4-luc) or its control vector as described under “Materials and Methods,” and stable transfectants were selected. The cell lines in which either the pTβRII−102/+2-luc or pTβRII−102/+2M4-luc gene were stably integrated were treated with 0.5 μmMS-275 for 24 h. As a control, the stable cell line, which contained pGL3-basic, a promoterless luciferase vector, was also treated with MS-275 under the same conditions. Expression of the luciferase gene was studied by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig.2 a, a DNA band of about 328 bp corresponding to a luciferase fragment of expected size was detected in MCF-7 cell lines. However, the level of luciferase expression in cell lines expressing control vector and pTβRII−102/+2M4-luc was very low, and MS-275 treatment did not increase the expression level. In the stable cell lines expressing pTβRII−102/+2-luc gene, the activity of theTβRII promoter was increased ∼5-fold following treatment with MS-275 (Fig. 2 a). The pTβRII−102/+2-luc stable cell lines showed higher basal luciferase activity, and MS-275 treatment further induced its luciferase activity (Fig. 2 b). These results indicate that MS-275 has the same effect in stable cell lines expressing the TβRII promoter/luciferase gene as in cells expressing the transiently transfected TβRIIpromoter. To characterize the promoter region responsible for the induction of the TβRIIpromoter by MS-275, serial deletion mutants of the TβRIIpromoter, as shown in Fig. 3, were transiently transfected into MCF-7 and ZR-75 breast cancer cell lines, and the cells were then treated with MS-275. When the promoter was deleted to −172, induction of the TβRII promoter by MS-275 was decreased to 50% in both cell lines, suggesting the presence of an element responsible for the induction within the region from −219 to −172. Interestingly, deletion of the region from −100 to −47 dramatically decreased the induction of the TβRIIpromoter to only about 2-fold upon treatment of MS-275, whereas expression of pTβRII−100/+35-luc was still induced ∼20-fold (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the region from −100 to −47 contains a major element(s) required for the induction by MS-275. Therefore, the region from −100 to −47 was focused on in order to study the mechanism of MS-275-mediated induction of theTβRII promoter. To further investigate the MS-275 responsive sequence between −100 and −47, we constructed site-directed mutants within this region, as shown in Fig. 4. Following transfection, the MCF-7 cells were exposed to MS-275 for 24 h and analyzed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 4 b, M3 and M4 mutants were only slightly affected by treatment with MS-275, whereas the wild type and other mutants of the TβRII promoter were dramatically induced. M3 and M4 contain mutations of the inverted CCAAT box (−82 to −78), which had previously been reported to be involved in v-SRC-mediated induction of the TβRII promoter (18Park S.H. Birchenall-Roberts M.C., Yi, Y. Lee B.Y. Lee D.G. Bertolette D.C., Fu, T. Ruscetti F. Kim S.-J. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, two different mutations in the CCAAT box abolished promoter activity induced by MS-275, indicating that this CCAAT box plays a critical role in the induction of the TβRII promoter by the HDAC inhibitor, MS-275. To identify specific binding of proteins to the sequences from −100 to −62, EMSA was performed as described above using a double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the sequences between −100 and −62. The reaction mixture was then electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel and viewed by autoradiography (Fig. 5). In the absence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (Fig.5 b, lane 1), three strong bands (complexesa, b, and c) were apparent. It is clear that these bands represent specific binding of protein(s) to the target oligonucleotide sequence because binding to the labeled probe diminishes with a wild-type unlabeled competitor (Fig. 5 b,lane 2). Mutant oligonucleotides derived from the sequences between −100 and −62 were used to identify the target sequences for complexes a, b, and c (Fig. 5 a). M1 and M2 mutants failed to compete for binding to these complexes, whereas the M3 mutant decreased competition for binding to all three complexes (Fig. 5 b,lanes 3–5). This region contains the inverted CCAAT consensus sequences. The binding of complexes a, b, and c to the M3 mutant was also markedly reduced (Fig. 5 c). To characterize which transcription factors interact with the CCAAT box in response to MS-275, an EMSA was performed with MCF-7 nuclear extracts prepared from MS-275 treated or untreated cells. Three protein-DNA complexes (complexes a, b, and c) from MCF-7 cells interacted with a 34-mer oligonucleotide probe of the region around the wild-type CCAAT box (Fig. 6 a). Treatment with MS-275 prior to preparation of nuclear extract had no apparent effect on the complex formation (Fig. 6 a). EMSA with the nuclear extract of ZR-75 human breast cancer cells showed the same protein-DNA complexes, which again were not affected by MS-275 treatment (data not shown). In addition, competition assay showed that all three protein-DNA complexes were specific to the inverted CCAAT box (Fig. 6 a). The addition of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild-type CCAAT box sequences completely abolished the formation of all three complexes, whereas both unlabeled M4 oligonucleotides containing the mutation of the CCAAT box and nonspecific oligonucleotides did not affect complex formation (Fig.6 a). To identify transcription factors interacting with this inverted CCAAT box in the TβRII promoter, antibody supershift assays were performed. Because it had been reported previously (18Park S.H. Birchenall-Roberts M.C., Yi, Y. Lee B.Y. Lee D.G. Bertolette D.C., Fu, T. Ruscetti F. Kim S.-J. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar) that the NF-Y protein binds to the CCAAT box of the TβRII promoter, we determined whether the NF-Y protein interacts with the CCAAT box in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. NF-Y is a complex composed of three subunits, NF-YA (CBF-B), NF-YB (CBF-A), and NF-YC (CBF-C), which are highly conserved throughout evolution, and all are required for DNA binding (26Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sinha S. Maity S.N., Lu, J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 b, the NF-YA and NF-YB antibodies were found to selectively supershift the complexa in both MS-275-untreated and -treated nuclear extracts, whereas the antibody against the other CCAAT box-binding protein, C/EBP, did not show any shifted band. Interestingly, complexesb and c were not changed by the supershift assay, suggesting that these complexes are formed by other nuclear proteins. Consequently, these results indicate that complex arepresents the NF-Y protein bound to the CCAAT boxes of theTβRII promoter in human breast cancer cell lines and that the binding activity of NF-Y protein is not affected by MS-275 treatment. However, we do not yet understand the reason why the supershifted band by NF-YA has lower mobility than by NF-YB. These results, however, did not clearly reveal the mechanism of induction of the TβRII promoter by MS-275 because binding of the NF-Y protein was not changed in MCF-7 nuclear extracts, whether untreated or treated by MS-275. Recent reports show that the NF-Y protein is connected with histone acetyltransferase activity (24Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29Currie R.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It was reported that the NF-Y complex possesses histone acetyltransferase activity through physical association with the related histone acetyltransferases, human GCN5 and PCAF, in vivo (29Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In two other reports, TSA, a potent inhibitor of HDAC, increased the activity of NF-Y-dependent promoters such as human MDR1 and Xenopus HSP70 in vivo (24Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the case of the MDR1 gene, overexpression of PCAF with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity induced the wild-type MDR1 promoter but not a promoter containing a mutation in the CCAAT box. Moreover, it was shown that NF-YA interacts with PCAF in vitro. In theHSP70 promoter it was reported that NF-YB is a substrate of p300 acetylation and recruits p300 to modulate transcriptional activity (30Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the NF-Y complex is truly involved in recruiting histone acetyltransferase activity to the TβRII promoter in response to either MS-275 or TSA, a DNA affinity pull-down assay was performed. Four copies of the region containing the wild-type CCAAT box were conjugated with magnetic beads and incubated with nuclear extracts of MCF-7 cells, which were treated or untreated with either MS-275 or TSA. As a negative control, four copies of the region in which the CCAAT box was mutated were simultaneously conjugated. Bound materials were eluted, and immunoblot analysis was performed with PCAF, NF-Y, and p300 antibodies. Interestingly, only PCAF, not p300, was detected in the nuclear extracts treated with MS-275 and NF-Y protein bound to the wild-type CCAAT box, not the mutant CCAAT box (Fig.7 a). However, we could not observe the presence of PCAF in untreated cells. This result suggests a novel mechanism for the activation of the TβRII promoter by an inhibitor of HDAC in human breast cancer cell lines. In the absence of either MS-275 or TSA treatment, NF-Y does not interact with PCAF in breast cancer cell lines, whereas PCAF is recruited to the NF-Y complex upon treatment with either MS-275 or TSA, increasing the activity of the TβRII promoter. To further support the possibility that PCAF is involved in the activation of the TβRII promoter in human breast cancer cell lines, a plasmid expressing PCAF was cotransfected with a wild-type (pTβRII−102/+2-luc) or CCAAT-mutated (pTβRII−102/+2M4-luc) TβRIIpromoter/luciferase construct into MCF-7 cells. Although transfection of PCAF increased the activity of the wild-type TβRIIpromoter about 5-fold, it had no effect on the CCAAT box mutant (Fig.7 b). However, expression of p300 did not increase the activity of the wild-type TβRII promoter in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (data not shown). Consequently, our results strongly suggest that activation of the TβRII promoter by an inhibitor of HDAC is due to the increase of HAT activity by recruiting PCAF to NF-Y tethered to the TβRII promoter in human breast cancer cell lines. Several studies demonstrate that transcriptional repression of the TGF-β type II receptor gene is one of several mechanisms leading to TGF-β resistance. Many human cancer cell lines harbor a normalTβRII gene and downstream signaling proteins but express significantly reduced or undetectable levels of TβRII mRNA (9Park K. Kim S.-J. Bang Y.-J.

Transcriptional regulation of TβRII gene expression plays an important role in modulating TGF-β responsiveness. Transformation of cells by the product of the adenovirus E1Agene or overexpression of cyclin D1 in epithelial cells has been associated with down-regulation of TβRII expression and TGF-β resistance (32Missero C.

Genet. 1999; 23: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) that the Ewing sarcoma EWS-Fli1 fusion gene suppresses transcription of theTβRII gene. These results imply that theTβRII gene acts as a tumor suppressor gene and may be a candidate target for cancer therapy of therapeutic targets for cancer. We have previously reported that MS-275, a HDAC inhibitor, enhancesTβRII gene expression in association with an accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 with the TβRII promoter and restores TGF-β signaling in human breast cancer cell lines, suggesting the possibility that histone deacetylation of theTβRII gene is a new epigenetic mechanism to contribute to the resistance of human breast cancer cell lines to TGF-β (15Lee B.Y. Park S.H. Kim J.W. Sausville E.A. Kim H.T. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Kim S.-J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 931-934PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the mechanism of the induction of theTβRII gene by an inhibitor of HDAC in human breast cancer cell lines. First, the induction of the TβRII gene by MS-275 requires an intact CCAAT box and its cognate binding factor, the NF-Y complex. Second, when cells are treated with an inhibitor of HDAC, PCAF with histone acetyltransferase activity is recruited into the NF-Y complex, increasing the activity of the TβRIIpromoter. Our findings that the CCAAT box and NF-Y are required for activation of the TβRII promoter are similar to the data described in the induction of the MDR1 gene by TSA (24Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and consistent with previous reports (29Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that NF-Y is connected with histone acetyltransferase activity through physical association with human GCN5 and PCAF. However, the study of MDR1 did not clearly provide the mechanism of the induction of the MDR1 gene by TSA. They showed that PCAF interacts with NF-YA in vitro, suggesting that the direct interaction of PCAF and NF-YA mediate the transcriptional activation. Interestingly, the interaction of PCAF and the NF-Y complex on the TβRII promoter was only shown in the presence of MS-275 treatment (Fig. 7 a). Under normal conditions, NF-YA tethered to the TβRII promoter did not interact with PCAF in the human breast cancer cell line. Upon treatment with either MS-275 or TSA, the interaction between the two proteins was increased as shown in the DNA affinity pull-down assay (Fig.7 a), whereas the DNA binding activity of the NF-Y complex was not changed in the absence or presence of an inhibitor of HDAC treatment. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for the activation of the TβRII promoter by an inhibitor of the HDAC. One possibility is that transcription of the TβRII promoter is repressed by a compact chromatin structure, which is maintained by increased HDAC activity in human breast cancer cell lines. However, MS-275 treatment leads to a local disruption of nucleosome structure of the TβRII promoter by acetylation of H3 or H4 histones, permitting PCAF with its intrinsic HAT activity to be recruited into the NF-Y complex, resulting in the increase of TβRIIpromoter activity. A second possibility is based on the finding that NF-YB and NF-YC contain a histone-like motif (27Sinha S. Maity S.N., Lu, J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 35Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and interact in a nucleosome-like structure. That is, the histone-like motifs of NF-YB and NF-YC could themselves be a target for an inhibitor of HDAC. It is possible that treatment of an inhibitor of HDAC increases the state of acetylation of NF-YB and NF-YC and causes disruption of the nucleosome structure. In this manner, the acetylation of NF-YB and NF-YC may also contribute to the recruitment of PCAF to the NF-Y complex. This is the first report showing the mechanism of the activation of theTβRII promoter by a histone deacetylase inhibitor in human breast cancer cell lines. In conclusion, our present studies suggest that PCAF is recruited to NF-Y, which binds to the inverted CCAAT box in the TβRII promoter and plays an important role in the activation of the TβRII promoter by treatment with an inhibitor of HDAC.

In cells undergoing DNA damage or responding to certain forms of stress (replicative senescence, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and oncogene overexpression) the ordinarily short-lived p53 protein is stabilized, rapidly accumulates, and undergoes several activating post-translational modifications. In this context, activated p53, via its ability to regulate gene transcription, elicits either a cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Fornace A.J., Jr. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). As it would be expected, p53 actions are largely regulated by post-translational events, including direct binding and occlusion of the transactivation domain, ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome, and control of subcellular localization. The Hdm2 protein has been implicated in all three of these processes, most recently as mediator of the export of p53 from the nucleus, which enhances the degradation of p53 in cytoplasmic proteosomes (2Roth J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Interestingly the Hdm2gene itself is a transcriptional target of p53. Thus, there is evidence for an autoregulatory feedback loop involving the expression and function of Hdm2 and p53. From a genetic standpoint, the close relationship between the murine ortholog of Hdm2, Mdm2, and p53 is further supported by the striking observation that a p53-null state can completely rescue the early-embryonic-lethal phenotype associated with Mdm2 deficiency (8Montes de Oca Luna R.

Hdmx has been shown to bind p53 and inhibit p53 transactivation in specific cellular contexts but, unlike Hdm2, is unable to induce p53 degradation (10Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F.

Similar conclusions were drawn when using the Hdmx murine ortholog Mdmx (12Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W.

Moreover, Mdmx and Mdm2 form stable heterodimers through their C-terminal RING-finger domains, and this interaction results in a substantial increase in the steady-state levels of Mdm2 (14Tanimura S.

It was therefore proposed that Hdmx (and Mdmx) secures a nuclear pool of transcriptionally incompetent p53, which upon stress can be quickly activated. Finally the first genetic evidences confirming the role of Mdmx as a critical regulator of p53 functionin vivo are now available. Mdmx-mutant mice die around midgestation because of loss of cell proliferation, while loss of p53 completely rescues this embryonic lethality (16Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V.

Pelicci, and J.-C. Marine, submitted. These new exciting data raise the possibility that increased Mdmx levels and the resulting inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity contribute to development of human tumors. We show here that exogenous Hdmx is mainly localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells by indirect immunofluorescence, while when co-expressed with Hdm2, Hdmx was then found almost exclusively in the nucleus. We show that this effect is dependent on the integrity of the RING-finger domain of both Hdmx and Hdm2 proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hdm2-dependent nuclear recruitment of Hdmx is indispensable for its ability to exert its two previously reported activities, regulation of p53 steady state levels and block of p53 transcriptional ability. DNAs encoding wild-type human p53 and Hdm2 in pCMV and the p53 reporter plasmid pG13Luc were a gift from B. Vogelstein. The HA-tagged wild-type p53, p53 K305N (nuclear localization signal (NLS)) (17Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol.

Vousden; Hdm2 NLS and Hdm2 G58A mutants were obtained from A. Levine. The pcDNA3.1 Myc-tagged Hdmx constructs (wild type and N-terminal truncation mutant (amino acids 101–490), also designated Hdmxp53bs−) were described previously (15Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by D. George. Full-length Hdmx and the N-terminal truncated (amino acids 101–490) Hdmx fragment were released from the above constructs using aBamHI-XhoI restriction digest and subcloned into the pcDNA3X(+)MyEGFP to generate Myc-GFP-tagged Hdmx and Myc-GFP-Hdmx-(101–490). The tagged Hdmx (R-NLS (amino acids 2–430) and R− (amino acids 2–451)) deletion mutants, deleted either of the entire RING-finger region including the putative NLS or most of it to leave the putative NLS intact, were generated by PCR amplification of the corresponding fragments using a 5′-primer including a BamHI site and 3′-primers includingXhoI sites. The PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1Myc and pcDNA3X(+)MyEGFP to generate the Myc-tagged Hdmx (R-NLS) and the Myc-tagged Hdmx (R−), and the Myc-GFP-tagged Hdmx (R-NLS) and the Myc-GFP-tagged Hdmx (R−), respectively. Hdmx NLS− mutants (KRPRD → ATPLD) were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotide and its complement were used for the mutagenesis in the context of the Myc-tagged Hdmx and Myc-GFP-tagged Hdmx constructs: 5′-tgtgaggcaacaccactagacggg. U2OS, Soas-2, NIH-3T3, and Phoenix (derived from the 293T cell line) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate method or the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunofluorescence staining, cells were transfected at 80% confluency on glass coverslips in six-well dishes and fixed 24 h after addition of the DNA mixtures. Fixed coverslips were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.15% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline + 2% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. Cells were than incubated in blocking buffer containing primary antibody for 1 h as indicated below and then washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline before incubation with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Stained cells were mounted on glass slides and examined using standard immunofluorescence or confocal microscopy. Alexa or Jackson Immunoresearch secondary antibodies were used for confocal or standard microscopy, respectively. Staining of p53 was carried out using the anti-p53 polyclonal FL-393 or anti-p53 monoclonal DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or, to detect HA-p53, the anti-HA polyclonal antibody HA.11 (Babco) was used. Mdm2 staining was carried out using the anti-Mdm2 monoclonal antibody SMP14 or the polyclonal antibody N20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The Myc-tagged Hdmx proteins were detected using an anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal or polyclonal (Upstate Biotechnology) antibody and/or the previously described anti-Hdmx mouse monoclonal antibody 6B1A (11Stad R.

U2OS cells were grown on six-well plates and transfected as outlined above. Luciferase analyses were performed with a commercial kit (Promega), and activity was measured in a luminometer. To correct for transfection efficiency, 1 μg of CMVlacZ was co-transfected in all cases, and luciferase values were corrected for β-galactosidase activity. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 units/ml aprotinin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNaF, 0.1 mm NaVO4) + 10% glycerol and sonicated 2 × 7 s (Sonicator, Ultrasonic processor XL, Heat Systems, 12–14% power). Debris were removed by sedimentation at 4 °C (20 min at 14,000 rpm). For immunoprecipitation assays, cell lysates (∼250 μg of protein) were incubated with 1–3 μg of the appropriate antibody (9E10 or SMP14) for 2 h at 4 °C. Following the addition of 30 μl of a protein A-Sepharose beads mixture, the reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C; the beads were then washed three times in the lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample loading buffer. The immunoprecipitates or the protein extracts (for straight Western blot analysis) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The proteins of interest were detected by incubation of the membrane with primary specific antibody as indicated below in 5% milk followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody and a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The membrane was probed with either an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11 from Babco) to detect the transfected p53 proteins (wild type and K305N) or the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1). The Mdm2 antibody SMP14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect Hdm2, and an anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody was used to detect the Myc-tagged Hdmx proteins. Determination of the subcellular localization of transfected Hdmx and/or Mdmx in different cellular contexts has led to conflicting observations (13Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To revisit this issue, we determined the localization of exogenous Myc-tagged (N-terminal) Hdmx and GFP-Hdmx in U2OS, Soas-2, and NIH-3T3 cell lines by immunofluorescence. In all cell types analyzed, both Hdmx-tagged proteins were mainly found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, a–d). The intensity and the frequency of the nuclear staining slightly varied from one cell line to another but always appeared much less frequent (<5% of cells) and less intense than the cytoplasmic staining (Fig.1 h). Sequence analysis of Hdmx reveals a single putative NLS in the C-terminal RING-finger domain (KRPRD). Point mutations in this motif (KTLLD) had no major effect on the cellular distribution of Hdmx (Fig.1, e and h). Deletion of the C-terminal RING domain instead resulted in both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of Hdmx (Hdmx R-NLS and R−, carrying deletions of either the entire RING domain, including the putative NLS, or most of it to leave the putative NLS intact) (Fig. 1, f–h). It appears, therefore, that the putative NLS of Hdmx is not functional and that its C-terminal RING-finger motif is an important determinant of the cellular distribution of Hdmx. Since Hdm2 is a nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling protein (2Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 3Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and Mdm2 (the mouse ortholog of Hdm2) forms stable hetero-oligomers with Mdmx (14Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 15Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Hdm2 levels affect Hdmx localization. Strikingly, GFP-Hdmx was entirely nuclear when co-expressed with Hdm2 in U2OS (Fig. 2,c–e and o) or Saos-2 cells (not shown). Similar results were obtained using a Hdmx-Myc tagged construct (not shown). This effect did not depend on the ability of Hdm2 to bind p53 since the p53 binding-defective mutant, Hdm2 G58A (22Freedman D.A. Epstein C.B. Roth J.C. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 248-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was still able to recruit Hdmx into the nucleus (Fig. 2 o). More importantly this effect depends on the ability of Hdm2 to interact with Hdmx. Indeed, deletion of the RING domains of Hdm2 (Hdm2R−) or Hdmx (Hdmx R− and R-NLS) abrogated their ability to form heterodimers (Fig. 2 p) and the nuclear recruitment of Hdmx by co-expressed Hdm2 (Fig. 2, f–k and o). Moreover, the putative NLS motif of Hdmx appears to be dispensable for its recruitment into the nucleus (Fig. 2 o), whereas this effect is dependent on the integrity of the Hdm2 NLS (Fig. 2,l–n and o) (3Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) further supporting that the observed effect on Hdmx localization is mediated by a direct interaction with Hdm2. Since p53 binds Hdmx and possesses a nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling activity independent of Hdm2 (23Middeler G. Zerf K. Jenovai S. Thulig A. Tschodrich-Rotter M. Kubitscheck U. Peters R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), we tested whether p53 can also recruit Hdmx in the nucleus. As shown, overexpression of wild-type p53 had a minor, yet reproducible, delocalization effect on Hdmx (Fig. 2 o). Expression of a p53 DNA binding-defective mutant (173L) was unable to alter the Hdmx localization pattern (Fig.2 o), thus suggesting that the slight nuclear accumulation of Hdmx following p53 overexpression is caused by the increased expression of a p53 target gene. Based on the data above, we propose that this effect is mediated by the transcriptional activation of endogenous Hdm2. It is generally accepted that Hdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 is essential for its degradation. Since binding of both Mdmx and Hdmx to Mdm2 increases the steady-state level of Mdm2 without affecting p53 stability (13Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), one obvious possibility is that Hdmx binding inhibits the Hdm2 E3 ligase function. This is supported by the finding that Hdmx contacts Hdm2 in its RING-finger domain, a region essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity (6Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar,7Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the levels of p53 ubiquitination in the presence of overexpressed Hdm2 and Hdmx by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 3). As expected, overexpressed Hdm2 promoted ubiquitination of endogenous p53. This effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 3, lanes 2and 3) and based on the ability of Hdm2 to bind p53 (G58A mutant, Fig. 3, lane 4). Expression of Hdmx instead had no measurable effect on p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 3, lane 5), indicating that Hdmx by itself does not have ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53. Co-transfection of Hdmx and Hdm2 resulted in stabilization of the Hdm2 protein, as expected, that was dependent on the integrity of the Hdmx RING domain (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 with6, 7 and 2 with 8,9). In these conditions, Hdmx did not detectably change the overall pattern of Hdm2-dependent ubiquitination of p53. However, in evaluating the effect of Hdmx on Hdm2-dependent p53 ubiquitination, one should consider the property of Hdmx to increase the protein levels of Hdm2. To this end, we set up experimental conditions that allowed the same amount of Hdm2 protein to be expressed even in the presence of increasing Hdmx protein concentrations (Fig. 3, lanes 10 and 11). Under these conditions, a significant reduction of p53 ubiquitination was observed in the presence of high Hdmx protein levels. Notably, expression of the HdmxR− mutant did not significantly interfere with Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and9). Similar results were obtained analyzing the status of ubiquitination of exogenous p53 in different cellular contexts such as in U2OS, Soas-2, and p53xMdm2 knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts (HA-p53) (not shown). Together these data indicate that Hdmx has the potential to inhibit Hdm2 ligase activity. However, the concomitant ability of Hdmx to stabilize the Hdm2 protein suggests that, under physiological conditions, inhibition of the Hdm2 ligase activity by Hdmx is not sufficient to account for the inhibition of Hdm2-mediated p53 degradation by Hdmx. It is well documented that wild-type p53 must reach the cytoplasm to be efficiently degraded (2Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 4Geyer R.K., Yu, Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 5Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 24Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M.

An alternative explanation for the stabilization of p53 is, therefore, that Hdmx interferes with the Hdm2-dependent p53 nuclear export. To test this possibility, we investigated the reciprocal effects of Hdm2, Hdmx, and p53 on their subcellular localization. Overexpressed p53 was almost exclusively nuclear and, when expressed with Hdm2, was partly relocalized to the cytoplasm as expected (4Geyer R.K., Yu, Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 5Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, a–f ands). Strikingly, co-expression of Hdmx inhibited the Hdm2-induced cytoplasmic delocalization of p53 (Fig. 4, g–jand s), indicating that nuclear Hdmx can block the Hdm2-dependent nuclear export of p53. p53 export, however, was not efficiently perturbed by Hdmx when co-expressed with the Hdm2 NLS mutant. Importantly we have shown earlier that the nuclear recruitment of Hdmx by Hdm2 NLS is only partial. Mutants of Hdmx unable to bind Hdm2, such as Hdmx R− and R-NLS, were incapable of reversing the Hdm2-induced export of p53 (Fig. 4, k–n ands) even if a significant fraction of these mutants are found in the nucleus (see also Fig. 1, f–h). Together these observations indicate that the nuclear localization of Hdmx is necessary but not sufficient to reverse Hdm2-induced nuclear export and that this effect is dependent on the ability of Hdmx to interact with Hdm2. Finally it has been shown that nuclear export of p53 is not required for its ubiquitination and that a p53 cytoplasmic mutant (K305N) can be ubiquitinated and degraded by Hdm2 NLS (26Yu Z.K. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that stabilization of p53 by Hdmx is the consequence of its ability to block p53 nuclear export. Therefore, Hdmx should be unable to reverse the Hdm2-dependent degradation of cytoplasmic p53. To test this hypothesis, we examined the levels of p53 and p53(K305N) following overexpression of Hdm2 or Hdm2 NLS, either alone or in the presence of Hdmx, in the U2OS (Fig. 5, aand b) or Soas-2 cells and in the p53xMdm2 knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts. In the absence of Hdmx, Hdm2 and Hdm2 NLS induced ubiquitination (not shown) and subsequent degradation of p53 or p53(K305N), respectively. However, co-expression of Hdmx appeared to stabilize wild-type p53 but had no effect on the p53 cytoplasmic mutant, indicating that the ability of Hdmx to inhibit Hdm2 function is restricted to the nuclear pool of Hdmx. In contrast, Hdmx expression resulted in the stabilization of both Hdm2 and Hdm2 NLS−. This last observation suggests that the Hdmx-dependent stabilization of Hdm2 and p53 are achieved through different mechanisms. Overexpression of Hdmx results in a modest, yet consistent, decrease of the p53 transcriptional regulation ability (11Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N. Grivell S. Attema J. van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25336-25341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At first analysis, this effect of Hdmx on p53-dependent transcription contrasts with our observation that overexpressed Hdmx is mainly localized to the cytoplasm. However, in all reported experiments but one (12Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), the effect of Hdmx was investigated by transient transfection using various p53-deficient cell lines (Hep3B, H1299, Calu, and p53−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts), overexpressed p53, and various reporter constructs (14Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 15Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In these experimental conditions, overexpressed p53 might trigger recruitment of Hdmx into the nucleus indirectly through its effect on the endogenousHdm2 promoter. To test this possibility, we have transfected U2OS cells, which express endogenous p53, with the reporter construct pG13Luc containing 13 copies of the p53 consensus sequence upstream of a minimal promoter driving transcription of the luciferase gene. As expected, endogenous p53 is able to sustain a significant basal level of expression of the reporter construct (Fig.6). Overexpression of Hdm2, but not of Hdmx, significantly inhibited pG13Luc transcription. Expression of HdmxR−, which is partly localized in the nucleus (see Fig. 1,f and h), slightly, yet reproducibly, reduced the p53 transcriptional ability. Strikingly, simultaneous expression of Hdm2 and Hdmx resulted in an almost complete repression of p53 pG13Luc transcription. These findings demonstrate that regulation of Hdmx by Hdm2 is an absolute requirement for the efficient regulation of p53 activity by Hdmx and suggest that only the nuclear fraction of Hdmx regulates p53-dependent transcription. We have shown here that exogenous Hdmx, when expressed alone, is mainly cytoplasmic, while, in the presence of Hdm2, it becomes mainly nuclear. Nuclear relocalization of Hdmx by overexpressed Hdm2 depends on their reciprocal interaction as suggested by the finding that this phenomenon requires the integrity of the RING domain of both proteins. Surprisingly, however, RING mutants of Hdmx (R− and R-NLS) were found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm even when expressed alone suggesting that Hdmx binds other cellular factor(s) that might sequester Hdmx in the cytoplasm in the absence of Hdm2. Since Hdm2 binds Hdmx in the same RING-finger region, it might compete for binding and displace this putative interaction. Alternatively, formation of Hdmx oligomers might occur in the cytoplasm and inhibit the nuclear import of Hdmx by, for instance, masking its putative NLS, which is located in the RING-finger motif of the protein. In this context, Hdm2, which forms stable heterodimers with Hdmx (14Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), might disrupt the formation of Hdmx oligomers. We then investigated the mechanisms by which nuclear Hdmx inhibits Hdm2-induced p53 degradation. Since this effect was previously reported to be mediated by the Hdmx RING-finger and to involve hetero-oligomerization with the Hdm2 RING-finger, we hypothesized that Hdmx inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of Hdm2. Our data, however, are not entirely consistent with this model. Indeed, as it was demonstrated earlier for p19ARF (27Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), we showed that the interaction with Hdmx reduces the ubiquitin ligase activity of Hdm2. However, this effect is counteracted in vivo by the ability of Hdmx to stabilize Hdm2 suggesting that Hdmx stabilizes p53 through other mechanisms. And in fact, Hdmx is able to rescue Hdm2-mediated degradation even in those experimental conditions where the overall levels of p53 ubiquitination are not affected by Hdmx. The block of the Hdm2 ligase activity by Hdmx might instead explain the stabilization of Hdm2 following Hdmx overexpression. In fact, Hdm2 is not only a ubiquitin protein ligase for p53 but also mediates its own ubiquitination and stabilization (6Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). It is believed that the nuclear export of p53 is critical for efficient Hdm2-mediated degradation, although the function of Hdm2 in p53 nuclear export is still a matter of debate. We have demonstrated that Hdmx antagonizes Hdm2-dependent p53 relocalization, thereby providing a simple model for the ability of Hdmx to stabilize p53. However, the mechanisms through which Hdmx inhibits nuclear export of p53 by Hdm2 remain elusive. It has been shown that mutation of the Hdm2 RING-finger impairs the ubiquitination and cytoplasmic relocalization of p53, suggesting that ubiquitin ligation is a crucial signal for p53 export (4Geyer R.K., Yu, Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 5Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Considering the modest effect of Hdmx on Hdm2-induced p53 ubiquitination, Hdmx must exert its stabilization function more downstream by counteracting the relocalization effect of the ubiquitination signal. Hdmx forms a ternary complex with Hdm2 and p53 (11Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N. Grivell S. Attema J. van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28039-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and could, for instance, occlude the C-terminal p53 nuclear export signal. This signal has, indeed, been proposed to be indispensable for Hdm2-mediated p53 export (4Geyer R.K., Yu, Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 5Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Alternatively, overexpressed Hdmx might compete with Hdm2 for p53 binding. This possibility, however, appears unlikely since Hdmx does not significantly disturb binding of Hdm2 to p53 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (11Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N. Grivell S. Attema J. van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28039-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).2 Finally we confirmed that Hdmx antagonizes p53 transcriptional activity and demonstrated that nuclear recruitment of Hdmx is essential for its ability to suppress efficiently p53 transactivation. Indeed, in our experimental setting, the effect of Hdmx on p53-dependent transcription was marginal when expressed alone, while it became dramatic when co-expressed with Hdm2. The mechanism for this suppression is unknown. The formation of a trimeric complex could block crucial interactions with proteins of the transcriptional machinery. The biological significance of these particular functions of Hdmx, however, remains to be elucidated. Recent reports, including observations presented here, indicate that stabilized p53 protein is not able to activate transcription, and it was proposed that Hdmx secures the presence of a pool of inactive p53 that can be instantly activated when needed. Overexpressed Hdmx, however, is an artificial situation, and it is not known whether or not it corresponds to any physiological situations. Indeed, Hdmx protein levels seem to be very low in all primary cells tested. On the other hand, increased Hdmx levels were found in a significant fraction of tumor cell lines when compare with normal cells (28Ramos Y.F. Stad R. Attema J. Peltenburg L.T. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1839-1842PubMed Google Scholar). In general Hdmx expression in these tumor cell lines correlates with the presence of wild-type p53, suggesting that deregulated expression of Hdmx plays a role in carcinogenesis as an alternative way to inactivate p53. High levels of Hdmx may also explain the efficient response to radiation and chemotherapy displayed by a subset of tumors, including germ-cell tumors, which express high levels of wild-type p53 and Hdm2 (29Guillou L. Estreicher A. Chaubert P. Hurlimann J. Kurt A.M. Metthez G. Iggo R. Gray A.C. Jichlinski P. Leisinger H.J. Benhattar J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1221-1228PubMed Google Scholar, 30Riou G. Barrois M.

The now available mouse models further support the notion that, at least during embryogenesis, the primary function of Hdmx is to inhibit p53 function (16Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W.

The hippocampus is located at the medial-temporal edge of the neocortex and harbors neural circuitry that is crucial for cognitive functions such as learning and memory (1Lisman J.E.

Witter M.P. Paxinos G. The Rat Nervous System. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 443-493Google Scholar). Lateral to the CA1 subfield lies the subiculum, pre-, and parasubiculum, which are regarded as transitional neocortical areas located between the hippocampus proper and the entorhinal cortex (3Levitt P. Barbe M.F. Eagleson K.L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). During early development of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampal neuroepithelium is organized into distinct germinative zones that specify the development of CA pyramidal neurons, DG granule neurons, and fimbrial glial cells (4Altman J. Bayer S.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 301: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 5Guo M. Bier E. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 913-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Newly born Ammon's horn pyramidal precursor neurons exhibit a delay in migration to the hippocampal plate (HP) in which they reside temporally in an inferior band referred to as the intermediate zone (6Altman J. Bayer S.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 301: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). After sojourn in the intermediate zone, presumptive pyramidal precursors settle in the HP plate in an “inside-out” sequence where first born neurons constitute deep layers and later generated neurons settle above in more superficial (external) locations. In contrast to morphogenesis of the neocortex where cortical plate neurons segregate radially into layers of functionally distinct neurons, pyramidal neurons of the Ammon's horn remain settled in a single homogenous layer.Granule cell neurogenesis in the hippocampus is complex and involves at least two germinative zones. An early wave of migrating granule cell precursors originate in a distinct subdomain of the hippocampal neuroepithelium, designated the dentate notch, which consists of a mixture of post-mitotic and mitotic cells (7Altman J. Bayer S.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 301: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The former cells settle in the dentate plate (DP) scaffold, where deposition of these pioneer granule cells begins in the suprapyramidal limb and proceeds into the infrapyramidal limb, establishing the suprapyramidal-to-infrapyramidal morphogenic gradient of DG scaffolding. The migrating mitotic granule cell precursors are destined for the tertiary germinative matrix in the hilar region, which constitutes an ectopic proliferative zone that persists into early postnatal development giving rise to the majority of post-mitotic granule cells that settle in the DP in the late embryonic and early postnatal period. Deposition of late born granule neurons in the DP follows an “outside-in” rule in which the youngest post-mitotic cells are located in deep layers next to the hilar region, and older cells are located in superficial layers close to the outer molecular layer (7Altman J. Bayer S.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 301: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). During the 1st month of postnatal development, the tertiary germinative matrix is replaced by the subgranular zone that forms at the border between the hilus and the granule cell layer and which is the major site of DG neurogenesis in adults.As a first step toward identifying factors that might be involved in defining hippocampal territory during early development, we describe the identification and preliminary characterization of a novel BTB/POZ-zinc finger gene, designated HOF. Alternative splicing gives rise to two protein isoforms that are nuclear, can dimerize with each other, and bind specifically to DNA. In the developing cerebral cortex, HOF expression is confined to neurons of the presumptive hippocampus and is transiently up-regulated in immature post-mitotic neurons derived from the hippocampal neuroepithelium and dentate notch. Postnatally, HOF expression was observed in a subpopulation of subventrical zone progenitors, in glial cells, and in developing cerebellar granule cells.DISCUSSIONHere we identify two isoforms of a new murine nuclear BTB/POZ domain zinc finger factor, designated HOF, that is expressed in hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule neurons, and macroglia. Nuclear BTB/POZ domain factors have been implicated in regulation of chromatin conformation associated with cellular differentiation, including the establishment of accessible (i.e. euchromatin) or inaccessible (i.e. heterochromatin) domains for classical transcription factors (34Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar). HOF expression coincides with early post-mitotic development of the three principal hippocampal cell types, presumptive CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of Ammon's horn and presumptive granule neurons of the dentate gyrus, and a sharp decline in expression appears at the border between the CA1 region and the subiculum. Although several genes are known to be expressed in subdomains within the developing hippocampus (21Grove E.A. Tole S. Cereb. Cortex. 1999; 9: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Pleasure S.J. Collins A.E. Lowenstein D.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HOF seems to be the first example of a gene whose expression is strictly confined to neurons of the hippocampal territory as opposed to the adjacent neocortical and transitional areas. Thus, HOF is a candidate regulatory factor for hippocampal cell fate in the medial temporal lobe. Furthermore, the observation that HOF is expressed in all three major neuronal cell types argues for a coordination function for the gene in hippocampal development. The finding that HOF and the POU homeodomain transcription factor Oct-6 are co-expressed in migrating and settled CA1 neurons implies that HOF could function with such subregion-restricted factors to specify neuronal subtype identities in the hippocampus. Alternatively, HOF could exhibit a more global role during hippocampal development such as a function in morphogenesis of the single cell-layered stratum pyramidal and granule cell layer or in coordination of hippocampal axon pathfinding.In addition to the dentate gyrus, HOF was also expressed during postnatal granule cell development in the cerebellum. Based on spatial and temporal expression patterns of molecular markers, Heintz and co-workers (25Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 385-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) defined four stages of development of cerebellar granule neurons. The first stage is granule cell neurogenesis, which is localized to proliferating cells in the superficial layer of the EGL. The second stage is initiation of differentiation of young post-mitotic cells in the deeper aspect of the EGL and extension of T-shaped parallel fibers. The third stage of granule cell development ranges from axon extension and migration along radial Bergmann glial processes in the molecular layer to their settling in deeper layers in the IGL. This stage is also characterized by the presence of a transient layer of immature granule cells in the upper aspect of the IGL, at the level of the Purkinje cell layer and the end of the radial glial trail. The transient layer presumably marks a transition from glial to non-glial guided migration and is characterized by expression of a brain-specific lipid-binding protein in both radial Bergmann glia and granule cells (25Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 385-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The fourth stage is characterized by terminal differentiation of settled granule cells in the IGL. This mature stage involves establishment of connections between Purkinje cell dendrites and parallel granule cell axons in the molecular layer as well as connections between afferent mossy fiber axons and granule cell dendrites in the IGL.Moderate levels of HOF occur in EGL cells during the first 2 weeks of postnatal development, but localization of the protein is not confined to nuclei. On the contrary, a distinct nuclear staining was revealed in immature granule cells which (i) migrate in the molecular layer, (ii) sojourn in a transient layer in the upper aspect of the IGL, and (iii) settle in deeper layers of the IGL. After the 2nd postnatal week, expression of the gene was confined to immature granule cells of the IGL but was down-regulated in mature granule cells. This expression pattern corresponds to stage three of granule cell development described above indicating that HOF may play roles in granule cell migration and axon growth but less in processes associated with granule cell proliferation (stage one) and refinement of synaptic connections (stage four).The postnatal subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricle is thought to derive from the subventricular zone of the lateral ganglionic eminence (28Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Doetsch F. Wichterle H. Lim D.A. Alvarez-Buylla A. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 36: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The latter generates tangentially migrating cortical interneurons during embryonic neurogenesis (36Anderson S.A. Eisenstat D.D. Shi L. Rubenstein J.L. Science. 1997; 278: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar, 37Lumsden A. Gulisano M. Science. 1997; 278: 402-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas the former is a major source of immature neurons migrating along the RMS to the olfactory bulb, where they differentiate into granule and periglomerular interneurons. In addition to olfactory bulb interneurons, the postnatal subventricular zone also harbors gliogenic stem cells, which generate astroglia and oligodendroglia. The anterior subventricular zone was considered to be restricted to generation of olfactory bulb interneurons, whereas more caudal levels were enriched in gliogenic progenitors (27Luskin M.B. McDermott K. Glia. 1994; 11: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Luskin M.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 173-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that neuronal progenitors can be isolated from all rostro-caudal levels (38Kirschenbaum B. Goldman S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and that the subventricular zone is a continuum of migrating neurons and astroglia arranged as chains in which some migrate tangentially from more caudal levels to join the RMS (28Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Doetsch F. Wichterle H. Lim D.A. Alvarez-Buylla A. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 36: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 39Doetsch F. Alvarez-Buylla A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Moreover, although numerous astrocytes migrate along the RMS to the olfactory bulb, little attention has been put into the origin of these cells.We find HOF expression at all rostro-caudal levels of the subventricular zone, and this expression coincides with immature cells that do not express astrocyte or neuronal late differentiation markers. In addition, high levels of HOF were revealed in a major portion of cells lining the anterior subventricular zone (Fig. 4 C) indicating that this region is not a homogenous cell mass but is a patchwork of HOF-expressing and non-expressing cells. A similar patchwork of HOF-expressing and non-expressing cells appeared in the horizontal limb of the RMS. In the RMS, the great majority of these HOF-positive cells appeared to be astrocytes as they express the glial marker GFAP. Whether HOF expression in the anterior subventricular zone occurs in a progenitor common to astroglia and olfactory neurons or in cells already restricted to a glial fate remains to be determined. Furthermore, HOF expression was also persistent in mature astroglia in other locations including the striatum, the cerebral cortex, and cerebellum as well as in white matter oligodendroglia indicating that HOF-expressing subventricular zone progenitors give rise to at least two types of mature glial cells. Whatever the case, this expression pattern suggests that HOF is a candidate marker for gliogenic progenitor cells in this region of the subventricular zone, including more caudal regions, and that the RMS may be a significant source of astroglia populating the olfactory bulb during postnatal development.In Drosophila, several BTB/POZ domain zinc finger transcription factors have been implicated in nervous system development, including the involvement of the tramtrack(ttk) gene in glial cell, sensory organ, photoreceptor, and cone cell development (5Guo M.

The importance of BTB/POZ zinc finger factors in cell type specification in the Drosophila nervous system implies that such factors also play important roles in specifying neuronal and glial cell lineages in the mammalian central nervous system. Thus, identification of novel mammalian BTB/POZ factors is an important first step in understanding their role in brain development. The cloning of the HOF gene provides an opportunity to inactivate the gene by homologous recombination. This could reveal definitive evidence regarding the role of this gene product in mammalian brain development.

Newly born Ammon's horn pyramidal precursor neurons exhibit a delay in migration to the hippocampal plate (HP) in which they reside temporally in an inferior band referred to as the intermediate zone (6Altman J. Bayer S.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 301: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). After sojourn in the intermediate zone, presumptive pyramidal precursors settle in the HP plate in an “inside-out” sequence where first born neurons constitute deep layers and later generated neurons settle above in more superficial (external) locations. In contrast to morphogenesis of the neocortex where cortical plate neurons segregate radially into layers of functionally distinct neurons, pyramidal neurons of the Ammon's horn remain settled in a single homogenous layer. dentate gyrus broad complex tramtrack bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger hippocampal plate dentate plate glutathioneS-transferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay DNA-binding domain activation domain promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein external granular cell layer internal granule cell layer subventricular zone rostral migratory stream bromodeoxyuridine bovine serum albumin activation domain dentate gyrus broad complex tramtrack bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger hippocampal plate dentate plate glutathioneS-transferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay DNA-binding domain activation domain promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein external granular cell layer internal granule cell layer subventricular zone rostral migratory stream bromodeoxyuridine bovine serum albumin activation domain Granule cell neurogenesis in the hippocampus is complex and involves at least two germinative zones. An early wave of migrating granule cell precursors originate in a distinct subdomain of the hippocampal neuroepithelium, designated the dentate notch, which consists of a mixture of post-mitotic and mitotic cells (7Altman J. Bayer S.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 301: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The former cells settle in the dentate plate (DP) scaffold, where deposition of these pioneer granule cells begins in the suprapyramidal limb and proceeds into the infrapyramidal limb, establishing the suprapyramidal-to-infrapyramidal morphogenic gradient of DG scaffolding. The migrating mitotic granule cell precursors are destined for the tertiary germinative matrix in the hilar region, which constitutes an ectopic proliferative zone that persists into early postnatal development giving rise to the majority of post-mitotic granule cells that settle in the DP in the late embryonic and early postnatal period. Deposition of late born granule neurons in the DP follows an “outside-in” rule in which the youngest post-mitotic cells are located in deep layers next to the hilar region, and older cells are located in superficial layers close to the outer molecular layer (7Altman J. Bayer S.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 301: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). During the 1st month of postnatal development, the tertiary germinative matrix is replaced by the subgranular zone that forms at the border between the hilus and the granule cell layer and which is the major site of DG neurogenesis in adults. As a first step toward identifying factors that might be involved in defining hippocampal territory during early development, we describe the identification and preliminary characterization of a novel BTB/POZ-zinc finger gene, designated HOF. Alternative splicing gives rise to two protein isoforms that are nuclear, can dimerize with each other, and bind specifically to DNA. In the developing cerebral cortex, HOF expression is confined to neurons of the presumptive hippocampus and is transiently up-regulated in immature post-mitotic neurons derived from the hippocampal neuroepithelium and dentate notch. Postnatally, HOF expression was observed in a subpopulation of subventrical zone progenitors, in glial cells, and in developing cerebellar granule cells. DISCUSSIONHere we identify two isoforms of a new murine nuclear BTB/POZ domain zinc finger factor, designated HOF, that is expressed in hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule neurons, and macroglia. Nuclear BTB/POZ domain factors have been implicated in regulation of chromatin conformation associated with cellular differentiation, including the establishment of accessible (i.e. euchromatin) or inaccessible (i.e. heterochromatin) domains for classical transcription factors (34Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar). HOF expression coincides with early post-mitotic development of the three principal hippocampal cell types, presumptive CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of Ammon's horn and presumptive granule neurons of the dentate gyrus, and a sharp decline in expression appears at the border between the CA1 region and the subiculum. Although several genes are known to be expressed in subdomains within the developing hippocampus (21Grove E.A. Tole S. Cereb. Cortex. 1999; 9: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Pleasure S.J. Collins A.E. Lowenstein D.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HOF seems to be the first example of a gene whose expression is strictly confined to neurons of the hippocampal territory as opposed to the adjacent neocortical and transitional areas. Thus, HOF is a candidate regulatory factor for hippocampal cell fate in the medial temporal lobe. Furthermore, the observation that HOF is expressed in all three major neuronal cell types argues for a coordination function for the gene in hippocampal development. The finding that HOF and the POU homeodomain transcription factor Oct-6 are co-expressed in migrating and settled CA1 neurons implies that HOF could function with such subregion-restricted factors to specify neuronal subtype identities in the hippocampus. Alternatively, HOF could exhibit a more global role during hippocampal development such as a function in morphogenesis of the single cell-layered stratum pyramidal and granule cell layer or in coordination of hippocampal axon pathfinding.In addition to the dentate gyrus, HOF was also expressed during postnatal granule cell development in the cerebellum.

Recently, we demonstrated that plasma vitronectin inhibits fibrinolysis by mediating the interaction of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor with fibrin (Podor, T. J., Peterson, C. B., Lawrence, D. A., Stefansson, S., Shaughnessy, S. G., Foulon, D. M., Butcher, M., and Weitz, J. I. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 19788–19794). The current studies were undertaken to further examine the interactions between vitronectin and fibrin(ogen). Comparison of vitronectin levels in plasma with those in serum indicates that ∼20% of plasma vitronectin is incorporated into the clot. When the time course of biotinylated-vitronectin incorporation into clots formed from125I-fibrinogen is monitored, vitronectin incorporation into the clot parallels that of fibrinogen in the absence or presence of activated factor XIII. Vitronectin binds specifically to fibrin matrices with an estimated K d of ∼0.6 μm. Additional vitronectin subunits are assembled on fibrin-bound vitronectin multimers through self-association. Confocal microscopy of fibrin clots reveals the globular vitronectin aggregates anchored at intervals along the fibrin fibrils. This periodicity raised the possibility that vitronectin interacts with the γA/γ′ variant of fibrin(ogen) that represents about 10% of total fibrinogen. In support of this concept, the vitronectin which contaminates fibrinogen preparations co-purifies with the γA/γ′ fibrinogen fraction, and clots formed from γA/γ′ fibrinogen preferentially bind vitronectin. These studies reveal that vitronectin associates with fibrin during coagulation, and may thereby modulate hemostasis and inflammation.

Vitronectin is a multifunctional plasma glycoprotein that participates in the regulation of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and the complement cascade (reviewed in Refs. 1Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog.

Like fibrinogen, vitronectin is found in plasma at micromolar concentrations (6Seiffert D. Geisterfer M. Gauldie J. Podor T.J. J.

In plasma, vitronectin circulates as a native, monomeric form that is a mixture of 72-kDa single-chain and two-chain disulfide-linked species (10Izumi M. Yamada K.M. Hayashi M. Biochim. Biophys.

Under normal conditions, less than 3% of plasma vitronectin is comprised of more reactive oligomeric forms that display enhanced affinity for heparin or heparin-like molecules, and for the conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody 8E6 (10Izumi M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Levels of the oligomeric forms of vitronectin in serum relative to plasma also increase; indicating the process of coagulation alters vitronectin structure and function (10Izumi M. Yamada K.M.

Moreover, using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we found PAI-1 co-localized with vitronectin on the fibrin fibrils of plasma clots. A unique organization of the fibrin-associated Vn-PAI-1 distribution revealed insights into the nature of the vitronectin-binding sites on fibrin. Thus, we observed the fibrin-associated vitronectin and PAI-1 to be distributed in periodic aggregates along fibrin fibrils and at sites of fibril branching. This conspicuous pattern of staining is suggestive of a vitronectin interaction with the fibrinogen γ−chains, and particularly the γA/γ′ variant form of fibrinogen that represents about 5–10% of the total fibrinogen in plasma (36Sienbenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The fibrinogen γA/γ′ arises from alternative mRNA processing, and differs structurally in that the carboxyl-terminal sequences 408–411 of the γA/γ′ chain are replaced in the γA/γ ′ variant by an anionic 20 residue sequence. The purpose of this current study was to further characterize the interactions between vitronectin and fibrin by: (a) comparing total vitronectin antigen levels in plasma with those in serum, (b) quantifying the binding of vitronectin to purified fibrin, and (c) pursuing a morphological analysis of vitronectin in clots formed from plasma or purified fibrinogen. We present evidence that vitronectin associates with fibrin clots due to its preferentially binding to the carboxyl-terminal γ′ chain of the fibrin(ogen) γA/γ′ chain variant.

For some experiments, native vitronectin was converted to the oligomeric form by treatment with 6 m urea in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by dialysis against PBS. Vitronectin preparations were subjected to PAGE analysis in the absence or presence of SDS, and conformational changes were assessed by measuring their relative affinities for heparin-Sepharose and for the conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody 8E6. Fibrinogen was rendered vitronectin-free by immunoaffinity chromatography using immobilized SAHVn IgG and was characterized as described (35Podor T.J. Peterson C.B. Lawrence D.A. Stefansson S.

Fibrinogen trace-labeled with Na125I using Iodo-Beads (specific activity ∼100 μCi/mg) was >95% clottable (41Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Hudoba M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Native vitronectin was biotinylated (8Hill S. Shaughnessy S.G. Joshua P. Ribau J. Austin R.C. Podor T.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 5061-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or labeled using 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (ICN Biomedicals, Mississauga, ON) to a specific activity of ∼200 μCi/mg (42Thiagarajan P. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3035-3038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled native vitronectin was converted to the oligomeric form by treatment with 6 m urea. Purified fibrin clots were formed at 37 °C from a TBS buffer solution (0.2 ml) containing 3 μm fibrinogen, 100,000 cpm of 125I-fibrinogen, 150 nmbiotinylated native vitronectin, and 2 units/ml thrombin. At intervals,d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) was added to 0.05 mm, and fibrin was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The radioactivity in the fibrin clot supernatant were measured in a γ-counter, whereas the amount of biotinylated-vitronectin in the clot supernatant at each time point was quantified relative to the starting solution at time 0 by titrating the samples with Dilution buffer, followed by incubation on SAHVn IgG-coated microtiter wells for 1 h. After washing, bound biotinylated-vitronectin was detected using streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase, and the hydrolysis of thep-nitrophenyl phosphate chromogenic substrate was monitored at 405 nm on a Microtek plate reader. Purified fibrinogen (3 μm) was clotted with thrombin (2 units/ml) around inoculation loops (41Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Hudoba M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) in the presence of increasing concentrations of125I-vitronectin in TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20. Clots were formed in the absence or presence of 10 mmCa2+ and Factor XIII (10 μg/ml) to examine the effects of cross-linking on vitronectin incorporation. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and washing, 125I-vitronectin incorporation into the clots was determined by counting the radioactivity of the clots and the supernatant. Clots were then solubilized with 0.2 ml of Laemmli sample buffer in the absence or presence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. After boiling for 1 h, half of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gel), and the dried gels exposed to autoradiography film. The rate of 125I-vitronectin diffusion out of the clots was measured by incubating clots formed in the absence of factor XIII in a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube containing 5 ml/clot of buffer consisting of either 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4, or the same buffer containing 2 m NaCl. All conditions were performed in triplicate. At time 0, 0.5 ml of the bathing buffer was put into four test tubes and clots added to three of these. All samples were counted, and then all clots and bathing buffer returned to the 50-ml tubes. The clots were monitored in the same fashion for various times, and the radioactivity in the bathing buffer was subtracted from the average radioactivity of clots, and the clot radioactivity at each time point was then expressed as a percentage of their initial radioactivity. 50-μl aliquots of varying concentrations of a fibrinogen solution were added to wells of 96-well plates, and fibrin matrices were formed by clotting the fibrinogen with 1.0 units/ml thrombin and 10 mm CaCl2. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, the plates were stored at 4 °C until use. To block nonspecific binding, 100-μl aliquots of PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 were added to wells for 2 h at 37 °C, and after washing, increasing concentrations of 125I-vitronectin in Dilution buffer were added. After incubating for 1 h at 37 °C, the plates were washed, and the bound 125I-vitronectin quantified. To examine the specificity of binding, experiments were repeated in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled vitronectin. Control experiments were done using BSA-coated microtiter wells, and the 125I-vitronectin to BSA-coated wells was subtracted from that bound to fibrin to control for nonspecific binding. For fluorescence confocal laser microscopic analysis of vitronectin distribution in plasma and purified fibrin clots, 150 μl of PPP or purified fibrinogen (3 μm) were placed on APTEX-coated coverslips and clotted with 1 unit/ml of thrombin and 10 mmCaCl2. To directly visualize the fibrin fibrils, a 1:20 molar ratio of FITC-conjugated fibrinogen (Molecular Bioprobes) per mole of native fibrinogen was added. Samples also were prepared with various concentrations of biotin-labeled vitronectin or BSA prior to clotting. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the biotinylated proteins were detected by incubation for 20 min with streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red rhodamine. After a brief rinsing, the clots were mounted using Permafluor mounting medium, and then visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510. Dual wavelength images were acquired using an argon ion laser (488 nm excitation), a helium/neon ion laser (543 nm excitation) and two matched long pass barrier filters for FITC (515–525 nm emission) and TxR (575–640 nm emission) images. Immunofluorescence detection of PAI-1 in clots formed from normal plasma was conducted as previously described (35Podor T.J. Peterson C.B. Lawrence D.A. Stefansson S. Shaughnessy S.G. Foulon D.M. Butcher M. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19788-19794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Initial experiments were undertaken to determine whether clotting of plasma influences vitronectin antigen levels. Vitronectin, plasminogen, fibrinogen, and albumin antigens were quantified, and levels in plasma and serum from six healthy volunteers were compared (Fig.1 A). Affinity purified sheep anti-vitronectin IgG (SAHVn IgG) was used as a capture antibody in the vitronectin immunoassay. This antibody, like the conformationally sensitive mAb 8E6, preferentially binds to the oligomeric, heparin-binding form of vitronectin. Because samples can contain mixed vitronectin conforms, all the samples were denatured with urea to convert the vitronectin to its oligomeric form. The mean vitronectin concentration in serum was ∼20% lower than that in plasma (pairedt test; p < 0.05). Likewise, plasminogen and fibrinogen levels in serum are 40 and 98% lower in serum than in plasma. In contrast, the level of albumin in serum and plasma is similar. To determine whether the lower level of vitronectin in serum relative to plasma reflects vitronectin incorporation into the clot, equal volumes of plasma, serum, or solubilized plasma clots were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis and scanning densitometry. Samples fractionated under nonreducing conditions confirmed the presence of clot-associated native vitronectin and vitronectin multimers with electrophoretic mobilities similar to those of vitronectin in plasma and serum (Fig. 1 B, arrows a and b). Under reducing conditions, multimeric vitronectin dissociates into 72- and 62-kDa vitronectin subunits (Fig.1 B, arrows C). The presence ofN-ethylmalamide had no effect on the mobility of vitronectin, indicating that the change in the apparentM r of vitronectin after clotting was not the result of disulfide-mediated binding interactions. Thus, these experiments suggest that vitronectin binds to the clot matrix. To monitor the time course of vitronectin incorporation into clots, 125I-fibrinogen (3 μm) was clotted with thrombin in the presence of biotinylated-vitronectin (0.15 μm). At different intervals after thrombin addition, fibrin was pelleted by centrifugation, and the concentrations of the labeled proteins in the clot and clot supernatant were quantified. Time-dependent incorporation of125I-fibrin(ogen) into the clots was mirrored by an increase in the level of biotinylated-vitronectin incorporation (Fig.2 A).125I-Fibrinogen incorporation reaches a plateau by 30 min, with 50% of the maximum incorporation achieved at ∼12 min. In contrast, vitronectin incorporation reaches a plateau within 7.5 min, with 50% of the maximum vitronectin incorporation occurring at <2.5 min. Thus, the rate of vitronectin incorporation into the clots appears to exceed the rate of fibrin incorporation in the initial 5-min period so that the vitronectin:fibrin ratio is initially over 1 (Fig.2 A, left of dashed line). The non-reduced SDS-PAGE gels in Fig. 2 B suggest that, as early as 1 min after the addition of thrombin, vitronectin multimers and monomers are incorporated within the solubilized fibrin clots. A portion of the oligomeric vitronectin is too large to enter the separating gel (Fig. 2 B, arrow a). After reduction, the majority of fibrin-associated vitronectin oligomers dissociate into native subunit forms, although there is evidence of residual vitronectin that migrates with the same apparentM r as vitronectin dimers (Fig. 2 B,arrow b), as well as thrombin-cleaved forms of vitronectin (Fig. 2 B, arrow c).

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 1HCMVhuman cytomegalovirusHSVherpesvirus simplex DNA replication results in the formation of large head-to-tail DNA concatemers. The subsequent maturation into unit-length molecules involves site-specific cleavage at sequence motifs (pac motifs) located within thea sequence of the terminal and internal repeat segments (1Chou J.

Unit-length genomes are then encapsidated into preassembled capsids. DNA-packaging is a complex biological process. While it is commonly accepted that ATP hydrolysis is the driving force behind it, the molecular mechanisms of DNA translocation and genome packaging remain unclear. In general, the following five steps are involved. (i) The recognition of concatemeric DNA by a specific protein (complex) able to (ii) bind and cut the DNA at specific sequence motifs (packaging signals, e.g. pac1 andpac2), (iii) translocation of the DNA-protein complex into the procapsid, (iv) packaging of one unit-length genome, and (v) completion of the packaging process by cutting off excess DNA at the portal region (5Higgins R.R.

Reschke M. Reis B. Mockenhaupt T. Radsak K. Virology. 1993; 196: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Bogner E. Radsak K. Stinski M.F. J.

Comparable results were reported of the HSV-1 pUL28, demonstrating a direct interaction of pUL28 with DNA containing thepac1 motif (10Adelman K. Salmon B. Baines J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3086-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by the use of viral mutants it was demonstrated that the deletion of pUL28 leads to nuclear accumulation of naked nucleocapsids and uncleaved concatemeric DNA (11Addison C. Ricon F.J. Preston V.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2377-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,12Tengelsen L.A. Pederson N.E. Shaver P.R. Wathen M.W. Homa F.L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3470-3480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been noted that the HCMV UL89 gene product, the HSV-1 UL15 homolog, exhibits homology to the bacteriophage T4 gp17 terminase subunit, implying a similar function in DNA packaging (13Davison A.J. Virology. 1992; 186: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, this homology was only due to the ATP binding motifs. DNA packaging of double-stranded DNA bacteriophage requires the terminase, a complex of two proteins (14Black L.W. The Bacteriophages.

DNA Packaging and Cutting, Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 305-330Google Scholar). Most bacteriophage terminases are hetero-oligomers with each subunit carrying a different function (17Black L.W. Showe M.K. Steven A.C. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 218-255Google Scholar, 18Casjens S. Hendrix R. The Bacteriophages. 1.

The large subunit catalyzes the ATP-dependent translocation of genomic DNA into the bacteriophage procapsids and the small unit binds and cleaves concatenated DNA (21Bhattacharyya S.P. Rao V.B. Gene. 1994; 146: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Kuebler D. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutations in any of the encoding genes lead to an accumulation of empty procapsids (proheads) and DNA concatemers (23Black L.W. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Rao et al. (24Rao V.B. Leffers G. Kuebler D. The 11th Evergrenn International Bacteriophage T4 Meeting. Olympia, WA1996Google Scholar) demonstrated that the ATPase activity is associated with the large terminase subunit gp17 of bacteriophage T4. Here we address the question which component of the HCMV terminase has the ability to hydrolyze ATP. Exclusively, pUL56 exhibited an ATPase activity, defining this protein as the central function in DNA packaging of HCMV. Interestingly, we demonstrated that pUL89 and pUL56 interact. Escherichia coli strain BL21 codon plus was used as the host strain for UL56- and UL89-carrying pGEX-5X-1 constructs. The UL89 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription and PCR amplification. PCR primers amplified DNA segments from −17 to +2306 bp of the HCMV (strain AD169) UL89 open reading frame sequence except that a single nucleotide 5′ of the initiation codon was deleted to generate an NdeI site. This fragment was cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) to generate construct pUB8. A BamHI-to-XbaI fragment from pUB8 was cloned into the corresponding sites of the vector pcDNA3.1/His C (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA-UL89. Plasmid GST-UL56C was generated by digestion of pRC/CMV-UL56 (7Bogner E. Reschke M. Reis B. Mockenhaupt T. Radsak K. Virology. 1993; 196: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (23Black L.W. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The 1.5-kb fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of HCMV pUL56 (amino acids 446–850) was ligated in-frame into pGEX-5X-1, yielding pGEX-UL56C. For construction plasmid GST-UL89, plasmid pGEX-5X-1 was digested with EcoRI and XhoI prior to insertion of a fragment encoding the entire HCMV pUL89. The respective fragment was obtained using plasmid pcDNA-UL89 as a template for PCR and the following pair of synthetic oligonucleotides (restrictions sites are underlined): 5′-CCGGAATTCATGTTGCGCGGAGACTCGGCC-3′ (forward nucleotide) and 5′-CCGTCGAGCTAGCTGACCCTGAAACGGATG-3′ (reverse nucleotide). A fresh overnight culture of E. coli BL21 carrying the plasmid pGEX-UL56C or pGEX-UL89 or pGEX-5x-1 was diluted 1:100 in LB medium (1 liter) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C. After the cells reached an A 600 of 0.5 the GST protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Sedimented cells were lysed in 40 ml of binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 250 μl of 1 m MgCl2, 25 μl of 1m MnCl, 40 μl of DNase I (10 mg/ml), and 400 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated on ice. Undissolved material was sedimented at 5000 × g at 4 °C and passed through a 0.2-μm filter. The purification was performed with a 1-ml GSTrapTM column by using aÄKTATM Prime machine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. The column was washed with three bed volumes binding buffer prior to loading the proteins. Elution was performed with 10 bed volumes elution buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm glutathione, pH 8.0), and ten fractions were collected. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the proteins were stored at −80 °C. Plasmid pcDNA-UL89 (0.5 μg) and plasmid pHM123 (0.5 μg), encoding HCMV IE1, was incubated with [35S] methionine (10 mCi/ml) and 20 μl TNTTMT7 Quick Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) in a final volume of 30 μl for 1 h at 30 °C. Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. HCMV pUL56-specific human polyclonal antibody pabUL56 (7Bogner E. Reschke M. Reis B. Mockenhaupt T. Radsak K. Virology. 1993; 196: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which was purified from high titer human serum by column affinity chromatography (Affi-Gel 10/15-pUL56). Affinity purification of the anti-UL89 antibody was done as follows. The GST fusion protein, GST-UL89, was coupled to activated immunoaffinity supports Affi-Gel 10 and Affi-Gel 15 (1:2 Affi-Gel 10/Affi-Gel 15; Bio-Rad Laboratories) as described by Bio-Rad, yielding Affi-Gel 10/15-pUL89. Unspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with buffer B (1 methanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3) for 1 h. The resin was equilibrated with start buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3). High titer human convalescent serum was incubated overnight with the prepared affinity matrix. After the matrix was washed twice with 10 bed volume of ice-cold start buffer, the bound antibody was eluted in 200 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. The purified anti-pUL89 antibody, pabUL89, was neutralized with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fractions of the purified GST fusion proteins were separated on 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (7Bogner E. Reschke M. Reis B. Mockenhaupt T. Radsak K. Virology. 1993; 196: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were pabUL56 antibody (1:10; 25) specific for pUL56 and pabUL89 antibody (1:10) specific for pUL89. For immunoprecipitation total cell extracts were prepared from HCMV-infected cultures 72 h post infection by solubilization in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml Trasylol) and ultrasonic treatment. Insoluble material was sedimented for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Comparable amounts of extracts and pabUL89 (1:20), were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. The probes were washed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer, incubated at 95 °C for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein pGEX-UL56C was expressed in E. coli strain BL21, and protein purification was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of GST-UL56C fusion protein or GST alone loaded on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with in vitro translated pUL89 or the immediate-early protein 1 (IE1) 2 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of binding buffer (0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 300 mm NaCl). Samples were washed with binding buffer and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE, fixation and autoradiography. Radioactive signals were quantitatively analyzed using a BioImager (Fuji, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) with the program AIDA. Purified GST fusion proteins GST-UL89, GST-UL56C, or the control proteins GST (each 1.2 μg) andApyrase were incubated with 1 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (specific activity 2500 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol), or [γ-32P]GTP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) in 30 μl of nuclease buffer. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA up to a final concentration of 50 mm. A 1-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was applied onto a 20-cm-long PEI-F cellulose strip (Merck Eurolab, Darmstadt, Germany) and dried. The chromatogram was developed in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl according to Guo et al. (26Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The run was stopped when the solvent front reached 1 cm from the upper edge, dried, and autoradiographed on Kodak BIOMAX MR. Radioactive signals were quantified using a BioImager and AIDA software (Raytest). The values of produced Pi were calculated by subtracting the GST-only value from each GST fusion protein value. Nonradioactive nucleotides were used as standards. The spots were visualized under UV light and marked on the cellulose. For this purposeE. coli BL21 cells expressing GST-UL89 or GST-UL56C fusion proteins were harvested and purified by GSTrapTM column chromatography. Aliquots of every fraction were assayed for protein content by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining (Fig.1, A and C) or transfer to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose filters were reacted with the affinity purified antibodies against pUL56 and pabUL56, (Fig.1 B) or against pUL89 and pabUL89, (Fig. 1 D). Fraction 2 containing GST-UL56C (Fig. 1, A and B) or GST-UL89 (Fig. 1, C and D), respectively, was used for further analysis. To identify the terminase subunit that has the ability to hydrolyze [γ-33P]ATP, experiments with purified GST fusion proteins were performed. Hydrolysis of radiolabeled ATP of purified terminase subunits was assayed following chromatographic separation of ATP and ADP + Pi on PEI-F cellulose. Addition of GST-UL56C to the reaction mixture resulted in generation of 33Pi(Fig. 2 B, lane 5) comparable with the reaction with the Apyrase, an ATPase and ADPase from Solanum tuberosum (EC 3.6.1.5; Fig.2 B, lane 2). GST-UL89 did not show a high hydrolysis of ATP (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). GST alone did not show a significant ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). These experiments lead to the suggestion that hydrolysis of ATP is mainly associated with the terminase subunit pUL56. To characterize the position of the enzymatic cleavage site, experiments were performed with [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dATP, or [γ-32P]GTP. The reaction with GST-UL56C yielded a more slowly migrating radiolabeled product corresponding to ADP (Fig.3 A, GST-UL56C), which results from the hydrolysis of the β-γ phosphodiester bond. After the incubation with Apyrase, AMP was still detectable because this enzyme has also an ADPase activity (Fig. 3 A,Apyrase). The buffer control (Fig. 3 A,buffer) as well as the reaction with GST (Fig.3 A, GST) or GST-UL89 (Fig. 3 A,GST-UL89) did not show a specific reaction. Experiments with dATP demonstrated that GST-UL56C could hydrolyze dATP (Fig.3 B, GST-UL56C), but the amount of converted dATP was reduced up to 7-fold. The reaction was specific for ATP since GTP was not hydrolyzed (Fig. 3 C, GST-UL56C). These results demonstrated that GST-UL56C hydrolyzes the β-γ phosphodiester bond of ATP, generating ADP and Pi. To further investigate ATP hydrolysis, the time course of the reaction was analyzed. The ATPase activity of GST-UL56C was already observed after 10 min of incubation (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). In contrast GST-UL89 needed an incubation time of 60 min (Fig.4 A, lane 8). The control GST protein did not show an increase of ATPase activity over time (Fig. 4 C). Hydrolysis of radiolabeled ATP into ADP and Pi was measured by incubation with Apyrase (Fig. 4, lane 2). The buffer control is shown in lane 1. These experiments support the notion that the terminase subunit pUL56 is the main ATPase. To determine whether the enzymatic reaction could be saturated, experiments were performed with increasing protein amounts. ATP hydrolysis was verified by incubation with Apyrase (Fig. 5,lane 1). Interestingly, a concentration of GST-UL56C of 0.6 μg/ml was defined as the point where the reaction is in the log phase. This amount of protein converted 65% of ATP into Pi(Fig. 5 B, lane 4). In contrast GST-UL89 still showed almost no enzymatic activity (Fig. 5 A). GST as well as buffer were used as control reactions (Fig. 5 C, Fig. 5, A–C, lane 1). Our results demonstrated that the hydrolysis of ATP is saturated at a concentration of about 0.6 μg/ml GST-UL56C. To further investigate whether GST-UL89 could enhance the ATPase activity of GST-UL56C, experiments under limiting concentrations of GST-UL56C (0.3 μg/ml) were performed. GST-UL89 (0.6 and 3.0 μg/ml) was added to the ATPase reaction mix of UL56 (0.6 μg/ml) and incubated for 1 h. In the presence of GST-UL89, the UL56 enzymatic activity was stimulated up to 30% (Fig. 6, lane 3–4) while acetylated bovine serum albumin had no influence (Fig.6, lane 5). Apyrase was used for verification of the position of Pi (Fig. 6, lane 2) GST as well as the buffer was used as control reactions (Fig. 6, lane 7, lane 1). Thus pUL89 stimulates pUL56 ATPase activity. GST pull down assays were carried out using the carboxyl-terminal half of pUL56. To this end, the GST-UL56C containing the carboxyl-terminal portion or GST itself were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated either with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled pUL89 (in vitro UL89; Fig. 7:lane 3) or [35S]methionine-labeled IE1 (in vitro IE1; Fig. 7, lane 6). The amount of bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 7, pUL89 interacted specifically with GST-UL56C (lane 3) but not with GST alone (lane 1). In vitrotranslated IE1, used as a negative control, did not interact with GST-UL56C (Fig. 2, lane 5). To estimate the intensity of the pUL56-pUL89 interaction, quantification was performed using bioimaging analysis of the fluorographs. Binding of pUL89 to GST-pUL56C was 25× stronger than that of GST alone to pUL89. These experiments demonstrated for the first time a direct interaction of pUL89 with pUL56. To further investigate a direct interaction between both proteins co-immunoprecipitation prior to Western blot analysis was performed. For co-immunoprecipitation the antibody pabUL89 was used. The following Western blot analysis using pabUL56 detected pUL56 as the full size protein of 130 kDa in HCMV-infected cell extracts and co-immunoprecipitates (Fig. 8,lanes 3 and 4). No detection was observed in mock-infected cell extracts or co-immunoprecipitates (Fig.8 A, lanes 1 and 2). Co-immunoprecipitation with an antibody against HCMV pUL112/113, mab M23, was used as a control. The resulting co-immunoprecipitates were not detected by pabUL56 (Fig. 8 B, lanes 3 and4). The protein recognized by the antibody pabUL89 was demonstrated in Western blots of mock- and HCMV-infected cell extracts (Fig. 8, C and D). In HCMV-infected cell extracts the 75-kDa pUL89 was detected. These experiments implicates a direct interaction between HCMV pUL56 and pUL89. Terminase subunits are the only proteins known to be involved in packaging of viral DNA and have, so far, been described for double-stranded DNA bacteriophages only (2Deiss L.P. Chou J. Frenkel N. J.

These enzymes are normally hetero-oligomeric complexes with multiple functions (17Black L.W. Showe M.K. Steven A.C. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4.

Although the exact mechanism of DNA translocation is not known, it is commonly accepted that this process is energy-dependent. Studies by Guo et al.(26Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and Shibata et al. (3Shibata H. Fujisawa H. Minagawa T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hydrolysis of one ATP provides energy to translocate two base pairs under in vitro conditions. It has been noted that the HCMV UL89 gene product, the homolog of herpesvirus simplex type-1 (HSV-1) pUL15, exhibits homology to the bacteriophage T4 gp17 terminase subunit (13Davison A.J. Virology. 1992; 186: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated whether either or both HCMV proteins exhibited an ATPase activity. Interestingly, the ATPase activity was only associated with pUL56, which hydrolyzed the β-γ phosphodiester bond, generating ADP and Pi. Other nucleosides were not hydrolyzed by pUL56. Preincubation of the recombinant protein with the specific antibody could reduce the enzymatic activity to ∼50%, while unspecific antibodies had almost no effect (data not shown). Although pUL89 did not have an obvious enzymatic activity, it enhanced the pUL56-associated ATPase activity by about 30%. Comparable observations were reported by Leffers and Rao (28Leffers G. Rao V.B. J. Bio. Chem. 2000; 276: 37127-37136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with the bacteriophage T4 terminase subunits. The large subunit gp17 exhibited an ATPase activity and that the gp17 activity was enhanced by gp16. This bacteriophage terminase subunit has two ATP-binding sites in the central and a metal-binding motif in the C-terminal portion of the protein (28Leffers G. Rao V.B. J. Bio. Chem. 2000; 276: 37127-37136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A mutation of either the metal-binding motif or the ATP-binding site resulted in the loss of gp17 function (22Kuebler D. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore we showed that both proteins interact under in vitro conditions as well as in infected cells. This could be an explanation for the enhancing of the pUL56-associated ATPase activity by pUL89. Therefore, it is possible that HCMV pUL56 and pUL89 are the functional homologues to the T4 gp16 and gp17 subunits, respectively. ATP hydrolyzing enzymes contain a Walker box: box A, GKT; box B, DE). Both regions are found in pUL89 and its homologs. Therefore the presumption was that pUL89 would have an ATPase activity. However, under the conditions we used pUL89 did not have an enzymatic activity. A motif in pUL56 that could theoretically constitutes a partial Walker box A is GKQ (amino acids 714–716). Recently it was demonstrated that a mutation from GKT to AKT in HSV-1 UL15, the homolog of pUL89, was unable to complement a UL15 mutant virus (29Yu D. Weller S.K. Virology. 1998; 243: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), thus leading to the presumption that ATPase activity is important for herpesvirus maturation. Based on our observations we postulate that the energy for translocation of the concatemeric DNA to the preformed procapsids is provided by the pUL56-mediated ATP hydrolysis. Recently, a new class of anti HCMV agents (30Townsend L.B. Devivar R.V. Turk S.R. Nassiri M.R. Drach J.C. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4098-4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), benzimidazole ribonucleosides, were shown to inhibit HCMV DNA maturation via interaction with the viral UL89 (31Underwood M.R. Harvey R.J. Stanat S.C. Hemphill M.L. Miller T. Drach J.C. Townsend L.B. Biron K.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 717-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and UL56 (32Krosky P.M. Underwood M.R. Turk S.R. Feng K.W-H. Jain R.K. Ptak R.G. Westerman A.C. Biron K.K. Townsend L.B. Drach J.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4721-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gene products. In addition, analysis of mutants of pUL56 homologs of HSV-1, pUL28, and pseudorabies virus demonstrated that the deletion of the protein leads to nuclear accumulation of naked nucleocapsids and concatemeric DNA (10Adelman K. Salmon B. Baines J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3086-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Addison C. Ricon F.J. Preston V.G. J. Gen.

However, nothing was known to date about the function of pUL56. Our findings could now give an explanation for the prevention of packaging after deletion of the gene in pseudorabies virus and HSV-1. Protein deletion will lead to the loss of energy for translocation of the concatemers to the procapsids. In consequence the next step of packaging into the capsid and cleavage into unit-length genomes will not occur. This resulted in the accumulation of concatemeric DNA and naked capsids in the nucleus. Together with our former study (8Bogner E. Radsak K. Stinski M.F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we suggest that pUL56 (i) mediates the specific binding to pac sequences on the concatemers and (ii) provides energy for the translocation of the DNA into the procapsids. The role of the terminase subunit pUL89 during packaging of unit-length genome remains to be determined.

To characterize the surface regions of PSI needed for the correct binding of both donors, loop j of PsaB of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was modified using site-directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation. Mutant strains D624K, E613K/D624K, E613K/W627F, and D624K/W627F accumulated <20% of PSI as compared with wild type and were only able to grow photoautotrophically at low light intensities.

In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the multiprotein complex photosystem I (PSI) 1PSIphotosystem IcytcytochromepcplastocyaninEeinstein is a light-driven oxidoreductase that transfers electrons from the soluble lumenal donors plastocyanin (pc) and cytochrome (cyt)c 6 to the soluble stromal acceptor ferredoxin. The eukaryotic PSI reaction center is a membrane-bound complex consisting of 13–14 polypeptide subunits (1Chitnis P.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Depending on the relative availability of copper in the culture medium,Chlamydomonas can replace the type I copper protein pc with a class I c-type cyt c 6 (2Wood P.M. Eur. J.

The two large PSI subunits, PsaA and PsaB, which carry the photochemical reaction center, each contain 11 transmembrane helices, of which helicesk and m are connected by the lumenal loopj (Fig. 1). The 2.5 Å x-ray crystal structure of PSI from Synechococcus elongatus (4Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar) reveals that a part of the loop forms an α-helix l that is oriented parallel to the membrane close to the primary donor, P700. photosystem I cytochrome plastocyanin einstein In eukaryotic organisms, docking of the soluble lumenal donors pc and cyt c 6 to PSI depends mainly on two different recognition sites, which are: (i) negative charges on the surface of the donor attracted by the positively charged N-terminal domain of the PsaF subunit of PSI (5Farah J.

Klösgen R.B. Stahl B. Michl D. Huvermann B. Karas M. Herrmann R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1028-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of helix l is highly conserved among different species (Fig. 1). It is assumed that it could be involved in docking of the soluble donors (9Schubert W. Klukas O. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Sun et al. (10Sun J. Hervas M. Navarro J.A., De La Rosa M. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol.

Indeed, a double mutant (W622C/A623R) was strongly affected in the interaction between the altered PSI and the electron donors pc and cytc 6. In contrast to eukaryotic organisms, in cyanobacteria, efficient binding and electron transfer between PSI and pc or cyt c 6 do not depend on the PsaF subunit because the specific deletion of the psaF gene in cyanobacteria did not affect photoautotrophic growth (11Chitnis P.R. Purvis D. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20146-20151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thein vivo measured electron transfer rate between cytc 553 and PSI was the same as that in wild type (12Xu Q., Xu, L. Chitnis V. Chitnis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro measurements revealed that even at high concentrations of pc or cyt c 6 no difference in electron transfer rates could be measured between the donor proteins and PSI isolated from the wild type or the PsaF-deficientSynechocystis mutant (6Hippler M.

These differences can be explained by the absence of the specific eukaryotic N-terminal recognition site in the cyanobacterial PsaF protein that is required for the binding of pc and cyt c 6 to PSI (6Hippler M.

To elucidate the role of loop j and especially that of helixl of the PsaB protein in a eukaryotic system we performed a combinatorial site-directed mutagenesis approach taking advantage of a PsaB-deficient mutant of C. reinhardtii (14Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Of seven mutant strains, three allowed isolation of PSI sufficient for a further functional characterization. Electron transfer between the altered PSI particles and the donors pc and cyt c 6 has been investigated using flash-induced absorption spectroscopy. The results suggest features of the lumenal surface of PSI that are crucial for the optimized binding equilibria of both donors. Furthermore, differences between both donors in the recognition and requirements for a correct docking and electron transfer can be identified. The data presented here will be discussed in light of the new structural information available for cyanobacterial PSI (4Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii wild type and mutant strains were grown as described previously (15Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). Tris acetate phosphate medium and high-salt medium were solidified with 2% Bacto agar (Difco) and supplemented with 150 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) when required. Procedures for the preparation of recombinant plasmids and DNA sequencing were performed as described previously (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was used as bacterial host. The site-directed change of PsaB Glu613 to Asn and Lys was carried out in a single tube PCR as described by Picardet al. (17Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E., Lu, A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We used degenerated mutagenic oligonucleotide N (5′-CAATCCGATAA(C/G)TCGTCTACT-3′) together with two oligonucleotides X (5′-GGTGCTCTAGATGCTCGT-3′) and P (5′-ACCATTAATTAAAAGAGA-3′) complementary to the flanking regions about 150 bp upstream and downstream from the mutagenic site containing cleavage sites XbaI and PacI, respectively. As template DNA, we used pKR162, a kind gift from K. Redding containing the PsaB coding sequence and 5′-untranslated region and also containing an aadA expression cassette conferring spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance to C. reinhardtii(18Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into pBluescript SK, amplified in bacteria, andXbaI/PacI-digested. After gel purification, the fragments were then cloned into pKR162, replacing the original sequence. For the site-directed mutagenesis of PsaB Trp627 to Phe and PsaB Asp624 to Lys, we performed PCR using pKR162 as template, oligonucleotide X, and the degenerated mutagenic oligonucleotides F (5′-ACCATTAATTAATTGAGAAGTT(G/T)AAC(C/A)AT(C/A)GG(G/T)AGTCACGTAACCA-3′) or K (5′-ACCATTAATTAATTGAGAAGAGTTTAACCATAGGTA(G/C)TTACGTAACCA-3′), respectively, containing the PacI cleavage site. The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into pKR162 as described above. For double mutants, PCR was performed with oligonucleotides F or K and X and with previously generated mutagenized pKR162 vectors as templates. All mutations were verified by sequencing using the ABI310 capillary system. Chloroplast transformation in C. reinhardtii was carried out as described previously (19Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W.

M10 tungsten particles (2.5 mg; Bio-Rad) were coated with 2 μg of the appropriate DNA as described and finally washed three times with 500 μl of absolute ethanol and resuspended in 25 μl of absolute ethanol by short sonification; 7 μl of the suspension were used per transformation. ΔPsaB cells lackingpsaB were grown at 25 °C in liquid Tris acetate phosphate medium in the dark, and 4 × 107 cells were dispersed per Tris acetate phosphate plate containing 150 μg/ml spectinomycin. Once the plates were dry, the cells were bombarded with the DNA-coated particles. The bombarded cells were kept under low light (5 μE m2 s) for 2 weeks. The appearing transformants were restreaked on fresh Tris acetate phosphate plates containing spectinomycin and used for further investigations. The isolation of pc and cyt c 6 followed previously published procedures (3Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Kerfeld C.A.

To quantify the amount of PSI, wild type thylakoids were diluted with thylakoids from theΔpsaB strain (lacking PSI), resulting in fractions that contained 100%, 50%, 25%, and 0% PSI. Equal amounts of thylakoid proteins from these fractions and from mutant thylakoids were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using PsaF-specific antibodies to estimate the PSI content in the different strains. The blots were also probed with light harvesting complex II antibodies to verify equal loading. Cross-linking was performed as described in Ref. 21Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D.

The measuring light was provided by a luminescence diode (Hitachi HE8404SG; 40 mW; full width at half-maximum, 30 nm) supplied with a stabilized battery-driven current source. The light was filtered through a 817-nm interference filter (full width at half-maximum, 9 nm) and passed through a cuvette containing 200 μl or 50 μl of the sample with an optical pathlength of 1 cm or 3 mm, respectively. To investigate the role of loop j and especially that of helixl of the PsaB protein in binding and electron transfer of the soluble electron donors pc and cyt c 6, we performed a combinatorial site-directed mutagenesis approach. A plasmid containing the altered psaB and the aadA gene (encoding for aminoglycoside adenyl transferase) that can be expressed in the chloroplast to confer resistance to spectinomycin or streptomycin (18Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) was transformed into a PsaB-deficient mutant (14Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In total, seven different mutant strains were obtained after selection on spectinomycin-containing medium (TableI). In spot test analyses, we found that all generated mutants could grow photoautotrophically at low light intensities (Table I). Mutant strains D624K, E613K/D624K, E613K/W627F, and D624K/W627F died under photoautotrophic or heterotrophic conditions at light intensities equivalent to or higher than 60 μE m−2 s −1 or 700 μE m−2 s−1, respectively. In Western blot analyses of SDS-PAGE fractionated thylakoids using PSI-specific antibodies, such as anti-PsaD or anti-PsaF antibodies, the amount of PSI in these strains could be estimated to be <20% of the amount of PSI found in wild type thylakoids (Table I). For mutant strains E613N, E613K, and W627F, these estimations revealed that >50% PSI as compared with wild type accumulated in the mutant thylakoids. However, strains E613K and W627F died under photoautotrophic or heterotrophic conditions at light intensities equivalent to or higher than 700 μE m−2 s−1 (Table I). These growth phenotypes are comparable with the phenotype observed for the PsaF-deficient mutant. Mutant strain E613N showed a strong light sensitivity under photoautotrophic conditions and light intensities equivalent to or higher than 700 μE m−2 s −1 (Table I). The higher amounts of PSI in these three strains enabled us to isolate the altered PSI complexes and to perform detailed functional studies using flash-induced absorption spectroscopy.Table IGrowth properties of wild type, the PsaF-deficient mutant, and the ΔPsaB transformants with an altered PsaB protein on TAPaTAP, Tris acetate phosphate; HSM, high-salt medium; WT, wild type. and HSM platesStrains10 μE m−2s−160 μE m−2s−1700 μE m−2s−1PSI contentHSMTAPHSMTAPHSMTAPWT++++++++++++100%E613N++++++++−+>50%E613K++++++−−>50%W627F++++++−−>50%E613K/W627F++−+−−>20%D624K++−+−−<10%E613K/D624K++−+−−<10%D624K/W627F++−+−−<10%3bF (ΔpsaF)++++−−>50%1-a TAP, Tris acetate phosphate; HSM, high-salt medium; WT, wild type. Open table in a new tab The electron transfer from pc or cytc 6 to PSI isolated from wild type and mutants E613N and E613K was investigated using excitation by single turnover flashes. It should be noted that residue Glu613 is located in the inter-helical-loop region of loop j. Fig.2 shows the absorbance transients at 817 nm induced by a laser flash for PSI particles in the presence of 20 μm cyt c 6. In the cases of wild type and mutant E613N, the time course of the P700+reduction can be deconvoluted into three kinetic components (for wild type, see also Fig. 6). The fast component with a constant half-life of 3–4 μs and a variable amplitude A(1) reflects a first-order electron transfer, the rate of which is independent of the concentration of the donor proteins. This phase can be explained by an electron transfer reaction within a preformed complex between the donor and PSI. The half-time of the fast phase, which was also identified in the kinetics of P700+ reduction using pc as electron donor (data not shown), is found to be the same for wild type and mutant E613N PSI. The intermediate component with an amplitude A(2) shows a half-life that decreases with increasing concentration of reduced donor protein, as known for second-order reactions between soluble reactants (see Fig.3). Amplitude A(1) increases with increasing concentration of reduced donor protein at the expense of A(2) (see Fig. 3). The third very slow component with an amplitude of about 25 and 40% of the total signal for PSI isolated from wild type and mutant E613N, respectively, has an electron transfer rate constant in the range of 7–9 × 105m−1 s−1 for pc or cytc 6, which is comparable with the values found for electron transfer between both donors and PSI from the PsaF-deficient mutant under similar conditions (21Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the case of mutant E613K, the time course of the P700+ reduction can be deconvoluted into only one kinetic component, with a second-order rate constant of about 5 × 105m−1 s−1, which is again comparable with the values found for electron transfer between both donors and PSI from the PsaF-deficient mutant. Therefore, the very slow electron transfer between mutant PSI E613K and cytc 6 or pc (Fig. 2, TableII) indicates that binding and electron transfer are independent of PsaF in this mutant.Figure 6Mutation of Trp627 to Phe in PsaB abolishes complex formation of PSI with pc but not with cyt c 6.

The relative amplitudes and half-times of the different kinetic components were as follows: for wild type, A(1) = 0.25 and 0.24 with t12(1) = 3.5 × 10−6 s, A(2) = 0.4 and 0.54 with t12(2) = 6.7 × 10−5 s and 2 × 10−4 s, and A(3) = 0.35 and 0.22 with t12(3) = 1.5 × 10−1 s and 3 × 10−2 s for pc and cyt c 6, respectively, and for mutant PSI W627F, a two exponential decay for pc with A(1) = 0.2 with t12(1) = 6 × 10−4 s, A(2) = 0.73 with t12(2) = 3.4 × 10−1 s, and a triphasic decay with A(1) = 0.09 with t12(1) = 3 × 10−5 s, A(2) = 0.24 with t12(2) = 3.5 × 10−4 s, and A(3) = 0.67 with t12(3) = 1.1 × 10−1s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Determination of the kinetic constants for the electron transfer between mutant PSI PsaB E613N and the two electron donors.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar. For further analysis of PsaF-dependent functional electron transfer, we will consider mainly the two kinetic components A(1) and A(2). Drepper et al. (27Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) described a kinetic model for the binding and electron transfer between pc and PSI that also takes into account the redox equilibrium of the electron transfer. In this model, a simple dissociation equilibrium of the complex between the reduced donor protein ([D]) and PSI was used to describe the concentration dependence of the amplitude A(1). An estimate of the dissociation constant (K D ) can be determined using the following equation: A1=f×[D]([D]+KD)Equation 1 where f represents an empirical factor (f < 1) that relates amplitude A(1) observed after the flash to the fraction of PSI in a complex with the reduced donor before the flash (27Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Eq.1 indicates that the relative amplitude A(1) has a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration [D],i.e. shows a half-maximum saturation at a donor protein concentration equal to K D and approaches a maximum value f at infinite concentration. The amplitude of the fast phases of P700+ reduction for kinetic experiments performed with PSI isolated from mutant E613N with various concentrations of pc and cyt c 6 is displayed in Fig. 3 A. The data points can be analyzed by a hyperbolic curve according to Eq. 1. As a result, dissociation constants and the values of f are obtained for pc and cytc 6 as summarized in Table II. Because the concentration of pc and cyt c 6exceeds that of P700 by >1 order of magnitude, the kinetic component A(2) follows an exponential time course. The plots of its rate constant, k = ln2/ t12,versus the donor concentration can be approximated by linear dependences throughout the concentration range used in the experiments (Fig. 3 B). The second-order rate constant,k 2 = ln2/( t12 × [D]), can be determined from the slope of the regression lines in Fig. 3 B. The results for the reactions of cytc 6 and pc with this mutant (E613N PSI) and with wild type PSI are summarized in Table II. The dissociation constants of 29 and 7.7 μm as well as the second-order rate constants of 11 and 8.2 × 107m−1 s−1 for pc and cytc 6, respectively, are significantly smaller for mutant PSI E613N than for the wild type (Table II). The determination of k 2 and K D values for binding of pc and cyt c 6 to PSI isolated from mutant E613N and the dissociation equilibrium of the complex, respectively, implies that the unbinding of the donors from altered PSI is about 3 times slower compared with wi"

Recent evidence implicates oxidants in cluster disassembly. We investigated H2O2-initiated Fe-S cluster disassembly in c-aconitase expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A signal for [3Fe-4S] c-aconitase was detected by whole-cell EPR of aerobically grown, aco1 yeast expressing wild-type IRP1 or a S138A-IRP1 mutant (IRP1S138A), providing the first direct evidence of a 3Fe intermediate in vivo. Exposure of yeast to H2O2 increased this 3Fe c-aconitase signal up to 5-fold, coincident with inhibition of c-aconitase activity. Untreated yeast expressing IRP1S138D or IRP1S138E, which mimic phosphorylated IRP1, failed to give a 3Fe signal. H2O2 produced a weak 3Fe signal in yeast expressing IRP1S138D. Yeast expressing IRP1S138D or IRP1S138E were the most sensitive to inhibition of aconitase-dependent growth by H2O2 and were more responsive to changes in media iron status. Ferricyanide oxidation of anaerobically reconstituted c-aconitase yielded a strong 3Fe EPR signal with wild-type and S138A c-aconitases. Only a weak 3Fe signal was obtained with S138D c-aconitase, and no signal was obtained with S138E c-aconitase. This, paired with loss of c-aconitase activity, strongly argues that the Fe-S clusters of these phosphomimetic c-aconitase mutants undergo more complete disassembly upon oxidation. Our results demonstrate that 3Fe c-aconitase is an intermediate in H2O2-initiated Fe-S cluster disassemblyin vivo and suggest that cluster assembly/disassembly in IRP1 is a dynamic process in aerobically growing yeast. Further, our results support the view that phosphorylation of IRP1 can modulate its response to iron through effects on Fe-S cluster stability and turnover.

As intracellular iron levels decrease, the [4Fe-4S] cluster in c-aconitase is disassembled, resulting in loss of c-aconitase function and restoration of IRE binding activity. This coordinated regulation of gene expression maintains a balance between iron storage and uptake. The mechanism by which cluster assembly and disassembly occurs in IRP1in vivo is not fully understood. In vitro, oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of c-aconitase causes the rapid loss of the solvent-exposed fourth iron atom (Fea), generating a [3Fe-4S] cluster and inactive aconitase (2Eisenstein R.S.

This and other observations have led to the suggestion that oxidants play a key role in Fe-S cluster disassembly in c-aconitase in vivo(2Eisenstein R.S. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation. International Thomson Publishing, New York1997: 157-216Google Scholar). Treatment of animal cells with nitric oxide or H2O2 results in an increase in IRE binding activity and decrease of c-aconitase activity (reviewed in Refs. 2Eisenstein R.S. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H.

IRE binding activity is also altered by hypoxia (23Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Toth I. Yuan L.

Hypoxia appears to stabilize the Fe-S cluster of c-aconitase, thereby causing a lowering of IRP1's IRE binding activity (23Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

Degradation of IRP2 slows in hypoxic cells, resulting in an increase in its IRE binding activity (25Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Whether hypoxia stimulates or inhibits IRE binding appears to depend on the contribution of IRP1 and IRP2 to the IRE binding activity of the cell (25Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IRPs appears to be another mode of regulating IRE binding activity. Both IRP1 and IRP2 are phosphorylated by protein kinase C (26Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Stimulation of protein kinase C activity increased IRE binding activity and transferrin receptor mRNA levels (26Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol.

Mutations at serine 138 to residues that mimic phosphoserine destabilized the Fe-S cluster of c-aconitase, increasing its sensitivity to oxygen (28Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15235-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results implicate phosphoregulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the process of Fe-S cluster disassembly in c-aconitase. In this study, we used wild type IRP1 and IRP1 Ser138mutants expressed in aco1 yeast to investigate Fe-S cluster disassembly initiated by H2O2. EPR of whole yeast cells revealed a pool of [3Fe-4S] c-aconitase in cells harboring wild-type IRP1 or IRP1S138A, which was enhanced by exposure of cells to H2O2. Our results suggest that ROS, such as H2O2, initiate Fe-S cluster disassembly in c-aconitase in vivo by causing rapid loss of the solvent-exposed Fea from the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Wild-type IRP1 and IRP1S138A accumulated as 3Fe c-aconitase in H2O2-treated cells, whereas the phosphomimetic IRP1S138D and IRP1S138E did not. These results support the view that phosphorylation at Ser138 enhances ROS-mediated conversion of c-aconitase to IRP1 by promoting more rapid and complete loss of the Fe-S cluster. The aconitase-deficient strain, 0615d (a, ura3–52,trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200, aco1, ade2, IDP2up), was used throughout this study (28Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C.

Strain 0615d with (0615d-a) or without (0615d) an IRE/luciferase reporter gene (29Narahari J., Ma, R. Wang M. Walden W.E. J. Biol.

IRP1-transformed 0615d and 0615d-a were maintained on synthetic complete medium containing 2% dextrose and lacking uracil (SD-ura) or lacking uracil and histidine (SD-ura-his) (30Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). The results presented are representative of observations made using both 0615d-a and 0615d transformed with the indicated IRP1. All cultures were grown at 30 °C. For treatment with H2O2, cell cultures were grown to midexponential phase. After collecting a presample, H2O2 was added to the remaining culture to the indicated concentrations, and cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed, and cells were washed twice with an equal volume of sterile water and either prepared for EPR analysis or for making cytoplasmic extracts. Yeasts expressing wild-type IRP1 or Ser138 IRP1 mutants were grown in synthetic complete media without or with H2O2. Cells were washed twice with a volume of ice-cold water equal to the cell culture volume and once with a volume of ice-cold 10% glycerol equal to one-tenth the culture volume. At this point, cells were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage until EPR analysis. For EPR analysis, cells were packed into quartz EPR tubes by centrifugation in a low speed tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C. Excess cell suspension buffer was removed, and the cell pellet was frozen by slow immersion in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra were recorded with an X-band Varian E112 century series spectrometer at a temperature of 11–14 K using standard methods. Conditions of spectroscopy were as follows: microwave power, 1 milliwatt; microwave frequency, 9.235 GHz; modulation amplitude and frequency, 5 millitesla and 100 kHz; time constant, 0.064 s; scanning time, 2 min. Each spectrum represents an average of four scans. Subtraction of one spectrum from another using SUMSPEC92 software (obtained from the National Biomedical ESR Center, Milwaukee, WI) was employed in order to eliminate signals from manganese and other signals common to transformed and nontransformed cells. Subtraction of the spectrum of untreated or H2O2-treated, nontransformed aco1 yeast maximally reduced background signals and revealed a clear [3Fe-4S] c-aconitase signal in the spectra of untreated and H2O2-treated IRP1-transformed aco1 yeast. The spectrum obtained with nontransformed yeast was unchanged by treatment of yeast with H2O2. Subtraction of the spectrum of untreated or H2O2-treated nontransformed aco1yeast from the spectrum of IRP1-transformed yeast yielded identical results. Preparation of yeast cytoplasmic extracts and aconitase assays were performed as described elsewhere (28Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S.

Cells from overnight cultures were washed twice with sterile water, suspended into sterile water, and serially diluted. Ten microliters containing from 2 × 102 to 2 × 105 yeast cells were spotted onto SD-ura-his plates, supplemented with or without glutamate and H2O2 as indicated. For growth analysis in liquid media, cells from a fresh overnight culture were washed twice with water and suspended in glutamate-free SD-ura media. Media were made iron-rich by adding 1 mmFeSO4 and 1 mm ascorbate to assist low affinity iron transport (33Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

IRE binding assays were performed as previously described (35Swenson G.R. Patino M.M. Beck M.M. Gaffield L. Walden W.E. Biol. Met. 1991; 4: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled transcript (8–10 fmol; 10,000 cpm) containing the first 92 nucleotides of rabbit ferritin L-chain mRNA (including the IRE) was incubated with 200 ng of cytoplasmic extract protein in 25 μl at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by a 10-min incubation with heparin (2.5 mg/ml). This amount of extract gave subsaturating IRE binding under these conditions. Free transcript was separated from bound by 4% native PAGE (36Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Quantitative determination of bound transcript was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. Earlier studies suggested that the level of c-aconitase activity in IRP1-transformed aco1 yeast was limited by Fe-S cluster disruption mediated by ROS produced during normal metabolism (28Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vitro, exposure of 4Fe c-aconitase to oxidants resulted in its conversion to 3Fe c-aconitase, which can be detected by EPR (2Eisenstein R.S. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Silver S. Walden W.

To investigate whether 3Fe c-aconitase was being generated in aerobically grown yeast, intact IRP1-transformedaco1 yeast were subjected to EPR analysis. Since IRP1 was expressed in yeast lacking mitochondrial aconitase, an EPR signal for [3Fe-4S] c-aconitase, if present, could be detected in IRP1-transformed aco1 yeast when compared with nontransformed yeast. The EPR spectrum of purified 3Fe c-aconitase is in Fig. 1 a, showing peaks at g values of 2.015 and 2.033, characteristic of 3Fe c-aconitase (20Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In comparison, the spectrum obtained with yeast expressing wild-type IRP1 was much more complex but did show a distinct shoulder at a g value of 2.033 (Fig. 1 b), which was absent from the spectrum of nontransformed aco1 yeast (Fig. 1 c). Subtraction of the spectrum of nontransformed yeast (Fig. 1 c) from that of transformed yeast (Fig. 1 b) left a weak [3Fe-4S] signal of oxidized c-aconitase (Fig. 1 d). The spectral peak occurred at the same g value and had the same characteristic line shape as that of purified [3Fe-4S] c-aconitase (Fig. 1, comparea with d). The major underlying signal was that of the tyrosyl radical of ribonucleotide reductase (40Chitambar C.R. Zivkovic-Gilgenbach Z. Narasimhan J. Antholine W.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4468-4472PubMed Google Scholar), which partially contributes to the peak created by [3Fe-4S] c-aconitase. The effect of the ribonucleotide reductase signal was to diminish the trough seen on the shoulder of the 3Fe c-aconitase peak (Fig. 1, compare a with d). Nonetheless, the [3Fe-4S] c-aconitase signal was readily apparent in the subtracted spectrum (Fig. 1 d). The existence of a pool of 3Fe c-aconitase in exponentially growing cells suggests that Fe-S cluster assembly and disassembly in IRP1 is a dynamic process in yeast. The results presented above do not distinguish between the 3Fe c-aconitase detected in aerobically growing aco1 yeast being an intermediate of [4Fe-4S] cluster disassembly or of Fe-S cluster assembly. To investigate this further, IRP1-transformed yeast were treated with H2O2 to attempt to induce cluster disassembly. Treatment of animal cells with H2O2 results in an increase in IRE binding activity, suggesting complete Fe-S cluster disassembly caused by this oxidant in vivo (41Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 42Martins E.A.L. Robalino R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The unsubtracted EPR spectrum of yeast transformed with wild-type IRP1 and treated with 6 mmH2O2 is shown in Fig. 1 e. The major effect of H2O2 on the unsubtracted EPR spectrum was to increase the signal at g value 2.033, which could now be seen as a distinct peak compared with the shoulder in the unsubtracted spectrum of untreated IRP1-transformed yeast (Fig. 1, compare e withb). The spectrum obtained with H2O2-treated nontransformed yeast was identical to the spectrum of untreated nontransformed yeast (not shown). Subtraction of the nontransformed cell spectrum from the transformed cell spectrum left a more intense [3Fe-4S] signal from the treated cells (Fig. 1 f). The intensity of this signal was 5 times that of untreated yeast expressing wild-type IRP1 (Fig. 1, comparef with d). This indicates that there is at least 5 times more 4Fe c-aconitase than 3Fe c-aconitase in IRP1-transformedaco1 yeast growing aerobically, assuming that the increase in intensity of the 3Fe signal induced by H2O2is due solely to conversion of the [4Fe-4S] cluster to a [3Fe-4S] cluster. Enhancement of the 3Fe c-aconitase signal in IRP1-transformed yeast was H2O2 dose-dependent at concentrations ranging from 15 μm to 6 mm, and was seen as early as 15 min after exposure to H2O2 (not shown). Mutation of serine 138 of IRP1 to aspartate or glutamate alters c-aconitase by making it more susceptible to inactivation by oxidants (28Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15235-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 3Fe c-aconitase detected by EPR in aerobically grown aco1 yeast transformed with wild-type IRP1 is probably generated from 4Fe c-aconitase by reaction with metabolically produced oxidants. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether the Ser138 c-aconitase mutants gave a similar 3Fe signal in vivo and whether the proportion of c-aconitase in the 3Fe form differed from that seen for wild-type c-aconitase. The S138A c-aconitase mutant displays sensitivity to inactivation by oxidants in vitro and functions as aconitase in vivo similarly to wild-type c-aconitase (28Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15235-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the EPR spectrum of untreated IRP1S138A-transformed yeast was similar to that obtained with aco1 yeast transformed with wild-type IRP1, with a distinct shoulder at g = 2.033 (Fig.2 a). A clear signal for a [3Fe-4S] cluster was left when the spectrum of nontransformedaco1 yeast was subtracted from the spectrum of IRP1S138A-transformed cells (Fig. 2 b). The intensity of this 3Fe signal also increased by about 5-fold upon treatment of cells expressing IRP1S138A with 6 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2, c andd). Although both IRP1S138E and IRP1S138D support aconitase-dependent growth of aco1 yeast, indicating that they are converted to c-aconitase in vivo(Fig. 4; see also Ref. 28Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15235-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), no signal for [3Fe-4S] c-aconitase was detected with untreated yeast expressing these IRP1 mutants (not shown). A weak signal for 3Fe c-aconitase, masked by a more intense signal for the tyrosyl radical of ribonucleotide reductase, was detected in cells expressing IRP1S138D after treatment with 0.6 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2, eand f). The 3Fe c-aconitase signal from IRP1S138D-transformed cells was evident as a shoulder superimposed on the tyrosyl radical signal from ribonucleotide reductase. The line shape of the signal in Fig. 2 f is dominated by the tyrosyl radical with the typical doublet split by 20G (40C"

We have previously demonstrated that one of the ATM substrates is Pin2/TRF1, a telomeric protein that binds the potent telomerase inhibitor PinX1, negatively regulates telomere elongation, and specifically affects mitotic progression. Following DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates Pin2/TRF1 and suppresses its ability to induce abortive mitosis and apoptosis (Kishi, S., Zhou, X. Z., Nakamura, N., Ziv, Y., Khoo, C., Hill, D. E., Shiloh, Y., and Lu, K. P. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 29282–29291). However, the functional importance of Pin2/TRF1 in mediating ATM-dependent regulation remains to be established. To address this question, we directly inhibited the function of endogenous Pin2/TRF1 in A-T cells by stable expression of two different dominant-negative Pin2/TRF1 mutants and then examined their effects on telomere length and DNA damage response. Both the Pin2/TRF1 mutants increased telomere length in A-T cells, as shown in other cells. Surprisingly, both the Pin2/TRF1 mutants reduced radiosensitivity and complemented the G2/M checkpoint defect without inhibiting Cdc2 activity in A-T cells. In contrast, neither of the Pin2/TRF1 mutants corrected the S phase checkpoint defect in the same cells. These results indicate that inhibition of Pin2/TRF1 in A-T cells is able to bypass the requirement for ATM in specifically restoring telomere shortening, the G2/M checkpoint defect, and radiosensitivity and demonstrate a critical role for Pin2/TRF1 in the ATM-dependent regulation of telomeres and DNA damage response.

However, A-T cells are defective in activating checkpoints at the G1/S, during S phase, and at the G2/M in response to ionizing radiation exposure (2Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

ATM is a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing DNA damage and is critical for genome stability, telomere maintenance, and induction of cell cycle checkpoints (2Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

For example, ATM phosphorylates p53 and thereby increases transcription of the Cdk inhibitor p21 and the Cdc2 sequester 14-3-3ς. Furthermore, ATM also phosphorylates Chks, which eventually leads to inhibition of Cdc2 activation. These multiple and redundant pathways have been shown to be involved in cell cycle checkpoint regulation (2Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

Both primary and transformed A-T cells have been found to have unusually short telomeres and chromosome end-to-end associations, and primary A-T cells show premature aging/senescence phenotype (24Rudolph N.S.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2659-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative ATM fragment in normal cells results in a decrease in average telomere repeat length (29Smilenov L.B. Morgan S.E. Mellado W. Sawant S.G. Kastan M.B. Pandita T.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2659-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Morgan S.E. Lovly C. Pandita T.K. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, ATM has been implicated in regulation of chromosome end associations and telomere nuclear matrix interactions (31Smilenov L.B. Dhar S. Pandita T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In yeast, deletion of ATM homologous genes TEL1 and MEC1 also leads to accelerated telomere shortening, premature aging, and the G2/M checkpoint defect (32Lustig A.J. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1398-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, yeast TEL1 partially substitutes for human ATM in suppressing ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis and telomere shortening in A-T cells (36Fritz E. Friedl A.A. Zwacka R.M. Eckardt-Schupp F. Meyn M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2605-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and overexpression of telomerase elongates telomeres and extends the life span of A-T cells (37Wood L.D. Halvorsen T.L. Dhar S. Baur J.A. Pandita R.K. Wright W.E. Hande M.P. Calaf G. Hei T.K. Levine F. Shay J.W. Wang J.J. Pandita T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ATM plays a crucial role in regulation of telomere maintenance and the G2/M checkpoint. However, overexpression of telomerase does not rescue radiosensitivity, telomere fusion, or cell cycle checkpoint defects in A-T cells (37Wood L.D. Halvorsen T.L. Dhar S. Baur J.A. Pandita R.K. Wright W.E. Hande M.P. Calaf G. Hei T.K. Levine F. Shay J.W. Wang J.J. Pandita T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of both TEL1 and MEC1 in yeast does not affect telomerase activity and still allows telomerase to act when the telomere structure is disrupted (38Chan S.W. Chang J. Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1240-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the primary function of ATM in telomere maintenance is not to regulate telomerase activity but rather to act on telomeres or telomere proteins (38Chan S.W. Chang J. Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1240-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicate that one of the ATM substrates in the regulation of telomeres and mitotic progression is the telomere protein Pin2/TRF1 (39Kishi S. Zhou X.Z. Nakamura N. Ziv Y. Khoo C. Hill D.E. Shiloh Y. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29282-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Pin2/TRF1 was originally identified by its ability to bind telomeric DNA repeats (TRF1) (40Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D. Erdjument B.H. Hanish J. Tempst P. de Lange T. Science. 1995; 270: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) or to bind the mitotic kinase NIMA and suppress its ability to induce mitotic catastrophe (Pin2) (41Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar,42Lu K.P. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Pin2 is identical to TRF1 with the exception of a 20-amino acid internal deletion but is 5–10-fold more abundant than TRF1 in the cell (43Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); they are likely generated from the same genePIN2/TRF1 (44Young A.C. Chavez M. Giambernardi T.A. Mattern V. McGill J.R. Harris J.M. Sarosdy M.F. Patel P. Sakaguchi A.Y. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For clarity, we will use Pin2 for the 20-amino acid deletion isoform and TRF1 for the 20-amino acid-containing isoform, as they were originally identified (40Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D. Erdjument B.H. Hanish J. Tempst P. de Lange T. Science. 1995; 270: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 41Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T.

A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and use Pin2/TRF1 for endogenous proteins. Overexpression of Pin2/TRF1 accelerates telomere loss, whereas dominant-negative Pin2/TRF1 increases telomere length, indicating that Pin2/TRF1 is a negative regulator of telomere elongation (45van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pin2/TRF1 interacts with tankyrase and Tin2, which modulate telomere metabolism (46Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 47Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Although Pin2/TRF1, tankyrase, and Tin2 do not directly inhibit telomerase activity (45van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 46Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 47Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we have recently demonstrated that Pin2/TRF1 binds a potent telomerase inhibitor, PinX1, which directly inhibits telomerase, shortens telomeres, and induces cells into crisis (48Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Pin2/TRF1 plays a key role in the regulation of telomere maintenance. In addition, we have shown that both the protein level and subcellular localization of Pin2/TRF1 are tightly regulated during the cell cycle. Pin2/TRF1 levels are increased in the G2/M (43Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pin2/TRF1 specifically localizes to the mitotic spindle during mitosis and affects microtubule assembly (49Nakamura M. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1062-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 50Nakamura M. Zhou X.Z. Kishi S. Kosugi I. Tsutsui Y. Lu K.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1512-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of Pin2/TRF1 induces abortive mitosis and apoptosis in cells containing short telomeres but not in those containing long telomeres (51Kishi S. Wulf G. Nakamura M. Lu K.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Pin2/TRF1 also plays an important role in mitotic progression. This is consistent with other studies linking telomere regulation to mitotic progression. For example, elimination or mutation of telomeres causes a Rad9p-mediated cell cycle arrest in G2 in budding yeast (52Sandell L.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), triggers abortive mitosis and apoptosis in Drosophila (53Ahmad K. Golic K.G. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or causes a severe delay or block in anaphase, displaying an anaphase bridge inTetrahymena (54Kirk K.E. Harmon B.P. Reichardt I.K. Sedat J.W. Blackburn E.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1478-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have also demonstrated that Pin2/TRF1 binds with ATMin vitro and in vivo (39Kishi S. Zhou X.Z. Nakamura N. Ziv Y. Khoo C. Hill D.E. Shiloh Y. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29282-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATM activated by DNA damage directly phosphorylates Pin2/TRF1 preferentially on serine 219 and also suppresses its ability to induce abortive mitosis and apoptosis (39Kishi S. Zhou X.Z. Nakamura N. Ziv Y. Khoo C. Hill D.E. Shiloh Y. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29282-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, point mutations in Pin2/TRF1 mimicking ATM phosphorylation completely abolished its ability to induce apoptosis, whereas replacing the ATM phosphorylation site with a nonphosphorylatable residue rendered Pin2 resistant to suppression by ATM (39Kishi S. Zhou X.Z. Nakamura N. Ziv Y. Khoo C. Hill D.E. Shiloh Y. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29282-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of Pin2/TRF1 results in phenotypes similar to those of ATM mutations, including accelerated telomere shortening (45van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 46Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 47Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 48Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), abortive mitosis, and apoptosis (51Kishi S. Wulf G. Nakamura M. Lu K.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ATM may inhibit the function of Pin2/TRF1 during DNA damage response. However, the physiological importance of Pin2/TRF1 in mediating ATM-dependent regulation remains to be determined. To address this question, we here inhibited the function of endogenous Pin2/TRF1 in A-T cells by stable expression of two different dominant-negative Pin2/TRF1 mutants. Both the mutants increased telomere length in A-T cells. More importantly, both the mutants reduced radiosensitivity and restored the G2/M checkpoint defect without inhibiting Cdc2 activation in A-T cells. In contrast, neither of the mutants affected the S phase checkpoint defect in same cells. These results indicate that inhibition of Pin2/TRF1 can specifically suppress telomere shortening, the G2/M checkpoint defect, and radiosensitivity in A-T cells and demonstrate a critical role for Pin2/TRF1 in mediating some aspects of phenotypes associated with ATM mutations. For stable expression of ATM, pEBS7 vector encoding full-length ATM tagged with FLAG or the control vector were stably transfected into parental A-T22IJE-T cells as described (39Kishi S. Zhou X.Z.

Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). After selection with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml) and limited dilution, multiple clones were isolated and checked for ATM expression by immunoblotting analysis with anti-ATM antibody (Ab-3) and anti-FLAG antibody (M5). For stable expression of Pin2 mutants, cDNA encoding Pin2-(1–372) and Pin2-(1–316) were cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector and stably transfected into A-T22IJE-T cells. After selection with G418 (1 mg/ml), GFP-expressed cells were picked up under a fluorescence microscope. Multiple stable clones were obtained with similar properties. To detect expression of GFP fusion proteins in the cells, trypsinized cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (BD PharMingen) for detection of the GFP fluorescence intensity of individual cells with nontransfected cells as a negative control or by immunoblotting analysis with anti-GFP antibodies. Telomere restriction fragment length was determined as described previously (48Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated and digested with restriction enzymes HinfI and RsaI (New England Biolabs), separated on 0.7% agarose gels (2 μg of DNA per lane). The gels were dried, but not completely, and then hybridized in-gel with a 500-bp telomeric DNA fragment labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by standard protocols, followed by autoradiography. Telomere FISH was carried out as described previously (39Kishi S. Zhou X.Z. Nakamura N. Ziv Y. Khoo C. Hill D.E. Shiloh Y. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29282-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were washed once in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated in 3.7% formaldehyde in TBS for 10 min at room temperature. These prepared cells were then denatured in a hybridization mixture containing 70% deionized formamide, 20 mm Tris pH 7.0, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 nm Cy3-labeled PNA telomere repeat probe (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) for 10 min at 80 °C. A hybridization was performed for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, DNA was counterstained with 0.5 mg/ml DAPI, and preparations were mounted in antifade solution (Vectashield, Vector Labs). Samples were observed using a fluorescence microscope, and digital images were recorded with a CCD camera. Quantitative fluorescence intensity of individual cells was evaluated by NIH Image software. To stain for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal), cells grown in dishes or on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde. The cells were then incubated with staining solution (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-galactoside, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS at pH 6.0) for ∼12 h at 37 °C, as reported previously (48Zhou X.Z.

Cells were rinsed in PBS, and the staining and cell morphology were determined under a microscope. Experiments were carried out according to previously published protocols (55Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A.

Briefly, 50% confluent monolayer cultures at logarithmic stage were irradiated, and after 14–21 days the resultant colonies were fixed and stained with 2% crystal violet in 50% ethanol and counted under a dissecting microscope. For cell cycle analysis, cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum, washed in PBS, and then fixed in 70% ethanol. After washing cells once with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, DNA was stained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) containing 250 μg/ml of ribonuclease A, followed by flow cytometry analysis (BD PharMingen) as described (42Lu K.P.

However, the role of PKC in agonist-induced PLD activation has been mainly investigated with a focus on the PLD1, which is one of the two PLD isoenzymes (PLD1 and PLD2) cloned to date. Since the expression of PLD2 significantly enhanced phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- or bradykinin-induced PLD activity in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of PLD2 in PC12 cells. Two different PKC inhibitors, GF109203X and Ro-31–8220, completely blocked PMA-induced PLD2 activation. In addition, specific inhibition of PKCδ by rottlerin prevented PLD2 activation in PMA-stimulated PC12 cells. Concomitant with PLD2 activation, PLD2 became phosphorylated upon PMA or bradykinin treatment of PC12 cells. Moreover, rottlerin blocked PMA- or bradykinin-induced PLD2 phosphorylation in PC12 cells. Expression of a kinase-deficient mutant of PKCδ using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of PLD2 induced by PMA in PC12 cells, suggesting the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of PLD2 mediated by PKCδ kinase activity in PC12 cells. PKCδ co-immunoprecipitated with PLD2 from PC12 cell extracts, and associated with PLD2 in vitro in a PMA-dependent manner. Phospho-PLD2 immunoprecipitated from PMA-treated PC12 cells and PLD2 phosphorylatedin vitro by PKCδ were resolved by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and compared. At least seven phosphopeptides co-migrated, indicating the direct phosphorylation of PLD2 by PKCδ inside the cells. Immunocytochemical studies of PC12 cells revealed that after treatment with PMA, PKCδ was translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where PLD2 is mainly localized. These results suggest that PKCδ-dependent direct phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of PLD2 activity in PC12 cells.

In this report, we show that PLD2 can be activated in PC12 cells by PMA treatment. Moreover, for the first time, we were able to demonstrate that PLD2 becomes phosphorylated in response to PMA treatment and that PKCδ mediates the phosphorylation-dependent activation of PLD2 in PC12 cells.

After removing the virus, cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated equine serum and 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were then incubated for 12 h in 0.5% fetal calf serum containing DMEM. PLD activity was assayed by measuring the formation of phosphatidylbutanol (PBtOH), the product of PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation, in the presence of 1-butanol as previously described (4Lee S.D.

The PLD2 was localized by autoradiography, excised from the membrane, and washed with deionized water. The piece of membrane corresponding to the PLD2 band was then incubated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mm acetic acid at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with water, and then with fresh 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Tryptic digestion was achieved by incubating the piece of membrane in 150 μl of 50 mmammonium bicarbonate with 10 μg TPCK-treated trypsin at 37 °C for 6 h, followed by the addition of another 10 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin and a second 6-h incubation at 37 °C. The tryptic digest was lyophilized, oxidized with performic acid, re-lyophilized, and then dissolved in 20 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (glacial acetic acid, formic acid (88%), H2O; 78:25:8973 v/v/v). Phosphotryptic peptides were separated on cellulose TLC plates by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the first dimension. In the second dimension TLC was performed inn-butanol:pyridine:glacial acetic acid:H2O (75:50:15:60, v/v/v/v). For phosphoamino acid analysis, the piece of membrane corresponding to the PLD2 band was dissolved in 6 n HCl and hydrolyzed for 1 h at 110 °C. The HCl was then removed by lyophilization, and the pellet dissolved in pH 3.5 buffer (glacial acetic acid:pyridine:H2O; 50:5:945, v/v/v). A mixture of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (1 μg of each) was then added. The 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis on 20 × 20-cm cellulose TLC plates. After electrophoresis the plates were dried, the phosphoamino acids were visualized by staining with 0.2% (w/v) ninhydrin in acetone, and the 32P-labeled amino acids identified by autoradiography. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed as described previously (30Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang I.H. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13621-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were grown on coverslips. After treatment with 100 nm PMA, cells were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated in blocking buffer (1% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-PLD antibody and 2 μg/ml anti-PKCδ antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies: TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100, the slides were mounted and examined under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY). It has been reported that PMA, an activator of PKC, stimulated PLD activity in PC12 cells (37Kanoh H. Kanaho Y. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that PLD2 was prominently expressed in PC12 cells (33Gibbs T.C. Meier K.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We confirmed the presence of PLD2 in PC12 cells using anti-PLD antibody (data not shown). Therefore, to investigate whether PLD2 is activated in PC12 cells upon PMA treatment, we used a PLD2-inducible PC12 Tet-Off cell line (4Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this case, recombinant human PLD2 protein is expressed under the control of an inducible tetracycline-regulated promoter. The removal of tetracycline from the culture medium thus results in increased expression of PLD2, which was verified by Western blot analysis using anti-PLD antibody, as shown in Fig.1 C. Treatment of the cells with 100 nm PMA stimulated endogenous PLD activity (+Tet) in PC12 cells, while the induction of heterologous PLD2 expression (−Tet) led to a further increase in PMA-induced PLD activity, indicating that the PLD2 activity had increased in response to PMA. The effect of PMA on the PLD2 activity was both time- and concentration-dependent. Activation of PLD2 by 100 nm PMA occurred within 5 min, and the PLD activity was saturated at 100 nm PMA in the presence or absence of tetracycline (Fig. 1, A and B). These data show that PLD2 can be activated by PMA in PC12 cells in time- and concentration-dependent manner. To confirm that PLD1 is also activated by PMA treatment, we created an inducible PC12 Tet-Off cell line, which overexpressed PLD1 in the absence of tetracycline. On checking the PMA-induced PLD1 activity in these PC12 cells, we found that the activity of PLD1 was also enhanced by the PMA treatment (data not shown). Next, we determined whether the PMA-induced PLD2 activation in PC12 cells was PKC-dependent. We used the PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Ro-31–8220 to detect any effect on PLD activity after PMA stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2, in the PLD2-overexpressing PC12 cells (−Tet) basal activity had increased, and furthermore, maximal PMA-induced PLD activation had also significantly increased compared with the control PC12 cells (+Tet), which do not overexpress PLD2. This indicated that the overexpressed PLD2 was responsive to PMA treatment. Inhibition of PKC by pretreating of the cells with GF109203X and Ro-31–8220, specific inhibitors of PKC, abrogated the PMA-induced PLD activity in the presence or absence of tetracycline. It has been reported that PC12 cells express PKCα, β, γ, δ, η, and ζ (43O'Driscoll K.R. Teng K.K. Fabbro D. Greene L.A. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and that PMA activates all PKC isozymes except ζ. To determine which isozyme of PKC was involved in the PMA-induced PLD2 activation in PC12 cells, we used two different PKC isozyme-specific inhibitors, classical PKC isozymes-specific Go6976 and PKCδ-specific rottlerin. As shown in Fig. 2, Go6976 had a slight inhibitory effect on the PMA-induced PLD2 activity (∼14%), while rottlerin strongly inhibited the PMA-induced PLD2 activity (∼69%), suggesting that PKCδ might be mainly involved in the PMA-induced activation of PLD2 in PC12 cells. To examine whether PLD2 is phosphorylated upon PMA treatment, we looked for PMA-dependent phosphorylation of PLD2 in PC12 cells. Lysates from [32P]orthophosphate-loaded control PC12 cells (+Tet and −Tet) and PC12 cells (+Tet and −Tet) treated with 100 nmPMA for 5 min were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLD antibody. As seen in Fig. 3 A, in the PLD2-overexpressing PC12 (− Tet) cells, PLD2 became basally phosphorylated during the initial incubation with [32P]orthophosphate, but more PLD2 became phosphorylated after PMA treatment. However, in (+Tet) cells, the amount of endogenous PLD2 was negligible (Fig. 1 C), we could not detect phosphorylation of endogenous PLD2 in (+Tet) cells (data not shown). To determine whether PKC mediated the PMA-dependent PLD2 phosphorylation in PC12 cells, we inhibited PKC activity by pretreating the cells with Ro-31–8220. We found that the intensity of the PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation was reduced to basal level by the Ro-31–8220 pretreatment, suggesting that PKC is indeed involved in the PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation. Next, we further checked which isozyme of PKC was involved in the PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation using the PKC isozyme-specific inhibitors Go6976 and rottlerin. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Go6976 slightly attenuated, but rottlerin significantly inhibited the PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation, suggesting that the PMA-induced PLD2 phosphorylation may be mainly mediated by PKCδ. Direct analysis of PLD2 phosphoamino acids proved that serine and threonine residues were phosphorylated. Pretreatment of rottlerin greatly reduced the PMA-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of PLD2 (Fig. 3 B). Next, we eluted32P-labeled PLD2 species, digested it with trypsin, and subjected it to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig.3 C). Multiple phosphopeptides were resolved from PLD2 before and after PMA treatment. Seventeen phosphopeptides (1–17) were either enhanced or created by the PMA treatment and pretreatment with rottlerin significantly reduced PMA-induced phosphopeptides, suggesting that 17 phosphopeptides from PLD2 after PMA treatment were the exclusive result of PKCδ kinase activity. We previously demonstrated that bradykinin activates PLD2 via PKCδ (44Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Ki"
https://openalex.org/W2148487326,"Streptolysin O (SLO), archetype of a cholesterol-binding bacterial cytolysin, forms large pores in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. We have recently reported that when a limited number of pores are generated in a cell, they can be sealed in a Ca++-dependent process. Here, we show that resealing is followed by the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from keratinocytes and from endothelial cells, both relevant targets for SLO attack. Production of cytokines by these cells was preceded by activation of transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB, which thus emerges as a common denominator of stress responses to various pore-forming agents, including alpha-toxin of Staphylococcus aureus and complement. Furthermore, we show that activation and cytokine release in response to an agent that forms a pore in the plasma membrane do not depend on paracrine effects, because supernatants of cells perforated by SLO did not activate bystander cells. The study provides definitive evidence that a transient transmembrane pore suffices to trigger productive transcriptional activation in a target cell."

In this study, we explored the ligand binding pocket of the Group III mGluR4 receptor subtype using site-directed mutagenesis and radioligand binding. The selection of 16 mutations was guided by a molecular model of mGluR4, which was based on the crystal structure of the mGluR1 receptor. Lysines 74 and 405 are present on lobe I of mGluR4. The mutation of lysine 405 to alanine virtually eliminated the binding of the agonist [3H]l-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate ([3H]l-AP4). Thus lysine 405, which is conserved in all eight mGluRs, likely represents a fundamental recognition residue for ligand binding to the mGluRs. Single point mutations of lysines 74 or 317, which are not conserved in the mGluRs, to alanine had no effect on agonist affinity, whereas mutation of both residues together caused a loss of ligand binding. Mutation of lysine 74 in mGluR4, or the analogous lysine in mGluR8, to tyrosine (mimicking mGluR1 at this position) produced a large decrease in binding. The reduction in binding is likely due to steric hindrance of the phenolic side chain of tyrosine. The mutation of glutamate 287 to alanine, which is present on lobe II and is not conserved in the mGluR family, caused a loss of [3H]l-AP4 binding. We conclude that the determinants of high affinity ligand binding are dispersed across lobes I and II.

The Group III mGluRs, which include mGluR4, -6, -7, and -8, are selectively activated by the agonist L(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (l-AP4; see Fig. 1). With the exception of mGluR6, which is localized postsynaptically in cells of the retina, the other Group III mGluRs show primarily a presynaptic localization (3Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wade E.

Based on these studies and the observation that mGluR4 and other Group III mGluRs display selectivity and high affinity for l-SOP, we have proposed that this phosphonated amino acid may be an endogenous neurotransmitter or neuromodulator at synapses expressing Group III mGluRs (17Hampson D.R.

The analysis of truncated mGluRs that contain only the extracellular amino-terminal domain has demonstrated that the glutamate binding site is contained within this domain of the receptor protein (18Okamoto T.

Earlier modeling studies based on structural similarities between mGluRs and a group of bacterial proteins known as periplasmic binding proteins, suggested that the amino-terminal domains of mGluRs possess a bilobed “Venus's flytrap” configuration whereby the ligand binds within a cleft between the two lobes causing a closing of the flytrap (21O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgerson H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of the mGluR1 (Group I) receptor subtype has confirmed this basic arrangement and provides a much more detailed picture of the binding domain of mGluR1 (22Kunishima N.

Despite the availability of the information provided by the x-ray structure of mGluR1, the molecular determinants that confer receptor subtype selectivity among the mGluRs are not known. Previous mutagenesis and modeling studies have identified residues embedded in the binding pocket that function as fundamental recognition sites common to all eight receptor subtypes (17Hampson D.R.

However, in addition to the complement of binding residues that are conserved in all mGluRs, an additional subset of amino acids in the binding pocket must be responsible for the unique pharmacological profiles of each of the three subgroups of mGluRs. The goal of the present study was to identify residues within the binding pocket of Group III receptors that mediate high affinityl-AP4 binding. To accomplish this task, we used a combination of molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and radioligand binding. l-AP4, l-SOP, (R,S)-α-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG),l-glutamate, [3H]l-AP4 (specific activity 49 Ci/mol), and [3H]CPPG (specific activity 15.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Bristol, UK). The three-dimensional structure of the proposed ligand binding domain of the rat mGluR4 receptor was formulated by homology modeling using the experimentally determined structure of the closed form of mGluR1 (22Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates were obtained from the Protein Data Base (PDB code, 1ewk). The QUANTA program (version 2000, Molecular Simulations Inc.) and the SYBYL program (version 6.7, TRIPOS Corp.) were used to view the model that encompassed the region from methionine 40 to tryptophan 508 of the rat mGluR4 sequence. The sequence alignment used to build the mGluR4 model is shown in Fig. 2. Backbone atom coordinates were assigned the corresponding residue coordinates from the crystal structure of the mGluR1, and side chain atom coordinates were based on maximal side chain atom fitting to the mGluR1 structure using the modeler software from within Quanta. Regions with insertions or deletions were modeled using known substructures identified by loop searching techniques; regions 1–39 and 125–147, which are absent in the mGluR1 structure, were not included in the model. Thel-SOP molecule was docked into the binding site of mGluR4 in an orientation corresponding to that observed for glutamate binding to mGluR1. The model was energy-optimized using a restrained energy minimization with additional constraints applied to the backbone regions based on the x-ray structure of the mGluR1 using the CHARMm force field. A steepest descent followed by a conjugate gradient method was used for energy minimization until the energy change per cycle was less than 0.0001 kcal/mol. The wild-type rat mGluR4a with a c-Myc epitope tag inserted between the amino acids histidine 38 and proline 39 (mGluR4a-cmyc-N) was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (19Han G. Hampson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10008-10013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The wild-type rat mGluR8a containing a c-Myc-polyhistidine epitope fused to the 3′ region was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (20Peltekova V. Han G. Soleymanlou N. Hampson D.R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 76: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An alternative version of the rat mGluR4a with a c-Myc-His epitope fused to the 3′ end of the mGluR4a cDNA was also produced (termed mGluR4a-cmyc-C). To delete the 3′ untranslated region of mGluR4a and fuse the c-Myc-His epitope, a PCR was performed on a 3838-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment using the forward primer (5′-CCG GGA GCT GAG CTA-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-TCC CCG CGG GAT GGC ATG GTT GTT-3′). The reverse primer deleted the stop codon to allow fusion of the tag and contained aSacII restriction enzyme site. The PCR product was purified and digested with AvrII and SacII, and the 766-bp product was gel-purified. For subcloning into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), full-length mGluR4a cDNA was digested withHindIII and AvrII yielding a 2.1-kb fragment that was gel-purified. The 766-bp AvrII/SacII PCR product and the 2.1-kb HindIII/AvrII mGluR4a fragment were ligated into the HindIII/SacII sites of pcDNA3.1- c-Myc-His vector. The resultant mGluR4a-cymc-C was sequenced from the 3′ end to confirm in-frame fusion of the c-Myc and His tags. The mGluR8a mutants K71A, K71Y, R75A, and several of the mGluR4a mutants including K74A, K74Y, K74N, K74Q, and H77Q were made using a cassette mutagenesis method. Briefly, the 1.8-kb KpnI fragment of mGluR8a and the 1.8-kb KpnI fragment of mGluR4a were both subcloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) and transformed into the CJ236 strain of Escherichia coli. Single-stranded DNA was isolated using the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were annealed to the single-stranded template and used to make double-stranded mutant DNA. Double-stranded DNA was transformed into DH5α E. coli (Invitrogen)-competent cells. Mutated cassettes were then excised from pBluescript SK− and ligated back into their corresponding vectors. All remaining mutations were made in mGluR4a-cmyc-C and produced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the wild-type mGluR4a 1.8-kbKpnI cassette in pBluescript SK− as a template. Briefly, two complementary oligonucleotides (31–34 bases) contained the desired base pair changes in the center of the oligos. The mGluR4a cassette was amplified using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) for 12–16 cycles in a programmable thermal controller (MJ Research Inc.). Digestion of template (nonmutated) DNA was accomplished with DpnI, and the resultant muted DNA was transformed into DH5α E. coli-competent cells. The amplified DNA was digested with transformed into E. coli DH5α-competent cells. All resultant mutated KpnI cassettes were sequenced via automatic sequencing on a LiCor LongReadIR sequencer prior to subcloning back into the full-length expression vector. Transient transfections of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293-TSA-201 cells were conducted using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol as described previously (19Han G. Hampson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10008-10013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium with 6% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All experiments were conducted on cells or membranes collected 48 h after transfection. The membrane preparation and the [3H]l-AP4 and [3H]CPPG radioligand binding assays were carried out as described previously (26Eriksen L. Thomsen C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3279-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Naples M.A. Hampson D.R. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells transiently transfected were harvested 48 h post-transfection and pelleted by centrifugation (3,840 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Pelleted cells were suspended in 20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (30 mm HEPES, 5 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Polytron prior to centrifugation (48,400 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The cell pellets were resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 0.08% Triton X-100 and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Following incubation, an additional 15 ml of lysis buffer was added, and the membranes were recentrifuged at 48,400 ×g for 15 min. Cell membranes were washed by resuspension in 15 ml of assay buffer (30 mm HEPES, 110 mmNaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2·6 H2O, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0), centrifuged (48,400 × g, 15 min), and homogenized in 1–5 ml of assay buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using a kit from Bio-Rad. All membranes were diluted in assay buffer to a final concentration of 0.625 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C. For radioligand binding, frozen membranes were thawed and homogenized using a Polytron. 125 μg of membrane protein was used for all binding assays in a final volume of 250 μl. All assays were performed on ice using either 20 nm [3H]CPPG or 30 nm[3H]l-AP4; nonspecific binding of these ligands to cell membranes was defined as binding in the presence of 300 μml-SOP. Following a 30-min incubation, bound and free radioligand were separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 4 min). The membranes were washed with cold assay buffer and solubilized overnight in 1 m NaOH. The solubilized pellets were counted using standard liquid scintillation counting techniques, and all data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 3.0. The procedures for immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (28Pickering D.S. Taverna F.A. Salter M.W. Hampson D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12090-12094Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis samples containing 100 mm dithiothreitol were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min prior to gel electrophoresis. For immunocytochemical analyses, HEK cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice at 48 h post-transfection and fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 10 min at 25 °C. The cells were air-dried for 15 min and then incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 25 °C. The cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with the anti-mGluR4a antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted to a final concentration of 0.15 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The primary antibody was then removed, and the cells were washed five times for 5 min each with PBS. After washing, the cells were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, B0529) diluted to a final concentration of 2.75 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After incubation, the cells were washed five times for 5 min each with PBS and treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma, E-2761) diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min at 25 °C in the dark; the cells were washed four times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted with 50% glycerol solution in PBS, and photographed with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV microscope equipped with a 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filter at a magnification of 400× using Kodak Tmax 400 film. An amino acid sequence alignment of a portion of the amino-terminal domain of the mGluRs is shown in Fig. 2. The amino acids targeted for mutagenesis are shown in bold; a total of 14 single and 2 double mutants were generated and characterized (TableI). The rationale for the choice of mutations was based on the homology model of mGluR4 (see below), which was in turn based on the crystal structure of mGluR1. All of the mutants analyzed were made in residues located within the region encompassing the putative glutamate binding pocket. The results of immunoblotting and radioligand binding experiments conducted at a single concentration of [3H]l-AP4 indicated that several of the mutant receptors were expressed at levels similar to that of wild-type rat mGluR4a (Fig.3). Further analysis based on radioligand binding competition experiments defined a class of mutants that were expressed at levels similar to the wild-type mGluR4a and showed no major changes in the affinity for l-AP4. This set of “no substantial effect” mutants included K74A, K74N, K74Q, H77Q, G158A, K317A, and K74A/R258A (Fig. 3 and Table I). “No substantial effect” was defined as mutants showing less than a 2-fold change in affinity compared with the wild-type receptor.Table ImGluR4 mutants generated and characterizedmGluR4 mutationIC50Equivalent residue in mGluR1LobemGluR4a0.420 ± 0.20 K74A0.488 ± 0.29Tyr74I K74YTyr74I K74N0.422 ± 0.25Tyr74I K74Q0.644 ± 0.09Tyr74I H77Q0.643 ± 0.33Gln77I G158A0.508 ± 0.24Ser164ImGluR4a-cmycC0.351 ± 0.13 D202A0.476 ± 0.15Asp208II Y230A0.328 ± 0.07Tyr236II R258A0.231 ± 0.03Ser263II N286A0.285 ± 0.16Glu292II E287AGly293II D312A0.445 ± 0.15Asp318II K317A0.330 ± 0.14Arg323II K405ALys409IIK74A/K317ATyr74/Arg323I and IIK74A/R258A0.266 ± 0.04Tyr74/Arg258I and IIFor mutagenesis, the wild-type amino acid was converted to the neutral amino acid alanine, or mutations were made to mimic another subtype of mGluR. These included K74Y, K74Q, and K74N to mimic mGluR1, mGluR6, and mGluR7, respectively.

Another subset of mutants that included D202A, Y230A, R258A, N286A, and D312A displayed expression levels that were slightly to moderately lower than that of the wild-type receptor. The lower level of protein expression seen on immunoblots was reflected in the level of [3H]l-AP4 binding (Fig. 3). However, this set of mutants also did not show major changes in the IC50values compared with the wild-type receptor in autocompetition experiments using radiolabeled and unlabeled l-AP4 (TableI). The absence of effect of the tyrosine 230 to alanine mutation indicates that a possible cation-pi interaction between the phenyl group of the tyrosine and the amino group of the bound ligand, as suggested for mGluR1 (22Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), is not critical for the binding of ligands to Group III mGluRs. The most interesting class of mutants comprised those that showed levels of protein expression on immunoblots similar to or slightly lower than that of the wild-type receptor but with drastic reductions in the level of [3H]l-AP4 binding. These included K74Y, E287A, K405A, and the K74A/K317A double mutant, which showed 7.6, 4.5, 1.9, and 3.8%, respectively, of wild-type binding (Fig. 3). Lysine 405, located on lobe I, is conserved in all eight mGluRs. Thus, this amino acid is likely essential for ligand binding to all members of the mGluR family. In contrast, lysine 74 on lobe I and glutamate 287 and lysine 317 on lobe II are not conserved in the mGluR family and therefore are likely not fundamental ligand recognition motifs; these amino acids may contribute to subgroup selective ligand binding. Lysine 74 was mutated to several different amino acids; mutation to the neutral alanine or to glutamine, which mimics mGluR6, or to asparagine, which mimics mGluR7 at this position, did not affect the pharmacological profile (Table I). In contrast, mutation of lysine 74 to tyrosine, which mimics mGluR1 at this position, resulted in a great loss of binding (Fig. 3). The observations on the series of mutations of lysine 74 in mGluR4 prompted us to confirm these results in the mGluR8 receptor, which is 71% identical to mGluR4 in the amino-terminal domain. Consistent with the results in mGluR4, mutation of lysine 71 to tyrosine in mGluR8 (lysine 71 in mGluR8 is analogous to lysine 74 in mGluR4) induced a sharp decline in the level of [3H]l-AP4 binding (Fig. 4, A andB). In contrast, mutation of this residue to alanine increased the amount of binding to mGluR8; this was reflected as a nonsignificant increase in the affinity for [3H]l-AP4 (Fig. 4 C). In addition to lysine 71, arginine 75 in mGluR8 was also mutated to alanine; the analogous residues in mGluR1 and mGluR4 (arginine 78, see Table I) have been shown to be essential for ligand binding to these receptors (17Hampson D.R.

Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Bräuner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 397: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As seen with mGluR4, mutation of this critical arginine in mGluR8 virtually eliminated [3H]l-AP4 binding. The effects of these mutations on the binding of the phosphonophenylglycine antagonist [3H]CPPG to mGluR8 were also investigated. At low nanomolar concentrations, [3H]CPPG can be used as a selective probe for mGluR8 (27Naples M.A. Hampson D.R. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As observed with [3H]l-AP4 binding, the R75A mGluR8 mutant also showed a large reduction in [3H]CPPG binding (Fig. 4 B). However, in contrast to the absence of any significant change in affinity in [3H]l-AP4 binding to the K71A mGluR8 mutant, the affinity of [3H]CPPG for K71A was ∼4-fold lower than for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4 C). The lack of effect on [3H]l-AP4 binding combined with the 4-fold reduction in affinity of the mGluR8 K71A for [3H]CPPG, suggests the possibility that the longer length of the CPPG molecule compared with L-AP4 may place the terminal phosphonate group of CPPG in a better position for making an interaction with the side chain of lysine 71 in mGluR8 as compared with the analogous lysine 74 in mGluR4.

Similarly to other GTP-binding proteins, the structural changes in the P loop and the Mg2+ binding site are known to be important for nucleotide release from EF-Tu. In the present paper, we determine the contribution of the contacts between helix D of EF-Tu at the base side of the nucleotide and the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts to the catalysis. The rate constants of the multistep reaction betweenEscherichia coli EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and GDP were determined by stopped-flow kinetic analysis monitoring the fluorescence of either Trp-184 in EF-Tu or mant-GDP. Mutational analysis shows that contacts between helix D of EF-Tu and the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts are important for both complex formation and the acceleration of GDP dissociation. The kinetic results suggest that the initial contact of EF-Ts with helix D of EF-Tu weakens binding interactions around the guanine base, whereas contacts of EF-Ts with the phosphate binding side that promotes the release of the phosphate moiety of GDP appear to take place later. This “base-side-first” mechanism of guanine nucleotide release resembles that found for Ran·RCC1 and differs from mechanisms described for other GTPase·GEF complexes where interactions at the phosphate side of the nucleotide are released first.

Although the architecture of the two complexes is distinctly different, as only one molecule of EF-Ts is found in the E. coli complex compared with an EF-Ts dimer in T. thermophilus, the interaction interface between EF-Tu and EF-Ts is remarkably similar in the two complexes. The G domain of EF-Tu contacts the subdomain N, the N-terminal domain, and the C-terminal module of EF-Ts (helix 13), whereas domain 3 of EF-Tu is bound to subdomain C of the EF-Ts core (1Kawashima T.

A movement of helix D in EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex may move residues Lys-136 and Asn-138 of EF-Tu, which are involved in interactions with the ribose and the guanine base, away from the nucleotide binding site, thereby relaxing the interactions with the base (1Kawashima T.

Mutations of K9A/R12A and M19E/M20E in the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts abolished the factor-dependent nucleotide release from EF-Tu, whereas a more neutral replacement M19A/M20A decreased the stability of the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex 8-fold (5Zhang Y.

The contribution of the interactions of the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts to the mechanism of nucleotide exchange in EF-Tu has yet to be studied.On the side of EF-Tu, the interaction between helix D (residues 144–161) and the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts involves Leu-145, Leu-148, Val-149, and Glu-152 (1Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In the present work, we have performed alanine replacements at positions in helix D of E. coli EF-Tu that are located in the vicinity of EF-Ts in the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex or are directly involved in the intermolecular contacts, Leu-145, Leu-148, Met-151, Glu-152, and Glu-155; a residue at the beginning of the helix, Glu-144, was replaced with glycine. The effects of the mutations on EF-Ts binding and GDP release were studied. The reaction mechanism, which is shown in SchemeFS1, was analyzed using experimental approaches described recently for the wild-type EF-Tu (6Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V.

Fluorescence changes were monitored either upon direct excitation or upon indirect excitation via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the single tryptophan in EF-Tu, Trp-184, to the mant group. Trp-184 is located in the G domain of EF-Tu at a distance of about 20–25 Å from the mant group, allowing efficient energy transfer to mant-GDP bound to EF-Tu. To study the binding of EF-Tu to EF-Ts, we monitored the fluorescence of Trp-184, which has an increased mobility and solvent accessibility in the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex compared with EF-Tu·GDP (7Jameson D.M.

Mutations of K9A/R12A and M19E/M20E in the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts abolished the factor-dependent nucleotide release from EF-Tu, whereas a more neutral replacement M19A/M20A decreased the stability of the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex 8-fold (5Zhang Y. Sun V. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21956-21963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The contribution of the interactions of the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts to the mechanism of nucleotide exchange in EF-Tu has yet to be studied. On the side of EF-Tu, the interaction between helix D (residues 144–161) and the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts involves Leu-145, Leu-148, Val-149, and Glu-152 (1Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In the present work, we have performed alanine replacements at positions in helix D of E. coli EF-Tu that are located in the vicinity of EF-Ts in the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex or are directly involved in the intermolecular contacts, Leu-145, Leu-148, Met-151, Glu-152, and Glu-155; a residue at the beginning of the helix, Glu-144, was replaced with glycine. The effects of the mutations on EF-Ts binding and GDP release were studied. The reaction mechanism, which is shown in SchemeFS1, was analyzed using experimental approaches described recently for the wild-type EF-Tu (6Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 4: 162-169Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding and dissociation were studied using a derivative of GDP carrying the fluorescent methylanthraniloyl group, mant-GDP/GTP. Fluorescence changes were monitored either upon direct excitation or upon indirect excitation via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the single tryptophan in EF-Tu, Trp-184, to the mant group. Trp-184 is located in the G domain of EF-Tu at a distance of about 20–25 Å from the mant group, allowing efficient energy transfer to mant-GDP bound to EF-Tu. To study the binding of EF-Tu to EF-Ts, we monitored the fluorescence of Trp-184, which has an increased mobility and solvent accessibility in the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex compared with EF-Tu·GDP (7Jameson D.M. Gratton E. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our data reveal the functional role of the interactions between helix D of EF-Tu and the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts and show the relative contribution of the factors that are crucial for the nucleotide exchange. We thank Wolfgang Wintermeyer for critically reading the manuscript and valuable suggestions; Charlotte Knudsen for the plasmids coding for EF-Ts; Barend Kraal for the plasmid construct coding for EF-Tu; and Carmen Schillings, Astrid Böhm, Simone Möbitz, and Petra Striebeck for expert technical assistance."

A comparison with the structures of the PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains of SAP90 illustrates significant differences, which may account for the unique binding properties of these homologous domains. Within the postsynaptic density, SAP90 functions as a molecular scaffold with a number of the protein-protein interactions mediated through the PDZ1 domain. Here, using fluorescence anisotropy and NMR chemical shift analysis, we have characterized the association of PDZ1 to the C-terminal peptides of the GluR6 subunit of the kainate receptor, voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.4, and microtubule-associate protein CRIPT, all of which are known to associate with SAP90. The latter two, which possess the consensus sequence for binding to PDZ domains (T/S-X-V-oh), have low micromolar binding affinities (1.5–15 μm). The C terminus of GluR6, RLPGKETMA-oh, lacking the consensus sequence, binds to PDZ1 of SAP90 with an affinity of 160 μm. The NMR data illustrate that although all three peptides occupy the binding groove capped by the GLGF loop of PDZ1, specific differences are present, consistent with the variation in binding affinities.

Glutamatergic synapses express three types of ionotropic glutamate receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid, and kainate, which are responsible for the majority of excitatory signals in the central nervous system (1Seeburg P.H.

It is known that SAP90 binds the NR2 subunits ofN-methyl-D-aspartate receptors through the first two PDZ domains (16Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

SAP90 binds directly to the cytoskeleton via the microtubule-associated protein CRIPT (18Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg T.M. Craig A.M. Sheng M.

Recently, SAP90 has been found to modulate the electrophysiological properties of kainate receptors (23Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 24Mehta S., Wu, H. Garner C.C. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16092-16099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In particular, the KA2 subunit of the kainate receptor interacts with both the Src homology 3 and guanylate kinase domains of SAP90, whereas the GluR6 subunit binds specifically to the PDZ1 domain (23Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The last four residues of the GluR6 C terminus (E-T-M-A-oh) were shown to be responsible for the association. This motif presents a variation of the previously defined consensus sequence for binding to PDZ domains (e.g.T/S-X-V-oh) (5Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain consists of ∼90 residues and is the most abundant constituent of the superfamily of PSD proteins, to which PSD95/SAP90 belongs. The tertiary fold of PDZ domains typically exhibits a six-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel flanked by two helices (4Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 25Morais Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tails of the target molecules fit into a hydrophobic groove and usually form an additional β strand in the PDZ β-sheet (4Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). PDZ domains have been divided into two classes, according to the nature of their ligands. The first class binds the consensus sequence (S/T)−2 X −1(V/I/L)0, and the second class prefers the (F/Y)−2 X −1(F/V/A)0motif; the preference for the X −1 position, when present, is not easily generalized (5Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Usually the C-terminal carboxylate group of the target protein is directly involved in the binding and fits into the loop formed by the first two β strands of the PDZ domain (4Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 26Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct.

An alternative PDZ binding mode involves an internal motif, usually a β-finger, associating with the binding pocket of the PDZ domain. This has been characterized for the binding of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase-PDZ domain to the α-syntrophin-PDZ domain (28Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and to the PDZ2 domain of SAP90 (29Christopherson K.S. Hillier B.J. Lim W.A. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27467-27473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain of neuronal nitric oxide synthase inserts its C-terminal β-finger into the canonical syntrophin and SAP90 PDZ binding pocket, replacing the C-terminal tail of the receptor with a β turn. Here, we describe the structural features of the PDZ1 domain of SAP90. The conformation is compared with those reported for PDZ2 and PDZ3 of SAP90, illustrating important differences and similarities to these homologous protein domains. Using NMR chemical shift variation and fluorescence anisotropy, the association of the C-terminal peptides of GluR6, CRIPT, and the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.4 to the PDZ1 domain of SAP90 is characterized. The SAP90-PDZ1 domain was prepared by cloning a PCR-amplified DNA fragment encoding residues 60–150 of rat SAP90 into the NcoI/BamHI sites of pET 11d (Novagen). This construct contains a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, so that a 96-amino acid protein is produced. Synthesis of recombinant protein in BL21 (DE3)pLysS strain of bacteria was induced when the optical density reached 0.4 by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested and lysed by French Press as directed by the manufacturer (SLM Instruments, Inc.). The soluble SAP90-PDZ1 was bound to Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at room temperature with mixing, loaded into a column, eluted from the Ni2+-NTA beads using a step gradient of 50, 100, 250, and 500 mm imidazole (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, and then dialyzed to remove the imidazole. The15N-labeled protein was expressed in M9 minimal medium with15NH4Cl (0.5 g/liter). The purity of the 10-kDa protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Peptides containing the C termini of GluR6 (RLPGKETMA-oh), Kv1.4 (YKETDV-oh), and CRIPT (TKNYKQTSV-oh) were purchased from Tufts Medical School (Boston, MA). Additionally, all of the peptides were synthesized containing a fluorescein isothiocyanate-β-alanine at the N terminus. All samples for the NMR experiments were prepared at a protein concentration of 1.0 mm in an aqueous 10 mm phosphate buffer (10% D2O) with 150 mm NaCl at pH 6.8 (direct meter reading). The spectra were collected at 25 °C and 35 °C on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer using a triple resonance probe equipped with triple-axes gradients. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe (30Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Sparky 3 (as provided by T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California San Francisco). The sequential assignment of the1H and 15N resonances was obtained by inspection of three-dimensional HNHA, 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC, and 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC experiments as well as two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments. The NOESY-type experiments were collected with mixing times ranging between 80 and 120 ms, whereas both DIPSI and MLEV pulse trains were implemented for TOCSY experiments, typically for 40 ms. Titrations of the PDZ1 protein with peptidic ligands were performed by adding solid aliquots of the peptides to 300 μm solutions of the protein until saturation was reached. The 1H and15N resonance variations were followed at 35 °C by collecting HSQC experiments. Combined chemical shift perturbations were calculated using the following equation: Δppm=(ΔδHN)2+(ΔδN*αN)2Equation 1 with a scaling factor (αN) of 0.17 (31Tochio H. Hung F., Li, M. Bredt D.S. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interproton upper bound restraints of 2.2, 3.8, and 5.0 Å were obtained by sorting two-dimensional NOESY and three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC peaks according to their relative intensity. Pseudo-atom corrections were applied for methyl groups and for unresolved methylene protons (32Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Dihedral angles were constrained to reproduce the coupling constants measured in HNHA experiments using the Karplus equation. Additional dihedral angle restraints were obtained by backbone chemical shift analysis using TALOS (33Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Amide protons involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding were identified by inspection of the intensity of the amide/water exchange peaks in three-dimensional NOESY- and TOCSY-HSQC experiments. Hydrogen bond restraints were introduced, taking into account these data, the presence of secondary structure from chemical shift deviations from random coil values (34Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar), and the proximity of a donor based on the NOEs. Structures were calculated using the program CNS (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), employing a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol following previously published procedures (36Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 124: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Floating chiralities were used for the methylene and methyl groups resolved but not diastereotopically assigned. In the final minimization step, a force constant of 75 Kcal·mol−1·Å−2 was applied for distance constraints (including the hydrogen bond constraints), 200 Kcal·mol−1·rad−2 was applied for dihedral restraints, and 1 Kcal mol−1 Hz−1 was applied for coupling constants. A total of 100 structures was calculated. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1KEF). Steady-state fluorescence spectra were collected on a SPEX 1681 Fluorolog (Edison, NJ) spectrofluorometer using a 450-W xenon lamp for excitation and a cooled photomultiplier tube for detection. Polarized spectra were collected in L-format using Glan-Thompson polarizers (polarization > 200:1). Excitation spectra were collected by observing the fluorescence emission at 530 nm while varying the excitation wavelength between 450 and 500 nm. Emission spectra were collected by exciting the sample at 492 nm and observing the emission between 510 and 600 nm. Typically, an increment of 2 nm/s was implemented. The total intensity (S) and the anisotropy (r) were calculated according to the equations: S=Ivv+2gIvhEquation 2 r=(Ivv−gIvh)/SEquation 3 where I xy indicates the fluorescence intensity (signal/reference − background/reference) observed with the excitation polarizer in the x orientation and the emission polarizer in the y orientation. Correcting for lamp intensity fluctuations using the spectrometer reference channel had no effect on the anisotropy values. The emission polarization bias (g-factor) was calculated using horizontally polarized excitation (I hv/I hh). Changes in the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy in a system undergoing binding equilibrium can theoretically reflect changes in global or local rotational mobility or in fluorescence lifetime or quantum yield. If the fluorophore can exist in either a free form (F) or bound to the protein (B), the observed anisotropy is given by r=fFrF+fBrBEquation 4 where r F and r Bare the anisotropies of the free and bound forms. For the case in which quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore are not affected by binding, the quantities f F andf B are the fraction of the total fluorophore present in the free and bound form. The binding models used to fit the data were derived from the following equilibrium F+P=BEquation 5 and, in the presence of a competitor, C+P=DEquation 6 where F and B are the fluorescent states,C and D are the unbound and bound nonfluorescent competitor, respectively, and P is the unbound protein. For the case of Eq. 5, the equilibrium concentration of Bmay be solved for analytically in terms of the initial concentrations of the reagents from the quadratic equation below. B2−B(P0+F0+KD)+F0P0=0Equation 7 The solution to the simultaneous equilibrium of Eqs. 5 and 6results in a similar cubic equation, which was solved numerically using previously published algorithms (37Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1986Google Scholar). The latter model implies that the competition between fluorescent and nonfluorescent peptide is direct. Titration experiments were performed by adding the PDZ1 protein to solutions containing a fixed amount of fluorescence-labeled peptide, ranging between 70 nm and 7 μm. Competition experiments were also carried out by adding a competing nonfluorescent binder to a solution containing a fixed amount of both PDZ1 and a fluorescent binder (normally 100 nm for the fluorescent binder and 10 μm for the protein). These latter experiments are particularly useful for determining the binding characteristics of compounds with weak affinity, given that very high concentrations of fluorescent peptide or protein are not required. They also allow the anisotropy change associated with binding to be distinguished from other factors, such as changes in viscosity due to the addition of the protein. In all cases, the dissociation constant (K D) was obtained by fitting the experimental data with the appropriate equations derived from Eqs. Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7. A Marquardt-Levenberg global least-squares minimization package (38Hustedt E.J. Cobb C.E. Beth A.H. Beechem J.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 614-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) modified to include custom-written equilibrium binding and competition simulations was used for fitting. The 1H and15N resonances of the PDZ1 domain of SAP90 were assigned by standard methods using a combination of two-dimensional (TOCSY and NOESY) and three-dimensional (1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC) experiments. A representative1H-15N HSQC spectrum is shown in Fig.1. All of the backbone resonances were assigned, with the exception of the N- and C-terminal residues and the15N resonances of the prolines. Approximately 95% of the side chain 1H resonances were assigned. The experimental restraints utilized in the structure calculations are reported in TableI, together with the structural statistics for a family of 28 structures, shown in Fig.2.

The NMR-derived tertiary structure consists of two α-helices and six β strands forming an antiparallel, β-sandwich. The β-sheets are composed of four (β1, β6, β4, and β5) and three (β2, β3, and the N-terminal portion of β4) strands, respectively (see Fig.3). The angle between the two β-sheets is ∼60°, with the helices located at the corners of the sandwich. The loops interconnecting the secondary structure elements are relatively well ordered, with the exception of the β1/β2 loop, for which very few intra- and inter-residue NOEs are observed. The general folding of PDZ1 closely resembles the shape of the PDZ2 domain of SAP90 (31Tochio H. Hung F., Li, M. Bredt D.S. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In particular, the structural motif of the variable β2/β3 loop is very similar in the two molecules and seems to represent a unique characteristic of the PDZ domains of SAP90. Excluding the β2/β3 loop, the structural features of the PDZ1 domain observed here are similar to those of the functionally unrelated NHERF-PDZ1 domain, suggesting that this three-dimensional arrangement is widely preserved in nature. Closer inspection of the structure shows that the hydrophobic residues Leu7, Leu14, Phe16, Ile18, Ile33, Ile35, Val73, and Leu76, most of which are highly conserved, cluster together in the region between β2 and α2, forming the characteristic binding pocket of PDZ domains. A serine (Ser17) occupies the second position of the β2 strand, a position that is often important for selectivity in ligand binding (18Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg T.M. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar,31Tochio H. Hung F., Li, M. Bredt D.S. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The conserved His69 is located at the beginning of the α2-helix, with the side chain projecting toward the hydrophobic binding pocket. Similar to what is observed for the PDZ2 domain of SAP90, the side chain of an asparagine (Asn24) is in the middle of the β2/β3 loop in proximity to the side chain of His69 (31Tochio H. Hung F., Li, M. Bredt D.S. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the same loop, His26 represents another conserved feature, adopting a position similar to that of His182 of the PDZ2 domain of SAP90 and Asn102of the α1-syntrophin PDZ domain (28Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 31Tochio H. Hung F., Li, M. Bredt D.S. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In both of these other proteins, these residues are directly involved in the binding of their targets. Finally, positively charged amino acids are found at key positions at the beginning of the β1/β2 loop (Arg9), in the β3 strand (Lys37) just below the second position of the β2 strand, and at the end of the α2-helix (Lys77). The association of peptides containing the C termini of GluR6, Kv1.4, and CRIPT was examined. The binding affinity of these peptides for the PDZ1 domain was measured by fluorescence anisotropy using both direct titration of the fluorescein-labeled compounds and competition experiments (see Figs. 4 and5). All of the peptides display ligand-specific, saturable binding to the PDZ1 domain of SAP90. Importantly, the fluorescence intensities of the peptides are only slightly altered by the addition of the protein, indicating that the fluorescein is not directly interacting with the PDZ1 domain and therefore is not affecting ligand binding. Indeed, the x-ray structure of the PDZ3 domain of SAP90 bound to the C terminus of CRIPT indicates that the N terminus of the peptide is removed from the protein, projecting out into the solvent (4Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The affinities increase going from Kv1.4 to CRIPT to GluR6, with 1 order of magnitude difference between each (K D = 1.5, 15, and 160 μm, respectively).Figure 5Binding of the GluR6 C terminus peptide to the PDZ1 domain of SAP90 (80 μm), as determined by fluorescence anisotropy (K D = 160 μm) through competition with the unlabeled C terminus peptide of Kv1.4 (10 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The association of the PDZ1 domain of SAP90 with the C-terminal peptides was also monitored by NMR.

We have identified a residue in the extracellular aspect of the second transmembrane domain that converted picrotoxin inhibition of glycine α1 receptors from non-use-facilitated to use-facilitated. In wild type α1 receptors, PTX inhibited glycine-gated Cl− current in a competitive manner and had equivalent effects on peak and steady-state currents, confirming a lack of use-facilitated block. Mutation of the second transmembrane domain 15′-serine to glutamine (α1(S15′Q) receptors) converted the mechanism of PTX blockade from competitive to non-competitive. However, more notable was the fact that in α1(S15′Q) receptors, PTX had insignificant effects on peak current amplitude and dramatically enhanced current decay kinetics. Similar results were found in α1(S15′N) receptors. The reciprocal mutation in the β2 subunit of α1β2 GABAA receptors (α1β2(N15′S) receptors) decreased the magnitude of use-facilitated PTX inhibition.

Lynch J.W. Schofield P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In native tissue, glycine receptors exist as either α homomers or αβ heteromers (1Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Schofield P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). They comprise five subunits (usually three α subunits and two β subunits) arranged asymmetrically around the ion pore. Each subunit is made up of a large extracellular N-terminal region, four transmembrane domains (TM), and a large cytoplasmic domain; TMII forms the channel lumen (2Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc.

For example, the TMII of the glycine β subunit was found to be responsible for conferring resistance to picrotoxin in heteromeric glycine αnβ receptors (n = 1–3) (6Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has defined the existence of a phenylalanine residue at the 6′ position of the TMII glycine β subunit in conferring insensitivity to picrotoxin (16Gurley D. Amin J. Ross P. Weiss D.S. White G. Receptor Channels. 1995; 3: 13-20PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, other TMII residues (2′ and 19′) have also been implicated directly or indirectly in the mechanism by which picrotoxin inhibits these channels (13Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Bany P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15ffrench-Constant R.H. Rocheleau T.A. Steichen J.C. Chalmers A.E.

The mutations at positions 2′ and 19′ have been shown to affect the type of the inhibition (competitive versus non-competitive) by picrotoxin in GABAC and glycine α1 receptors, respectively (13Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Bany P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Wang T.-L. Hackam A.S. Guggino W.S. Cutting G.R. Proc.

This trait is generally referred to as a use-dependent or use-facilitated block and suggests that the site of action of the antagonist may be in the channel lumen. Whereas picrotoxin block of GABAC and glycine α1 receptors displays weak or no use-facilitation (13Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Bany P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Dong C. Werblin F. Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3997-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), picrotoxin inhibition of GABAA receptors and glutamate-gated Cl− channels is strongly use-facilitated (3Etter A. Cully D.F. Liu K.K. Reiss B. Vassilatis D.B. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Inoue M. Akaike N. Neurosci.

The molecular basis underlying this trait is unknown. Thus, we sought to determine the mechanism that confers use-facilitated blockade by picrotoxin. Because of its prominent role in picrotoxin action, we focused on the TMII domain as the probable region that would underlie the differing mechanisms of picrotoxin blockade. In our analysis of the TMII domain of Cl− channels of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, we observed that GABAA and glutamate-gated channels have neutral acidic polar residues (Asn and Gln) at the 15′ position; these receptors both demonstrate use-facilitated block by picrotoxin. Glycine α1 receptors, which do not display use-facilitated picrotoxin blockade, have a dissimilar residue (Ser) at the 15′ position.We demonstrate here that S15′Q and S15′N mutations in the TMII of glycine α1 receptors confer use-facilitated block by picrotoxin. In addition, the S15′Q mutation converted the picrotoxin block from competitive to non-competitive. This position also affects the mechanism of the picrotoxin blockade in GABAA receptors, because receptors expressing the reciprocal mutation (N15′S) in the β2 subunit of α1β2 GABAA receptors displayed significantly less use-facilitated block than observed in wild type receptors. Our data demonstrate the involvement of the 15′ position in the mechanism of picrotoxin block and suggest that PTX may be acting at two distinct sites in ligand-gated anion channels.RESULTSPrevious work has shown that mutations at the 15′ position affect glycine sensitivity to varying degrees (23Ye Q. Koltchine V.V. Mihic S.J. Mascia M.P. Wick M.J. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3314-3319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, we first examined the glycine concentration-response curve for the wild type, the mutant α1(S15′Q), and mutant α1(S15′N) receptors (Fig.2). The EC50 and Hill coefficient values for glycine in the wild type receptors were 44 ± 5.3 and 2.1 ± 0.5 μm, respectively. The substitution of the 15′-serine by glutamine caused a roughly 2-fold right shift in the glycine dose-response curve. The incorporation of Asn at position 15′ caused a dramatic rightward shift, roughly 15-fold, in the concentration-response curve for glycine. The EC50and Hill coefficient values for all receptors are summarized in TableI.Figure 2Glycine sensitivity in wild type and mutant glycine α1 receptors. Both mutations induced a rightward shift in the glycine concentration-response curve. EC50 values were 44 ± 5.3, 102 ± 7.6, and 670 ± 38 μm in wild type, α1(S15′Q), and α1(S15′N) receptors, respectively. See Table I for Hill coefficients.

Open table in a new tab S15′Q Mutation Confers Use-facilitated Block by PicrotoxinIn wild type α1 receptors, picrotoxin lacks the use-facilitated feature that exists in GABAA and glutamate-gated Cl−channels (13Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Bany P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We observed a similar lack of use-facilitated block in the present studies. As shown in Fig.3 A, picrotoxin inhibited the peak as well as the steady-state current induced by 200 μm glycine with equal potency in the wild type receptors. Picrotoxin did not increase the rate of current decay, even at a concentration of 3 mm. The introduction of the 15′Q mutation had striking effects on the picrotoxin blockade of the glycine receptor. Co-application of variable concentrations of picrotoxin (1–1000 μm) with 1 mm glycine in α1(S15′Q) receptors had little effect on the initial peak current but subsequently induced a time-dependent current decay to steady state (Fig. 3 B). In addition, increasing the picrotoxin concentration enhanced the exponential decay rate of the glycine-induced current (Figs. 3 B and4). The application of increasing picrotoxin concentration caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the time constant (t) of the current decay from 11.5 ± 1.0 s with 3 μm PTX to 0.23 ± 0.02 s with 1 mm PTX (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the time constant for the decay was inversely related to the concentration of picrotoxin. We also evaluated the effect of picrotoxin on the current induced by glycine in α1(S15′N) receptors. The conversion to use-facilitated block was evident in α1(S15′N) receptors as well (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the incorporation of Asn or Gln changed the mechanism by which picrotoxin inhibits glycine receptors. The α1(S15′Q) mutation had an effect on picrotoxin inhibition similar to that observed with the α1(S15′N) mutation, and had a lesser effect on glycine sensitivity (Fig. 2). Hence, the remaining experiments were conducted using α1(S15′Q) receptors.Figure 3Use-facilitated picrotoxin block conferred by the S15′Q and S15′N mutations.

Note that picrotoxin equally inhibited the peak and steady-state currents. B,a, response to picrotoxin in α1(S15′Q) receptors. Note insignificant effects on peak current and marked enhancement of current decay in this receptor, which are indicative of use-facilitated blockade. b, mean concentration-response profile for the effect of picrotoxin on initial peak and steady-state currents. Picrotoxin of up to 1 mm had minimal effect on peak current. C, similar use-facilitated blockade was observed in α1(S15′N) receptors (a), although the degree of use-facilitation was not as great as that induced with the S15′Q mutation (b). Calibration bar equals 360 pA in A, 285 pA in B, and 885 pA in C. See Table I for IC50 and Hill coefficient values.

A, rate of picrotoxin-induced current decay is significantly slower when the channel is gated by 100 μm glycine (a) than when gated by 1000 μm glycine (b), a trait consistent with use-facilitated blockade. B, the time constant (t) for use-facilitated block picrotoxin is inversely proportional to picrotoxin concentration. Decaying currents were fitted with a single exponential function. Note also the summary data for the experiment in A, illustrating a 5-fold enhancement in current decay kinetics by 100 μmpicrotoxin when glycine is increased from 100 to 1000 μm. All data points are from a minimum of three cells. Calibration bar equals 175 pA in Aa and 375 pA in Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next tested whether increasing the glycine concentration would increase the rate of the block by picrotoxin in α1(S15′Q) receptors. When the channel was gated by 100 μm glycine, 100 μm picrotoxin enhanced the glycine current decay rate to a time constant (t) of 4.7 ± 0.3 s (Fig.4 A). When the α1(S15′Q) receptors were gated with a saturating glycine concentration (1 mm), 100 μm picrotoxin caused a much greater enhancement of the decay of the glycine-activated current to a t of 0.87 ± 0.5 s. The enhancement of current decay with an increase in glycine concentration further demonstrates the use-facilitated nature of picrotoxin blockade in the mutant receptor.It might be argued that the mutation has affected the glycine activation kinetics by enhancing glycine binding and/or the gating transition. In this scenario, the data would not necessarily reflect a use-facilitated block but could instead be explained via an underlying alteration in the relative reaction rates for glycine and picrotoxin in the wild type compared with the mutant receptors. To test this possibility, we measured the 10–90% current rise time (t 10–90) in wild type and α1(S15′Q) receptors. The t 10–90 was not different in the two receptors (85 ± 17 ms (n = 5) and 127 ± 16 ms (n = 7) in wild type and mutant receptors, respectively). Thus, a change in glycine activation kinetics is not responsible for the presence of use-facilitated block in glycine α1(S15′Q) receptors.S15′Q Mutation Converts Picrotoxin Antagonism from Competitive to Non-competitiveA TMII mutation has been shown to convert the mechanism of picrotoxin blockade in α1 glycine receptors from competitive to non-competitive (13Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Bany P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The enhanced picrotoxin effect with increased concentrations of glycine as described above is suggestive of non-competitive inhibition. Thus, we assessed the nature of picrotoxin inhibition in both wild type and α1S15′Q receptors. In this report, picrotoxin inhibited the current induced by the glycine EC50 with an IC50 of 39 ± 6.0 μm. Increasing the glycine concentration (4× the glycine EC50) shifted the picrotoxin IC50 almost 10-fold to the right to 339 ± 40 μm (Fig.5 A), confirming the previous report of competitive inhibition in glycine α1 receptors (13Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Bany P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In α1S15′Q receptors, picrotoxin inhibited the current induced by the glycine EC50 with an IC50 of 54 ± 14 μm. However, when the channel was gated with a saturating concentration of glycine (1 mm), the picrotoxin concentration-response curve was significantly shifted to the left to 9.3 ± 1.5 μm (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the (S15′Q) mutation converted the mechanism of picrotoxin block from competitive to non-competitive. A summary of the effects of picrotoxin in the different receptor configurations is presented in Table I.Figure 5S15′Q mutation converts picrotoxin blockade from competitive to non-competitive inhibition. A, consistent with previous findings (13Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Bany P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), picrotoxin inhibition of wild type glycine α1 receptors is competitive. B, in contrast, picrotoxin-induced blockade in α1(S15′Q) receptors was converted to non-competitive inhibition.

Res. 1988; 5: 380-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, picrotoxin can efficiently access its site without channel opening in glycine α1 receptors (13Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Bany P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); we confirmed this finding in the present investigation (data not shown). We subsequently tested whether the S15′Q mutation affected the channel state dependence of picrotoxin access. Receptors were preincubated in 100 μm picrotoxin for 3 min. At the 3-min time point, glycine (1 mm) and picrotoxin (100 μm) were co-applied to the cell while still equilibrated in bath picrotoxin. As is evident from Fig.6, pretreatment with picrotoxin abolished the use-facilitated aspect of block (Fig. 6, n = 4). A similar effect was found when using 10 μm picrotoxin. Thus, whereas the S15′Q mutation clearly induced a use-facilitated picrotoxin effect, it did not prevent picrotoxin from accessing its site in the closed channel state.Figure 6Picrotoxin can access its site in the absence of the glycine application in α1(S15′Q) receptors. Following establishment of the control glycine current (1 mm) (solid line), receptors were incubated in 100 μm picrotoxin for 3 min. Picrotoxin and glycine were subsequently co-applied to the cells. The dotted linerepresents the presence of picrotoxin in the bath solution.Dashed line represents a 5-s co-application of picrotoxin (100 μm) and glycine (1 mm) separated by 3-s intervals. Similar results were obtained in four cells expressing the S15′Q mutation as well as wild type glycine α1 receptors (data not shown).

We next sought to evaluate the effects of the reciprocal mutation (N15′S) in GABAA receptors. The wild type GABAA receptor α1 subunit has a serine residue at the 15′ position. Co-expression of the wild type α1 subunit with the β2(N15′S) subunit yields a α1β2(N15′S) GABAA receptor with only serine residues at this position; thus, it is equivalent to the wild type glycine α1-homomeric receptor at the 15′ position. The N15′S mutation caused a 3-fold shift in GABA sensitivity (Table I). As expected, picrotoxin inhibition of wild type α1β2 GABAAreceptors showed strong use-facilitated non-competitive inhibition (Fig. 7 A). In α1β2(N15′S) receptors, blockade by picrotoxin was not completely shifted to that observed in wild type glycine α1 receptors. However, the magnitude of the use-facilitated block was greatly attenuated. In wild type receptors, increasing the GABA-gating concentration from the EC50 to 10× EC50 decreased the picrotoxin IC50 ∼8-fold. In contrast, in α1β2(N15′S) GABAA receptors, increasing the GABA-gating concentration had no effect on picrotoxin sensitivity. The results confirm the involvement of this residue in the mechanism of picrotoxin blockade of both glycine and GABAA receptors.Figure 7N15′S modifies picrotoxin inhibition of α1β2 GABAAreceptors. A, picrotoxin inhibits wild type α1β2 GABAA receptors in a non-competitive fashion. In these receptors, increasing the GABA-gating concentration from the GABA EC50 (1.5 μm) to 10× the GABA EC50 elicited a dramatic leftward shift in the picrotoxin inhibition curve. B, the mutation of the β2 subunit 15′ asparagine to serine completely abolished the GABA concentration dependence of the ability of picrotoxin to block the channel. However, the mutation did not fully convert the mechanism of picrotoxin blockade to competitive inhibition. See Table I for IC50 and Hill coefficient values under each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Glycine receptors belong to a superfamily of ligand-gated chloride channels that include GABAA1 receptors, GABAC receptors, and glutamate-gated chloride channels (1Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Schofield P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In native tissue, glycine receptors exist as either α homomers or αβ heteromers (1Rajendra S.

They comprise five subunits (usually three α subunits and two β subunits) arranged asymmetrically around the ion pore. Each subunit is made up of a large extracellular N-terminal region, four transmembrane domains (TM), and a large cytoplasmic domain; TMII forms the channel lumen (2Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2823-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).

The COOH terminus of E2 interacts with several proteins such as E1, TATA-binding protein, transcription factor IIB, and p53, suggesting that the COOH terminus of E2 also contains the receptor site for communicating with other regulatory proteins (14Benson J.D.

In this study, we show that (i) human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 interacts with p/CAF, (ii) this interaction requires residues 1–390 in the NH2 terminus of p/CAF, (iii) p/CAF strongly activates E2-dependent transcription, and (iv) p/CAF appears to be recruited to the E2-dependent promoter to the hyperacetylate promoter region in vivo.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-E2 expression vectors were engineered by PCR using appropriate primers. pCDNA3-p/CAF-(1–390) and pCDNA3-p/CAF-(352–658) were cloned into pCDNA3 using PCR products of amino acids 1–390 and 352–658 of p/CAF, respectively. Several glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused p/CAF proteins were cloned into pGEX4T-1 by the PCR method using appropriate primers. The pFR-Luc and pM plasmids were purchased from CLONTECH. Human embryonic kidney cell 293T and human cervical cancer cell C33A were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours before transfection, 3 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm plates. Transfections were performed either by the standard calcium phosphate method (19Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3507) Google Scholar) or by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The transfected plasmids were prepared by the Qiagen procedure (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted with pCDNA3 or blank plasmid DNA. Equal amounts of cell lysates were employed for the detection of luciferase (Luc) activity. Luc activity was normalized by protein concentration or galactosidase activity using Luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II from CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Radiolabled, in vitrotranslated proteins were incubated with GST fusion protein in T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH. 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, and this mixture were incubated on a rotating machine (Nutator) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed four times with T buffer, 5 × loading dye (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 14.4 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% bromphenol blue) was added, and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed to yield the cell extract using EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Incubation of the transfected cell extracts with GST or protein G (detecting for FLAG antibody) resin resulted in the co-precipitation of GST-18E2 and FLAG-p/CAF. The resulting precipitates were washed, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The GST-E2 fusion protein and FLAG-p/CAF were detected by Western blotting using anti-GST and anti-FLAG antibodies from Sigma, respectively. 293T cells were cultured on glass coverslips and transfected with calcium precipitation. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. The cell membrane was permeabilized by treatment with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and nonspecific antibody binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were treated with mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti-p/CAF polyclonal antibody at a dilution 1:1000 (anti-FLAG) or 1:200 (anti-p/CAF) for 2 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained with donkey anti-mouse TRITC 488 and goat anti-rabbit TRITC at a dilution 1:2500 for 2 h. The cells were washed, treated with prolonged mounting media, and the proteins were visualized using an immunofluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Micrococal nuclease digestions (0–0.64 units, Sigma N5386) were performed on purified nuclei for 20 min at room temperature in MNase digestion buffer (60 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction was terminated and DNA was extracted using phenol extraction. After proteinase K treatment and ethanol precipitation, DNA was treated with RNase A. p/CAF L606A was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis Stratagene kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Mutants was identified by automated DNA sequencing. ChIP assays were performed essentially as described in the Upstate Biotechnology protocol. Briefly, a 10-cm dish of 50% confluent 293T cells was transfected with 2 μg of p2 × 2xE2BS-Luc reporter plasmid, 2 μg of pCX-p/CAF, and/or 2 μg of pCG-18E2 plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were cross-linked and treated as per the protocol. After 24 h later, cells were cross-linked and treated as per the protocol. About 1 μg of each indicated antibody was used (anti-acetylated H3 histone). Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of water. To detect the precipitated plasmid sequence, 1–5 μl of DNA was used in a 100 μl, 22–30 cycles PCR with primers (for p2x2xE2BS-Luc, Luc5 (5′-ATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACAT-3′) and Luc3 (5′-CATAGCTTCTGCCAACCGAA-3′)). We previously reported that CBP interacts with HPV-18 E2 (18Lee D. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.W. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7045-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because p/CAF has a co-activator function independent of p300/CBP, we attempted to decipher whether p/CAF also functionally interacts with HPV-18 E2. To determine whether p/CAF binds to HPV-18 E2 in vivo, we co-transfected GST-fused HPV-18 E2 and FLAG-tagged p/CAF expression vectors into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, FLAG-p/CAF is only detected in GST resin precipitates when co-transfected with GST-E2. FLAG-p/CAF did not co-precipitate with GST along with FLAG-p/CAF or GST-E2 alone, indicating that p/CAF binds to HPV-18 E2 in vivo. Similarly, GST-E2 is only detectable in protein G (for detecting FLAG antibody) precipitates when co-transfected with FLAG-p/CAF (Fig. 1 B). As a negative control, we used FLAG-tagged HPV-11 E7. Western analysis showed that GST, GST-E2, FLAG-E7, and FLAG-p/CAF were properly expressed in the transfected 293T cells. These results also showed that p/CAF binds to HPV-18 E2 in mammalian cells. The existence of E2-p/CAF complex was further confirmed by the intracellular localization of p/CAF and HPV E2 using confocal microscopy (Fig. 1 C). GFP-E2 brought FLAG-p/CAF or endogenous p/CAF into nuclear dots, indicating that p/CAF and HPV-18 E2 proteins are co-localized in nucleus. To show that HPV-18 E2 binds to p/CAF in vitro, we performed GST pull down assays using recombinant GST fusion proteins of HPV-18 E2. The schematic representation of each recombinant GST-E2 proteins is shown in Fig.2 A. GST pull down assays demonstrated that p/CAF bound to both the transactivation domain and DNA-binding domain of E2 (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that GST pull down assays were specific, we carried out the same assay using recombinant GST proteins and in vitro translated Luc under the same condition as a negative control. Previous reports (18Lee D. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.W. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7045-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Marcello A. Massimi P. Banks L. Giacca M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9090-9098Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that p300/CBP binds to the NH2 terminus of HPV-18 E2. Our data showed that transactivation domain and DNA-binding domain of E2 interacts with p/CAF in vitro. To define the HPV-18 E2-binding domain within p/CAF, GST pull down assays were carried out using recombinant GST fusion proteins of p/CAF (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, the NH2 terminus of p/CAF bound to the full-length HPV-18 E2 in vitro. In vitro translated E2 was not bound to GST alone, GST-p/CAF-(658–832), and GST-p/CAF-(352–658). E2 binds to E2BS and activates or represses cognate binding site-dependent transcription (11McBride A.A. Romanczuk H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18411-18414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because p/CAF can activate several transcription factors (3Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V.

Yang X.J. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we carried out a transient reporter assay to test the role of p/CAF in E2-dependent transcription using E2 expression (pCG-18E2) and E2-dependent reporter (p2x2xE2BS-Luc) plasmids. Co-transfection of pCG-18E2 and the p2x2xE2BS-Luc reporter was performed in the presence or absence of pCX-p/CAF and pCDNA3-mCBP. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed using a Reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Equal amounts of cell lysates were employed for the detection of Luc activities. We added 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector to each transfectant as an internal control. Fig.4 A showed that p/CAF activated the E2-dependent transcription (maximum 7-fold), and CBP and p/CAF can further boost this high level of activity an additional 2–3-fold. Co-transfection of CBP and p/CAF expression plasmids significantly augmented E2-dependent transcription by about 8.4-fold. These results showed that p/CAF and CBP synergistically activate E2-dependent transcription. This synergy is believed to reflect a cooperative recruitment of the different co-activators (such as p300/CBP and p/CAF) by E2. Fig. 4 Bshowed that p/CAF did not affect basal E2-dependent transcription of a reporter plasmid (p2x2xE2BS-Luc). Since HPV-18 E2 binds to the NH2 terminus of p/CAF in vitro(Fig. 3), we tested whether the ectopic expression of the NH2 terminus of p/CAF (pCDNA3-p/CAF-(1–390)) had an effect on E2-dependent transcription in C33A cells. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the NH2 terminus of p/CAF repressed E2-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner, while the HAT domain of p/CAF did not affect the E2-dependent transcription. The E2 proteins from various HPV strains were tested in this assay. The E2 open reading frames of HPV-6b, -11, and -16 were in vitrotranslated using a TNT-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega). Using the GST-p/CAF-(1–390), pull down assays were carried out (Fig.5 A). These results showed that other types of HPV E2 proteins also bind to GST-p/CAF in vitro. Next, We tested whether the transcriptional activity of various HPV E2s was stimulated by p/CAF. As expected, we observed that p/CAF stimulated HPV E2-dependent promoter (Fig.5 B). HPV strains fall into two categories: a high-risk group (HPV-16 and -18) and a low-risk group (HPV-6 and -11) for the development of cervical cancer. E2 from the low-risk group of HPV showed a weak stimulatory effect on E2-dependent transcription, as compared with that of E2 from the high-risk group. From these results, we concluded that p/CAF has a universal property that stimulates transcriptional activation function of various HPV E2. To test whether the HAT activity of p/CAF is required for E2-dependent transcription, we constructed p/CAF(L606A), which lost the intrinsic HAT activity of p/CAF (21Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This p/CAF mutant did not acetylate histone proteins (data not shown). We carried out transient reporter assay using E2 expression and E2-dependent reporter plasmids. Co-transfection of pCG-18E2 and the p2x2xE2BS-Luc reporter was performed in the presence or absence of pCX-p/CAF and pCX-p/CAF(L606A). As shown in Fig. 6 A, the wild type p/CAF activated E2-dependent transcription by 2.3–5.8-fold. p/CAF(L606A), however, did not augment and rather repressed E2-dependent transcription. To confirm whether p/CAF and mutant p/CAF modulated E2 expression levels, we performed Western blot and Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 6 A, The amounts of E2 in the presence of wild type p/CAF expression plasmid was almost the same as that observed without the p/CAF expression plasmid. Our data imply that transactivator E2 recruits HATs into its cognate promoter to hyperacetylate its promoter region, resulting in activation of E2-dependent promoter. Because E2 required HAT activity of p/CAF for activating its transcriptional activation, we tested whether E2 recruits p/CAF to its promoter region for inducing hyperacetylation. We examined the acetylation status of p2x2xE2BS-Luc promoter using antibody specific for acetylated histone H3 and ChIP assay from Upstate Biotechology (Lake Placid, NY). We co-transfected p/CAF, p/CAF(L606A), and p2x2xE2BS-Luc in the presence or absence of E2 and recovered DNA by ChIP. Semi-quantitative PCR showed that E2-dependent promoter was hyperacetylated (Fig. 6 B). Without co-transfection of E2, less p2x2xE2BS-Luc was precipitated. When we co-transfected p/CAF(L606A) with E2 expression plasmid, the histone H3 in p2x2xE2BS-Luc was not hyperacetylated. We performed in vitro acetylation assay using recombinant E2 protein and p/CAF did not acetylate E2 protein while p/CAF acetylates histone or E2F sufficiently under our experimental condition (data not shown). To address whether transfected DNA might assemble into a nucleosome structure, we performed micrococcal nuclease digestion of isolated nuclei from cells transiently transfected with combination of p2x2xE2BS-Luc and E2 expression vector (Fig. 6 C). Nuclei were subjected to digestion with increasing amounts of micrococcal nuclease (0–0.64 unit) for 20 min at room temperature. Bulk DNA was isolated and separated on a 1.8% agarose gel (Fig. 6 C, left panel). The isolated DNA was subjected to Southern blot analysis and hybridization with luciferase gene fragment (Fig. 6 C, right panel). Mono- and dinucleosomes can be detected, consistent with previous results (22Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). From these results, we concluded that the E2-dependent promoter is hyperacetylated by HATs and p/CAF appears to activate E2-dependent promoter by acetylating promoter region in vivo. It has been well known that p300/CBP and p/CAF form a coactivator complex to facilitate transcription (23Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). p/CAF, which associates with viral acidic transcription factors such as Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2 and Herpes simplex virus VP16, binds to p300/CBP and potentiates viral promoter and host promoters through cooperatively association with other co-activators (24Wang L. Grossman S.R. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, Reid et al. (21Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that p/CAF stimulates transcription in yeast, which does not contain p300/CBP. They also showed that a p/CAF deletion mutant, which does not contain the binding region for CBP, augments Rous sarcoma virus long control region-dependent transcription in mammalian cells. These results suggest that p/CAF has an independent role in transcriptional activation from CBP/p300. Previously we reported that CBP binds to human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 and activates E2-dependent transcription (18Lee D. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.W. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7045-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CBP(F1541A), a HAT-negative CBP mutant, did not stimulate E2-dependent transcription as the wild type CBP. In this report, we showed that p/CAF and CBP activates E2-dependent promoter synergistically. CBP(F1541A) retains the ability to increase the E2-dependent transcription marginally. This residual effect suggests that HAT activity can be provided by other CBP-associated proteins or other factors. In this paper, we demonstrated that p/CAF(L606A), an HAT-negative p/CAF mutant, is not able to stimulate E2-dependent transcription and it shows a dominant negative effect on E2-dependent promoter, indicating the possibility that p/CAF may be the major HAT for E2-dependent transcription. Our preliminary data showed that E2 was not acetylated by p/CAF and CBP (data not shown). From these results, we speculated that the HAT activities of CBP and p/CAF are related to the acetylation status of promoter region. p/CAF and p300/CBP have been shown to acetylate nucleosomal histones in vitro (1Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 7Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H.

Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). The post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation are thought to facilitate or block transcription by altering the chromatin structure. p/CAF and p300/CBP have also been shown to acetylate the transcription factors (26Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 27Huang S. Qiu Y. Shi Y., Xu, Z. Brandt S.J.

A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and the transcriptionally active tumor-suppressor protein p53 has been shown to undergo functionally relevant acetylation by p300 and P/CAF (31Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 32Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Because the augment of E2-dependent transcription is reduced when the HAT function of p/CAF is disrupted, it seems likely that the effect of p/CAF on E2-mediated transcription also involves acetylation of histones or other substrates. Our ChIP assay shows that E2-dependent promoter is hyperacetylated by E2, which binds to E2BS. Thus, E2 seems to recruit HATs into its cognate promoter region in vivo and the HAT activities are important for efficient stimulation of E2-dependent promoter. In this study, we define that co-activator p/CAF specifically binds to HPV E2 and stimulates E2-dependent transcription in vivo. These findings are consistent with the notion that E2 is modulated by many cellular factors and these protein-protein interactions may provide the various functions in host cells such as apoptosis and transcriptional or replication modulation of HPV E2 protein."

Human apoA-I transgenic mice exhibit a human-like HDL profile, indicating that the amino acid sequence of apoA-I is a determinant of the HDL profile. Comparison of the primary sequence of mouse and human apoA-I and the previously designated “hinge” domain of apoA-I led us to hypothesize that α-helices 7 and 8 (7/8) are determinants of HDL subclass distribution. The following proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli: human apoA-I, T7-hAI; mouse apoA-I, T7-mAI; chimeric human apoA-I containing murine helices 7/8 in place of human helices 7/8, T7-hAI(m7/8); and the reciprocal chimera, T7-mAI(h7/8). The recombinant proteins were examined for their association with human plasma HDL subclasses. The results demonstrated that T7-hAI bound HDL2 and HDL3 equally well, whereas T7-mAI bound to HDL2 preferentially. T7-hAI(m7/8) behaved like T7-mAI, and T7-mAI(h7/8) behaved like T7-hAI. Thus, α-helices 7/8 are strong contributors to the pattern of HDL subclass association. Self-association, α-helicity, cholesterol efflux, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity of the recombinant proteins were also assessed.

Human and non-human primate HDL are heterogeneous, with the two major subclasses designated HDL2 and HDL3. Epidemiological data suggest that HDL2 is more atheroprotective than HDL3 (1Miller N.E. Am. Heart J. 1987; 113: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The epidemiological data and in vitroassays in which HDL subclasses have discrete functional capacities (2Rye K.A. Clay M.A. Barter P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 145: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) suggest that HDL subclasses may have discrete atheroprotective mechanisms. In contrast to primates, most other mammals have less polydisperse HDL. In the case of the mouse, a species being intensively studied with molecular genetic tools in atherosclerosis research, the HDL size and density resemble human HDL2. A major determinant of HDL size and density is the structure of the major HDL protein, apoprotein A-I (apoA-I). This is exemplified by human apoA-I transgenic C57BL/6 mice that have a human-like HDL profile (3Schultz J.R. Verstuyft J.G. Gong E.L. Nichols A.V. Ruben E.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ApoA-I is a 243-amino acid protein that can be divided into an N-terminal globular domain (residues 1–43), encoded by exon 3 of the apoA-I gene, and a C-terminal domain (residues 44–243), encoded by exon 4 of the gene (4Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Borhani D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1531: 4-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is predicted to contain eight 22-mer and two 11-mer amphipathic α-helices, with most of the helices being punctuated by prolines. Functionally, apoA-I activates LCAT (5Fielding C.J. Shore V.G. Fielding P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, apoA-I is believed to be the structural framework that mediates changes in HDL size (9Jonas A. Kezdy K.E. Hefele-Wald J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) from this laboratory using proteins chimeric for human apoE and apoA-I demonstrated that residues 44–243 of apoA-I, which include the repeating amphipathic helical domain, is most influential in subclass determination. A sequence comparison of the helical domain of mouse and human apoA-I and the previously reported hinge domain led us to focus on helices 7/8 (residues 165–209) as the most likely region to influence the distinct human and mouse HDL subclass distributions. This was explored using chimeric apoprotein molecules in which helices 7/8 are exchanged between the human or mouse apoA-I proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis (Bio-Rad T7 in Vitro Mutagenesis) and PCR amplification/mutagenesis, using the oligonucleotides (oligos) shown in TableI, were utilized to construct recombinant apoA-I cDNAs. The relative position of restriction sites used to generate the mature apoA-Is and chimeras are shown in Fig.1. All DNAs were sequenced by the method of Sanger et al. (18Sanger R. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) or by fluorescent sequencing at the DNA Sequencing Core Facility at the University of Chicago. The mature apoA-I cDNAs were subcloned into the pET 28c+ vector (Novagen), a bacterial expression vector containing a His6-T7 epitope tag sequence (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMASMTGGQQMGR). The His6 was used to purify recombinant apoA-I, and the T7 epitope was used for detection in Western blotting. The recombinant cDNAs were subcloned downstream and in frame with this tag by utilizing the BamHI site in the polylinker region. This introduced an additional N-terminal dipeptide (IQ) between the His6-T7 epitope tag and mature apoA-I sequence when the proteins were expressed in the pET 28C+ vector.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used for the construction of cDNAs encoding human and mouse apoA-I and the chimera apoA-IsUse of oligonucleotideApoA-I cDNA location ntSequencehAIMutagenesis1.

The mature mouse apoA-I cDNA was excised with BamHI and placed in the corresponding region of pET 28c+ vector. The T7-hAI(m7/8) chimera was prepared by excising the cDNA segment encoding human residues 163–212 and replacing it with the corresponding cDNA segment coding for murine residues 163–212 (based on human apoA-I numbering) as shown in Fig. 1. In order to create this chimeric cDNA, several unique restriction sites were created. First, using the mature human apoA-I cDNA in M13mp19, the codons for His162, Leu163, and Ala164 (CAT CTG GCC) were mutated to CAC CTA GGC with Oligo 5, introducing a unique AvrII restriction site without changing the corresponding amino acid residues. Next, the codons for Leu211, Glu212, and Asp213 (CTC GAG GAC) were mutated to CCT GCA GAC (Oligo 6), introducing a PstI site as well as changing the corresponding amino acid sequence to Pro211, Ala212, and Asp213. After removing thePstI site in the polylinker region of M13mp19 (Oligo 7), the human apoA-I cDNA was linearized at the remaining uniquePstI, the 3′-overhang removed with mung bean nuclease and the construct digested with AvrII, excising the cDNA fragment encoding human residues 163–212. The cDNA encoding the corresponding murine residues (Fig. 1) was obtained by digesting the mature mouse apoA-I cDNA with EcoO109I, blunt-ending the 5′-overhang with mung bean nuclease, and digesting withNheI. As NheI and AvrII have compatible overhangs, the 163–212-residue murine fragment was ligated into the corresponding AvrII/PstI site of the vector containing human apoA-I. The T7-hAI(m7/8) insert was excised with BamHI-HindIII and ligated into the corresponding region of the pET 28c+ vector. To generate T7-mAI(h7/8) cDNA, the codon for residue 88 in mouse apoA-I was mutated to ablate an EcoO109I site using Oligo 8, leaving a unique EcoO1091 that cuts between the codons for murine residues 212 and 213 (based on the human apoA-I sequence). The modified cDNA was digested with NheI, which cleaved between residues 162 and 163, and EcoO1091 to remove the cDNA encoding murine residues 163–212. The corresponding region of human apoA-I was obtained by PCR. The 5′-oligomer (Oligo 9) contained a 5′-flanking HindIII site and generated an NheI site to cleave between residues 162 and 163. The generation of theNheI site changed His162 to Gln162. The 3′-oligomer (Oligo 10) contained a BamHI site after the codon for human residue 215. The PCR fragment was subcloned into theHindIII/BamHI site of pUC19. The cDNA encoding residues 163–212 was excised with NheI andEcoO109I and subcloned into the corresponding region in mouse apoA-I, yielding the T7-mAI(h7/8) chimeric cDNA sequence. Note that the codon for human residue 162, which was mutated to Gln and included in the final chimera construct, is in helix 6. In mouse helix 6 residue 162 is a Gln so that this insert reconstitutes the wild-type murine sequence in this helix. The chimeric cDNA was excised withBamHI and placed in the corresponding region of the pET 28c+ vector. The recombinant apoA-I pET expression vectors inE. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) were expressed and purified as described previously by Frank et al. (19Frank P.G. Bergeron J. Emmanuel F. Lavigne J.-P. Sparks D.L. Denefle P. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1798-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were lyophilized after dialysis against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Some recombinant apoA-Is were dialyzed against dd H2O so that molecular weights could by confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Quattro II mass spectrometer or atmospheric pressure chemical ion mass spectrometry was performed with an Alpha Perkin Instrument 300. Lipid-free apoA-Is (0.5 mg/ml) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline were incubated for 3 h on ice with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, Pierce, final concentration 3.5 mm) in a modified version of the Staros technique (20Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3950-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction mixture was quenched by adding 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (final concentration 63 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (NOVEX). Coomassie Blue-stained gels were scanned using DeskScanII, and the areas under the curve were measured using ImageQuant (Genomic Solutions Inc.); and percent of total area was determined for each oligomer. CD spectra of free apoA-I and of rHDL were measured with a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter. The samples were dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and were adjusted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml using the same buffer. Measurements were made at room temperature using a 0.1-cm quartz cell. Five scans between 200 and 250 nm were acquired and averaged. A base-line scan was subtracted to produce the final average scan. The percentage of α-helix content was calculated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm, as described previously (21Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). The rHDL substrate for the LCAT assays and CD spectra was prepared at a molar ratio of 80:4:1sn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC):cholesterol:apoA-I with a trace amount of [3H]cholesterol for the LCAT assays as described by Sorci-Thomas et al.

The rHDLs were purified by passage through a Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences and Molecular Dynamics) column (55 × 1.8 cm) in Standard buffer (10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA and 0.15 mm sodium azide), pH 7.4. The final molar composition of the rHDL (22Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. Landrum M. J. Biol.

The number of molecules of recombinant apoA-I per rHDL (final concentration 15 μmof protein) was determined by cross-linking using BS3 as described above. LCAT analysis was performed as described previously (22Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. Landrum M. J. Biol.

The reactions were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C, and the conversion of [3H]cholesterol to [3H]cholesteryl ester was determined (23Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The fractional esterification rate was multiplied by the nanomoles of substrate cholesterol in the assay tube, corrected for the background, and converted to nanomoles of cholesteryl ester formed/h/ml of LCAT. The rHDL were examined by electron microscopy using a Philips CM10 electron microscope (University of Chicago Core Electron Microscopy Facility). The samples were stained with sodium phosphotungstate (25Cabana V.G. Lukens J.R. Rice K.S. Hawkins T.J. Getz G.S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2662-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the diameters of 100 particles were measured. Cholesterol efflux from [3H]cholesterol-labeled membranes of normal human skin GM3468A fibroblasts by apoA-I in the lipid-free or rHDL form (with a molar ratio of 100:1 POPC:apoA-I) was assayed as described previously (26Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total lipoproteins (TLP) were isolated from human plasma by preparative centrifugation at ρ < 1.21 g/cm3. HDL2 (ρ = 1.063–1.125 g/cm3) and HDL3 (ρ = 1.125–1.21 g/cm3) were isolated by sequential flotation of human plasma. After isolation, a preservative mixture (0.1% w/v aprotinin, 1 mm butylated hydroxytoluene, 0.1% w/v EDTA, 0.02% w/v NaN3, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the lipoproteins, and they were stored under N2 at 4 °C to minimize proteolysis and oxidation. Prior to use, isolated lipoproteins were extensively dialyzed against Standard buffer, pH 8.0. ApoA-I levels of TLP and HDL were determined using an immunoturbidometry kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals as modified by Sandkamp et al. (27Sandkamp M. Tambyrajah B. Schriewer H. Assmann G. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1988; 26: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I standards were purchased from Northwest Lipid Research Laboratory (Seattle, WA). Typically, 10 μg of recombinant apoA-I was incubated with TLP containing 625 μg of apoA-I in 0.5 ml of Standard buffer, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 4 °C. The final volume was adjusted to 2.0 ml and subjected to 10–20% NaBr equilibrium density gradient (28Cabana V.G. Siegel J.N. Sabesin S.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After separation, 30× 0.4-ml aliquots were collected using an ISCO gradient collector with tube effluent being monitored continuously at 280 nm with a UV monitor (Instrument Specialties Co., Lincoln, NE). From the 280 nm tracings, the relative amount of protein in HDL2 and HDL3 was determined by quantitation of the area under the curve of HDL2 or HDL3using a computer digitizer (Sigma Scan, Scientific Measurement System; Jandel Scientific). Density measurements were confirmed by refractometry (Abbe Refractometer Mark II) from a gradient containing TLP. Gradient fractions in the VLDL/LDL, HDL2, HDL3, and free protein density range were electrophoresed on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels and the proteins transferred to Immobilon-P. When the blots were specifically probed for recombinant apoA-Is, the mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (1:1000 dilution, Novagen) and 35S-labeled anti-mouse Ig antibody (1:500 dilution, Amersham Biosciences and Molecular Dynamics) were used following the manufacturers' instructions. The blot was subjected to PhosphorImaging (Storm PhosphorImager, Amersham Biosciences, and Molecular Dynamics). The relative amount of recombinant apoA-I in HDL2 and HDL3 fractions was determined using ImageQuant software (Genomic Solutions Inc.), and the proportion of apoA-I in HDL2 and HDL3 was then expressed as a percent of total HDL association. Alternatively, murine Ig-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution, Sigma) was used; recombinant proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences and Molecular Dynamics), and HDL proportions were determined from densitometric scanning. The fractions were also probed for endogenous apoproteins using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human apoA-I (1:12,500 dilution), apoA-II (1:7500 dilution), and apoE (1:1000 dilution). The proportions of each apoprotein in VLDL/LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 fractions were determined as described for recombinant apoA-I above. The human apoA-I antibody reactivity was used to determine the relative amount of HDL2 and HDL3 in the total lipoprotein samples used for the association assays. Antibodies that cross-react with mouse apoA-I were removed by passing the antiserum over an Affi-Gel 15 column containing murine HDL. While this human apoA-I-specific antibody recognizes endogenous apoA-I as well as recombinant T7-hAI and T7-hAI(m7/8), the recombinant proteins have a slightly slower mobility on the SDS-acrylamide gels due to the presence of the N-terminal tag. In addition, the recombinant proteins are present at 60-fold lower concentration than the endogenous protein, and thus detection of these proteins in the immunoblots of the HDL fractions requires overexposure of the film. Increasing amounts of recombinant apoA-I (10–80 μg) were added to isolated HDL2 or HDL3 (200 μg of total protein) in 545 μl of Standard buffer, pH 8.0. After a gentle vortex, 45 μl (designated the reserved incubation mixture) was removed for subsequent generation of standard curves. The remaining 500 μl was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Protein aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to two tandem Superose 6 columns (Amersham Biosciences and Molecular Dynamics) that had been equilibrated with Standard buffer, pH 8.0. HDL and free proteins were eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. All samples were immediately frozen or placed on ice when they were collected to minimize proteolysis or HDL reformation. Samples to be electrophoresed on 4–20% non-denaturing gradient gels (see below) had the preservative mixture added to them and were stored at 4 °C, for no longer than 4 days, until electrophoresis was performed. Recombinant and endogenous apoA-Is were quantitated by Western blotting as described above. The reserved incubation mixture was used to generate standard curves for recombinant (range 1.25–20 ng) and endogenous (range 6.25–20 ng) apoA-I, respectively. A standard curve for the appropriate apoprotein was included on every blot to correct for variability in electrophoretic transfer and antibody reactivity. The concentration of recombinant apoA-I in the peak HDL fractions (bound), free protein fractions, and aggregated pellet was determined by linear regression analysis of recombinant or endogenous apoA-I standard. The concentration of bound apoA-I versus free apoA-I was analyzed by Scatchard analysis using Kaleidagraph (version 3.5) software. Peak HDL2 and HDL3 fractions were separated on non-denaturing 4–20% gradient acrylamide gels (NOVEX) by electrophoresis at 125 V/gel for 5 h at 4 °C, according to manufacturer's instructions. rHDL sizes were determined as described previously (23Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using 4–30% nondenaturing gradient acrylamide gels (obtained from David Rainwater, Southwest Foundation, San Antonio, TX). The calibration standards (high molecular weight electrophoresis calibration kit) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. Group differences were tested by analysis of variance and the Scheffe and Tukey/Kramer post-hoc tests, using StatView (version 5.0.1) software. Our strategy has involved the synthesis of recombinant apoA-I constructs each containing N-terminal tags consisting of a His tag for purification and a T7 tag for selective identification. The recombinant proteins had the expected molecular weights as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2) and by electron spray mass spectrometry (data not shown). From densitometric scanning of the gel, the purity of the recombinant proteins was 95%. The remaining 5% of the protein contained a distinct band at 41 kDa. The 41 kDa was not recognized by anti-T7 or polyclonal antibodies directed against human and mouse apoA-I (data not shown), suggesting that this band was a bacterial protein. Recombinant apoE purified using the same system also has a 41-kDa band, 2T. Biswas, personal communications. supporting the suggestion that it was a contaminating bacterial protein. Modification of the washing and elution conditions did not eliminate this band. Because it composed less than 5% of total protein, did not associate with HDL, and did not interfere with apoA-I structure/function (demonstrated below), no further attempts were made to eliminate this band. Prior to examining the association of the recombinant proteins with HDL subclasses, the physicochemical, structural, and functional properties of the proteins were examined. The self-association behavior of the apoA-Is in the lipid-free state was examined by cross-linking with BS3. As a control, isolated human plasma apoA-I was cross-linked at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (Fig. 3), resulting in 55% forming oligomers (dimers to pentamers), consistent with previous studies (29Swaney J.B. O'Brien K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gong E.L. Tan C.S. Shoukry M.I. Rubin E.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The T7-hAI self-association properties were similar to those of human plasma apoA-I. Approximately 31% of T7-mAI formed oligomers at 0.5 mg/ml, consistent with the previous findings that mouse plasma apoA-I self-associates to a lesser extent than does human plasma apoA-I (30Gong E.L. Tan C.S. Shoukry M.I. Rubin E.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The chimeras in which helices 7 and 8 were exchanged retained properties similar to those of the wild-type parent constructs, i.e. T7-hAI(m7/8) had self-association properties similar to T7-hAI and T7-mAI(h7/8) had properties similar to T7-mAI. These findings suggest that helices 7/8 do not govern the self-association properties, consistent with previous studies (10Minnich A. Collet X. Roghani A. Cladaras C. Hamilton R.L. Fielding C.J.

The biological function of bacterial UPP is to serve as a carrier to transport UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid pentapeptide, which subsequently reacts with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to form lipid II, to extracellular compartments where lipid II molecules are assembled into peptidoglycans of the cell wall (8Robyt J.

In E. coli UPPS structure, an elongated tunnel with the hydrophobic amino acid side chains covering the entire interior surface was proposed to accommodate the UPP product (Fig.1 A) (12Ko T.P.

This hydrophobic tunnel is surrounded by two α-helices (α2 and α3) and four β-strands (βA-βB-βD-βC).

Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that IPP is probably bound to the area of Glu-213, Arg-194, and Arg-200 since mutations of these residues to Ala resulted in significantly increased IPPK m and decreased k cat values (13Pan J.J.

The replacement of Trp-75 residue, located in the loop with Ala, increases the FPP and IPP K m values, indicating that Trp-75 is close to the bound IPP and FPP (12Ko T.P. Chen Y.K. Robinson H.

The loop may also serve as a hinge for the necessary protein conformational change in catalysis since two conformers observed in the E. coli UPPS structure differ in the position of α3 helix (Fig. 1 A), which is connected to the loop (12Ko T.P. Chen Y.K. Robinson H. Tsai P.C. Gao Y.-G. Chen A.P.-C. Wang A.H.-J. Liang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47474-47482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the closed conformer, the tunnel is narrow within which an elongated electron density envelope (probably Triton or polyethylene glycol used in the crystallization) is visible. On the other hand, the open form of the tunnel contains only water molecules in the active site area. This loop is proposed to function in bringing the α3 helix close to α2, leading to the formation of the closed form, in which the enzyme has better interactions with the substrate. In the present study, fluorescence experiments were utilized to examine the binding of FPP and IPP since the binding of substrate to enzyme may alter the UPPS intrinsic fluorescence. All Trp residues including Trp-31, Trp-75, Trp-91, Trp-149, Trp-207, and Trp-221 in the E. coli UPPS primary sequence were individually mutated to Phe for the fluorescence studies (see Fig. 1 B for the positions of Trp residues in the UPPS). Furthermore, stopped-flow fluorescence technology was employed to monitor the protein conformational change associated with UPPS catalysis. To serve the above purposes as well as to test the inhibition of the enzyme, (S)-farnesyl thiopyrophosphate (FsPP, a FPP analogue) was synthesized. Due to its much less labile thiopyrophosphate group and its structural similarity to FPP, FsPP could act as a good UPPS inhibitor. Previously, the thiol analogue of geranyl pyrophosphate was prepared and used as an inhibitor as well as an alternative substrate for farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, which synthesizes FPP from geranyl pyrophosphate and IPP (16Phan R.M. Poulter C.D. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The geranyl thiopyrophosphate was an extremely poor substrate for farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and showed 106 lower activity compared with the normal substrate (16Phan R.M. Poulter C.D. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, FPP thiol analogue has not been tested as an inhibitor for the enzymes catalyzing FPP chain elongation until now. The results of inhibition of UPPS by FsPP and the fluorescence binding and stopped-flow experiments using FPP or its thiol analogue to identify the protein conformational change are presented in this paper. Trimethylphosphate, tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide, dimethylchlorothiophosphate, iodotrimethylsilane, and all-trans-farnesyl chloride were purchased from Aldrich. Dowex AG50 × 8 ion exchange column (NH 4+ form) was obtained from Sigma. The radiolabeled [14C]IPP (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. The all-trans-FPP and IPP were obtained from Sigma. Reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate was the product of Merck. Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Invitrogen. The plasmid mini-prep kit, DNA gel extraction kit, and nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin were obtained from Qiagen. Potato acidic phosphatase (2 units/mg) was purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. The protein expression kit including the pET32Xa/LIC vector and competent JM109 and BL21 cells and Factor Xa protease were obtained from Novagen. The mutagenic primers were prepared by MDBio Co. All commercial buffers and reagents were of the highest grade. NMR measurements were performed using Bruker AVANCE spectrometer. Mass analysis was carried out using Jeol-SX102A instrument. For HPLC chromatography, a Waters system with a reverse phase Hypersil® HS C8 column (250 × 4.6 mm) obtained from ThermoQuest was used. Synthesis of (S)-farnesyl thiopyrophosphate was performed using the procedures previously reported for preparing geranyl thiopyrophosphate via the synthesis of tetra-n-butylammonium dimethylphosphate and tetramethyl thiopyrophosphate (16Phan R.M. Poulter C.D. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with modification in making (S)-farnesyl thiopyrophosphate from tetramethyl thiopyrophosphate as described below. Tetramethyl thiopyrophosphate (0.5 g, 2.0 mmol) was added dropwise to iodotrimethylsilane (2.26 g, 11.28 mmol) at −35 °C, and the solution was allowed to warm to room temperature over 6 h. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford brown semi-solid residue. The residue was then dissolved in 7 ml of acetonitrile, adjusted to pH 6 with 40% (w/w) aqueous tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide, and further titrated with 0.4 m aqueous tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide to pH 7–7.2. The organic solvent was first removed by vacuum, and the remaining solution was lyophilized to give the substance for the next step without further purification. All-trans-farnesyl chloride (220 mg, 0.9 mmol) was added dropwise to thetris-(trimethylsilane) thiopyrophosphate solution at 25 °C, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The organic solvent was removed by a rotatory evaporator to afford a brown solid. The solid was dissolved in a limited amount of deionized water and passed through a short Dowex 50 × 8 ion exchange column (NH 4+ form). The collected filtrate was lyophilized to yield a white solid. This solid was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a program of 5 min of 100% A followed by a linear gradient of 100% A to 100% B over 30 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min (A, 25 mm aqueous ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0); B, acetonitrile). The fractions containing product were collected and lyophilized to afford 239 mg of white solid (70% yield):1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ 1.62 (6H, s, CH3), 1.69 (3H, s, CH3), 1.71 (3H, s, CH3), 2.00–2.15 (8H, m, CH2), 3.53 (2H, t,J = 8.4 Hz), 5.19 (2H, m, CH), 5.42 (1H, t,J = 8 Hz); 13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O) δ 15.24, 16.92, 24.80, 25.55, 25.72, 27.94 (d), 38.72, 119.89(d), 124.22, 124.43, 133.49, 136.61, 140.77;31P NMR (D2O) δ −7.47 (d), 7.78 (d); high resolution mass (fast atom bombardment) calculated for C15H28O6P2S 398.1082, found [M-1]− m/z = 397.1008. The measurement of the inhibition constant for FsPP analogue was performed in a reaction mixture containing 0.03 μm UPPS, 3 μm FPP, and 50 μm[14C]IPP in a buffer of 100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor ranged from 0 to 6 μm. The 0.1% Triton X-100 was included in the reaction so that the product release did not limit the reaction so as to allow the measurement of IPP condensation rate at each inhibitor concentration. Portions of reaction mixture periodically withdrawn were mixed with 10 mm EDTA to terminate the reaction, and 1-butanol was utilized to extract the enzyme products for quantification using scintillation counting. The initial rate was obtained for zero and different concentrations of inhibitor, and the IC50 value of the inhibitor was determined by fitting the reaction rate versus inhibitor concentration using the following equations (17Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems (Wiley Classics Library, ed). John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 100-118Google Scholar). A(I)=A(0)×{1−[I/(I+Ki(1+S/Km))]}Equation 1 IC50=Ki(1+S/Km)Equation 2 In these equations, A (I) is the enzyme activity with inhibitor concentration I, A (0) is enzyme activity without inhibitor, I is the inhibitor concentration,K i is the inhibition constant of inhibitor,S is the FPP concentration, and K m is Michaelis constant of FPP. In a reaction mixture containing 0.1 μm UPPS, 50 μm [14C]IPP, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) at 25 °C, 5 μm of FsPP was added to initiate the enzyme reaction. Because the reaction rate of using this alternative substrate was extremely slow, 40-μl portions of reaction mixture were withdrawn every 12 h and mixed with 10 mm EDTA to stop the enzyme reaction. The total time for assay was 36 h. The subsequent procedure to determine the reaction rate was the same as described above. PCR technique was employed to produce UPPS mutants using our previously constructed plasmid as template, which contained the pET32Xa/LIC vector with insertion of the E. coli Bos-12 UPPS gene (18Pan J.J. Chiou S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotides for performing site-directed mutagenesis were 5′-GGCAATGGTCGCTTTGCAAAAAAGCAAGG-3′ for W31F (mismatched bases are underlined), 5′-AGTAGTGAAAACTTCAACCGACCAGCGCAG-3′ for W75F, 5′-TTTGTGTTCGCGCTAGAT-3′ for W91F, 5′-GGTGGACGTGCGGATATA-3′ for W149A, 5′-TTGCTTTTCCAAATTGCC-3′ for W207F, and 5′-GATGTTCTCTTCCCCGAT-3′ for W221F. For the second PCR reaction, the forward primer 5′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCATGTTGTCTGCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCATCAGGCTGT-3′ were used with the PCR products generated from the above mutagenic oligonucleotides to prepare mutant UPPS genes. Expression and purification of the mutant proteins were carried out as previously described (13Pan J.J. Yang L.W. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13856-13861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 0.01 μm mutant UPPS to a mixture containing various concentrations of FPP and [14C]IPP. In the measurements of K m and k cat values of these mutant enzymes, five times the K m value of one substrate was utilized to saturate enzyme, and concentrations of 0.5–5 K m of the other substrate were used. All reactions were carried out in 100 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.5), 50 m KCl, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. To measure the initial rate, portions of the reaction mixture were periodically withdrawn within 10% substrate depletion and mixed with 10 mm EDTA for reaction termination. The radiolabeled products were then extracted with 1-butanol and quantitated using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Data of initial rates versus substrate concentrations were analyzed by non-linear regression of the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 3) using the KaleidaGraph computer program (Synergy software) to obtainK m and V max values (19Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1984: 99-101Google Scholar). Thek cat was calculated fromV max/[E]. vo=Vmax[S]/(Km+[S])Equation 3 where v o is the initial velocity, [E] is the enzyme concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration,V max is the maximum velocity, andK m is the Michaelis constant. The change of UPPS intrinsic fluorescence upon the addition of substrate was monitored using a F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan). The emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 450 nm upon excitation of wild-type and mutant UPPS at 285 nm. The fluorescence spectra of 1 μm UPPS in a buffer containing 100 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.5 MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl at 25 °C were measured before and after the addition of 15 μm FPP or FsPP. The experiments were also carried out in the absence of MgCl2 to examine the role of the metal ion in FPP binding. For determination of the effect of IPP binding in the fluorescence spectra, the 1 μm enzyme (wild type or mutant) preincubated with 15 μm FsPP was mixed with 40 μm IPP in a buffer containing 100 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.5 MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl at 25 °C. The same experiment was also performed in the absence of MgCl2. Stopped-flow measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX-18 MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Leatherhead, Surrey, UK). This apparatus has a 1.4-ms dead time, and the 1-cm path length was used. Protein Trp fluorescence emission above 320 nm was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 285 nm. A cut-off filter was used to prevent the detection of fluorescence signal below 320 nm. The observation cell was maintained at 25 °C during the stopped-flow measurements. The stopped-flow experiments were performed by mixing wild-type and mutant UPPS that is preincubated with FPP or FsPP with equal volumes of IPP solution in a buffer containing 100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl with IPP. The concentrations of enzyme, FPP or FsPP, and IPP cited in the text and in the parentheses are those after mixing, which are half the original concentrations due to an equal volume mixing. The apparent observed rate was obtained by fitting the stopped-flow trace (average of four repeated runs) with either a single exponential or a double exponential equation. Initially we followed the published procedure for preparing geranyl thiopyrophosphate (16Phan R.M. Poulter C.D. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which failed to yield FsPP at −35 °C probably due to the less reactive farnesyl chloride in the coupling reaction with thiopyrophosphate. By elevating the temperature to 25 °C, the desired product FsPP was obtained with the final yield of 70%. The synthesis of FsPP is outlined in Scheme FS1. This substrate analogue was used in the inhibition studies, fluorescence binding, and stopped-flow experiments as described below. As shown in Fig. 2, the IC50 of the inhibitor in the presence of 0.03 μm enzyme, 3 μm FPP, and 50 μm IPP was ∼1.3 ± 0.1 μm, which corresponds to 0.2 μm K i value according to Equations 1 and 2. As expected, this substrate analogue binds to the enzyme with similar affinity as the substrate FPP (K m = 0.4 μm). The FsPP also served as an alternative substrate for UPPS but with a much slower rate. The k cat value measured at 25 °C was 3.1 × 10−7s−1, 107 times slower than thek cat value of the enzyme reaction using FPP as the substrate. The UPPS mutants including W31F, W75F, W91F, W149F, W207F, and W221F were produced. These mutant enzymes were expressed as His-tag fusion proteins using E. coli BL21 as host cells under the control of a T7 promoter. The yield of each protein is ∼100 mg/liter of culture. The protein was purified using the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column, and the tag was cleaved by incubation with Factor Xa protease. The purity of the purified protein was >95%, judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). As summarized in TableI, the kinetic parameter measurements reveal that W75F has larger FPP and IPP K m values of 1.8 and 26 μm, respectively. W31F has an increased FPPK m value (2 μm) without the change ofk cat and IPP K m values. These results indicate that Trp-31 and Trp-75 are part of the active site and involved in the substrate binding. W207F displays 6-fold larger IPPK m value (23 μm) and an 8-fold increase FPP K m value (3.4 μm), whereas its k cat value is similar to that of the wild type. This residue is located at the interface of the UPPS dimer (Fig. 1 B) and stacks with Arg-148 from the other subunit. W149F mutation also results in a five-times increased IPPK m value (20 μm). Based on theK m value measured for each mutant, sufficient quantity of substrate (at least 5-fold of K m value) was used in the following experiments to saturate the enzyme.Table IKinetic parameters of E. coli UPPS mutants with Trp replaced by PheUPPSk catK m (FPP)K m (IPP)Location of mutations −1μmμmWild type2.5 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.3W31F1.1 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.35.9 ± 0.8α1W75F1.1 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.226 ± 3Flexible loopW91F2.5 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.27.2 ± 1.3α3W149F1.7 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.320 ± 4α5W207F1.5 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.823 ± 3Loop of βE-βFW221F3.5 ± 0.50.5 ± 0.0414 ± 2Loop of βF-α7 Open table in a new tab A fluorescence spectrophotometer was employed to monitor the change of protein intrinsic fluorescence upon adding the substrate. As shown in Fig.3 A, 15 μm FPP reduces the intrinsic fluorescence of 1 μm wild-type UPPS in the presence of Mg2+. FPP still quenches the wild-type UPPS fluorescence in the absence of the metal ion, indicating that FPP binding to the enzyme does not require Mg2+ (data not shown). The fluorescence of mutant UPPS other than W31F and W91F is quenched by FPP with comparable magnitude to the wild-type UPPS (data not shown). In contrast, the fluorescence of 1 μm W31F is partially reduced (Fig. 3 B), and that of W91F is almost not changed by adding 15 μm FPP to the protein (Fig.3 C). These indicate that when FPP is bound to the wild type UPPS, it mainly quenches the fluorescence of Trp-91. The addition of IPP to the UPPS solution in the absence of the other substrate FPP does not alter the protein fluorescence (data not shown). However, the addition of IPP to a preformed binary UPPS·FPP complex enhances fluorescence of the protein complex (data not shown). When the FsPP was used instead of FPP, the protein fluorescence also increases, indicating that the binding of IPP to the E·FsPP accounts for most of the protein fluorescence change (Fig.4 A). FsPP reduces the wild-type protein fluorescence as FPP does (Fig. 4 A shows the fluorescence spectra of UPPS (▪) and UPPS complexed with FsPP (○)), and the fluorescence increases to a higher level upon the addition of 40 μm IPP in the presence of Mg2+(asterisks). On the other hand, FsPP still quenches the UPPS fluorescence, but the addition of IPP fails to increase the fluorescence of the complex in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig.4 B). This indicates that the metal ion is required for the binding of IPP to the UPPS complexed with FsPP. Because there are changes of protein fluorescence by adding FPP into enzyme as well as IPP into the UPPS·FsPP (or UPPS·FPP) complex, the fluorescence stopped-flow method was used to measure the progress of these fluorescence changes in ways similar to previous studies (20Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12206-12212Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the emission of the Trp fluorescence above 320 nm was monitored by excitation of the UPPS sample at 285 nm. No fluorescence change could be detected in the time scale (ms) of the stopped-flow instrument by mixing 1 μm enzyme with 5–15 μm FPP (data not shown) despite the observable fluorescence difference in the steady-state fluorescence spectra shown above. This indicates that the binding of FPP may be too fast to be measurable due to the small FPPK m on our stopped-flow apparatus, which has a dead time of 1.4 ms. During the binding of IPP with the enzyme in the absence of FPP, no fluorescence change with time could be observed by mixing 1 μm enzyme and 5–40 μm IPP in the presence of 0.5 mm MgCl2 (data not shown). This is not surprising since no net fluorescence difference could be detected between the spectrum of UPPS alone and that of the UPPS-IPP mixture. We then mixed by stopped-flow IPP (20 μm) with the enzyme (2.5 μm) that was preincubated with FPP (5 μm), since IPP enhances the fluorescence of the enzyme complex as shown in Fig. 4 A. In this stopped-flow experiment, the change of Trp fluorescence signal with time (a stopped-flow trace) was observed with three phases. The two slow phases observed in the 10-s window are shown in Fig.5 A. The fastest phase and part of the slow phase in the 200-ms window are shown in Fig. 5 B. The data of Fig. 5 B were fitted using a double exponential equation to obtain the rate constants of 95 and 6 s−1 for the first and the second phase, respectively. These data are complicated by the signals from both the binding of IPP to the complex and the subsequent enzyme reaction. To interpret these phases of the stopped-flow data, UPPS (2.5 μm) preincubated with FsPP inhibitor (5 μm) was used to mix with IPP (20 μm) in a stopped-flow experiment. This is shown in Fig.5 C as a quick increase of fluorescence, which plateaus within 20 ms with an observed rate of 90 s−1. The observed rate is IPP concentration-dependent, indicating that it is resulted from the binding of IPP to the UPPS·FsPP complex. Measurements of the observed rate versus IPP concentration give a k on value of 2 μm−1 s−1 for the IPP binding. FsPP did not react with IPP during this short period of time, and thus, the two slow phases were not seen in the 10-s time frame of the stopped-flow experiment in mixing IPP with the E·FsPP complex. Apparently, the two slow phases observed in mixing the UPPS·FPP complex with IPP are due to the protein conformational changes related to enzyme reaction and/or product release. The stopped-flow measurements using the six UPPS mutants were performed. In these experiments, IPP (50 μm) was mixed with enzyme (1 μm) preincubated with FPP (10 μm) in the presence of 0.5 mmMg2+. Under this condition, W149F and W207F were found to show smaller but not zero amplitude for the stopped-flow signal compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5 D). These two Trp residues together may account for the fluorescence change observed in the stopped-flow experiments for the wild-type UPPS. Other mutants, W31F, W75F, W91F, and W221F, gave a comparative level of stopped-flow trace with that of the wild-type UPPS (data not shown). According to the crystal structure of UPPS, FPP was proposed to bind to the enzyme with its pyrophosphate group near the Asp-26, Asn-28, Arg-30, and Glu-198 area (11Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W.

The present site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that Trp-31 is involved in the FPP binding, probably through its hydrophobic interaction with the C15 carbon chain of FPP. W31F has a 5-fold larger FPPK m value without significant changes of IPPK m and k cat values. As indicated by our fluorescence quenching studies, the addition of FPP partially quenches the Trp-31 fluorescence, consistent with the fact that Trp-31 is related to FPP binding. On the other hand, W91F exhibited almost no change in the fluorescence upon the addition of FPP. Trp-91 is located in the α3 helix, which kinks to a larger degree when a hydrophobic molecule occupies the active site, as demonstrated in our E. coli UPPS structure (Fig.1 A). From the above data, it is mainly the Trp-91 fluorescence, which is quenched by adding FPP to the wild type UPPS. The binding of FPP may relocate the α3 helix toward the active site via the movement of the flexible loop 72–83. The quenching of fluorescence by FPP still occurs in the absence of Mg2+, indicating that FPP binding may not require Mg2+. This is consistent with our previous observation that the D26A mutation did not change the FPP K m value (13Pan J.J. Yang L.W. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13856-13861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Previously, Asp-26 has been proposed to provide its carboxylate group for binding with FPP via Mg2+ (11Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y., Li, X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We suggest that the tight FPP binding may result from the simultaneous contributions of several amino acid residues in the active site, especially hydrophobic residues such as Trp-75 and Trp-31, as indicated by the site-directed mutagenesis studies presented here. On the other hand, the binding of IPP absolutely requires the Mg2+ ion, as suggested by our data. IPP is proposed to bind to the site of Glu-213, which could employ its carboxylate group for the binding with Mg2+-IPP. The mutant E213A has significantly reduced IPP affinity, as indicated by its markedly increased IPP K m value (13Pan J.J. Yang L.W. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13856-13861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). According to our stopped-flow fluorescence studies, the IPP binding to the preformed complex of UPPS·FPP triggers the enzyme reaction with a three-phased fluorescence change; the first phase is due to the IPP binding, whereas the second and third phases are related to the enzyme reaction and product release. The intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-149 and Trp-207 residues likely contributes to these stopped-flow signals. Based on the crystal structure, Trp-207 and Trp-149 are located closely at the dimeric interface of UPPS. The side chain of Trp-207 is stacked with that of Arg-148 (next to Trp-149) from the other subunit. The conformational change during the enzyme catalysis represents a major one since it changes the fluorescence of the residues located in the dimer interface. Accordingly, the UPPS structure is flexible to allow the enzyme to catalyze multiple IPP condensations and the large product to exit the active site. In the UPPS reaction, a single FPP reacts with eight molecules of IPP for product generation. It is reasonable to assume that FPP binds the enzyme first followed by the binding of IPP. Our fluorescence quenching data indicate that FPP could bind UPPS in the absence of IPP. However, the addition of IPP alone to the enzyme fails to produce fluorescence change unless FPP (or FsPP) is preincubated with the enzyme. These results are consistent with the assumption that the binding order is FPP first, followed by IPP. The time scale of the protein conformational change measured by the stopped-flow apparatus seems consistent with the time course of the rate-limiting IPP condensation reaction for the conversion of C15 FPP to C55 UPP and further extension to C75. In this time course, the C55 product is formed in about 2 s, and then the C60 to C75 products are generated within 10 s (see Fig. 2B the supporting information of Ref. 18Pan J.J. Chiou S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The stopped-flow trace increases in 2 s and then decreases by the end of 10 s (Fig. 5). Compared with the single-turnover time course data (18Pan J.J. Chiou S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the two slow phases observed in the stopped-flow experiment may represent the conversion of C15 to C55reaction in the active site and the product release, respectively. The product release process is accompanied with the conversion of C55 to the extended length of C75 due to the slow product release in the absence of Triton (18Pan J.J. Chiou S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased fluorescence due to the substrate binding and the subsequent reaction might cause the formation of a “closed-form” UPPS, which provides a better interaction between the enzyme with the substrates and the intermediates. After the reaction, decreased fluorescence represents the shift of UPPS structure to an “open form” for the product release triggered by the crowding prenyl chain of the product since the bottom of the tunnel is sealed by the large amino acid residue Leu-137 (12Ko T.P. Chen Y.K. Robinson H. Tsai P.C. Gao Y.-G. Chen A.P.-C. Wang A.H.-J. Liang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47474-47482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This model is shown in Fig. 6. Our stopped-flow data provide an insight of the E. coli UPP reaction mechanism and reveal a novel intrinsic protein fluorescence change associated with the substrate binding, subsequent reaction, and product release. These fluorescent properties of UPPS in conjunction with previous site-directed mutagenesis and crystallographic studies allow the identification of the substrate binding site and measurements of IPP binding and reaction rates to be made. Furthermore, stopped-flow technology could be used as an alternative method of enzyme activity assay to the current way of using radiolabeled IPP. Therefore, this technology may be potentially useful in the search of enzyme inhibitor that could serve as broad spectrum of antibacterial agent since UPPS enzyme is essential in bacterial survival.

Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) is expressed predominantly in yeast internal membranes and fails to complement a yeast strain devoid of its endogenous H+-ATPase Pma1. We observed that phosphorylation of AHA2 in the heterologous host and subsequent binding of 14-3-3 protein is crucial for the ability of AHA2 to substitute for Pma1. Thus, mutants of AHA2 ,complementingpma1, showed increased phosphorylation at the penultimate residue (Thr947), which creates a binding site for endogenous 14-3-3 protein. Only a pool of ATPase in the plasma membrane is phosphorylated. Double mutants carrying in addition a T947A substitution lost their ability to complement pma1. However, mutants affected in both autoinhibitory regions of the C-terminal regulatory domain complemented pma1 irrespective of their ability to become phosphorylated at Thr947. This demonstrates that it is the activity status of the mutant enzyme and neither redirection of trafficking nor 14-3-3 binding per se that determines the ability of H+-pumps to rescuepma1.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used for many years as a heterologous system to assign functions to membrane proteins. Because yeast genes are easily disrupted, endogenous transport activities can be suppressed, which in several cases renders the yeast strain dependent on the transgene for growth.

Thus, it has been speculated that the deficiency in complementation of yeast transport mutants could be caused by targeting problems in this heterologous host (7Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G.

Plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase is an example of a protein that can be expressed in yeast to high levels in a functional form but often fails to replace its yeast counterpart, Pma1 (7Villalba J.M.

However, a large number of mutations in plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases that result in the ability of those pumps to rescue pma1 mutants have been identified (9Baunsgaard L. Venema K. Axelsen K.B.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most of these mutants have been localized to the C-terminal cytosolic domain, which comprises about 100 amino acid residues following the last transmembrane span (M10). Recently, an alanine-scanning mutagenesis through the C-terminal 87 amino acid residues of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2 ( A rabidopsis thaliana H+-ATPase isoform 2) revealed a total of 32 mutant enzymes that when expressed in yeast complemented a defect in the endogenous PMA1 (12Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mutants cluster in two regions, I and II, stretching from Lys863 to Leu885 and Ser904 to Leu919, respectively. The C-terminal regulatory domain of the H+-pump (the R-domain) is an autoinhibitory domain that interacts directly with regulatory protein 14-3-3. As a result of this interaction, the H+-ATPase acquires an activated state characterized by an increase in V max, an increased affinity for ATP, and a change in pH dependence with higher activity toward physiological pH (13Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The site of interaction of 14-3-3 protein with the plant H+-ATPase has been mapped to the extreme C-terminal end of the pump (14Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B.

Binding has been shown to involve the three C-terminal residues (Y946TV in AHA2) and requires phosphorylation of the penultimate residue (Thr947 in AHA2). In the present study we show that regions I and II are true autoinhibitory sequences and that both regions have to be neutralized concomitantly for complementation of pma1 to be effective. However, phosphorylation at Thr947 of AHA2 and subsequent binding of 14-3-3 protein, events that can be promoted by single point mutations, also lead to full activation of pump activity by a mechanism, which most likely involves disruption of an interaction between the two autoinhibitory regions and the rest of the H+-ATPase. This post-translational modification apparently is a prerequisite for the ability of this plant transporter to replace its yeast counterpart. We suggest that similar post-translational modifications are required for plasma membrane H+-ATPases to function properly in planta. The multicopy vector YEp-351 (17Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) containing the full-length cDNA of AHA2 under control of thePMA1 promoter (7Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate alanine mutants was described previously (12Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Double point mutants, carrying alanine at Thr947 were generated by PCR using 5′-CCT GAT AGC TGG AAG CTT AAA GAA ATT TTT GC-3′ as the forward and 5′-GGA CTA GTT TAT CAC ACA GCG TAG TGA CTG GGA GT-3′ as the reverse primer. As templates, plasmids pMP658 (AHA2), pMP706 (aha2G867A), pMP719 (aha2R880A), and pMP752 (aha2R913A) were used. Following digestion with HindIII and SpeI, the PCR products were ligated intoHindIII-SpeI-digested pMP658 (12Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) resulting in the generation of pMP832 (aha2T947A), pMP1030 (aha2G867A,T947A), pMP1031 (aha2R880A,T947A), and pMP1032 (aha2R913A,T947A). Deletion mutants were constructed as described (14Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The AHA2 H+-ATPase (plasmid pMP658) was tagged by introducing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to its N-terminal end (resulting in plasmid pMP1000). To produce EGFP, the F64L mutation (18Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar) was introduced into sGFP(S65T) using a PCR-based approach. A plasmid harboring the cDNA encoding sGFP(S65T) was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Sheen (19Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). A SacII restriction site was introduced upstream of both the EGFP stop codon and the AHA2 start codon using a PCR-based approach, without disturbing the open reading frames. The EGFP sequence was inserted between the XhoI restriction site and the newly created SacII restriction site of pMP658. As a result of the construct, an SAA tripeptide linker was inserted between the two components of the EGFP-AHA2 fusion protein, and also a CGG CCG CAA CA sequence was inserted between the start codon of EGFP and the XhoI restriction site of the pMP658 plasmid. RS-72 (MATa ade1–100 his4–519 leu2–3,112) was transformed and cultured essentially as described previously (20Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). In RS-72, the natural constitutive promoter of the endogenous yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase PMA1 has been replaced by the galactose-dependent promoter of GAL1. BecausePMA1 is essential for yeast growth, this strain only grows on galactose medium. Alternatively, AHA2 and its mutants were transformed into a yeast strain deleted in the 14-3-3 protein homologues BMH1 and BMH2 (RRY1216, a kind gift from Dr. G. Fink). The cells were grown and harvested, and plasma membranes were isolated on a sucrose step gradient at the 43/53% (w/w) interface as described (20Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation of yeast microsomal membranes on a linear sucrose density gradient (33–55% (w/w)) was as described (7Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was determined as described (20Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels and the buffer system of Fling and Gregerson (21Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). After electrotransfer of the proteins to a Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), proteins were probed with an antibody raised against the H+-ATPase, an anti-phosphothreonine antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or an antibody against a barley 14-3-3 protein. Alternatively, membranes were probed with 14-3-3 protein fused to cyan fluorescent protein for overlay assay as described earlier (14Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Yeast was grown on solid, synthetic media containing 2% galactose as the only carbon source and supplemented with adenine and histidine. 103 cells in 10 μl were spotted onto fresh plates containing either galactose at pH 5.5 or glucose at pH 5.5 or 4.5. Growth was recorded after incubation at 30 °C for 2 to 3 days. Yeast cells were fixed in 5% freshly made paraformaldehyde in culture medium for 15 min, gently spun down (5 min at 3000 rpm), and resuspended in 5% paraformaldehyde in buffer A (50 mmK2HPO4, KH2PO4, 0.05 mm MgCl2, and 1.2 m sorbitol, pH 6.5) for 30 min. After washing in buffer B (buffer A with mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5), the cell walls were removed by treatment in zymolase (in buffer B) at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing in buffer B the cells were mounted on polylysine-coated microscope slides (Teflon-printed multiwell slides) and air-dried. Cell membranes were permeated and denaturated by immersing the slides in absolute methanol at −20 °C for 6 min and in acetone at −20 °C acetone for 30 s. The slides were incubated in the primary monoclonal antibody (1:150) in PBS-BSA (phosphate-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin) for 30 min, washed with PBS-BSA, incubated with secondary IgG anti-mouse (decorated with Alexa 488) (1:50) in PBS-BSA for 30 min, and washed with PBS-BSA. The cells were mounted with anti-bleach medium (1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane) and stored in the dark under refrigeration. Observation and documentation with the confocal laser scanning microscopy was with fluorescein isothiocyanate filter setting (laser at 488 nm, beam splitter at 510 nm, and emission filter at 520–580 nm BP). For each mutant a complete stack of optical sections was recorded to find the median section where peripheral and internal localization of the antibody could be discriminated. Plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases often fail to complement mutations in the endogenous yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase Pma1. It has been suggested that this is due to a targeting defect because, following expression in yeast, plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases such as AHA1 (7Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and AHA2 (20Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar) accumulate in internal membranes. However, a small fraction of AHA2 can be immunolocalized close to or within the plasma membrane (20Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that at least a fraction of the ATPase is able to reach this location. Using an improved method for immunolocalization, we localized AHA2 protein to the plasma membrane in addition to internal membrane structures (Fig. 1 A). In the plasma membrane, part of the fluorescence was organized in what appeared to be a punctuate pattern. To confirm these findings, we constructed an in-frame fusion between AHA2 and green fluorescent protein and expressed the fusion protein in yeast. Fluorescence was intense in internal membranes surrounding the nucleus, an indication of ER localization (Fig. 2). Furthermore, peripheral fluorescence, indicating plasma membrane localization, was clearly evident and partially patch-like (Fig. 2). This indicates that use of the immunofluorescence technique revealed the correct localization of the recombinant protein expressed in yeast.Figure 2Localization of GFP-tagged AHA2 plasma membrane H+-ATPase expressed in yeast. A series of optical sections from the same cell is shown. Peripheral fluorescence is indicative of plasma membrane localization. In addition, perinuclear fluorescence, which is typical of the endoplasmic reticulum, is seen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Class C mutants of AHA2 are defined such that they readily complement pma1 (12Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We analyzed in more detail a corresponding mutant protein that carries a substitution to alanine at position Arg913. Despite its ability to substitute for the endogenous yeast proton pump (Fig.3), the aha2R913A mutant protein Pma1 showed a very similar intracellular and peripheral localization when compared with AHA2 (Fig. 1 B). The same localization pattern was also assessed for mutant aha2T947A (Fig. 1 C) and a double mutant aha2R913A,T947A (Fig. 1 D), which were both impaired in binding the 14-3-3 protein and unable to substitute for Pma1 (Fig. 3). Compared with AHA2, the pH dependence of aha2R913A and other class C mutant enzymes is shifted with higher activity toward neutral pH (12Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). This kinetic profile is typical for the plasma membrane H+-ATPase activated via displacement of its C-terminal autoinhibitory domain (13Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and might indicate a correlation between the activatory status of the plant enzyme and its ability to substitute for Pma1. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the activation state in a number of AHA2 deletion mutants with different ability to substitute for Pma1. Deletion of 3, 10, 30, or 40 amino acid residues had no positive effect on the ability to replace Pma1, whereas deletion of 92 residues fully restored the growth of the yeast strain (Fig.5 A). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of microsomal membranes followed by immunological quantification of AHA2 protein in the various fractions revealed that all deletion mutants were expressed to about the same level in the yeast plasma membrane (data not shown). Next, we used the shift in pH optimum as an indicative of AHA2 activation. Deletion of just 3 or 10 C-terminal amino acid residues did not lead to a changed pH profile compared with AHA2, whereas deletion of 30 or 40 C-terminal amino acids gave rise to a significant shift in the pH dependence of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5 B) similar to that seen in the complementing mutant, aha2R913A (Fig.4 A). Deletion of 92 C-terminal amino acid residues resulted in an additional shift of the activity profile toward alkaline pH. The data given above demonstrate that it is possible to generate regulatory mutants of AHA2 that appear to be activated but, nevertheless, are not able to replace Pma1. 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in the activation of plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases. To investigate the possibility that binding of endogenous yeast 14-3-3 protein might be involved in the activation of mutants of AHA2 expressed in yeast, plasma membrane-enriched fractions of yeast expressing representatives of each class of mutants were prepared. 14-3-3 proteins are soluble and therefore not normally associated with the yeast plasma membrane. Accordingly, plasma membranes from cells expressing either no ATPase or AHA2 contained little 14-3-3 protein (Fig.6 B). In contrast, membranes expressing class C mutants contained significant amounts of immunodetectable 14-3-3 protein (Fig. 6 B). Class B mutants, showing a somewhat intermediate complementation efficiency, had increased binding of 14-3-3 protein compared with AHA2 but not to the same degree as class C mutants (Fig. 6 B). It has recently been shown that binding of 14-3-3 protein to plasma membrane H+-ATPase is dependent upon phosphorylation of Thr947 in AHA2, the penultimate residue (14Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S.

Olsson A. Piotrowski M. Rosenquist M. Ottman C. Larsson C. Oecking C. Sommarin M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2391PubMed Google Scholar). To test the phosphorylation status of the recombinant H+-pumps, we used an antibody directed against phosphothreonine (Fig. 6 C). AHA2 and class A mutants were only marginally labeled. However, the antibody gave rise to a strong signal with class C mutants, whereas class B mutants were less intensely labeled. Provided that Thr947 is phosphorylated, plasma membrane H+-ATPase will bind 14-3-3 protein directly in an in vitro overlay assay (14Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To test whether direct binding of 14-3-3 protein to AHA2 is possible, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with 14-3-3 protein fused at the gene level to cyan fluorescent protein (14Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Compared with AHA2, class B and C mutants should have increased binding of 14-3-3-cyan fluorescent proteinin vitro (Fig. 6 D). Binding was further improved by the addition of 5 μm fusicoccin (Fig. 6 E), a fungal phytotoxin that is known to stabilize the complex between 14-3-3 protein and H+-ATPase. The aha2R913A,T947A mutant was not recognized by a phosphothreonine antibody (Fig. 7 B) suggesting that phosphorylation occurred at position Thr947. Mass spectrometry analysis (14Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) confirmed that Thr947 was phosphorylated in gel purified aha2R913A (data not shown). No other phosphorylated residues could be detected within the C-terminal domain of the mutant enzyme. Together, this suggests: (i) a direct interaction of the yeast 14-3-3 proteins with aha2R913A and respective mutants; (ii) that this interaction was the result of a phosphorylation of aha2R913A at Thr947; (iii) that the fraction of H+-ATPase molecules phosphorylated was significantly higher in aha2R913A and other class C mutants compared with class A mutants and the AHA2 protein; and (iv) that the increased ability to bind 14-3-3 protein of different point mutations correlates directly with their ability to substitute for Pma1. The phosphorylation status of class C mutants might be dependent on their cellular location. To test this possibility, microsomes from yeast expressing either aha2R913A or aha2R913A,T947A were fractionated on sucrose step gradients to partially separate endomembranes from plasma membrane-containing fractions. Only the plasma membrane fraction containing aha2R913A was able to bind 14-3-3 protein and could be recognized by the anti-phosphothreonine antibody (Fig. 7 B). Plasma membrane-enriched microsomes were subsequently run on a linear sucrose gradient between 33 and 55% sucrose to more closely characterize the composition of the vesicle fraction (Fig.8). In these experiments, yeast cells were allowed to divide only three times on glucose medium before harvest, to ensure that traces of Pma1 were still present in the plasma membrane. From overlay assays of the fractions it appeared that the form of aha2R913A, which is able to bind 14-3-3 protein, was specifically localized in a dense fraction of the gradient likely to represent the plasma membrane since it co-migrated with Pma1. However, aha2R913A protein as such was also localized in lighter membranes, probably representing endomembrane vesicles since it co-migrated with Kar2 (a soluble marker for the ER lumen) and Kex2 (a Golgi marker). The data given above suggest that (i) only a fraction of aha2R913A reaches the plasma membrane and that (ii) aha2R913A gets phosphorylated following exit from the ER. Class C mutants aha2G867A and aha2R913A complement the yeast strain RS-72, which does not express Pma1 on glucose medium (12Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that 14-3-3 binding is involved in activation of the AHA2 and its mutants in yeast, we employed double point mutants aha2G867A,T947A and aha2R913A,T947A, in which the 14-3-3 binding site had been destroyed. Indeed, these double point mutants did not support yeast growth in a manner similar to the aha2T947A substitution and AHA2 (Fig. 3). These data suggest that class C mutations have to be accompanied by phosphorylation of Thr947 to successfully complement yeast devoid of endogenous Pma1. The requirement for phosphorylation at the penultimate residue is obviously not met in the C-terminal deletion mutants that also complement pma1(20Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the possibility that complementation does not depend on the binding of 14-3-3 protein per se but rather requires neutralization of the autoinhibitory regions by direct or indirect mechanisms, we constructed the triple mutant G867A,R913A,T947A. This mutant carries a mutation in both autoinhibitory regions and cannot get phosphorylated at the penultimate residue. Indeed, this mutant was shown to fully complement pma1 (Fig. 3). The double mutant R913A,T947A and the triple mutant G867A,R913A,T947A (Fig.3 B) showed pH dependence and kinetic parameters very similar to the respective single point mutant R913A (Fig.4 A). Because binding of 14-3-3 protein to the double mutants is impaired, this would suggest that the changed kinetic properties of the class C mutants are not the result of the binding of 14-3-3 protein. To test this possibility, class C mutant ahaR913A was expressed in a yeast strain devoid of its endogenous 14-3-3 proteins (Δbmh1/Δbmh2) (Fig. 4 B). The pH dependence of ATP hydrolysis was again very similar to the situation in which the same mutant was expressed in the presence of 14-3-3 or when the binding site for 14-3-3 protein was destroyed (Fig.4 A). The results obtained here suggest that post-translational modifications of the plant H+-ATPase in yeast is a crucial component in determining the ability of this pump to substitute for Pma1 in the heterologous host yeast. Following expression of AHA2 and mutant forms of the enzyme, we observed a direct correlation between (i) the degree of phosphorylation of recombinant enzymes, (ii) the amount of 14-3-3 protein interacting with the enzymes, and (iii) the ability of the respective enzyme to support growth of yeast. The immunolocalization studies on the mutants indicate that the mutations did not interfere with the targeting of the protein during post-translational transport and that, despite accumulation in internal membranes, a fraction of AHA2 was delivered to the yeast plasma membrane. A GFP fusion protein also labeled both an intracellular endomembrane compartment as well as the plasma membrane. In the latter case, patch-like structures were apparent, furthermore, just below the membrane surface. At present it is unclear whether this punctuate pattern indicates a local accumulation of the pump in the plasma membrane or reflects the accumulation of vesicles or membrane sheets just below the plasma membrane. Deletion of only three amino acid residues from the C terminus of AHA2 results in the loss of the phosphorylation site and therefore yields an enzyme that is no longer able to bind 14-3-3 protein (14Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Therefore, none of the tested deletion mutants is able to bind 14-3-3 protein. Successive deletion of the C terminus demonstrated that deletion of 30 and 40 amino acids leads to activated enzymes as judged by the shift in optimum pH (Fig. 5 A). The deletion of 30 amino acid residues already had resulted in an enzyme with pH dependence similar to that of class C mutants. Further deletion, however, was necessary to produce an enzyme able to substitute for Pma1 to the same extent as class C mutants. Phosphorylation of the plant H+ pump apparently occurs in the plasma membrane of the yeast cells. Phosphorylation and/or the subsequent binding of 14-3-3 protein leads to activation in vivo. Only a fraction of the total amount of AHA2 expressed in yeast is localized in the plasma membrane. Therefore, in a mixed population, the increased activity of phosphorylated pumps able to bind 14-3-3 protein versus nonphosphorylated pumps impaired in binding 14-3-3 protein may be difficult to record. Thus, the amounts of nonphosphorylated pumps in the ER were consistently higher than those of phosphorylated pumps in the plasma membrane. Our results would suggest that it is not binding of 14-3-3 proteinper se that determines the ability of H+-ATPase to substitute for Pma1 but rather the changed kinetic profile of the enzyme, which can be brought about by either binding of 14-3-3 protein or neutralization of the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain. This hypothesis was confirmed by producing a mutant enzyme with a destroyed phosphorylation site and with both autoinhibitory regions modified. Although this mutant could not bind 14-3-3 protein and carried no deletions in its C-terminal end, it had an alkaline shift in its pH dependence and readily replaced Pma1. On the basis of the above results, we suggest that binding of 14-3-3 protein to class C mutants in the plasma membrane results in the additional activation needed to substitute for Pma1 in vivo. Thus it may be possible that the small population of mutant enzymes that is targeted to the plasma membrane, phosphorylated, and bound to 14-3-3 protein shows kinetic properties and pH dependence that are similar to the highly activated deletion mutant aha2Δ92 (20Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). This would resemble the behavior of tobacco PMA2 expressed in yeast (16Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In planta, it seems likely that phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding is required for plasma membrane H+-ATPases to function to the full extent. In line with this hypothesis it has been demonstrated that 2-fold overexpression of PMA4 plasma membrane H+-ATPase in tobacco does not lead to detectable phenotypes (22Zhao R. Dielen V. Kinet J.-M. Boutry M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 535-546PubMed Google Scholar), whereas expression of a C-terminally modified pump leads to increased acid tolerance of transgenic A. thaliana (23Young J.C. DeWitt N.D. Sussman M.R. Genetics. 1998; 149: 501-507PubMed Google Scholar). When mutants from class C were further mutated to destroy the phosphorylation site and their ability to bind 14-3-3 protein, the resulting mutants still revealed a substantial degree of activation, suggesting that the point mutations within region I or II per se resulted in a conformational change independent of 14-3-3 binding. This confirms the suggestion (12Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that regions I and II are true autoinhibitory regions. It seems likely that this conformational change is the primary effect, which allows for phosphorylation of Thr947 via a plasma membrane-bound yeast kinase and subsequent binding of 14-3-3 protein. Based on site-directed mutagenesis of Q943P,Q944S within tobacco H+-ATPase PMA2, it has been suggested (16Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that AHA2, which lacks the QQ motif but possesses the PS sequence, may not serve as the substrate for the yeast protein kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Thr947. As a consequence, AHA2, in contrast to PMA2, would fail to substitute for the yeast endogenous H+ pump. This reasoning, however, is not in line with our finding that mutations upstream of the phosphorylation motif can result in an enzyme with increased phosphorylation at Thr947. Our data suggest rather that when AHA2 is expressed in yeast, Thr947 is not exposed to the protein kinase unless at least one of the two autoinhibitory regions is mutagenized. One possible interpretation is that the major pool of AHA2 is not properly folded when expressed in the heterologous host yeast and that mutations within the C-terminal domain by some means allow for a better folding, which is required for subsequent post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation and subsequent binding of 14-3-3 protein). Thus, only a very small portion of AHA2 protein is phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation status changes significantly in activated class C mutants. In contrast, the phosphorylation status of PMA2 and its activated mutants is very similar (16Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Upon arrival at the plasma membrane, many transporters undergo phosphorylation (24Decottignies A. Owsianik G. Ghislain M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37139-37146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Estrada E. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Goris J. Merlevede W.

In several documented cases, phosphorylation occurs on serine residues, and some of the required kinases have been identified (26Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23608-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a number of cases, this post-translational modification is required for a subsequent modification, ubiquitination, that occurs at the plasma membrane (26Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23608-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Soetens O., De Craene J.O. André B. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4482-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this case, post-translational modification is a signal required for endocytosis. We have demonstrated yet another example of post-translational modification at the plasma membrane, which leads to the binding of regulatory 14-3-3 protein. As 14-3-3 proteins bind to a large number of eukaryotic target proteins including membrane-bound transporters, the ability of endogenous protein kinase(s) to recognize the 14-3-3 binding motifs might govern the activity of these proteins not only in heterologous systems such as yeast but also in their natural hosts.

https://openalex.org/W2047897241,"Duplin binds to β-catenin and inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby leading to repression of the β-catenin-mediated transactivation and Xenopus axis formation. To find an additional function of Duplin, yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out. Importin α was isolated as a binding protein of Duplin. Importin α bound directly to basic amino acid clusters of Duplin. Although Duplin was present in the nucleus, deletion of the basic amino acid clusters (DuplinΔ500–584) retained Duplin in the cytoplasm. DuplinΔ500–584 bound to β-catenin as efficiently as wild-type Duplin, but it neither repressed Wnt-dependent Tcf transcriptional activation in mammalian cells nor showed ventralization in Xenopus embryos. The Duplin mutant without a β-catenin-binding region lost the ability to inhibit the Wnt-dependent Tcf activation, but retained its ventralizing activity. Furthermore, Duplin not only suppressed β-catenin-dependent axis duplication and expression ofsiamois, a Wnt-regulated gene, but also inhibitedsiamois-dependent axis duplication. These results indicate that Duplin is translocated to the nucleus by interacting with importin α, and that nuclear localization is essential for the function of Duplin. Moreover, Duplin has an additional activity of inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway by affecting the downstream β-catenin target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2052531740,"Mitochondrial ATP synthase γ-subunit (F1γ) pre- mRNA undergoes alternative splicing in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner. Exon 9 of F1γ pre-mRNA is specifically excluded in heart and skeletal muscle tissues and in acid-stimulated human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, rhabdomyosarcoma KYM-1 cells, and mouse myoblast C2C12 cells. Recently, we found a purine-rich exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) element on exon 9 via transgenic mice bearing F1γ mutant minigenes and demonstrated that this ESE functions ubiquitously with exception of muscle tissue (Ichida, M., Hakamata, Y., Hayakawa, M., Ueno E., Ikeda, U., Shimada, K., Hamamoto, T., Kagawa, Y., Endo, H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15992–16001). Here, we identified an exonic negative regulatory element responsible for muscle-specific exclusion of exon 9 using bothin vitro and in vivo splicing systems. A supplementation assay with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells and acid-stimulated HT1080 cells was performed for an in vitroreaction of muscle-specific alternative splicing of F1γ minigene and revealed that the splicing reaction between exons 8 and 9 was the key step for regulation of muscle-specific exon exclusion. Polypyrimidine tract in intron 8 requires ESE on exon 9 for constitutive splice site selection. Mutation analyses on the F1γEx8-9 minigene using a supplementation assay demonstrated that the muscle-specific negative regulatory element is positioned in the middle region of exon 9, immediately downstream from ESE. Detailed mutation analyses identified seven nucleotides (5′-AGUUCCA-3′) as a negative regulatory element responsible for muscle-specific exon exclusion. This element was shown to cause exon skipping in in vivo splicing systems using acid-stimulated HT1080 cells after transient transfection of several mutant F1γEx8-9-10 minigenes. These results demonstrated that the 5′-AGUUCCA-3′ immediately downstream from ESE is a muscle-specific exonic splicing silencer (MS-ESS) responsible for exclusion of exon 9in vivo and in vitro."

Hydrogen turnover in hepatic metabolites begins with the transport of water across the plasma membrane (1Yano M. Marinelli R.A. Roberts S.K. Balan V. Pham L. Tarara J.E. de Groen P.C. LaRusso N.F. J.

Cytosolic water is then distributed rapidly among different subcellular organelles (3Lopez-Beltrán E.A. Mate M.J. Cerdán S. J. Biol.

Academic Press, New York1970: 116-215Google Scholar). The turnover completes when replaced metabolite hydrogens return to intracellular water through the same exchange reactions, eventually leaving the organelle and the cell. Classical studies analyzed the exchange between specific hydrogens of metabolites and those of the solvent, providing well established tools to investigate the kinetic mechanisms of enzymes in vitro(6Popjáck G. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Vol. 2. Academic Press, New York1970: 116-215Google Scholar, 7Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Similarly, tritiated or deuterated water were used to probe metabolic turnover of fatty acids and carbohydrates (8Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol.

However, the exchange of specific hydrogens from hepatic amino acids, like glutamate or aspartate, with hydrogens from intracellular water or its potential metabolic implications remained less explored. 13C NMR techniques have been used routinely in the last decades to investigate the turnover of individual metabolite carbonsin vivo or in vitro in animals and humans by administering precursors selectively enriched in 13C (10Künnecke B.

Notably, most metabolite carbons are attached to one or more hydrogen atoms, a circumstance which should allow to extend the use of13C NMR to analyze hydrogen turnover.

The quicker time scale allowed to resolve in time, faster processes than previously accessible to conventional experiments of 13C turnover.

During this perfusion period with 50%2H2O mouse livers maintained appropriate bioenergetics and metabolism (21Moldes M. Cruz F. Garcı́a-Martı́n M.L. Garcı́a-Espinosa M.A. Alvarez J. Cerdán S. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 731-740PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the perfusion, livers were freeze-clamped with aluminum tongs precooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until extraction. Perchloric acid extracts from these livers were prepared, neutralized with KOH, lyophilized, and resuspended in 2H2O (99.9% 2H) prior to high resolution 13C NMR analysis (12Moldes M. Cerdán S. Erhard P. Seelig J. NMR in Biomed. 1994; 7: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Total contents of glutamate, aspartate, and alanine of liver extracts obtained at the end of the perfusions were determined by automatic ionic exchange chromatography after ninhidrin derivatization (22Speckman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. Anal. Chem. 1957; 30: 1190-1206Crossref Scopus (6576) Google Scholar). Hepatic oxygen consumption due to alanine oxidation was measured polarographicaly using Clark oxygen electrodes located before and after the liver in the perfusion circuit, correcting for the basal rate of endogenous oxygen consumption (23Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Extracts from livers were analyzed (pH 7.2, 22 °C) by 13C NMR at 14.09 T (150.9 MHz) using a Bruker AMX-600 NMR spectrometer (Bruker Analystische Messtechnik, Rheinsteten, Germany). Acquisition conditions (150.9 MHz) were: π/3 pulses, 33.3 KHz sweep width, 128 K data table (1.97 acquisition time), 7.97-s recycle time, and ∼600 scans. To minimize nuclear Overhauser effects in quantitation, broad band proton decoupling was applied only during the acquisition. In addition, 1H-decoupled and 2H-decoupled13C NMR spectra were obtained from the same samples at 11.9 Tesla with a Bruker AVANCE 500 NMR Spectrometer operating at 125.76 MHz for 13C, equipped with a commercial crioprobe refrigerated with liquid nitrogen. Conditions were: π/3 pulses, 25.06 KHz, 64 K data table, 6-s total cycle time, and 4096 scans. 2H decoupling was performed simultaneously with 1H decoupling only during the acquisition, using the lock channel and a software driven lock switch. Chemical shifts were referred to that of a 10% dioxane solution (67.4 ppm) placed in a concentric coaxial capillary. At least four extracts from different livers were analyzed for every time point. Covalent binding of one or more 2H atoms to 13C results in the formation of 2H-13C couplings and2H-induced isotopic shifts which split and shift the perprotonated 13C resonance into characteristic2H-13C multiplets (5Garcı́a-Martı́n M.L.

Replacement of one geminal hydrogen by one deuterium splits the original13C singlet into a 1:1:1 triplet (19.21 <1JCH < 22 Hz) inducing a geminal isotopic shift (−0.25 < Δ1 < −0.33 ppm). Multiple replacements of geminal hydrogens with two or three deuterons result in additive isotopic shifts and 2H-13C coupling patterns of five or seven line multiplets, respectively. Smaller and additive isotopic shifts are also observed upon deuterium substitution of one or more vicinal hydrogens (−0.03 < Δ2 < − 0.11 ppm). Vicinally shifted resonances maintain the multiplicity caused by the geminal couplings since vicinal couplings to2H are too small to be resolved. Thus high resolution13C NMR allows to determine the number of deuterium replacements, their relative contributions, and their geminal or vicinal location with respect to the observed 13C carbon of specific 13C isotopomers through the analysis of the shifted and unshifted (1H,2H)13C multiplets (5Garcı́a-Martı́n M.L.

This is conveniently accomplished using the simulation program WINDAISY (Bruker Analystische Messtechnik, Rheinstetten, Germany) which allows the quantitative determination of the relative contributions of the individual (1H,2H)13C multiplets to the analyzed resonance. Fig. 1 depicts the model used for the analysis of the exchange of the H2 and H3 hydrogens from [2-13C]glutamate or [3-13C]aspartate with intracellular heavy water deuterons.

Optimal values for these parameters were estimated by nonlinear fitting of the kinetics of deuteration in the different (1H, 2H) isotopomers of [2-13C]glutamate and [3-13C]aspartate (cf. Fig. 5). Briefly, the system of differential equations was provided with an initial set of estimated parameters which was successively refined iteratively by minimizing the squared difference between calculated and mean experimental values of relative deuteration for every investigated isotopomer in each time point. For this purpose, we used the Stella package for simulations of system dynamics (High Performance Systems, Hanover, NH) as implemented in a desktop Pentium III platform and the BMDP package (BMDP Statistical Software Inc., Los Angeles, CA) as implemented on a Alpha 2100 mainframe computer (Digital Corp., San Diego, CA). Fig.2 shows illustrative examples of the time courses of 1H-2H exchange as detected in the (1H,2H)13C multiplets of the C2 carbon of [2-13C]glutamate (top) and the C3 carbon of [3-13C]aspartate (bottom) from extracts obtained at increasing times of perfusion with [3-13C]alanine in KRB containing 50% 2H2O. Similar spectra were obtained for the C2 carbon of [2-13C]aspartate, the C3 carbon of [3-13C]lactate, the C3 carbon of [3-13C]glutamate and, with significantly smaller intensity, for the C4 carbon of [4-13C]glutamate (not shown). All these resonances depicted evident (1H,2H)13C multiplet patterns revealing characteristic and time-dependent increases in deuteration. These spectra were obtained at 14.09 Tesla, a field which improved considerably earlier results both in terms of sensitivity and resolution (12Moldes M. Cerdán S. Erhard P. Seelig J. NMR in Biomed. 1994; 7: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, despite the high field used, more quantitative determinations of the kinetics of1H-2H exchange required deconvolution of the observed (1H,2H)13C multiplets into their individual components. Fig. 3 shows representative deconvolutions of the C2 carbon resonance of [2-13C]glutamate and C3 carbon resonance from [3-13C]aspartate, respectively. Deconvolution of the C2 carbon resonance revealed contributions from five different [1H, 2H, 13C]glutamate isotopomers: (i) [2-13C]glutamate as the unshifted singlet (55.50 ppm); (ii) [2-13C, 2-2H]glutamate as a triplet (1J13C2H= 19,2 Hz) shifted −0.32 ppm; (iii) [2-13C, 3-2H]glutamate as an upfield shifted singlet (Δ1= −0.07 ppm); (iv) [2-13C, 2-2H, 3-2H′]glutamate as an upfield shifted triplet (Δ1= −0.39 ppm,1J13C2H= 19.2 Hz); and (v) [2-13C, 3,3′-2H2]glutamate as a doubly shifted singlet (Δ1 = −0.14 ppm). Similarly, deconvolution of the C3 resonance from [3-13C]aspartate revealed the relative contributions of four different (13C, 1H,2H) isotopomers: (i) [3-13C]aspartate, as an unshifted singlet (37.30 ppm); (ii) [3-13C, 2-2H]aspartate, as a singlet isotopically shifted −0.08 ppm; (iii) [3-13C, 3-2H]aspartate, as a 1:1:1 triplet (1J13C2H= 19,21 Hz) shifted −0.28 ppm; and (iv) [3-13C, 2,3-2H2]aspartate, as a 1:1:1 triplet shifted −0.36 ppm. These assignments were confirmed in independent experiments, in which simultaneous 1H and 2H decoupling were applied to the same samples during 13C NMR acquisition. The use of simultaneous 1H and 2H decoupling caused the multiplets derived from 2H-13C couplings to collapse into the corresponding 2H-decoupled singlets, thus reducing the complexity of the (1H,2H)13C spectrum and increasing the sensitivity for 2H-13C isotopomer detection. This triple resonance experiment became particularly useful in the determination of the relative contributions of2H-13C triplets or higher order multiplets appearing many times with relatively low intensity in 13C specta decoupled only for 1H. Fig.4 illustrates this aspect by showing a representative comparison of 1H decoupled only (upper panels) and simultaneously 1H- and2H-decoupled 13C NMR spectra (lower panels) of the C2 glutamate and C3 aspartate resonances. The2H- and 1H-decoupled spectra depict more clearly resolved and with increased intensity, the singlet resonances corresponding to the 2H-13C triplets observed the proton decoupled spectrum of [2-13C, 2-2H]- and [2-13C, 3-2H, 2-2H]glutamate (t and st, left panel) or [3-13C, 3-2H]- and [3-13C, 3-2H, 2-2H]aspartate (t and st, right panel), respectively. The concentrations of glutamate and aspartate measured in the extracts were 24.7 ± 4.5 μmol g−1 dry weight and 8.85 ± 2.3 μmol g−1 dry weight (n = 6), respectively, and did not vary appreciably during the entire2H2O perfusion period. Oxygen consumption due to alanine oxidation under these conditions was 2.3 ± 0.3 μmol min−1 g−1 dry weight (n = 4). The relative contributions of specific (13C, 2H, 1H) isotopomers of [2-13C]glutamate and [3-13C]aspartate was determined as indicated in Figs. 3 and 4, in liver extracts prepared at increasing times of perfusion with 50% deuterated KRB and [3-13C]alanine (Fig.5). In the case of glutamate, [2-13C, 2-2H]glutamate production (t) was the fastest process, [2-13C, 3-2H]glutamate was produced slower (ss) and [2-13C; 3-2H′, 2-2H]glutamate or [2-13C, 3-2H2]glutamates (st or dss) were produced even slower but at similar rates. Concerning deuteration of [3-13C]aspartate isotopomers, the fastest process was the deuteration of H2 to produce [3-13C, 2-2H]aspartate (ss), while the formation of [3-13C, 3-2H]- and [3-13C, 3-2H′, 2-2H]aspartates (t and st) was slower. Taken together these results indicate that [2-13C]glutamate and [3-13C]aspartate are deuterated first to their (2-2H) isotopomers, the corresponding (3-2H), (3-2H′, 2-2H), or (3-2H2) isotopomers being produced successively later. We performed a more quantitative interpretation of the kinetics of2H incorporation into [2-13C]glutamate and [3-13C]aspartate by simulating the experimental data of Fig. 5 with the model shown in Fig. 1. This model describes the dynamics of exchange of the H2 and H3 hydrogens of [2-13C]glutamate or [3-13C]aspartate by intracellular heavy water deuterons, starting from the perprotonated molecules. The best fits for the kinetics of individual (13C, 1H, 2H) isotopomers, obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures,” are illustrated by the different lines in Fig. 5. A good agreement between calculated and experimentally measured values can be observed in every case. The apparent rate constants and input-output fluxes optimized in this way are summarized in Table I.Table IRate constants for 1H-2H exchange and steady state input/output fluxes of individual (13C,1H,2H) isotopomers determined from the experimental data of Fig. 5 using the model of Fig. 1Rate constant (min−1) or input/output flux[2-13C]Glutamate[3-13C]Aspartatek 1,k −10.32 ± 0.035, 0.56 ± 0.062k 2,k −20.1 ± 0.011, 0.05 ± 0.006k 3,k −30.035 ± 0.004, 0.06 ± 0.007k 40.035 ± 0.004k 5,k −50.4 ± 0.017, 0.5 ± 0.021k 6,k −60.3 ± 0.013, 0.2 ± 0.008k 7,k −70.2 ± 0.008, 0.23 ± 0.010f10.008 ± 0.0009f20.010 ± 0.0011f30.002 ± 0.0002f40.008 ± 0.0009f50.01 ± 0.0004f60.005 ± 0.0002f70.02 ± 0.0008Apparent pseudo-first order rate constants and input/output fluxes were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Apparent pseudo-first order rate constants and input/output fluxes were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Notably, the kinetics for the exchange of some of the hydrogens shown in Table I are significantly faster than previously measured values of turnover from the neighboring 13C carbon, indicating that these hydrogens turn over several times during a single 13C turnover (13Moldes M.

This is the case of the H2 hydrogens of glutamate and aspartate. In previous experiments of mouse liver perfusion performed under the same conditions, [3-13C]alanine-labeled the C2 and C3 carbons of glutamate with apparent rate constants of 0.07 ± 0.02 and 0.06 ± 0.01 min−1 and aspartate C2 and C3 with apparent rate constants of 0.15 ± 0.02 and 0.033 ± 0.003 min−1, respectively (13Moldes M. Cruz F. Chapa F. Cerdán S. Quart. Mag. Res. Med. Biol. 1995; 2: 5-17Google Scholar). 2M. Garcı́a-Martı́n and S. Cerdán, unpublished observations. Steady state 13C labeling of the glutamate carbons under these conditions is achieved after approximately 30 min of perfusion. However, the steady-state deuteration of these carbons is reached after 10–15 min of perfusion only (Fig. 5). As indicated in Table I, the exchange of H2 glutamate occurs with a rate constant of the order of 0.3 min−1, approximately five times faster than the turnover of the geminally attached 13C2 carbon. Moreover, in addition to the fast exchange of glutamate H2, it is possible to measure also a slower exchange process of the H2 glutamate hydrogen, occurring only in those glutamate molecules deuterated in H3′ (see [2-13C, 2-2H, 3-2H′]glutamate, st in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). This slower H2 exchange occurs essentially at the same rate than the exchange of both H3 hydrogens by deuterium (see [2-13C, 3,3′-2H2]glutamate, dss in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). A similar situation occurs with the H2 hydrogen of [3-13C]aspartate which exchanges approximately five times faster than the attached 13C3 carbon and presents additionally a slower exchange, occurring after one H3′ deuteration (see the production of [2-13C, 2-2H]- and [2-13C, 2-2H, 3-2H′]aspartate, ss and"

We investigated whether Ca(2+) signaling, a crucial step for T cell activation, was altered by prolonged exposure of Jurkat T cells to gp160. Microfluorometric measurements showed that Jurkat cells incubated with gp160 had smaller (approximately 40%) increases in [Ca(2+)](i) in response to phytohemagglutinin and had a reduced Ca(2+) influx (approximately 25%). gp160 had similar effects on Jurkat cells challenged with thapsigargin. We used the patch clamp technique to record the Ca(2+) current, which is responsible for Ca(2+) influx and has properties of the calcium release-activated Ca(2+) current (I(CRAC)). gp160 reduced I(CRAC) by approximately 40%. The inhibitory effects of gp160 were antagonized by staurosporine (0.1 microm), an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein kinase Cs (PKCs), and by Go 6976 (5 microm), an inhibitor acting especially on PKC alpha and PKC beta I. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (16 nm), a PKC activator, reproduced the effects of gp160 in untreated cells. A Western blotting analysis of PKC isoforms alpha, beta I, delta, and zeta showed that only the cellular distribution of PKC alpha and -beta I were significantly modified by gp160. In addition, gp160 was able to modify the subcellular distribution of PKC alpha and PKC beta I caused by phytohemagglutinin. Therefore the reduction in I(CRAC) caused by prolonged incubation with gp160 is probably mediated by PKC alpha or -beta I."

However, the exact biological role played by PARP or how PARP is involved in these cellular functions is still unclear. To elucidate the biological functions of PARP in vivo, we have constructed transgenic flies that overexpress Drosophila PARP in the developing eye primordia. These flies showed mild roughening of the normally smooth ommatidial lattice and tissue polarity disruption caused by improper rotation and chirality of the ommatidia. To clarify how this phenotypical change was induced, here we analyzed transgenic flies overexpressing PARP in the developing eye, embryo, and adult in detail. PARP mRNA level and the phenotype were enhanced in flies carrying more copies of the transgene. Developing eyes from third instar larvae were analyzed by using the neural cell marker to examine the involvement of PARP in cell fate. Morphological disorder of non-neuronal accessory cells was observed in PARP transgenic flies. Interestingly, overexpression of PARP did not interfere with the cell cycle or apoptosis, but it did disrupt the organization of cytoskeletal F-actin, resulting in aberrant cell and tissue morphology. Furthermore, heat-induced PARP expression disrupted organization of cytoskeletal F-actin in embryos and tissue polarity in adult flies. Because these phenotypes closely resembled mutants or transgenic flies of the tissue polarity genes, genetic interaction of PARP with known tissue polarity genes was examined. Transgenic flies expressing either PARP or RhoA GTPase in the eye were crossed, and co-expression of PARP suppressed the effect of RhoA GTPase.

Recent studies with PARP-1 knockout mice suggest that PARP-1 plays a role in maintaining genomic and chromosomal stability (13Wang Z.Q. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K.

PARP may play a role in developmental processes such as differentiation, cell proliferation, and programmed cell death. However, the biological role of PARP in Drosophila has not yet been determined. The Drosophila eye provides an excellent system, approachable with genetic and molecular tools, for understanding cell differentiation, proliferation, and programmed cell death at the single-cell level (18Bonini N.M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19Dokucu M.E. Zipursky S.L. Cagan R.L. Development. 1996; 122: 4139-4147PubMed Google Scholar, 20Royet J. Finkelstein R. Development. 1997; 124: 4793-4800PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiation commences in mid-third instar larvae with a wave of development marked by morphogenetic furrow (MF), which progresses from posterior to anterior across the epithelial field of progenitor cells. Anterior to the MF, cells are unpatterned, undifferentiated, and asynchronous (21Ready D.F. Hanson T.E. Benzer S. Dev. Biol. 1976; 53: 217-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). All cells are synchronized in G1 just anterior to the furrow, resulting in a signal to initiate differentiation (22Pignoni F. Zipursky S.L. Development. 1997; 124: 271-278PubMed Google Scholar). Posterior to the furrow, clusters of cells, which are destined to become the adult ommatidial units, undergo cell selection events during differentiation. As we recently reported (23Uchida M. Hanai S. Uematsu N. Sawamoto K. Okano H. Miwa M. Uchida K. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), targeted expression of D.PARP in the developing eye of Drosophila induced rough-eye phenotype. In this study, we analyzed transgenic flies overexpressingD.PARP in the developing eye and also in embryos, clarifying how this phenotypical change was induced. Our results indicate that overexpression of PARP interferes with the organization of cytoskeletal filamentous actin (F-actin) and disrupts tissue polarity. This study may lead to further insight into the role played by PARP-1 in differentiation, proliferation, and programmed cell death during development. Flies were cultured at 25 °C. Oregon-R and w1118 were used as wild-type unless otherwise stated. Mutant and transgenic flies includingGMR-p35 were from G. M. Rubin, fz1,fzR52, dsh1 and GMR-fzwere from P. N. Adler; GMR-RhoA (Rho1) was from I. K. Hariharan; and Df903 RhoAP2/CyO was from M. Mlodzik. Genetic crosses were performed at 25 °C. A full-lengthD. PARP cDNA was inserted into the multi-cloning site of pGMR (24Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pCaSpeR-hs (25Thummel C.S. Pirotta V. Drosoph. Inf. Serv. 1992; 71: 150Google Scholar), and pUAST (26Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to establishGMR-PARP, hs-PARP, and UAS-PARP, respectively. Transgenic flies were generated by P element-mediated germ line transformation as previously described (27Spradling A.C. Rubin G.M. Science. 1982; 218: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Transgenic lines were isolated with a single P element insertion on the second or third chromosome. To obtain transgenic flies harboring four copies ofGMR-PARP (w, GMR-PARP,GMR-PARP), standard genetic crosses were conducted. To analyze the effect of PARP overexpression in the embryo, stage 12–13 embryos were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, incubated at 25 °C for 2 h, and then fixed. To analyze the effect of PARP overexpression in the adult fly, a 1-h heat pulse was given at 37 °C every 12 h from the early third instar to the end of the pupal stage. Total RNA was isolated from eye- antennal discs of wild-type and GMR-PARP third instar larvae as described (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62868) Google Scholar). Northern blotting and hybridization, carried out as described (17Hanai S. Uchida M. Kobayashi S. Miwa M. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11881-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were analyzed with a Fujix BAS 1500 Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). RecombinantD.PARP protein was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified according to the standard protocol. PurifiedD.PARP protein was injected into rats following standard protocols, and unpurified serum was used for Western blotting and immunolabeling. For Western blotting, protein was extracted from wild type and GMR-PARP eye antenal discs from third instar larvae, separated on SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% gel, and electrotransferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein from ∼10 discs of each line was analyzed. Protein concentration was quantified by DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Rat antiserum was prepared against D.PARP and used as a primary antibody in immunoblotting. The primary antibody was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Samples for scanning electron microscopy were prepared by the critical point drying technique described by Kimmel et al. (29Kimmel B.E. Heberlein U. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 712-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For light microscopy, adult Drosophila heads were fixed and embedded in Poly/Bed 812 resin (Polyscience, Inc., Warrington, PA), and sections were cut as described by Carthew and Rubin (30Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cobalt sulfide staining of pupal retinas was carried out as described by Wolff and Ready (31Wolff T. Ready D.F. Development. 1991; 113: 825-839PubMed Google Scholar). To detect F-actin, 40-h pupal retinas and embryos were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin as described (32Wulf E. Deboben A. Bautz F.A. Faulstich H. Wieland T. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and analyzed using a confocal laser microscope (Leica TSC 4D Confocal System, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Third instar eye discs were immunolabeled using rat antiserum againstD.PARP, antibody against Elav (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City), antibody against Spalt (a gift from Rosa Barrio) or antibody against phosphorylated histone H3 (anti-phos H3 mitosis marker, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primary antibody was detected using the Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Third instar eye discs were dissected in cold Drosophila Ringer solution (D.Ringer) and cultured with 500 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) inD.Ringer at 25 °C for 1 h. Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 1 h, washed in PBT (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100), treated with 2 n HCl/PBT at room temperature for 30 min, washed in PBT, and then incubated in anti-BrdUrd antibody (Sigma). The primary antibody was visualized using ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories). TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) of third instar larval eye discs was carried out using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For targeted expression of D.PARP in the developing eye of Drosophila, D.PARP cDNA was placed under the control of GMR such that PARP was expressed only in and posterior to the MF (23Uchida M. Hanai S. Uematsu N. Sawamoto K. Okano H. Miwa M. Uchida K. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five transgenic lines have been generated by P element-mediated germ line transformation, each of which has a single transgene integrated on the second or third chromosome (23Uchida M. Hanai S. Uematsu N. Sawamoto K. Okano H. Miwa M. Uchida K. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using two independent lines harboring four transgenes each (w; GMR-PARP; GMR-PARP), PARP expression was analyzed in third instar larval eye discs of these transgenic flies by Northern blotting, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1). PARP expression was compared in wild-type flies and in flies harboring 2 (1 line) or 4 (2 lines) copies of the transgene. As shown in Fig.1 A, PARP mRNA level increased ∼5- or 10-fold in flies with two or four copies of the transgene, respectively. Because the transgene has two poly(A) additional signals, one from thePARP cDNA and another from the pGMR vector, the longer sizes of transcript were detected in the GMR-PARPs. PARP protein was also increased in flies with two or four copies ofGMR-PARP (Fig. 1). However, PARP protein does not increase in a transgene copy number-dependent manner. This result may indicate that the Western blot signal is not in the linear range of detection or is caused by poor titer of anti-PARP antiserum. Immunohistochemistry using anti-PARP antiserum showed weak PARP expression in whole eye antenal discs of wild-type flies. InGMR-PARP flies, PARP expression was elevated only in and posterior to the MF, as was the expected pattern of GMR-induced overexpression. The adult compound eye comprises ∼800 unit eyes, or ommatidia, consisting of an ordered array of eight photoreceptor neurons and an invariant array of non-neuronal accessory cells (31Wolff T. Ready D.F. Development. 1991; 113: 825-839PubMed Google Scholar). InGMR-PARP, the arrangement of ommatidia was disordered because of ommatidia with abnormal shape and size or because of fusion of the ommatidia (Fig. 2). This phenotype was more or less severe in flies with more or fewer transgenes (Fig. 2,B and C). Tangential sections of adult eyes (Fig.2, E and F) showed that the orientation of the ommatidia is disrupted in GMR-PARP. Polarity in theDrosophila eye is manifested as a dorso-ventral reflection of two chiral forms of the individual unit ommatidia. There is a dorso-ventral midline of mirror symmetry known as the equator, and the two ommatidial forms fall on opposite sides of this line (Fig.2 D, red line). In the wild type, there is a highly ordered array of an asymmetric trapezoidal pattern of seven rhabdomeres in the photoreceptors, but in GMR-PARP, it was slightly disordered (Fig. 2, E and F). Some ommatidia were rotated incorrectly and exhibited inappropriate chiral forms. In some GMR-PARP flies, a rectangular pattern of rhabdomeres was observed; this arrangement was also observed in flies with a tissue polarity phenotype and is caused by bilaterally symmetrical arrangement of R3 and R4 (Fig. 2 E,red). The number and morphology of non-neuronal accessory cells was analyzed by staining retinas from 40-h pupae with cobalt sulfide (Fig. 2,G–I). This analysis clearly showed an incorrect arrangement of non-neuronal ommatidial cells and improper polarity of ommatidia in retinas from GMR-PARP. In the wild type, there is an invariant array of non-neuronal accessory cells at the apical surface of the retina (Fig. 2 G). The number of non-neuronal cells was almost normal in GMR-PARP; however, the morphology and symmetrical arrangement were disordered and abnormal (Fig. 2,H and I). To examine the effect of overexpressing PARP on cell fate, developing eyes from third instar larvae were examined. In the wild-type eye disc from third instar larvae, neuronal differentiation occurs sequentially following the movement of the MF. The pattern of neuronal differentiation was examined using an antibody against the neuronal cell marker, Elav (35Robinow S. White K. Dev. Biol. 1988; 126: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The number of Elav-immunostained neuronal cells in the eye imaginal disc from GMR-PARP (Fig.3 B) third instar larvae was almost same as in wild type (Fig. 3 A), whereas the arrangement of photoreceptor clusters was slightly disordered inGMR-PARP. To investigate the ommatidial polarity in the eye disc of third instar larvae, the pattern of photoreceptors 3 and 4 (R3 and R4) was detected by immunostaining with antibody against the R3/R4 marker, Spalt (36Barrio R. de Celis J.F. Bolshakov S. Kafatos F.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the wild-type eye disc, the orientation of Spalt-immunostained R3/R4 cells is identical in all ommatidia, and a highly ordered array of R3/R4 is observed (Fig. 3 C). InGMR-PARP, R3/R4 cells were arranged with random orientation in each ommatidia, indicating that the polarity of ommatidia was disordered. These data indicate that overexpression of PARP affects tissue polarity, not cell number, at the initial stage of neuronal differentiation. During normal development, programmed cell death occurs in 10–20% of all cells posterior to the MF in the eye discs (18Bonini N.M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because PARP is proteolytically degraded by caspase-3 during apoptosis, it is possible that overexpression of PARP inhibits caspase 3-dependent proteolysis, which could alter apoptosis in the developing eye and result in a rough-eye phenotype. To examine the effect of overexpression of PARP on programmed cell death in the developing eye, TUNEL assays were carried out using third instar larval eye discs. As shown in Fig. 4, the number of TUNEL-positive cells posterior to the MF was slightly higher inGMR-PARP (Fig. 4 B) than in wild type (Fig.4 A). If the increased frequency of apoptosis disrupts ommatidial polarity of GMR-PARP, then inhibition of apoptosis should normalize polarity. This idea was tested by crossingGMR-PARP with GMR-p35 transgenic flies.GMR-p35 expresses baculovirus p35, which inhibits caspase protease activity and apoptosis in various species includingDrosophila (24Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2 × GMR-p35 shows slightly distorted but almost normal ommatidial polarity (Fig. 4 G). Misrotation and incorrect chirality of ommatidia induced in 2 ×GMR-PARP (Fig. 2, E and H) were not neutralized by coexpression of p35 (Fig. 4 H). In addition, the number of ommatidia and neuronal/non-neuronal cells was almost the same as wild-type (Fig. 2), suggesting that the extra unnecessary cell proliferation followed by apoptosis might occur and cause an increase in the number of apoptotic cells. BrdUrd incorporation and immunolabeling using antibody against phosphorylated histon H3 mitosis marker were carried out to analyze the cell cycle in third instar larval eye discs. No difference of DNA synthesis (Fig. 4, Cand D) and mitosis (Fig. 4, E and F) was observed between wild type and GMR-PARP. Programmed cell death and cell cycle regulation appeared normal, indicating that the aberrant tissue polarity associated with overexpression of PARP in the eye is not linked to abnormality in apoptosis or cell cycle regulation. It is possible that the aberrant morphology of ommatidial cells and polarity of ommatidia in GMR-PARP is due to abnormality of the cytoskeleton. This idea was consistent with the observation of the fact that the organization of cytoskeletal F-actin was disrupted in retinas from GMR-PARP. In wild-type retinas, the lattice of the ommatidia is regular, and the outlines of cone cells, pigment cells, and bristles are clear. F-actin is organized into neat bundles and forms a close spokewise pattern at the apical surface (Fig. 5 A). F-actin forms a star-like pattern in the middle plane at the center of the ommatidium (Fig. 5 B). There is an ordered petal pattern formed by the secondary and tertiary pigment cells and bristle complexes with the circular center of the photoreceptor axon bundles in the basal floor (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, these distinct patterns were not observed in retinas from GMR-PARP. In retinas from GMR-PARP, F-actin was disorganized in every cell. F-actin was sporadically organized at the apical surface, and a spokewise pattern of F-actin was almost completely absent (Fig.5 D). In the middle plane, some ommatidia lacked the normal accumulation of F-actin at the center, which is the precursor of the rhabdomere (Fig. 5 E). Cell morphology and arrangement of photoreceptors in each ommatidium were also distorted. Morphology was also disrupted at the basal floor with abnormal morphology and arrangement of secondary and tertiary pigment cells and bristle complexes (Fig. 5 F). If overexpression of PARP disrupts the tissue polarity and cytoskeleton, these effects should be evident in all tissues in the fly. This idea was tested by overexpression of PARP from the heat shock promoter inhs-PARP transgenic flies (Fig.6). Fig. 6, A–C, shows wing hair of adult flies with and without heat shock. Induction of the PARP expression disrupts polarity and the direction of wing hair inhs-PARP (Fig. 6 B). Aberrant polarity was also observed in several epidermal tissues of the adult fly including the notum, abdomen, and eye (data not shown). Heat-treated wild-type and nontreated hs-PARP were used as controls, and they showed no change in polarity (Fig. 6, A and C). Moreover, heat treatment during embryonic development disrupted the organization of cytoskeletal F-actin in the epidermis of the embryo, as it did in the midpupal retinas in GMR-PARP (Fig. 6, D–F). These results strongly suggest that the overexpression of PARP disrupts tissue polarity and disrupts the organization of cytoskeletal F-actin. Because similar effects are observed with different transgenic lines expressing PARP and with transgenes expressing PARP from different promoters, it is unlikely that these effects are artificial or are caused by mutations created at the site of P element insertion. The phenotype of GMR-PARP closely resembles the phenotype of mutants and transgenic flies involving the tissue polarity genes frizzled (fz), disheveled(dsh), and RhoA GTPase, which are involved in a single signaling pathway (37Shulman J.M. Perrimon N. Axelrod J.D. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 452-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Strutt D.I. Weber U. Mlodzik M. Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). PARP was tested for genetic interaction with these genes by genetic crosses betweenGMR-PARP and mutants or transgenic flies of these genes (Table I). Although, genetic interaction between PARP and fz or dsh were not observed in this experiment, interestingly, GMR-PARP genetically interacted with GMR-RhoA expressing RhoA GTPaseunder the control of GMR (34Hariharan I.K., Hu, K.Q. Asha H. Quintanilla A. Ezzell R.M. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Small GTPase, RhoA, is well known to regulate the organization of cytoskeleton and tissue polarity in developmental process of Drosophila (37Shulman J.M. Perrimon N. Axelrod J.D. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 452-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Strutt D.I. Weber U. Mlodzik M. Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar).GMR-RhoA flies have a rough-eye phenotype with dramatic disruption of ommatidial architecture (Fig.7, B and E). The retina is markedly reduced in thickness, and the lattices formed by secondary and tertiary pigment cells are completely absent. Pigment cells are restricted to the apical regions of the retina. As shown in Fig. 7, C and F, this phenotype was partially rescued by co-expression of PARP. InGMR-PARP/GMR-RhoA (w;GMR-PARP/+; GMR-PARP/2 ×GMR-RhoA) eyes, ommatidial lattices were observed, and pigment cells were distributed to deeper regions than in flies overexpressing RhoA alone. A distinct rhabdomere structure also appeared. Based on these results, it might be expected that overexpression of PARP would enhance the hemizygosity of RhoA. This idea was tested by crossing GMR-PARP with a deficiency mutant of RhoA, Df 903 RhoAP2. However, genetic interaction was not observed in this experiment (Table I).GMR-RhoA was crossed with GMR-GAL4 as a control experiment. The phenotype of RhoA overexpression was not affected by co-expression of GAL4 (data not shown).Table IAnalysis of genetic interactions between PARP and tissue polarity genesGenetic interaction1-aHeterozygous for GMR-PARP.fz1/+−fz R52/+−GMR-fz/+−dsh 1/+−Df903 RhoA P2/+−GMR-RhoA/++1-a Heterozygous for GMR-PARP. Open table in a new tab This study reports the result of overexpression of PARP in transgenic flies and, unexpectedly, this experiment showed that overexpression of PARP causes disorganization of cytoskeletal F-actin and disruption of tissue polarity. These data suggest that PARP may play a role in the developmental process inDrosophila. Although the rough-eye phenotype was modest for high levels of PARP expression, all of the GMR-PARP transgenic lines showed disruption of tissue polarity characterized by misrotation and incorrect chirality of ommatidia in eye. A rectangular pattern of rhabdomeres was observed in some eyes, which is caused by a bilaterally symmetrical arrangement of R3 and R4. This pattern is also observed in mutants in tissue polarity genes. Furthermore, planar polarity in various epidermal tissues was disrupted in hs-PARP. These phenotypes closely resemble the phenotypes of mutant or transgenic flies with alterations in tissue polarity genes (37Shulman J.M. Perrimon N. Axelrod J.D. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 452-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the effects of PARP overexpression is that it alters the processes of apoptosis and/or cell proliferation. However, in these experiments, no significant change in the apoptotic pathway or cell cycle was detected in GMR-PARP flies, and the number of neuronal/non-neuronal cells in the adult eyes ofGMR-PARP was almost normal. If PARP directly regulates apoptosis, then it is expected that these processes would be altered by overexpression of PARP. Although apoptosis increased posterior to the MF in GMR-PARP, overexpression of p35 to prevent apoptosis did not prevent disruption of tissue polarity. On the contrary, tissue polarity disruption was enhanced by p35 (compare Figs. 2 Eand 4 H), possibly because of inhibition of caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP. Although, it is reported that apoptotic fragments of PARP-1 inhibit DNA repair and transcription (39Yung T.M. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11279-11286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), disruption of tissue polarity in PARP-transgenic flies should not be induced by these fragments of PARP. Because the disruption of tissue polarity was not rescued by co-expression of p35. Apoptosis might increase in GMR-PARP flies as a secondary effect because of altered cell morphology and/or tissue/cell polarity. These results suggest that PARP may directly affect tissue polarity but is not likely to directly affect apoptosis. Recent reports show that PARP is a transcriptional co-activator (40Cervellera M.N.

It is possible that overexpression of PARP alters the expression of some genes which play a role in determining tissue polarity or cytoskeleton. For example, gene expression of some cytoskeletal molecules was altered in cells from PARP-1-knockout mice. (44Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M., Ly, D.H. Rosenthal D.S. Konopka G. Luo R. Wang Z.Q.

In these studies, the level of F-actin appeared somewhat reduced when GMR-PARP retinas and hs-PARP embryos were stained with phalloidin. However, it is not clear whether overexpression of PARP reduces the level of actin molecule, which might also influence organization of F-actin. It is possible that overexpression of PARP alters the expression of actin molecule or that overproduced mono- or poly(ADP-ribose) interacts(?) with actin (45Geipel U. Just I. Schering B. Haas D. Aktories K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the function of protein involved in cytoskeletal organization might be affected by PARP overexpression. Small GTPase, RhoA, is well known and well studied as a regulator of cytoskeletal organization. In recent reports, RhoA is considered one of the genes regulating tissue polarity in developmental process ofDrosophila (37Shulman J.M. Perrimon N. Axelrod J.D. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 452-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Strutt D.I. Weber U. Mlodzik M. Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Because the phenotypes of flies overexpressing PARP closely resemble the phenotypes of mutants or transgenic flies with altered expression of tissue polarity genes,fz, dsh, or RhoA, we tested for genetic interaction with those genes. Interestingly, the effect of RhoA overexpression was partially rescued by co-expression of PARP, indicating genetic interaction of PARP and RhoA. Although the mechanism of interaction between PARP and RhoA is not clear, this observation may be one possible explanation of the mechanism of disruption of tissue polarity and cytoskeleton by PARP overexpression. Although a loss-of-function mutant fly for PARP is not available, PARP transgenic flies may provide genetic evidence for the biological role played by PARP. Further mechanistic insight is required to understand why the cytoskeletal organization is disrupted in PARP transgenic flies. Biochemical studies using cultured Drosophila and mammalian cells are being carried out to address these questions. Our study suggests the involvement of PARP in cytoskeletal organization and the determination of tissue polarity during Drosophiladevelopment. This role may be mediated by an interaction between PARP and the signaling pathway in cytoskeletal organization. These observations were unanticipated, and they may have important implications for signaling processes that involve both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. These findings shed light on the biological role played by PARP and on cellular motility associated with cancer cell metastasis and invasion. We thank Dr. S.
