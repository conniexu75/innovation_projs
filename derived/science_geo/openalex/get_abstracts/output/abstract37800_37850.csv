https://openalex.org/W2037851765,"Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly. Several families have been described in which Alzheimer's disease is caused by an autosomal dominant gene defect. The chromosomal location of this defective gene has been discovered by using genetic linkage to DNA markers on chromosome 21. The localization on chromosome 21 provides an explanation for the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in Down syndrome. Isolation and characterization of the gene at this locus may yield new insights into the nature of the defect causing familial Alzheimer's disease and possibly, into the etiology of all forms of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2059658339,"The occurrence of seizure activity in human temporal lobe epilepsy or status epilepticus is often associated with a characteristic pattern of cell loss in the hippocampus. An experimental model that replicates this pattern of damage in normal animals by electrical stimulation of the afferent pathway to the hippocampus was developed to study changes in structure and function that occur as a result of repetitive seizures. Hippocampal granule cell seizure activity caused a persistent loss of recurrent inhibition and irreversibly damaged adjacent interneurons. Immunocytochemical staining revealed unexpectedly that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons, thought to mediate inhibition in this region and predicted to be damaged by seizures, had survived. In contrast, there was a nearly complete loss of adjacent somatostatin-containing interneurons and mossy cells that may normally activate inhibitory neurons. These results suggest that the seizure-induced loss of a basket cell-activating system, rather than a loss of inhibitory basket cells themselves, may cause disinhibition and thereby play a role in the pathophysiology and pathology of the epileptic state."
https://openalex.org/W2073865988,"The hormone-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 secretes transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which can be detected in the culture medium in a biologically active form. These polypeptides compete with human platelet-derived TGF-β for binding to its receptor, are biologically active in TGF-β-specific growth assays, and are recognized and inactivated by TGF-β-specific antibodies. Secretion of active TGF-β is induced 8 to 27-fold under treatment of MCF-7 cells with growth inhibitory concentrations of antiestrogens. Antiestrogen-induced TGF-β from MCF-7 cells inhibits the growth of an estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cell line in coculture experiments; growth inhibition is reversed with anti-TGF-β antibodies. We conclude that in MCF-7 cells, TGF-β is a hormonally regulated growth inhibitor with possible autocrine and paracrine functions in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065432160,"In postmortem studies of patients with schizophrenia, D2 dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia have been observed to be more numerous than in patients with no history of neurological or psychiatric disease. Because most patients with schizophrenia are treated with neuroleptic drugs that block D2 dopamine receptors in the caudate nucleus, it has been suggested that this increase in the number of receptors is a result of adaptation to these drugs rather than a biochemical abnormality intrinsic to schizophrenia. With positron emission tomography (PET), the D2 dopamine receptor density in the caudate nucleus of living human beings was measured in normal volunteers and in two groups of patients with schizophrenia--one group that had never been treated with neuroleptics and another group that had been treated with these drugs. D2 dopamine receptor densities in the caudate nucleus were higher in both groups of patients than in the normal volunteers. Thus, schizophrenia itself is associated with an increase in brain D2 dopamine receptor density."

https://openalex.org/W1973644988,"A new homodimer form of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), TGF-beta 2, has been identified in porcine blood platelets. TGF-beta 2 is homologous to ordinary TGF-beta (TGF-beta 1), which is also present in platelets. TGF-beta 1.2, a heterodimer containing one TGF-beta 1 chain and one TGF-beta 2 chain, has also been isolated. TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 interact differently with a family of receptors in target cells. A 280 kd receptor displays high affinity for both TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2. Occupancy of this receptor by TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2 correlates with the ability of these TGF-beta s to inhibit cell proliferation. In contrast, 65 kd and 85 kd receptors have high affinity for TGF-beta 1 but lower affinity for TGF-beta 2. The existence of distinct forms of TGF-beta that interact differently with a family of TGF-beta receptors could provide flexibility to the regulation of tissue growth and differentiation by the TGF-beta system."

https://openalex.org/W2043952976,"The term ""DNA fingerprint"" has been used to describe the extensive restriction fragment length polymorphism associated with hypervariable minisatellites present in the human genome. Until now, it was necessary to hybridize Southern blots to specific probes cloned from human genomic DNA in order to obtain individual-specific restriction patterns. The present study describes the surprising finding that the insert-free, wild-type M13 bacteriophage detects hypervariable minisatellites in human and in animal DNA, provided no competitor DNA is used during hybridization. The effective sequence in M13 was traced to two clusters of 15-base pair repeats within the protein III gene of the bacteriophage. This unexpected use of M13 renders the DNA fingerprinting technology more readily available to molecular biology laboratories."

https://openalex.org/W1992871476,"Transcriptional activation of gene expression by glucocorticoid hormones is mediated by the interaction of hormone–receptor complexes with specific DNA sequences called glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs) (refs 1–3, see ref. 4 for review). Deletion of this sequence abolishes glucocorticoid induction of transcription4–8. According to a current model, activation of the cytoplasmic receptor protein by hormone binding leads to its increased affinity for and translocation to the nucleus4. However, recent reports that the oestradiol and progesterone receptors are localized in the nucleus in the absence of steroid9–11 led us to examine whether the free receptor interacts in vivo with its DNA binding site in the absence of hormone binding. We used the genomic footprinting technique12–15 to show that changes in in vivo protein–DNA interactions within the GREs of the tyrosine aminotransferase gene (TAT) can be detected only after hormone treatment in hepatoma cells. Such changes are not detected in fibroblast cells, in which the TAT gene is not expressed. Many of the changes in dimethylsulphate reactivity observed in the living cell are also found in vitro using cloned DNA and a partially purified glucocorticoid receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1503629275,"Guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) was found to inhibit guinea pig liver transglutaminase activity as measured by [3H]putrescine incorporation into casein. GDP and GTP-gamma-S also inhibited enzyme activity (GTP-gamma-S greater than GTP greater than GDP). Kinetic studies showed that GTP acted as a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor and that CaCl2 partially reversed GTP inhibition. GTP also inhibited rat liver and adult bovine aortic endothelial cell transglutaminase, but did not inhibit Factor XIIIa activity. Guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic GMP, and polyguanylic acid did not inhibit enzyme activity. Guinea pig liver transglutaminase adsorbed well to GTP-agarose affinity columns, but not to CTP-agarose columns, and the binding was inhibited by the presence of calcium ions. Specific binding of GTP to transglutaminase was demonstrated by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azidoguanosine 5'-[gamma-32P] triphosphate, which was inhibited by the presence of GTP or CaCl2. GTP inhibited trypsin proteolysis of guinea pig liver transglutaminase without affecting the trypsin proteolysis of chromogenic substrates. Proteolytic protection was reversed by the addition of calcium. This study demonstrates that GTP binds to transglutaminase and that both GTP and calcium ions function in concert to regulate transglutaminase structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W2080261925,"We have examined the molecular organization of a region of mouse chromosome 17 that allows homologous recombination between wild-type and t haplotype chromosomes across a large inversion. We have used a combination of genetic mapping of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, molecular characterization of cloned regions isolated on overlapping cosmids, and subchromosomal restriction mapping using the pulsed field gel technique. Our analyses show that the wild-type form of chromosome 17 contains an inverted duplication of an element of at least 650 kb that is present in only one copy in the t haplotype form. Two chromosomes, th45 and tAE5, arose by homologous recombination across the element that is present in both chromosomal variants in the same orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2071971601,"The calcitonin/CGRP gene is a complex transcription unit in which developmentally regulated cell-specific alternative RNA processing results in the production of CGRP mRNA in neurons, and of calcitonin mRNA in thyroid C cells. Alternative poly(A) site selection and exon splicing lead to the production of these alternative mature transcripts. The wild-type and a series of mutated calcitonin/CGRP genes were expressed in heterologous cell types, which produced predominately calcitonin or CGRP mRNA. The results of these studies suggest that neurons express machinery or a factor that determines a specific alternative splicing pathway and consequently its associated alternative poly(A) site selection. It is hypothesized that a splice commitment regulatory factor might modulate pre-mRNA secondary structure, revealing a cryptic splice site required to generate CGRP mRNA in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1543342841,"An increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian cells requires a coordinated increase in the expression of a number of nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial proteins. To examine the regulatory mechanisms involved, we used specific anti-sense RNA probes to estimate the cellular concentrations of mRNA transcripts of two such nuclear genes in rabbit tibialis anterior muscles subjected in vivo to 10-21 days of indirect electrical stimulation. The unstimulated contralateral muscle in the same animals provided a base line for comparison. Change in expression of mitochondrial proteins was assessed in terms of the enzymatic capacity of citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase, which increased 2.1-fold after 10 days and 5.5- and 4.1-fold, respectively, after 21 days of stimulation. As a proportion of total cellular RNA, messenger RNA encoding subunit beta of F1-ATPase increased 2.2-fold over control levels after 10 days and 2.3-fold after 21 days; mRNA encoding subunit VIC of cytochrome oxidase increased 1.3-fold and 1.9-fold over control levels after stimulation for 10 and 21 days, respectively. These changes were not attributable to nonspecific effects of stimulation on all mRNA transcripts, since aldolase A mRNA decreased to 26% of control levels after 21 days of stimulation. Furthermore, mRNA transcripts from these nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins did not increase to the same extent as mRNA transcripts of mitochondrial genes such as cytochrome b, which increased 5.9-fold after 21 days of stimulation. We conclude that the increase in mitochondrial biogenesis induced by electrical stimulation of skeletal muscle is supported by pretranslational regulation of expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. There are, however, indications that translational or post-translational regulatory events may also be involved."
https://openalex.org/W2132993242,"Little is known about the pathophysiology of cerebral edema and other disturbances of water balance that involve the barrier tissues at the interface of blood and brain. The present experiments show that these barrier tissues contain receptors and second messenger systems for atriopeptins, recently identified cardiac peptides involved in peripheral water regulation. They also show that atriopeptins can alter the rate of cerebrospinal fluid production. Because the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers are involved in normal water movements in the central nervous system, these studies suggest that brain barrier tissues may be important end organs for the atriopeptins and that atriopeptins could have therapeutic application to disorders of water balance in the central nervous system. An isolated, purified population of atriopeptin receptor cells, obtained from choroid epithelium, was used in these experiments. This cell population may provide a valuable model system for investigating the intracellular biochemical mechanisms through which atriopeptins exert their actions."
https://openalex.org/W1903748805,"The tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the rat hypothalamus project to the median eminence and release dopamine from the axon terminals into the portal vessels. The released dopamine is transported to the anterior pituitary and acts to inhibit the release of prolactin from lactotrophs. About 50% of the tuberoinfundibular neurons have been shown to have estrogen receptors, and several research groups have shown that estrogen treatment affects dopamine release. Our interest is to determine, using an in vitro run-on transcription assay, whether acute estrogen treatment modulates the expression of the gene encoding for the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase, in a manner parallel to the values reported for dopamine turnover. We found that after 20 min of estrogen treatment in a 3-week ovariectomized rat that tyrosine hydroxylase gene transcription decreased to 40% of control and continued to decrease after an hour of estrogen to 5% of control. After 4 days of estrogen, tyrosine hydroxylase gene transcription increased but was only about 70% of control. In contrast to the bimodal change in tyrosine hydroxylase gene transcription in response to acute estrogen, we were only able to detect a change in the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA after 2 weeks of estrogen treatment, when a 2-fold decrease was observed. Similar results for dopamine turnover, as compared to tyrosine hydroxylase gene transcription, have been reported by others in that 3 h after a single estrogen benzoate injection, dopamine turnover was decreased, while after 3 days there was not a significant change. Therefore, it seems that the changes in tyrosine hydroxylase gene transcription after acute estrogen treatment qualitatively parallel the values reported for dopamine turnover, suggesting that the rate of transcription may be an index of neural stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1585084333,"A soluble Escherichia coli protease has been identified and purified to homogeneity. The protease cleaves glutamine synthetase which has been modified by mixed function oxidation; native glutamine synthetase is not a substrate. Using [14C]glutamine synthetase as a substrate (prepared by growing E. coli on 14C-labeled amino acids), protease activity was assayed by determining the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble material. The pure protease cleaves glutamine synthetase near the carboxyl terminus yielding 4,500 and 47,000 Mr products. The characteristics of this enzyme distinguish it from proteases previously purified from E. coli. These characteristics include a molecular weight of 75,000, alkaline pH optimum, lack of inhibition by serine protease inhibitors, and the ability to degrade insulin and casein. Oxidation of glutamine synthetase and other enzymes can be catalyzed by a variety of mixed function oxidase systems from bacterial and mammalian sources. Mixed function oxidation may be a signal or marker which consigns a protein for proteolytic degradation. Susceptibility to oxidation is subject to metabolic regulation, thereby providing control of proteolytic turnover. Isolation of a protease specific for modified glutamine synthetase provides the enzymatic basis for the specificity of this scheme."

https://openalex.org/W1501340647,"We have analyzed the interaction of phosphorylated oligosaccharides and lysosomal enzymes with immobilized bovine liver cation-dependent mannose-6-P receptor. Oligosaccharides with phosphomonoesters were the only species that interacted with the receptor, and molecules with two phosphomonoesters showed the best binding. Lysosomal enzymes with several oligosaccharides containing only one phosphomonoester had a higher affinity for the receptor than did the isolated oligosaccharides, indicating the possible importance of multivalent interactions between weakly binding ligands and the receptor. The binding of a mixture of phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes to the cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor was markedly influenced by pH. At pH 6.3, almost all of the lysosomal enzymes bound to the receptor; whereas at pH 7.0-7.5, approximately one-third of the material passed through the column, one-third interacted weakly, and one-third bound tightly. The distribution of individual lysosomal enzyme activities was similar to that of the total material. The species of phosphorylated oligosaccharides present on the lysosomal enzymes which interacted poorly with the receptor were similar to those found on the tightly bound material and included species of oligosaccharides with two phosphomonoester groups. Isolated oligosaccharides of this type bound to the receptor over the entire pH range tested. These findings indicate that at neutral pH the phosphorylated oligosaccharides on some lysosomal enzyme molecules are oriented in a manner which makes them inaccessible to the binding site of the cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor. Since the same enzymes bind to the cation-independent Man-6-P receptor at neutral pH, at least a portion of the phosphomannosyl residues must be exposed. We conclude that small variations in the pH of the Golgi compartment where lysosomal enzymes bind to the receptors could potentially modulate the extent of binding to the two receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1603442691,"The amino acid sequence of human lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase has been determined by degradation and alignment of peptides obtained from tryptic and staphylococcal digestions and the cleavage with cyanogen bromide and consisted of 416 amino acid residues. All of the tryptic peptides of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase were isolated and sequenced. Peptides resulting from digestion by staphylococcal protease, cyanogen bromide cleavage, or the combination of the two methods were employed to find overlapping segments. The N terminus of human lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase was determined to be phenylalanine by sequencing the whole protein up to 40 residues while the C terminus was identified as glutamic acid through carboxypeptidase Y cleavage. Cys50 and Cys74 and Cys313 and Cys356 were identified as the two disulfide bridges while the free sulfhydryl groups were located at positions 31 and 184. The N-glycosylated sites of the protein were assigned to asparagines at positions 20, 84, 272, and 384. The active site of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase was identified as serine on position 181 according to its homology with other serine-type esterases which have a common structure of glycine-variable amino acid-active serine-variable amino acid-glycine (Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly) with the variable amino acids disrupting the homology. No long internal repeats or homologies with apolipoproteins were found. The secondary structure is consistent with the results of predictive algorithms. A simple model of the enzyme is proposed on the basis of available chemical data and predictive methods."

https://openalex.org/W1600537577,"Mitochondrial respiratory activities in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei are developmentally regulated. The trypanosomes in the mammalian bloodstream derive ATP entirely from glycolysis. The trypanosomes found in the midgut of the insect vector or in culture at 26 degrees C have fully functional mitochondria with cytochrome-mediated respiration. In this paper, we show that the steady state levels of the 9 S and 12 S mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are 30-fold lower in an early developmental stage in the mammal, the slender forms, relative to the levels in the stumpy trypanosomes, a later developmental stage in the mammalian infection. Transcripts from three other mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b and subunits I and II of cytochrome oxidase, are undetectable in the slender trypanosomes and increase in the stumpy trypanosomes to levels approaching those in trypanosomes from 26 degrees C cultures. Transcription of other mitochondrial genes, including NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 5, is unregulated during trypanosome development. These results show that the level of some mitochondrial transcripts is developmentally regulated in bloodstream trypanosomes and suggest that the stumpy bloodstream trypanosomes accumulate mitochondrial transcripts prior to development of a functional mitochondrion. These results also show that the developmental activation of mitochondrial activities at 26 degrees C is not controlled at the level of mitochondrial transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1555738070,"Abstract Previously we have shown that beef heart mitochondrial F1 contains a total of six adenine nucleotide binding sites. Three sites exchange bound ligand rapidly during hydrolysis of MgATP, whereas three sites do not. The noncatalytic sites behave asymmetrically in that a single site releases bound ligand upon precipitation of F1 with ammonium sulfate. In the present study, we find this same site to be the only noncatalytic site that undergoes rapid exchange of bound ligand when F1 is incubated in the presence of EDTA at pH 8.0. Following 1000 catalytic turnovers/F1, the site retains the unique capacity for EDTA-induced exchange, indicating that the asymmetric determinants are permanent and that the three noncatalytic sites on soluble F1 do not pass through equivalent states during catalysis. Measurements of the rate of ligand binding at the unique noncatalytic site show that uncomplexed nucleotide binds preferentially. At pH 7.5, in the presence of Mg2+, the rate constant for ADP binding is 9 X 10(3) M-1 s-1 and for dissociation is 4 X 10(-4) s-1 to give a Kd = 50 nM. The rate of dissociation is 10 times faster in the presence of EDTA or during MgATP hydrolysis, and it increases rapidly at pH below 7. EDTA-induced exchange is inhibited by Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ but not by Ca2+ and is unaffected by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide modification. The unique noncatalytic site binds 2-azido-ADP. Photolysis results in the labeling of the beta subunit. Photolabeling of a single high-affinity catalytic site under conditions for uni-site catalysis also results in the labeling of beta, but a different pattern of labeled peptides is obtained in proteolytic digests. The results demonstrate the presence of two different nucleotide binding domains on the beta subunit of mitochondrial F1."

https://openalex.org/W1484203767,"The gene coding for the biosynthetic thiolase from Zoogloea ramigera has been isolated by using antibody screening methods to detect its expression in Escherichia coli under the transcriptional control of the lac promoter. We have located and determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The structural gene is 1173 nucleotides long and codes for a polypeptide of 391 amino acids; 282 nucleotides 5' and 58 nucleotides 3' to the coding sequence are also reported. By comparing the amino acid sequence data predicted from the gene with data determined experimentally, we have derived the complete primary structure of thiolase. A catalytically essential cysteine is located at residue 89. The DNA sequence presented has a very high G/C content, 66.2%, typical of the Z. ramigera genome. In the coding region, this increases to 68.2% and is strongly reflected in the codon usage which demonstrates a strong preference for G or C in the third position. Examination of the 5'-flanking sequence establishes that the NH2-terminal methionine is specified by an ATG codon, 7 nucleotides downstream from a Shine-Dalgarno sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1581243106,"A new method has been developed for the chemical modification and labeling of carboxyl groups in proteins. Carboxyl groups are activated with Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium 3'-sulfonate), and the adducts are reduced with [3H]BH4. The method has been applied to the anion transport protein of the human red blood cell (band 3). Woodward's reagent K is a reasonably potent inhibitor of band 3-mediated anion transport; a 5-min exposure of intact cells to 2 mM reagent at pH 6.5 produces 80% inhibition of transport. The inhibition is a consequence of modification of residues that can be protected by 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate. Treatment of intact cells with Woodward's reagent K followed by B3H4 causes extensive labeling of band 3, with minimal labeling of intracellular proteins such as spectrin. Proteolytic digestion of the labeled protein reveals that both the 60- and the 35-kDa chymotryptic fragments are labeled and that the labeling of each is inhibitable by stilbenedisulfonate. If the reduction is performed at neutral pH the major labeled product is the primary alcohol corresponding to the original carboxylic acid. Liquid chromatography of acid hydrolysates of labeled affinity-purified band 3 shows that glutamate but not aspartate residues have been converted into the hydroxyl derivative. This is the first demonstration of the conversion of a glutamate carboxyl group to an alcohol in a protein. The labeling experiments reveal that there are two glutamate residues that are sufficiently close to the stilbenedisulfonate site for their labeling to be blocked by 4,4'-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate and 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate."
https://openalex.org/W1480195675,"The beta-subunit of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase is synthesized as a precursor in the cytoplasm which is delivered through two bilayers bounding the mitochondria prior to its assembly with other proteins into a functional complex. In order to determine the role of the amino-terminal 50 residues of the precursor on its localization, maturation, and assembly, a set of deletions within this region of the ATP2 gene encoding the beta-subunit has been analyzed. These studies reveal that deletions between residue 10 of the F1 beta-presequence and residue 36 can still direct in vivo mitochondrial import and assembly of the mutant subunit into a functional complex. Deletions within ATP2 which contain less than the first 10 residues of the precursor are not imported. Thus, the extreme amino terminus (about half of the transient presequence) of the F1 beta-subunit can direct its mitochondrial import. The wild-type F1 beta-subunit precursor is matured by the matrix-located metalloprotease at Lys19-Gln20; however, small in-frame deletions up to 17 residues distal to this site fail to be matured either in vitro or in vivo. This nonmatured F1 beta-subunit is also assembled into a functional enzyme and supports growth of its host on a nonfermentable carbon source. These data indicate that maturation of the F1 beta-subunit precursor is dependent on a protein sequence located distal to the proteolytic maturation site which is distinct from the mitochondrial targeting sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2021200424,"We used a cholinesterase-mediated density shift protocol to investigate the movement of internalized transferrin (Tf) through endo- and exocytic coated vesicles (CVs) in the perfused rat liver. Upon internalization, exogenous 125I-Tf was found in endocytic CVs but not in cholinesterase-containing (i.e., exocytic) CVs (0–40 min). Between 1 and 2 hr, 125I-Tf began to appear in exocytic CVs. The origin of the exocytic CV was further investigated. After perfusion of the liver with asialotransferrin, the exocytic CVs were shown to contain resialylated Tf, indicating that the trans Golgi was the origin of this class of CVs. The resialylated Tf accumulated in the extracellular medium with kinetics very similar to the time course for appearance of Tf in cholinesterase-containing, exocytic CVs, suggesting that these CVs are directly involved in the transfer of material from the trans Golgi to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1622273370,"A single-gene nuclear mutant has been selected from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe for growth resistance to Dio-9, a plasma membrane H+-ATPase inhibitor. From this mutant, called pma1, an ATPase activity has been purified. It contains a Mr = 100,000 major polypeptide which is phosphorylated by [gamma-32P] ATP. Proton pumping is not impaired since the isolated mutant ATPase is able, in reconstituted proteoliposomes, to quench the fluorescence of the delta pH probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy acridine. The isolated mutant ATPase is sensitive to Dio-9 as well as to seven other plasma membrane H+-ATPase inhibitors. The mutant H+-ATPase activity tested in vitro is, however, insensitive to vanadate. Its Km for MgATP is modified and its ATPase specific activity is decreased. The pma1 mutation decreases the rate of extracellular acidification induced by glucose when cells are incubated at pH 4.5 under nongrowing conditions. During growth, the intracellular mutant pH is more acid than the wild type one. The derepression by ammonia starvation of methionine transport is decreased in the mutant. The growth rate of pma1 mutants is reduced in minimal medium compared to rich medium, especially when combined to an auxotrophic mutation. It is concluded that the H+-ATPase activity from yeast plasma membranes controls the intracellular pH as well as the derepression of amino acid, purine, and pyrimidine uptakes. The pma1 mutation modifies several transport properties of the cells including those responsible for the uptake of Dio-9 and other inhibitors (Ulaszewski, S., Coddington, A., and Goffeau, A. (1986) Curr. Genet. 10, 359-364)."
https://openalex.org/W1507301663,"Abstract Proglucagon is a polyprotein precursor containing not only glucagon and glicentin, but glucagon-like peptides-I and -II and an intervening peptide (IP-II). The glucagon gene is expressed in both pancreatic islets and neuroendocrine L-cells of the gastrointestinal tract. We have recently cloned an islet cell line from a rat pancreatic islet cell tumour that simultaneously expresses the glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and angiotensinogen genes. We investigated the potential role of second messenger pathways in the regulation of glucagon gene expression. Both the tumor promoter agent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and a diacylglycerol analog, 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, induced a 2.7- and 2.5-fold increase in steady-state glucagon mRNA levels at 24 h, respectively. The increase was progressive up to 24 h and was specific for glucagon mRNA; the insulin and somatostatin mRNA levels remained unchanged. An inactive phorbol ester, 4 beta-phorbol 12,13,20-triacetate, was without effect. The glucagon mRNA increase induced by PMA was mediated through an increase in glucagon gene transcription reaching maximal stimulation at 30-60 min. Glucagon mRNA half-life was similar in both control and PMA-treated cells, approximating 12 h. The stimulation of glucagon gene transcription was accompanied by a corresponding 3-fold increase in proglucagon biosynthesis. Neither dibutyryl cAMP nor glucocorticoids affected glucagon mRNA levels, while inducing a 5-fold increase in somatostatin mRNA levels and 4.8-fold stimulation in angiotensinogen mRNA at 24 h, respectively. We conclude that expression of the glucagon gene in this islet cell line is regulated at the level of transcription through a protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme)-activated pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1497248427,"Following a brief period of heat stress, the two highly conserved mammalian stress proteins, hsp68 and 70, were examined with respect to their intracellular locations. In four independent cell lines, hsp68 and 70 were found to partition into both Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble fractions as assessed by two-dimensional gel analysis of newly synthesized polypeptides, whereas a fifth cell line showed these proteins only in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. In addition, a previously described cell fractionation technique was utilized to gain information regarding the segregation of the two major mammalian stress proteins, hsp68 and 70, into distinct biochemically and morphologically characterized subcellular compartments of PtK2-epithelial cells. Two cytoskeletal-specific agents, taxol and colchicine, were also probed for their effects on the disposition of these polypeptides. Under our conditions of acute heat exposure, hsp68, 70 and their isoforms were globally distributed in all subcellular fractions examined, with a few notable exceptions in drug-treated cells. Colchicine, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, inhibited the association of hsp68 and its variants with the double-detergent-extractable labile cytoskeleton, whereas taxol, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, in some manner, facilitated the transit of hsp68 and its isovariants from a cytoplasmic to nuclear domain. Degree of cell density is a factor which influences the synthesis of various cytoskeletal proteins; therefore, we studied the effect of cell confluency on the disposition of mammalian stress proteins hsp68 and 70 in human FS-4 fibroblasts. In confluent cultures, where cell-cell contact was maximal, we observed the appearance of a previously undetected polypeptide which was not found in sparsely populated cultures. This protein may represent a post-translationally modified isoform of a preexisting heat shock protein, or perhaps, a novel stress protein."
https://openalex.org/W1596095700,"We have examined intermediate Pi-water oxygen exchange during [gamma-18O]ATP hydrolysis by the F1 adenosine triphosphatase from Escherichia coli K-12. Water oxygen incorporation into each Pi released was increased as ATP concentration was lowered as observed previously for the same reaction catalyzed by the enzyme from eukaryotic sources. Heterogeneous distributions of 18O in product Pi were produced by coexisting epsilon subunit-replete and epsilon subunit-depleted enzyme molecules. The epsilon-replete enzyme showed a much higher probability for oxygen exchange. These data imply that the epsilon subunit inhibits net ATP hydrolysis by imposing conformational constraints which reduce the cooperative conformational interactions that promote ADP and Pi release. Four enzyme variants altered in alpha or beta subunit structure with reduced net hydrolytic activity showed sharply increased oxygen exchange during ATP hydrolysis. Heterogeneity was apparent in the 18O distribution of the product Pi, however. That behavior could reflect hindered conformational interactions and/or increased affinity of the alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta complex for the epsilon subunit. In contrast, enzyme from mutant uncA401 showed very little oxygen exchange accompanying hydrolysis of 20 microM ATP. This is the only enzyme so far reported with this unusual property. Its rate limitation appears to be in the hydrolytic rather than the product release step of the catalytic sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1514146299,"Thrombin activation of platelets induces the release of a high molecular weight glycoprotein, thrombospondin. On treatment with factor XIII transglutaminase and [3H]putrescine, thrombospondin undergoes specific incorporation of this labeled amine, with 2-3 mol of putrescine being incorporated per mol of thrombospondin. Analysis of plasmin digests of [3H]putrescine-thrombospondin showed that the Mr 53,000-core peptide contains the glutamine site for amine incorporation. In the absence of amine substrate, thrombospondin was found to provide both donor (glutamine) and acceptor (lysine) sites for intermolecular cross-links by factors XIIIa, and high molecular weight protein complexes were formed. Homopolymers of thrombospondin were also observed by electron microscopy. Thrombin-cleaved thrombospondin has more cross-linking sites accessible for [3H]putrescine incorporation or for cross-linkage to itself than does the uncleaved native protein. Examination of thrombospondin cross-linkage in the presence of other protein substrates (fibronectin, collagen, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor) for factor XIIIa, resulted in reduced thrombospondin polymer formation. Electron microscopy and autoradiography of fibrin clots formed in the presence of 125I-thrombospondin showed an association of thrombospondin with fibrin fibrils. However, confirmation that this association involves covalent epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysyl cross-links between thrombospondin and fibrin was not obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1495205460,"A 50-kDa polypeptide that is rapidly phosphorylated on addition of [gamma-32P]ATP to isolated clathrin-coated vesicles is shown here to be identical to the 50-kDa component (AP50) of the clathrin assembly protein (AP), a complex that promotes the assembly of clathrin coat structures under physiological conditions of pH and ionic strength. Phosphorylation of the AP50 occurred readily at 0 degrees C, almost exclusively on a threonyl residue(s). This reaction is attributable to autophosphorylation, since the AP50 was able to covalently incorporate 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP after separation by either one- or two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Kinetic studies in solution were consistent with an intramolecular phosphorylation event; in addition, a concentration-dependent increase in AP50 phosphorylation was observed that may reflect intermolecular AP-AP activation of autophosphorylation. The phosphorylated AP50 was resistant to several inorganic phosphatases tested but was a substrate for protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, suggesting that a physiological phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle may exist. The phosphorylation state of the AP50 did not affect the ability of the AP to promote in vitro clathrin coat assembly. These and other data suggest that unique structural domains of the assembly protein are responsible for assembly (the 100-kDa components) and autophosphorylation (the AP50) and that the latter may be active as a protein kinase in the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W1525684717,"A mutation of the b subunit of the Escherichia coli proton-translocating ATPase and mutations in the gene for the a subunit that suppress its effects have been previously described (Kumamoto, C., and Simoni, R. D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10037-10042). In this paper, we describe the characterization of a new mutation that partially suppresses the effects of the original b mutation. The new suppressor mutation causes the substitution of serine for alanine at position 62 of the c subunit. Biochemical studies of double mutants, carrying both b and c mutations, demonstrate that the c mutation partially restores the function of the enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1494651252,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase and its associated kinase have been purified to homogeneity from rat liver and, together with the catalytic subunit of liver protein phosphatase, used to study the effect of phosphorylation on the carboxylase activity. Phosphatase increases the carboxylase activity, whereas the kinase decreases it. A linear inverse relationship (correlation coefficient = 0.98) exists between phosphate incorporated by the kinase and the specific activity. The kinetics of activation by citrate show an increased Ka and a decreased Vmax for carboxylase preparations with increasing levels of phosphate. On this basis an enzymic test was devised for phosphate incorporated by the kinase. Thus the ratio of activities at 0 and 2 mM citrate is inversely proportional to the phosphate incorporated (correlation coefficient = -0.95), with 0.8 mol of P incorporated per mol of subunit decreasing the activity ratio from 0.5 to 0. This activity ratio method has an inherent internal control which makes it suitable for determining the level of protein-bound phosphate affecting the carboxylase activity in crude tissue extracts, and hence it should be useful for physiological studies. Tryptic maps of carboxylase labeled with radioactive phosphate by the carboxylase kinase indicate that the slightly less than 1 mol of P/mol of subunit is distributed equally between two peptides, whereas cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates these two sites and a third which may not affect activity."
https://openalex.org/W1584802918,"Glutamine synthetase of plants is the physiological target of tabtoxinine-beta-lactam, a toxin produced by several disease-causing pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae. This toxin, a unique amino acid, is an active site-directed, irreversible inhibitor of glutamine synthetase from pea. ATP is required for inactivation. Neither ADP, AMP, nor adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate (AMP-PCP) supports inactivation. Adenyl-5'-yl imidophosphate (AMP-PNP) is slowly hydrolyzed by glutamine synthetase to produce adenyl-5'-yl phosphoramidate (AMP-PN) and inorganic phosphate as identified by 31P NMR spectroscopic analysis. AMP-PNP also supports a slow inactivation of glutamine synthetase by tabtoxinine-beta-lactam. These data are consistent with gamma-phosphate transfer being involved in the inactivation. Completely inactivated glutamine synthetase has 0.9 mumol of toxin bound/mumol of subunit. One mumol of ATP is bound per mumol of subunit of glutamine synthetase in the absence of either the toxin or another active site-directed inhibitor, methionine sulfoximine; whereas, a 2nd mumol of either [alpha- or gamma-32P]ATP is bound per mumol of subunit when glutamine synthetase is incubated in the presence of either toxin or methionine sulfoximine until all enzyme activity is lost. These data suggest that the gamma-phosphate hydrolyzed from ATP during inactivation remains with the enzyme-inhibitor complex, as well as the ADP. The open chain form, tabtoxinine, was neither a reversible nor an irreversible inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, suggesting that the beta-lactam ring is necessary for inhibition. The inactivation of glutamine synthetase with tabtoxinine-beta-lactam is pseudo-first-order when done in buffer containing 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The rate constant for this reaction is 3 X 10(-2) S-1, and the Ki for the toxin is 1 mM. Removal of the ethylene glycol from the buffer allows the reaction to proceed in a non-first-order manner with the apparent rate constant decreasing with time. As the enzyme is inactivated in these conditions, the binding affinity for the toxin appears to decrease, while the Km observed for glutamate does not change."
https://openalex.org/W1691673438,"The plasma membrane of yeasts contains an H+-ATPase similar to the other cation transport ATPases of eukaryotic organisms. This enzyme has been purified and shows H+ transport in reconstituted vesicles. In the presence of Mg2+, formycin triphosphate (FTP) is hydrolyzed by the H+-ATPase and supports H+ transport. When combined with terbium ion, FTP (Tb-FTP) and ATP (Tb-ATP) are no longer hydrolyzed. Competition between Mg-ATP and Tb-FTP for ATP hydrolysis indicates that terbium-associated nucleotides bind to the catalytic site of the H+-ATPase. The fluorescent properties of the Tb-FTP complex were used to study the active site of the H+-ATPase. Fluorescence of Tb-FTP is greatly enhanced upon binding into the nucleotide site of H+-ATPase with a dissociation constant of 1 microM. Tb-ATP, Tb-ADP, and Tb-ITP are competitive inhibitors of Tb-FTP binding with Ki = 4.5, 5.0, and 6.0 microM, respectively. Binding of Tb-FTP is observed only in the presence of an excess of Tb3+ with an activation constant Ka = 25 microM for Tb3+. Analysis of the data reveals that the sites for Tb-FTP and Tb3+ binding are independent entities. In standard conditions these sites would be occupied by Mg-ATP and Mg2+, respectively. These findings suggest an important regulatory role of divalent cations on the activity of H+-ATPase. Replacement of H2O by D2O in the medium suggests the existence of two types of nucleotide binding sites differing by the hydration state of the Tb3+ ion in the bound Tb-FTP complex."
