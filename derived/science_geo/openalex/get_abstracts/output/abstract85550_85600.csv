https://openalex.org/W1528288950,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor from bovine cerebral cortex was solubilized with sodium deoxycholate and purified by affinity chromatography on benzodiazepine-agarose and ion exchange chromatography. The benzodiazepine binding protein was enriched 1800-fold. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol showed the presence of two major bands of Mr = 57,000 and 53,000. [3H]Flunitrazepam, after UV irradiation, was incorporated irreversibly into both bands of the isolated protein. A high affinity binding site for gamma-aminobutyric acid was co-purified with the benzodiazepine binding site and the two sites were shown to reside on the same physical structure. The dissociation constants were 10 +/- 4 nM for [3H] flunitrazepam and 12 +/- 3 nM for the gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist [3H]muscimol. The maximum specific activity for [3H] muscimol binding was 4.3 nmol/mg of protein. The ratio of [3H]muscimol to [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites was between 3 and 4. Gel filtration and sucrose density gradient sedimentation studies gave a Stokes radius of 7.3 +/- 0.5 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 11.1 +/- 0.3 S, respectively. The purified complex had a pharmacological profile that corresponds to the receptor specificity found in membranes and crude soluble extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1597402402,"We have determined the absolute phosphate content of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and established that phosphorylation inhibits the actin filament cross-linking activity of MAPs and both of the major MAP components, MAP-2 and tau. Similar results were obtained with actin from rabbit muscle, hog brain, and Acanthamoeba castellanii. We used the endogenous phosphatases and kinases in hog brain microtubule protein to modulate MAP phosphate level before isolating heat-stable MAPs. MAPs isolated directly from twice-cycled microtubule protein contain 7.1 +/- 0.1 (S.E.) mol of phosphate/300,000 g protein. After incubating microtubule protein without ATP, MAPs, had 4.9 +/- 0.6 phosphates. After incubating microtubule protein with 1 mM ATP and 5 microM cAMP in 2 mM EGTA, MAPs had 8.6 +/- 0.5 phosphates but there was also exchange of three more [32P]phosphates from gamma-labeled ATP for preexisting MAP phosphate. Incubation of microtubule protein with ATP and cAMP in 5 mM CaCl2 resulted in exchange but no net addition of phosphate to MAPs. We fractionated the MAP preparations by gel filtration and obtained MAP-2 with 4.3 to 7.5 and tau with 1.5 to 2.2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein depending on how we treated the microtubule protein prior to MAP isolation. The actin filament cross-linking activity of whole MAPs, MAP-2, and tau depended on the MAP-phosphate content. In all cases, phosphorylation of MAPs inhibited actin filament cross-linking activity. The concentration of high phosphate MAPs required to form a high viscosity solution with actin filaments was 2 to 4 times more than that of low phosphate. MAPs. During incubation of microtubule protein with [gamma-32P]ATP, only MAP peptides are labeled. Treatment of these MAPs with either acid or alkaline phosphatase removes phosphate mainly from MAP-2, with an increase in actin filament cross-linking activity. Thus, both MAP phosphorylation and the effect of phosphorylation on actin cross-linking activity of MAPs are reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1530423872,"The DNA sequence of the ompC gene which encodes one of the outer membrane porins has been determined. The gene appears to encode a secretory precursor of OmpC protein consisting of a total of 367 amino acid residues with a signal peptide of 21 amino acid residues at its NH2-terminal end. The 5' end noncoding region including the promoter of the ompC gene is extremely [A-T]-rich, and the codon usage in the ompC gene is unusual as are those in genes for other abundant outer membrane proteins. The promoter sequence of the ompC gene was compared with that of the ompF gene, both of which are controlled by the osmoregulatory operon, ompB. The deduced amino acid sequence of the OmpC protein showed extensive homology with that of the other porins (OmpF and PhoE proteins). The homology in the primary amino acid sequences, as well as the coding DNA sequences among the porins, indicates that the structural genes for the three porins evolved from a common ancestral gene. Comparison of the amino acid sequences among the OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE porins will be discussed with regard to structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1671239779,"The mechanism by which fatty acids stimulate the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine has been studied in cultured rat hepatocytes. Long chain fatty acids (1 mM) stimulated approximately 1.9-fold [methyl-3H] choline incorporation from phosphocholine into phosphatidylcholine by isolated hepatocytes. Oleate and palmitate (4 mM) enhanced phosphatidylcholine production by 3- and 2.2-fold, respectively. Stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by oleate was evident within 30 min after addition of the fatty acid to the hepatocyte medium. The effect could be correlated with a doubling of the microsomal CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity. Additional evidence for a direct effect by fatty acids and their CoA derivatives on the cytidylyltransferase was obtained in vitro. Arachidonate, oleate and palmitate (0.1 mM) stimulated rat liver cytosolic cytidylyltransferase activity 4.1-, 3.5- and 3.2-fold, respectively. Activation by oleate was accompanied by a 3.6-fold reduction in the apparent Km of the cytidylyltransferase for CTP and aggregation of the enzyme to high molecular weight species. Acceleration of the cytidylyltransferase reaction by fatty acids provides a positive feed-forward mechanism for regulation of phosphatidylcholine anabolism."

https://openalex.org/W174810609,"We examined the effects of external H+ on the kinetics of Na+-H+ exchange in microvillus membrane vesicles isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. The initial rate of Na+ influx into vesicles with internal pH 6.0 was optimal at external pH 8.5 and was progressively inhibited as external pH was reduced to 6.0. A plot of 1/V versus [H+]o was linear and yielded apparent KH = 35 nM (apparent pK 7.5). In vesicles with internal pH 6.0 studied at external pH 7.5 or 6.6, apparent KNa was 13 or 54 mM, Ki for inhibition of Na+ influx by external Li+ was 1.2 or 5.2 mM, Ki for inhibition by external NH4+ was 11 or 50 mM, and Ki for inhibition by external amiloride was 7 or 25 microM, respectively. These findings were consistent with competition between each cation and H+ at a site with apparent pK 7.3-7.5. Lastly, stimulation of 22Na efflux by external Na+ (i.e. Na+-Na+ exchange) was inhibited as external pH was reduced from 7.5 to 6.0, also consistent with competition between external H+ and external Na+. Thus, in contrast with internal H+, which interacts at both transport and activator sites, external H+ interacts with the renal microvillus membrane Na+-H+ exchanger at a single site, namely the external transport site, where H+, Na+, Li+, NH4+, and amiloride all compete for binding."

https://openalex.org/W1597858892,"The promoter-proximal gene (glpT) of the glpT-glpQ operon of Escherichia coli encodes a membrane permease responsible for active transport of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Promoter-distal glpQ encodes a periplasmic protein which is not required for active transport of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (Larson, T.J., Schumacher, G., and Boos, W. (1982) J. Bacteriol. 152, 1008-1021). This periplasmic protein has now been identified as a phosphodiesterase which hydrolyzes glycerophosphodiesters into sn-glycerol 3-phosphate plus alcohol. The enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity with respect to the alcohol moiety; sn-glycerol 3-phosphate was released from glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoglycerol, and bis(glycerophospho)glycerol. The enzyme was specific for glycerophosphodiesters; bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate, a substrate for other phosphodiesterases, was not hydrolyzed. In a coupled spectrophotometric assay utilizing sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and NAD, apparent activity was optimal at pH 9 and was stimulated by Ca2+. The substrates of the phosphodiesterase had no affinity for the glpT-encoded active transport system. Thus, the glpQ gene product expands the catabolic capability of the glp regulon to include a variety of glycerophosphodiesters."
https://openalex.org/W1528373510,"The natural history of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor was examined by radiolabeling cells in monolayers or in suspension; the receptor was isolated by immuno- or affinity precipitation followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The receptor was found to contain asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains and phosphorylated serine residues. Newly made receptor was sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo-H) and was slowly converted to a mature endo-H resistant form; phosphate was found on the mature receptor only. The receptor had an apparent molecular weight of 215,000 at all times, as determined under reducing and denaturing conditions; unreduced receptor had a greater electrophoretic mobility, suggesting the presence of intrachain disulfide linkages. The synthesis of immunoreactive receptor occurred with a lag of 50 min and of functional receptor with a lag of 70 min, indicating a requirement for some post-translational event(s) for acquisition of immunoreactivity and binding activity. Maturation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides was not the requisite modification, since endo-H sensitive or deglycosylated receptor bound to both antibody and to insoluble phosphomannan; however, much less immunoreactive and functional receptor was detected in the presence of tunicamycin. Immunoprecipitable [3H]leucine-labeled receptor was degraded with a t1/2 of 16 h and 6 h for cells in monolayers and suspension, respectively, whereas 32P was lost with a corresponding t1/2 of 2.3 and 4 h. A pool of cell surface mannose 6-phosphate receptor was identified by separation on Percoll gradients as well as by iodination of cells with 125I; receptor in this pool was resistant to endo-H and had a t1/2 similar to that of the total [3H]leucine-labeled receptor, even in the presence of a saturating concentration of ligand. During endocytosis, ligand (beta-galactosidase) and 125I-receptor separated, the ligand accumulating within lysosomes. These results are consistent with current concepts of recycling of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1544390306,"A procedure has been developed for isolating canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum with considerably improved Ca2+ transport properties and stability. Contamination by mitochondria and sarcolemma is low, and the preparation is at least 85% pure sarcoplasmic reticulum. The preparation exhibits efficient, high activity ATP-dependent, oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ accumulation. At 13-16 microM ionized Ca2+, loading at 37 degrees C is 2.55 +/- 0.08 mumol of Ca2+/mg of protein in 1 min and reaches 9.08 +/- 0.64 mumol of Ca2+/mg of protein. Approximately 1 mol of Ca2+ is transported per mol of ATP hydrolyzed. Ca2+-insensitive ATPase is low. The Ca2+ loading rate and the Ca2+/ATP efficiency are increased by addition of ryanodine. At 1.2 microM ionized Ca2+, where the control rate is significantly higher than values previously reported, the Ca2+ transport rate is further increased 64% by calmodulin, 2.3-fold by cAMP plus cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and 2.5-fold by the combination of these components. The preparation is stable for 24 h at room temperature and for 48 hr at 0 degrees C and can be stored at -70 degrees C with retention of function for more than 1 month. The preparation is further characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by phospholipid analysis, and by thin section, freeze-fracture, and negative staining electron microscopy. The analyses indicate that the orientation and turnover number of the cardiac Ca2+ pump protein are similar to those of the skeletal muscle enzyme, and that the major factor in the lower Ca2+ transport rate of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is a lower density of Ca2+ pump polypeptides in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1547585735,"The oxidation of ascorbic acid by molecular oxygen was investigated by optical and magnetic resonance methods in the presence and in the absence of copper and iron complexes. The results show that one superoxide ion is generated for each oxidized molecule of ascorbate. The effect of addition of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, which at concentrations higher than 10(-7) M halves the oxidation rate, is discussed and a reaction mechanism is proposed. An upper limit for the kinetic rate constant of the reaction between the ascorbate radical and the superoxide ion is reported."

https://openalex.org/W1577737603,"Salmonella typhimurium LT2 rapidly accumulates high levels of a family of five adenylylated nucleotides following exposure to a bacteriostatic quinone, 6-amino-7-chloro-5,8-dioxoquinoline. These compounds have been analyzed using our recently described two-dimensional thin layer chromatographic method. The five dinucleotides, which cannot be detected in exponentially growing cells, have been identified as diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (AppppA), ApppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate-5'-adenosine-5'-(P1,P3-triphosphate)), AppppG (adenosine 5'-guanosine-5'-(P1,P4-tetraphosphate)), ApppG (adenosine 5'-guanosine-5'-(P1,P3-triphosphate)), and ApppA (diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P3-triphosphate). AppppA has been previously detected in vitro as an enzymatic product of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and in vivo at submicromolar levels in eucaryotic cells. The induced intracellular concentration of AppppA and the other adenylylated nucleotides in S. typhimurium is approximately 100-fold higher than that found in eucaryotic cells. We propose that these dinucleotides are alarmones, regulatory molecules signaling a particular metabolic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1524486180,"Skin fibroblasts from a patient with a lethal form of osteogenesis imprefecta were found to synthesize equal amounts of normal pro-alpha 1(I) chains and pro-alpha 1(I) chains which are about 10% shorter because of a deletion of about 100 amino acids in the middle of the alpha chain domain. The pro-alpha 1(I) chains were incorporated into three different kinds of trimers: a normal type I trimer with normal length pro-alpha 1(I) chains; a type Is trimer with one shortened pro-alpha 1(I) chain and two normal length chains; and a type Iss trimer containing two shortened pro-alpha 1(I) chains and one normal length pro-alpha 2(I) chain. As judged by resistance to digestion by chymotrypsin and trypsin, the type Is and Iss trimers denatured at a temperature at least 3 degrees C lower than normal type I procollagen. Procollagen containing the shortened pro-alpha 1(I) chains was slowly secreted by the cells but was degraded by extracellular proteinases within 6 h of chase into the medium. The results indicated that the presence of the shortened pro-alpha 1(I) chains in procollagen trimers produces a delay in rate of helix formation, overmodification of the polypeptides by post-translational enzymes, a decrease in the thermal stability of the trimers, and increased susceptibility of the protein to endogenous proteinases. Additionally, the fibroblasts of this patient synthesized and secreted a type III-like species of procollagen with unusual chromatographic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1587641611,"A phosphatase that is active in dephosphorylating the isolated 20,000-Da light chain of myosin, as well as the enzyme myosin light chain kinase, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from turkey gizzards. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 165,000 by sedimentation-equilibrium centrifugation under nondenaturing conditions and is composed of three subunits (Mr = 60,000, 55,000, and 38,000) in a 1:1:1 molar ratio. The properties of the holoenzyme, as well as the purified catalytic subunit (Mr = 38,000) were compared using myosin light chains, intact myosin, and myosin light chain kinase as substrates. Although the holoenzyme is active in dephosphorylating the isolated myosin light chains and the enzyme myosin light chain kinase, the holoenzyme does not dephosphorylate myosin. On the other hand, the catalytic subunit of the holoenzyme dephosphorylates all three substrates. When myosin light chain kinase, which has been phosphorylated at two sites is used as substrate, both sites are rapidly dephosphorylated by the phosphatase in the absence of bound calmodulin. If calmodulin is bound to the diphosphorylated kinase, only one site is dephosphorylated. Interestingly, the single site dephosphorylated when calmodulin is bound to myosin light chain kinase is the site that is not phosphorylated when the calmodulin-myosin kinase complex is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1545753134,"Calcium-activated protease (CAP) was purified from the cytosol fraction of homogenized human platelet concentrates using a combination of gel filtration chromatography and affinity chromatography on antipain aminohexyl-Sepharose and activated thiol-Sepharose 4B. Purified CAP is composed of two different polypeptides of Mr = 80,000 and 27,000. Half-maximal protease activity was observed at 0.52 mM Ca2+, and all activity was inhibited by antipain, leupeptin, and N-ethylmaleimide. Activated CAP showed a time-dependent inactivation in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ with only 5% of the control protease activity remaining after a 1-h exposure to calcium. Preincubation of washed platelets with varying amounts of CAP (0.2-0.4 units) significantly interfered with thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. In addition, ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination in the presence of von Willebrand factor was completely inhibited by 0.4 units of CAP. Concomitant with these protease-induced changes in platelet function, a decrease was observed in a major glycoprotein band of Mr = 150,000 present in platelet membranes and presumed to be glycoprotein Ib. In addition to these effects on platelets, CAP inhibited thrombin-induced production of prostacyclin by cultured human endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner when the cells were pretreated with CAP. Thus platelet CAP can modulate membrane functions in both platelets and endothelial cells and may thus contribute to the regulation of hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1479764565,"The four ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA units) of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, were identified and mapped by restriction enzyme analysis and Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA. Although the four genes share common characteristics, they appear to be internally different from each other in expanse and sequence. One HindIII site near the 3' end of the coding region for the large rRNA is the only restriction site which we have detected that is conserved in all of the genes. The distance between the conserved HindIII site and the coding region for the small rRNA is at least 1-2 kilobases longer in two of the rDNA units than in a third unit. None of the four rDNA units were linked by restriction mapping where about 150 kilobases of the genome were accounted for. The copy number of two of the rDNA units was determined to be approximately 1 per haploid genome by quantitative analysis of cloned (plasmid) DNA versus genomic DNA digests on Southern blots. The other two genes also appear to be present in 1 copy. Restriction analysis confirms both the low copy number and that these genes are not in an easily recognizable tandem array. The low number of rDNA units requires that new copies of the genome produced during intraerythrocytic growth be active in RNA synthesis soon after their replication."
https://openalex.org/W1527560201,"A potent nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (EC 3.6.1.3) with a number of unusual properties has been found in the parasitic protozoan (Toxoplasma gondii) and has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is localized in the cytosol and constitutes 3-4% of the total cytosolic protein. It has a molecular weight of 240,000-260,000 and contains four equivalent subunits of Mr = 63,000. Dithiol compounds such as dithiothreitol, dithioerythritol, or dimercaptopropanol were essential activators of the enzyme. Monothiol compounds had no effect. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 2,500 mumol/min/mg at 37 degrees C under optimal conditions. Magnesium was the most effective activating metal ion, although manganese and calcium were also active. A higher excess of magnesium over total ATP was essential for maximal activity. Anions were found to inhibit the enzyme activity in an almost chaotropic order. The enzyme demonstrated a wide substrate specificity for both ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate and hydrolyzed these nucleotides at almost the same rate. ADP was also a substrate and was hydrolyzed at a rate of 18% of that for ATP. Slight activity was seen with inorganic tri- and tetrapolyphosphates but not with monophosphate compounds. Km values for MgATP2- and MgADP- were 0.12 +/- 0.01 mM and 0.70 +/- 0.06 mM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1587243129,"In dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas, cholecystokinin-27-32-amide (CCK-27-32-NH2) did not alter amylase secretion but was able to antagonize the stimulation caused by cholecystokinin-related agonists. CCK-27-32-NH2 caused a parallel rightward shift in the dose-response curve for the stimulation of amylase secretion caused by cholecystokinin and inhibited binding of 125I-labeled cholecystokinin to pancreatic acini. These results indicate that CCK-27-32-NH2 is a fully competitive cholecystokinin receptor antagonist. CCK-27-32-NH2 did not alter the rate of dissociation of bound 125I-cholecystokinin from pancreatic acini but was able to reverse the residual stimulation of enzyme secretion caused by first incubating pancreatic acini with a relatively high concentration of cholecystokinin. Compared to other cholecystokinin receptor antagonists, CCK-27-32-NH2 is the most potent antagonist described to date, i.e. 30 times more potent than N2,O2-dibutyryl guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate. These results also indicate that the COOH-terminal phenylalanine residue of cholecystokinin is essential for intrinsic cholecystokinin-like activity but is not essential for binding of the peptide to cholecystokinin receptors in pancreatic acini."
https://openalex.org/W1582482658,"We have analyzed the initiation and termination sites of transcription in vivo of the colicin E1 gene in Escherichia coli cells by S1-mapping assay and RNA blot hybridization. According to the S1-mapping assay, the transcription was initiated at about 75 base pairs upstream from the NH2-terminal codon of the gene. The initiation site corresponded with one of the two promoters which were previously determined by in vitro transcription experiments (Ebina, Y., Kishi, F., Miki, T., Kagamiyama, H., Nakazawa, T., and Nakazawa, A. (1981) Gene 15, 119-126). Transcription in vivo of the colicin E1 gene was stimulated by cyclic AMP in the adenylate cyclase-defective mutant cells. Two transcripts of the colicin E1 gene, approximately 1700 and 2200 nucleotides, were detected by the blot hybridization. Since initiation of the transcription started at one site in vivo, these results indicated two termination sites. The location of the termination sites were approximately 60 and 560 base pairs downstream from the COOH-terminal codon of the gene as judged by S1-mapping assay. In vitro transcription experiments with rho-factor strongly suggested that the termination in the proximal terminator was rho-dependent. In the terminator structure, there is the sequence CAAACAAA which is homologous to a common sequence CAATCAA found in other rho-dependent terminators."
https://openalex.org/W1479951874,"The role of lipids in the function of membrane receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters is still obscure. To gain information on this subject, a delipidated receptor preparation was developed. The beta-adrenergic receptor from turkey erythrocyte membranes was solubilized in deoxycholate and was freed extensively of phospholipids and of cholesterol by gel filtration. The delipidated preparation, after removal of the detergent, showed little, if any, ligand binding to the receptor as measured with the beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I] iodocyanopindolol. Readdition of soybean lipids restored specific radioligand binding. The lipid reconstituted receptor demonstrated agonist and antagonist binding affinities which were not very different from those of the native receptor. The receptor also retained its ability to function, as demonstrated by transfer to a foreign adenylate cyclase system. The delipidated receptor preparation lent itself conveniently to study the requirement for specific lipids in restoration of agonist and antagonist binding. Phosphatidylethanolamine restored maximal binding. Acidic phospholipids and sphingomyelin were inefficient in reconstitution of the receptor. The effect of cholesterol addition was also investigated. Binding was dramatically increased when a cholesterol ester was added in mixture with the acidic phospholipids, cardiolipin or phosphatidylinositol. Further studies unexpectedly revealed that reconstitution of the delipidated receptor is not exclusively dependent on the addition of a phospholipid; a mixture of 1-monooleylglycerol with cholesteryl hemisuccinate restored binding as efficiently as phosphatidylethanolamine. The presently described preparation should be useful in elucidating the part played by lipids in the action of the receptor in the adenylate cyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W1602218001,"A Mg2+-dependent phosphatase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from turkey gizzard smooth muscle. The enzyme has a Mr = 43,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 44,500 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation under nondenaturing conditions. Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate all of the phosphatase activity was found to migrate as a single band, subsequently shown to have an Mr = 43,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is inactive in the absence of Mg2+ and maximum activity is reached at a free concentration of 12 mM Mg2+. Mn2+ can replace Mg2+, but the activity is only about one-fifth of that found with 12 mM Mg2+. NaF and the nucleotides ATP, ADP, and AMP inhibit phosphatase activity. This inhibition appears to be independent of their ability to bind Mg2+. The phosphatase purified from turkey smooth muscle appears to be identical with that purified from canine heart (Binstock, J. F., and Li, H. C. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 87, 1226-1234) and rat liver (Hiraga, A., Kikuchi, K., Tamura, S., and Tsuiki, S. (1981) Eur. J. Biochem. 119, 503-510)."

The enzyme fraction contained 16 nmol of cytochrome P-450/mg of protein and showed only one protein band with a minimum molecular weight of 51,000 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified cytochrome P-450 catalyzed 25-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol, and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 up to 50 times more efficiently, and 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 about 150 times more efficiently than the microsomes. The cytochrome P-450 showed no detectable 25-hydroxylase activity towards vitamin D2 and was inactive in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation as well as in 12 alpha- and 26-hydroxylations of C27-steroids. It catalyzed hydroxylations of testosterone and demethylation of ethylmorphine at the same rates as, or lower rates than, microsomes. The 25-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol and vitamin D3 with the purified cytochrome P-450 was not stimulated by addition of phospholipid or cytochrome b5 to the reconstituted system. Emulgen inhibited 25-hydroxylase activity towards both substrates. The possibility that 25-hydroxylation of C27-steroids and vitamin D3 is catalyzed by the same species of cytochrome P-450 is discussed."

The high affinity, low capacity site showed values of Kd 0.19 X 10(-10) M. This value was in the range of concentration of free L-triiodothyronine found in the plasma and was several orders of magnitude higher than the Kd values previously reported for other L-triiodothyronine membrane-binding systems. The binding site also showed a high stereospecificity for L-triiodothyronine. D-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine and L-thyroxine were less potent (about 1000-fold) than L-triiodothyronine in competing for these sites. L-3,3,5'-triiodothyronine and triiodothyroacetic acid were inactive. The physiological relevance of this site is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1518230311,"An exposed hinge region of cGMP-dependent protein kinase is known to be susceptible to both limited proteolysis and autophosphorylation. A 91-residue fragment has been isolated from this region and its amino acid sequence has been compared with the analogous regions of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases. Although a resemblance among these sequences is not striking, the phosphorylation sites are in corresponding regions toward the NH2 termini, and there are indications of homology in the vicinity of their autophosphorylation sites. As in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the site of autophosphorylation and the site of susceptibility to limited proteolysis are very near each other in the primary structure. The actual site of autophosphorylation (the underlined threonine residue in Pro-Arg-Thr-Thr-Arg) is quite different from those in the regulatory subunit of Type II cAMP-dependent kinase or the site in Type I regulatory subunit that can be phosphorylated by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1601774040,"Sarcolemmal vesicles isolated from relaxed rat cardiac ventricles were 120-fold enriched in (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and 5'-nucleotidase activities (final recoveries, 50%). The alpha and beta chains of the former enzyme were visualized by the immunological approach. Inside-out sarcolemmal vesicles were isolated by affinity chromatography on immobilized concanavalin A. The yield of membranes was 0.45 mg of protein/g of muscle. The orientation of the unbound vesicles was studied by the increased accessibility of sarcolemma outer face markers (ouabain- and K+-binding sites, 5'-nucleotidase, and sialic acids) with permeability-increasing treatments: freeze-thaw cycles, sodium dodecyl sulfate, methanol, and valinomycin. The total ATP hydrolysis remained constant with a conversion of ouabain-insensitive activity into an ouabain-sensitive one. These agents caused a parallel increase in the ouabain sensitivity, the number of [3H]ouabain-binding sites, the monovalent cation stimulation of ATPase, and the 5'-nucleotidase activity. Valinomycin revealed that most vesicles were sealed to sequestered and exogenous K+. Inside-out vesicles were 80% pure in sidedness and sealing. The affinity chromatography did not affect the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity (200 mumol of product/mg of protein/h). This model of sarcolemma vesicles offers a new tool for ion transport studies."
https://openalex.org/W1586421616,"We have analyzed the chromatin structure of a phosphate-repressible acid phosphatase gene (PHO5) within yeast nuclei. Under derepressed conditions (low Pi media), the gene is much more sensitive to either DNAse I or micrococcal nuclease digestion than is the repressed gene. We have mapped DNase I hypersensitive sites unique to the active gene near the 5'-end of the acid phosphatase mRNA and within a region presumed to function in the regulation of the gene by Pi. Although the gene is packaged into regularly spaced nucleosomes, no detectable phase relationship exists between nucleosomes and DNA sequence under derepressed conditions, whereas in the repressed state the nucleosomes occur in one predominant phase. These results demonstrate reversible changes in the chromatin structure of a eukaryotic gene system that directly correlate with the functional state of the gene."

Cellular transformation was monitored looking at the morphology change, the cell growth, and the expression of plasminogen activator. Analysis on polyacrylamide gel of intracellular and secreted proteins showed: 1) a disappearance of the specific products of differentiated chondrocytes; 2) a switch in the collagen synthesis from the type II, the chondrocyte-specific type, to the type I, characteristic of fibroblasts and other cells of mesenchymal origin; 3) an enhancement of fibronectin synthesis. Analysis of the proteins from chondrocytes infected with Rous-associated virus 1, a virus unable to induce cell transformation in vitro, indicated that the altered expression of the differentiated proteins in Rous sarcoma virus-infected chondrocytes depended upon the action of src gene product."
https://openalex.org/W117268838,"Acidification of a salt-free solution of native low spin globular horse heart ferricytochrome c with HCl causes a single cooperative transition centered at pH 2.5 at 23 degrees C resulting in the formation of denatured high spin ferricytochrome c. By contrast, acidification with HCIO4 uncouples denaturation from the spin-state transition, resulting in the formation of a globular high spin form of ferricytochrome c at pH 0.0 exhibiting only modest conformational differences from native cytochrome c as judged by far ultraviolet circular dichoroic, tryptophan fluorescence, and reduced viscosity measurements. This uncoupling is consistent with the preferential binding of two perchlorate anions to the globular form(s) cytochrome c. The acid spin-state transition of the perchlorate complex is biphasic, having midpoint values at pH 0.7 and 3.6 involving 1.0 and 1.6 protons, respectively, when measured in the presence of 1 M perchlorate."
https://openalex.org/W1530453318,"Phosphorylation of alpha- and beta-D-glucose by glucokinase from rat liver or a radiation-induced, transplantable insulinoma was investigated. Glucokinase partially purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Cibacron blue F3GA agarose was incubated for brief periods (1 or 3 min) with glucose anomers. Glucokinase from both liver and insulinoma tissue had a higher affinity for alpha-D-glucose (S0.5 = 6-7 mM) than beta-D-glucose (S0.5 = 12-14 mM). The maximum velocity was 15-20% lower for alpha-D-glucose than beta-D-glucose. Cooperative rate dependence with respect to glucose concentration was observed with both anomers (nH = 1.4). These kinetic data imply that both anomers of glucose are phosphorylated by glucokinase, however, at the physiological range of glucose concentrations below 15 mM, the higher affinity of alpha-D-glucose results in higher rates than with beta-D-glucose. At clearly pathological glucose concentrations exceeding 20 mM, the observed velocities are slightly higher with beta- than alpha-D-glucose. Glucokinase is thought to be the glucose sensor of pancreatic beta cells. The present data indicating a preferential phosphorylation of alpha-D-glucose compared to beta-D-glucose by glucokinase, supports the glucokinase-glucose sensor hypothesis, because it parallels the well established greater potency of alpha-D-glucose as a stimulant of insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1558665550,"Phosphorylation of liver glycogen synthase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) results in the incorporation of approximately 0.7 to 1.0 mol of PO4/subunit. Analyses of the tryptic peptides by isoelectric focusing and peptide mapping reveal the presence of a single 32P-labeled peptide. This extent of phosphorylation does not result in a significant reduction of the synthase activity ratio. Phosphorylation of the liver synthase by cAMP-independent synthase (casein) kinase-1 results in the incorporation of 1.6 to 2.2 mol of PO4/subunit. Although at least 4 tryptic peptides have been found to be labeled with 32P, no significant reduction of the synthase activity ratio was observed. Under the same assay conditions, the muscle synthase is effectively inactivated by either kinase alone or in combination. Inactivation of liver synthase can be achieved after phosphorylation by A-kinase and followed by synthase (casein) kinase-1. However, the inactivation becomes less effective if the order of the addition of these two kinases is reversed. Under the latter assay condition, the phosphate incorporation is less than additive in the presence of both kinases. Prior phosphorylation of the synthase by A-kinase transforms the synthase to become a better substrate for synthase (casein) kinase-1 as evidenced by a 3- to 5-fold increase in the rate of phosphorylation. This increased rate of phosphorylation of the synthase by synthase (casein) kinase-1 results from the rapid phosphorylation of a site neighboring to that previously phosphorylated by A-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1523559584,"The translation of poliovirion RNA (polio RNA) in an in vitro fractionated system was much less efficient than that of encephalomyocarditis virion RNA (EMC RNA). In contrast, when polio and EMC RNAs were added to postmitochondrial cell lysates (S10), they were translated with equal efficiency. However, this equality was observed only when high concentrations of S10 were employed; at lower concentrations, polio RNA translation was reduced relative to that of EMC RNA. These results suggest that both the fractionated and S10 systems are limiting in a component that is required for the optimal translation of polio RNA. The elongation rates for EMC and polio RNA translation in the fractionated system were found to be similar, indicating that this component acts at an initiation step. Various components, including excess ribosomal salt wash and postribosomal supernatant of cell lysate, were added to the fractionated system in an effort to identify the slow step more precisely. Of these, only excess ribosomal salt wash specifically stimulated polio RNA translation, suggesting that one or more initiation factors is necessary in unusually large amounts for this mRNA. Various purified initiation factors were tested for the ability to enhance polio RNA translation. Of these, only purified eukaryotic initiation factor 4A had a specific effect. This suggests that polio RNA, in contrast to other mRNAs tested (EMC, reoviral, and globin), may have an unusually low affinity for this initiation factor. The significance of these results is discussed in terms of the methods picornaviruses have evolved for reprogramming the translational machinery of the host cell."
https://openalex.org/W1649815099,"The photoaffinity label 8-azido[32P]adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and affinity chromatography on N6-(2-aminoethyl)-cAMP-Sepharose were used to analyze the cAMP-binding proteins present in cell-free extracts of Blastocladiella emersonii zoospores. In the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors, 8-azido[32P]cAMP was specifically and quantitatively incorporated into a major protein band of Mr = 58,000, and three minor protein bands of Mr = 50,000, Mr = 43,000, and Mr = 36,000 respectively, after autoradiography following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis. In the absence of the protease inhibitors, the Mr = 58,000 protein band was converted into the lower molecular weight cAMP-binding proteins, indicating a high sensitivity of the intact Mr = 58,000 protein band to endogenous proteases. The Mr = 58,000 protein corresponded to the regulatory subunit (R), of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase of zoospores, as shown by their identical behavior on DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The partially purified protein kinase incorporated 32P from [gamma-32P] ATP . Mg2+ into R as demonstrated by the specific adsorption of the 32P-labeled protein with N6-(2-aminoethyl)-cAMP-Sepharose. The incorporated 32P group was rapidly removed by endogenous phosphoprotein phosphatases in the presence of cAMP, as shown by pulse-chase experiments with [gamma-32P]ATP. Dephosphorylation of R-cAMP and rapid proteolysis may indicate two other mechanisms, in addition to cAMP, for the control of this protein kinase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2033460806,"The arrangement and the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA genes in the 2.0-kilobase-pair EcoRI restriction fragment EcoQ of Euglena gracilis Klebs, strain Z Pringsheim chloroplast DNA have been determined. This fragment, cloned in pBR325 to form the plasmid pEZC300, contains five tRNA genes. The DNA insert of this plasmid, a known tRNA gene locus (Orozco, E.M., Jr., and Hallick, R.B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3258-3264) has been mapped by Southern gel analysis using a 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide tRNA gene probe. The DNA sequence of 870 base pairs (bp) from EcoQ containing the entire tRNA gene locus was determined. The organization of this tRNA gene cluster on the E. gracilis chloroplast chromosome is tRNAUUGGln-14-BP spacer-RNAGCUSer-175-bp spacer-tRNACAUMet-12-bp spacer-tRNAGCCGly-5-bp spacer-tRNAUGUThr. The tRNAUUGGln and tRNAGCUSer gene sequences are of the opposite polarity as the other three gene sequences, but of the same polarity as the rRNA genes. The tRNAMet gene is a putative initiator tRNA. The five tRNA genes are separated and flanked by A-T-rich spacer sequences. This gene arrangement is consistent with the model that E. gracilis chloroplast tRNA genes are transcribed into multicistronic tRNA precursors. The DNA sequences have been used to deduce the primary and secondary structures of the tRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1506025441,"The binding characteristics of human placental microsomes were evaluated for properties related to an adenosine receptor using 2-chloro[8-3H]adenosine as the ligand. Saturation of binding sites occurred with 0.75 pmol of ligand/mg of protein. Analysis of these data by Scatchard plot indicates a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 56 nM with 1.1 pmol of ligand bound/mg of protein. The specificity of 2-chloro[8-3H] adenosine binding was assessed by the ability of adenosine analogs to compete for binding sites. Using this approach, the Kd for 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine was estimated to be 0.3 microM and for N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine or N6-cyclohexyladenosine to be greater than 100 microM. Isobutylmethylxanthine and theophylline, receptor antagonists, have Kd values of 19 microM and 150 microM, respectively. Chloroadenosine binding to placental microsomes was time-dependent and reached equilibrium at approximately 20 min. The kob was 0.24 min-1 and the k1 was 0.71 X 10(8) min-1 M-1. Reversibility of chloroadenosine binding at equilibrium was completed at 5 min with a k2 value of 1.17 min-1. The Kd calculated from the reverse rate constant was 17 nM. Our observations suggest that 2-chloro[8-3H]adenosine identifies binding sites in human placenta with characteristics of an adenosine receptor. The binding properties conform to the previous description of a low affinity stimulatory receptor (Ra or A2 receptor)."

U.S.A. 67, 305-312) underestimated by about 10-fold the total amount of [3H]cAMP bound by crude extracts of cultured forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (epimastigotes), when compared with the results obtained by the modified Millipore filter technique described by Doskeland and Ueland (Doskeland, S. O., and Ueland, P.M. (1977) Biochem. J. 165, 561-573). After column chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, the cAMP-binding activity eluted as a single symmetrical peak at about 210 mM NaCl, totally separated from two peaks of cAMP-independent phosphotransferase activities which eluted, respectively, at 90 and 270 mM NaCl. These two protein kinases showed similar specificities for exogenous substrates, preferring in this order: protamine greater than casein greater than histone H2b. Photoaffinity labeling of cell-free extracts with 8-azido[32P]adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and autoradiography following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis specifically labeled only one protein of Mr = 62,000. From these results it is concluded that T. cruzi epimastigotes possess one single cAMP-binding protein of monomeric Mr = 62,000, not associated with a phosphotransferase activity and probably very different in nature to known regulatory subunits of protein kinases, given the results obtained with the Millipore filtration technique."
https://openalex.org/W1488683657,"Leucine can be utilized efficiently as a precursor for lipid biosynthesis by adipose tissue, especially in the presence of glucose or glucose and insulin. During the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes, the rate of lipid biosynthesis from L-[U-14C]leucine increases at least 30-fold and lipogenesis, with [U-14C] acetate as the precursor, increases by 10- to 15-fold. The specific activities of two mitochondrial dehydrogenases in the leucine oxidative pathway, the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, as well as of leucine:alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase, increase at least 20-fold during the adipose conversion. Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase was assayed in crude extracts using a specific fluorimetric method employing electron transfer flavoprotein as the electron acceptor for the flavoprotein dehydrogenase. The specific activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, the mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing the terminal reaction in the leucine degradation pathway, increases 4-fold during differentiation. The increases in the specific activities of the mitochondrial enzymes occur without a change in the specific activity of cytochrome oxidase, indicating that the increases do not simply reflect proliferation of mitochondria. The biosynthesis of at least 20 soluble mitochondrial polypeptides is enhanced during the adipose conversion of the fibroblasts as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following incubation of the cells with [35S] methionine. The results provide a conservative estimate of the extent of changes in mitochondrial soluble proteins during the adipose conversion. They also establish that differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes metabolize leucine like mature adipose tissue and illustrate the roles of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase in lipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1497317240,"Beef heart cytochrome c oxidase subunit V was isolated by a new one-step procedure. The product was homogeneous to 99% and immunogenically competent. The resulting antibodies inhibited the whole enzyme. A variation of ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is described which, using a homogeneous antigen, probes the surface of intact membranes to a high degree of specificity. We showed that the subunit is accessible on the surface of inside-out mitochondrial inner membrane particles only when the particles were reduced with ascorbate and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylene-diamine but is inaccessible on the surface of right-side-out particles regardless of the presence of reductants. These findings have implications with respect to the topography of the enzyme per se and in relation to its neighbors, and with respect to the degree of coupling between electron transport and proton pumping by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1563444565,"The present study addresses the question whether tetrameric flavocytochrome b2 in the crystal is catalytically competent and, if so, whether it is possible to prepare a functional complex of the crystalline enzyme with its physiological electron acceptor cytochrome c. By single crystal microspectrophotometry we show that the native reduced enzyme can be oxidized by oxygen or ferricyanide and that the oxidized enzyme can be reduced by the electron donor L-lactate. Reduced cytochrome c appears to diffuse through the liquid channels of flavocytochrome b2 crystals and, at low ionic strength, to accumulate in amounts stoichiometrically equivalent to the enzyme protomers. Both cytochromes can be oxidized by ferricyanide. In the presence of L-lactate, both cytochromes become reduced. Since reduction of cytochrome c by L-lactate requires the catalytic action of flavocytochrome b2, it is concluded that the structure of the crystalline enzyme not only allows for electron transfer from L-lactate to flavin and intramolecular electron transfer from flavin to heme, but also for the formation of a productive complex with cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W2098474404,"EPR spectra of nitric oxide complexes of cytochrome c oxidase were studied as a function of temperature in the fully reduced form and in a mixed valence form. In the 12-77 K range, temperature-dependent motion changed the EPR spectral line shape of the mixed valence form but not the fully reduced form. Two separate hypotheses which both indicate cytochrome a-cytochrome a3 interaction could account for this phenomenon: i.e. either, in response to redox changes at cytochrome a, a changed ligand binding environment occurs at cytochrome a3 which has conformations that down to 40 K can interconvert on a 10(8) s-1 time scale, or dipolar spin-spin interaction occurs between the NO-liganded a3 center and a paramagnetic metal center in cytochrome a. This interaction is then modulated by the temperature-dependent spin-lattice relaxation behavior of the center in cytochrome a. If this latter hypothesis is correct, the intercenter distance can be estimated at 15 A, and the more likely interacting center can be predicted to be the heme moiety of cytochrome a."
https://openalex.org/W1594539868,"From the results obtained in perfused rat hearts, Frick and Lowenstein proposed that ecto-5'-nucleotidase catalyzes a vectorial reaction in which AMP hydrolysis is accompanied by transfer of adenosine across the cell membrane (Frick, G.P., and Lowenstein, J.M. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 1240-1244). We have examined by the use of perfused rat livers, the uptake mechanism of adenosine generated from AMP by ecto-5'-nucleotidase. Recirculating perfusion of rat livers was performed with a buffered saline containing [2-3H]AMP at an initial concentration of 5 microM. One-half of the [2-3H] AMP was dephosphorylated by 0.8 min of perfusion; less than 13% of the radioactivity of hydrolyzed [2-3H] AMP was located in [2-3H]adenosine plus [2-3H]inosine appearing in the perfusate. Addition of 6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-guanosine, an inhibitor of the nucleoside transport system, at 120 microM to the perfusate caused a 3.9-fold increase in the amount of the [2-3H]AMP-derived 3H-nucleosides appearing in the perfusate. Moreover, in a perfusion in which uridine was added to the perfusate at 2.6 mM to compete with the [2-3H] AMP-derived [2-3H]adenosine for the nucleoside transport system, more than 87% of the radioactivity of hydrolyzed [2-3H]AMP was located in [2-3H]adenosine appearing in the perfusate; the result indicates that the uridine added to the perfusate efficiently trapped the [2-3H]adenosine formed from [2-3H]AMP. These results support an uptake mechanism of the AMP-derived adenosine in which the adenosine formed by ecto-5'-nucleotidase in the blood-sinusoidal plasma membrane of hepatocytes, is taken up by the nucleoside transport system located at the plasma membrane side by side with ecto-5'-nucleotidase. The results therefore indicate that the ecto-5'-nucleotidase of hepatocytes does not catalyze vectorial production of adenosine, in contrast to the previous report on perfused rat hearts."
https://openalex.org/W132991231,"Extensive kinetic studies of bovine intestinal 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase as a function of pH have confirmed and amplified the catalytic mechanism previously proposed on the basis of isolation of a covalent phosphorylated intermediate (Landt, M., and Butler, L.G. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 4130-4135). An enzyme-ionizing group with apparent pKa = 6.85 controls the rate-determining step. Electrostatic interactions between anionic substrate and two or more ionic groups on the enzyme have a major role in substrate binding. Binding of strongly inhibitory 5'-AMP is controlled by an ionizing group, probably on the enzyme, with pKa less than or equal to 5.9. At pH 6.0, imidazole is a classic uncompetitive inhibitor, in agreement with independent evidence that it stabilizes the covalent intermediate form of the enzyme. KI values for phosphonate analogs, which are competitive inhibitors, indicate that phosphodiesterase binds its products and product analogs more strongly than it binds substrate analogs. Some of the results presented here can be interpreted as indicating that 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase is the evolutionary precursor of alkaline phosphatase, with which it has many structural and catalytic properties in common, and which is found in relatively large amounts in the same tissue."
https://openalex.org/W140676626,"Screening of three human hepatoma-derived cell lines revealed the presence of an immunologically similar plasma binding protein for vitamin D and its metabolites in media from Hep 3B cells. Approximately 3% of protein synthesized and secreted by these cells was immunoprecipitated by specific antiserum to the D-binding protein. Medium content of the protein increased over 11 days following cell seeding, and negligible amounts of 125I-labeled binding protein added to cultures were degraded over 48 h. The hepatoma-derived binding protein was indistinguishable from plasma binding protein or reference pure protein in gel filtration, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems. The Hep 3B cell product was found to bind mole/mol with monomeric actin, and bind vitamin D sterols with an affinity and specificity characteristic of the human plasma binding protein. The findings argue strongly for the identity of the Hep 3B cell product and the human plasma protein. The continuous availability of the Hep 3B cell line provides a reasonable model for investigations of biosynthesis and release of this important plasma protein."

Sodium diphosphate, a competitive inhibitor with respect to thiamin diphosphate (Ki = 5.2 . 10(-4) M) prolongs the lag, while the strongly binding transition state analog thiamin thiazolone diphosphate has no effect. tau is independent of the enzyme concentration, thus no dissociation-association step is involved. Incubation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex with thiamin diphosphate, Mg2+, and pyruvate leads to a shortening of the lag phase, as well as to a decrease of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in a time-dependent process, which evinces the same characteristics as tau. Dependence of pyruvate, as well as of the substrate analog methylacetylphosphonate, can be established by measurements of fluorescence quenching, thus ruling out an essential role of hydroxyethyl thiamin diphosphate in the process reflected by the lag phase. The results demonstrate that the lag phase is induced after the binding of both thiamin diphosphate . Mg2+ and pyruvate to the catalytic site to form a ternary enzyme complex, which undergoes subsequently a slow conformational change to an active enzyme form. This change is confined to single subunits, and no interactions between neighboring monomers could be observed. A model is proposed to describe the mechanism represented by the lag phase."

At 16-320 mM Na+, the extent of positive change was almost saturated at 0.4 microM ATP, but the rate of the change was significantly accelerated by much higher concentrations of ATP. In the presence of 640 mM Na+, the change showed an initial small decrease in fluorescence (t 1/2 = 15 ms), followed by an increase (t 1/2 = 145 ms). The amount of phosphoenzyme increased rapidly and gave a steady level (t 1/2 = 38 ms) after the addition of ATP to give 12.2 microM. Comparison of the relative fluorescence intensity and the amount of phosphoenzyme at a given time permitted modeling the amount of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme and K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme present. A simulation gave a good fit to the smoothed data. These data show directly that ATP is hydrolyzed through ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme and K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+."
