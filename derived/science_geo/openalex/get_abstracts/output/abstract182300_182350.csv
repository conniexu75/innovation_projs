https://openalex.org/W2002726823,"Regulatory T cells engage in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance by actively suppressing self-reactive lymphocytes. Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanism of their development. Here we show that Foxp3, which encodes a transcription factor that is genetically defective in an autoimmune and inflammatory syndrome in humans and mice, is specifically expressed in naturally arising CD4+ regulatory T cells. Furthermore, retroviral gene transfer of Foxp3 converts naïve T cells toward a regulatory T cell phenotype similar to that of naturally occurring CD4+ regulatory T cells. Thus, Foxp3 is a key regulatory gene for the development of regulatory T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140626630,"Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have activating mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, and most patients with GISTs respond well to Gleevec, which inhibits KIT kinase activity. Here we show that approximately 35% (14 of 40) of GISTs lacking KIT mutations have intragenic activation mutations in the related receptor tyrosine kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA). Tumors expressing KIT or PDGFRA oncoproteins were indistinguishable with respect to activation of downstream signaling intermediates and cytogenetic changes associated with tumor progression. Thus, KIT and PDGFRA mutations appear to be alternative and mutually exclusive oncogenic mechanisms in GISTs."
https://openalex.org/W2096418655,"So far some nuclear receptors for bile acids have been identified. However, no cell surface receptor for bile acids has yet been reported. We found that a novel G protein-coupled receptor, TGR5, is responsive to bile acids as a cell-surface receptor. Bile acids specifically induced receptor internalization, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase, the increase of guanosine 5′-O-3-thio-triphosphate binding in membrane fractions, and intracellular cAMP production in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TGR5. Our quantitative analyses for TGR5 mRNA showed that it was abundantly expressed in monocytes/macrophages in human and rabbit. Treatment with bile acids was found to suppress the functions of rabbit alveolar macrophages including phagocytosis and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine productions. We prepared a monocytic cell line expressing TGR5 by transfecting a TGR5 cDNA into THP-1 cells that did not express TGR5 originally. Treatment with bile acids suppressed the cytokine productions in the THP-1 cells expressing TGR5, whereas it did not influence those in the original THP-1 cells, suggesting that TGR5 is implicated in the suppression of macrophage functions by bile acids.

Bile acids are not simply byproducts of cholesterol metabolism but play essential roles in the absorption of dietary lipids and in the regulation of bile acid synthesis (1Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Google Scholar). Farnesoid X receptor and pregnane X receptor have been recently identified as specific nuclear receptors for bile acids (2Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y.

Through the activation of farnesoid X receptor bile acids repress the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis (2Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J.

The activation of pregnane X receptor by bile acids results in both the repression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and the transcriptional induction of cytochrome P450 3a, the bile acid-metabolizing enzyme (4Jones S.A.

In hepatobiliary diseases including obstructive jaundice, viral hepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis, the mean serum concentration of bile acids exceeds 100 μm (range, 70–400 μm), whereas normally this remains below 10 μm (6Keane R.M. Gadacz T.R. Munster A.M. Birmingham W. Winchurch R.A. Surgery. 1984; 95: 439-443Google Scholar). At such high concentrations, bile acids are known to exhibit immunosuppressive effects on cell-mediated immunity and macrophage functions (6Keane R.M. Gadacz T.R. Munster A.M. Birmingham W. Winchurch R.A. Surgery. 1984; 95: 439-443Google Scholar, 7Kimmings A.N. van Deventer S.J.H. Obertop H. Rauws E.A.J. Gouma D.J. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1995; 181: 567-581Google Scholar, 8Drivas G. James O. Wardle N. Br. Med. J. 1976; 26: 1568-1569Google Scholar). The phagocytic capacity of the reticuloendothelial system including Kupffer cells is depressed in cholestasis or obstructive jaundice (8Drivas G. James O. Wardle N. Br. Med. J. 1976; 26: 1568-1569Google Scholar). Cholestatic jaundice frequently causes infectious complications and endotoxemia, which are closely related to elevated serum bile acid levels (7Kimmings A.N. van Deventer S.J.H. Obertop H.

Furthermore, bile acids including deoxycholic acid (DCA) 1The abbreviations used are: DCA, deoxycholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CHO cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells; TGR5-GFP, a fusion protein of human TGR5 and green fluorescent protein; TLCA, taurine-conjugated lithocholic acid; CHO-TGR5 cells, CHO cells expressing human TGR5; THP-TGR5 cells, THP-1 cells expressing human TGR5; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AMs, adherent alveolar macrophage cells; LCA, lithocholic acid; CA, cholic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate 1The abbreviations used are: DCA, deoxycholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CHO cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells; TGR5-GFP, a fusion protein of human TGR5 and green fluorescent protein; TLCA, taurine-conjugated lithocholic acid; CHO-TGR5 cells, CHO cells expressing human TGR5; THP-TGR5 cells, THP-1 cells expressing human TGR5; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AMs, adherent alveolar macrophage cells; LCA, lithocholic acid; CA, cholic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) have been demonstrated to have inhibitory activities on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of cytokines in macrophages, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (10Greve J.W. Gouma D.J. Buurman W.A. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 454-458Google Scholar, 11Calmus Y. Guechot J. Podevin P. Bonnefis M.T. Giboudeau J. Poupon R. Hepatology. 1992; 16: 719-723Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms involved have remained unclear. Here we show that a novel G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), TGR5, is responsive to bile acids and discuss the possibility that bile acids suppress macrophage functions via TGR5. Expression vectors with human TGR5 cDNA (pAKKO-TGR5) and rat Gi cDNA (pAKKO-Gi) were, respectively, constructed by inserting their coding regions into pAKKO-111H (12Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) dhfr− cells stably transfected with only pAKKO-111H (mock CHO cells) were cultured in a medium and used as host cells. TGR5, luciferase, and Gi were transiently expressed in the host cells by co-transfection using a LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After culture overnight, the cells were incubated with test compounds for 4 h. Luciferase activity was measured with a PicaGene LT.2.0 (Toyo Ink). The expression vector with a fusion protein of human TGR5 and green fluorescent protein (TGR5-GFP), pAKKO-TGR5-GFP, was constructed by the insertion of a fused DNA so that the human TGR5- and GFP-coding regions were connected in tandem. Mock CHO cells seeded onto chambered coverglasses (Nalgene) were transfected with pAKKO-TGR5-GFP and cultured overnight. After treatment with 50 μm taurine-conjugated lithocholic acid (TLCA) for 30 min, the cells were examined under a confocal fluorescence microscope. CHO cells expressing human TGR5 (CHO-TGR5) cells were established by transfecting pAKKO-TGR5 into CHO dhfr− cells (12Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Google Scholar). THP-1 cells expressing human TGR5 (THP-TGR5) cells were established by transfecting pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) inserted with human TGR5 cDNA and selecting neomycin-resistant cells. CHO-TGR5 and mock CHO cells were cultured in a medium containing 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and then additionally cultured overnight in a medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were preincubated with fresh medium for 3 h and then exposed to TLCA at 2 μm. Western blotting was performed with a PhosphoPlus p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Membrane fractions prepared from CHO-TGR5 and mock CHO cells as described elsewhere (13Ohtaki T. Ogi K. Masuda Y. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Kitada C. Sawada H. Onda H. Fujino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15464-15473Google Scholar) were suspended at 500 μg/ml in a binding buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30 μm GDP, and 0.05% CHAPS. The membrane fractions (196 μl) were mixed with TLCA (2 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide solution) and 100 nm [35S]GTPγS (Amersham Biosciences) (2 μl). After incubation at 25 °C for 60 min, the reaction mixtures were diluted with 1.8 ml of a chilled washing buffer, which was a modified binding buffer without GDP, and then filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were washed with 1.8 ml of the washing buffer, dried, and subjected to a liquid scintillation counter to measure [35S]GTPγS bound to the membrane fractions. CHO-TGR5 cells (2 × 104) were incubated with the samples for 20 min in the presence of 0.2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma). Rabbit adherent alveolar macrophage cells (AMs) (2 × 105 cells) were treated with TLCA (200 μm) for 4 min in the presence of 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. THP-TGR5 or THP-1 cells (1 × 105 cells) were treated with bile acids (50 μm) for 20 min in the presence of 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The amount of cAMP was determined with a cAMP-Screen System (Applied Biosystems). Poly(A)+RNAs from human tissues and a human blood fraction multiple tissue cDNA panel were purchased from Clontech. After a 48-h culture, AMs in the culture plates were washed twice with fresh medium. Total RNAs were extracted from the adherent cells or rabbit tissues using an Isogen (Nippongene). Random-primed cDNAs were synthesized and then subjected to quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (14Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Habara Y. Hinuma S. Sekiguchi M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Regul. Pept. 1999; 83: 1-10Google Scholar). AMs were obtained by the lavage of lungs of female New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2.5–3.0 kg (Kitayama LABES), purified through gradient centrifugation with a Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Pharmacia), and then suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics. The viability of the cells was more than 95% as determined by trypan blue-exclusion tests. The cells were comprised of more than 90% macrophages as determined by phagocytic tests and morphological criteria. Rabbit AMs thereby obtained were cultured overnight and used for experiments. After pretreatment with bile acids (100 μm) for 16 h, AMs were incubated with heat-inactivated yeast cells in the presence of fresh rabbit serum for 40 min, and then the AMs containing yeast cells were counted under a microscope. In the assay for cytokine secretion, AMs were preincubated with bile acids for 1 h and then treated with 1 ng/ml LPS (Escherichia coli O111:B4, Wako) in the presence of bile acids for 12 h. THP-TGR5 or THP-1 cells were treated as in AMs with the exception of LPS concentration at 50 ng/ml. TNFα concentrations (which could be neutralized by the anti-TNFα antibody) in the supernatants were measured by bioassay using L929 cells (15Evans T.J. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 15: 243-248Google Scholar). In searching for GPCRs in the GenBankTM data base, we found a human genomic DNA sequence (AC021016) coding for a novel GPCR. Based on this sequence, we isolated a cDNA encoding the GPCR, designated as TGR5, from human spleen cDNAs. We subsequently isolated TGR5 cDNAs in various species. Human TGR5 shared 86, 90, 82, and 83% amino acid identity, respectively, with that in bovine, rabbit, rat, and mouse (Fig. 1). Among the known GPCRs, TGR5 shared at most 30, 29, 26, and 25% amino acid identity with EDG6, EDG8, EDG1, and EDG7 (16Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J.A. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 507-534Google Scholar), respectively. We thus began studies to identify ligands for TGR5 as an orphan GPCR. Although we previously reported a strategy to identify ligands for orphan GPCRs by detecting signal transduction (17Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Google Scholar, 18Hinuma S. Onda H. Fujino M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 495-504Google Scholar), in this study we employed a new method. We co-transfected a reporter gene (cAMP-responsive element fused to luciferase gene (pCRE-Luc, Clontech)) and expression vectors of human TGR5 and rat G protein α subunit Gi (to reduce the basal level of luciferase) into CHO cells. We then screened more than 1,000 compounds by measuring luciferase activities induced in response to intracellular cAMP production and detected specific increases due to bile acids including TLCA, lithocholic acid (LCA), DCA, and CDCA at 25 μm. In addition, we confirmed that TGR5 derived from not only human but also the other all species examined responded similarly to these compounds in this assay (data not shown), suggesting that TGR5 functions as a receptor for bile acids commonly in mammals. Although TGR5 was suggested to be a GPCR based on its sequence (Fig.1), we expressed TGR5-GFP in CHO cells and then examined its subcellular localization (19Kallal L. Benovic J.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 175-180Google Scholar, 20Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Google Scholar). In the absence of a ligand, TGR5-GFP was typically localized at the plasma membrane (Fig.2 A, left panel) but internalized into the cytoplasm in response to TLCA (Fig.2 A, right panel). To confirm further that the interaction of TLCA and TGR5 occurred in the plasma membrane, we prepared membrane fractions from CHO-TGR5 and examined [35S]GTPγS binding to these fractions (Fig.2 B). Significant levels of the binding were detected at 1 μm TLCA. They reached 4–5 times the basal level at 10–100 μm TLCA in a dose-dependent manner. However, such increases in [35S]GTPγS binding were not detected in the membrane fractions of mock CHO cells. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAP kinase is reportedly activated in the signal transduction of GPCRs (20Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Google Scholar, 21English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Google Scholar). Treatment with TLCA rapidly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAP kinase activity in CHO-TGR5 cells but not in mock CHO cells (Fig. 2 C). In addition we found that TLCA, LCA, DCA, CDCA, and cholic acid (CA) dose-dependently induced the production of cAMP in CHO-TGR5 cells (Fig. 3 A) at the median effective concentrations (EC50) of 0.33, 0.53, 1.01, 4.43, and 7.72 μm, respectively. These bile acids did not induce the production of cAMP in mock CHO cells (data not shown). We examined various cholesterol metabolites and related compounds in cAMP production in CHO-TGR5 cells (Fig. 3 B). The agonistic activities seen appeared to increase in accordance with hydrophobicity and not only free forms but also taurine and glycine conjugates were active. Ursodeoxycholic acid and cholesterol were only slightly active, but pregnandione showed significant activity. These results suggest that the hydroxy groups as well as the 5β-cholanic acid structure are important for the ligands to exhibit agonistic activity on TGR5. (E)-([tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalenyl]propyl)benzoic acid (TTNPB), rifampicin, and 22(R)-hydroxysterol, which are potent agonists for farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, and liver X receptor, respectively (3Parks D.J.

When we compared stable CHO cell lines expressing various receptors, TLCA induced a response to TGR5 but not to EDG6, EDG7, or EDG8 (data not shown). Altogether, our results unequivocally demonstrate that TGR5 functions as a specific cell surface receptor for bile acids.Figure 3Promotion of cAMP production in CHO-TGR5 cells by bile acids.

We therefore analyzed its tissue distribution in human and rabbit by reverse transcription-PCR. High levels of TGR5 mRNA were detected in human placenta and spleen, whereas moderate levels were found in various other tissues including lung and fetal liver (Fig.4 A). In fractionated human leukocytes, TGR5 mRNA was detected mainly in the resting CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 4 B). Among rabbit tissues, the highest level of TGR5 mRNA was detected in the spleen (Fig.4 C). We also detected a high level of TGR5 mRNA in AMs, indicating that at least one of the major cells expressing TGR5 is a monocyte/macrophage. We therefore used rabbit AMs in the following experiments. An increase of intracellular cAMP reportedly results in the suppression of LPS-stimulated cytokine production in macrophages (23Yoshimura T. Kurita C. Nagao T. Usami E. Nakao T. Watanabe S. Kobayashi J. Yamazaki F. Tanaka H. Inagaki N. Nagai H. Pharmacology. 1997; 54: 144-152Google Scholar). In addition, CD14 has been shown to function as the LPS receptor (24Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Google Scholar). Because, as demonstrated above, bile acids were supposed to affect macrophage functions via TGR5, we examined this point. TLCA was found to increase cAMP production in AMs (Fig.5 A). TLCA, glycolithocholic acid, and LCA all significantly suppressed phagocytic activity in AMs (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, TLCA greatly reduced the induction of cytokine mRNAs (i.e. TNFα, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) in AMs stimulated with LPS (Fig. 5 C). Finally, LPS-induced TNFα secretion was significantly reduced with LCA, DCA, and CDCA and their taurine- or glycine-conjugated forms (Fig.5 D). These relative inhibitory activities mostly agreed with the cAMP production stimulatory activities observed on CHO-TGR5 cells. To determine whether the effects of these bile acids were exhibited through TGR5, we established a stable human monocytic cell line expressing TGR5 by transfecting an expression vector of human TGR5 into THP-1 cells. The original THP-1 cells expressed little TGR5 mRNA. TLCA, LCA, and DCA significantly induced cAMP production in THP-TGR5 cells, whereas TLCA did not do so in THP-1 cells (Fig.6 A). LPS-stimulated TNFα secretion was markedly reduced by bile acids including TLCA, LCA, DCA, and CDCA in THP-TGR5 cells but not in THP-1 cells (Fig. 6, Band C). Notably, the relative inhibitory activities of bile acids on TNFα secretion from THP-TGR5 cells almost paralleled those seen in rabbit AMs.Figure 6Immunosuppression by bile acids via TGR5 in THP-1 cells expressing TGR5.

T, taurine-conjugated; F, free.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have isolated a novel GPCR, TGR5, on the basis of sequence information of the databases. TGR5 was found to be identical to hGPCR19, which has been very recently reported by another group (25Takeda S. Kadowaki S. Haga T. Takaesu H. Mitaku S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 97-101Google Scholar). However, the ligands and functions of this receptor have been unidentified. In this paper, we have demonstrated that TGR5 functions as a cell surface receptor responsive to bile acids as agonists. Although nuclear receptors for bile acids have been reported, we believe this is the first report on the identification of a GPCR responsive to bile acids. We have found that the primary structures and responsiveness to bile acids are highly conserved in TGR5 among human, bovine, rabbit, rat, and mouse, suggesting that TGR5 has some important physiological functions. We tried to demonstrate a direct binding of [3H]TLCA to the membrane fractions of CHO-TGR5 but failed because [3H]TLCA showed high nonspecific binding to various substrates and cell membrane fractions (data not shown). We think that synthetic compounds with high affinity to TGR5 will be required to demonstrate the direct binding of a ligand to TGR5 in future studies. However, instead of that, we demonstrated that TGR5 functions as a cell surface receptor responsive to bile acids on the basis of several lines of evidence. By visualization using a fusion protein of TGR5 and GFP, we found that the fusion protein was apparently localized at the membrane of CHO cells, and bile acids induced the internalization of the fusion protein from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we demonstrated that [35S]GTPγS binding were specifically induced in the membrane fractions prepared from CHO-TGR5 by TLCA. Because the replacement of GDP and GTPγS is specifically induced in G proteins coupling to GPCRs, our results indicate that TGR5 is specifically activated by TLCA. Taken together with the results of internalization and [35S]GTPγS binding, TGR5 is thought to be directly responsive to bile acids. The treatment of bile acids specifically induced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAP kinase and intracellular cAMP production in CHO cells expressing TGR5. However, we could not detect any apparent change in intracellular Ca2+ in CHO cells expressing TGR5, suggesting that TGR5 couples to Gαs but not to Gαq or Gαi. Some lipid mediators reportedly have not only nuclear receptors but also cell surface receptors (26Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar). However, our research indicates that the nuclear and cell surface bile acid receptors possess distinctive functions. For example, taurine- or glycine-conjugated forms of bile acids showed agonistic activity on TGR5. However, they are reportedly inactive to the nuclear receptors in the absence of a specific transporter, even though bile acids usually exist as conjugated forms. In addition, the effective doses of the bile acids were lower for TGR5 than for the nuclear receptors (i.e. EC50 > 10 μm). Finally, the tissue distribution of TGR5 mRNA differed from those of the nuclear receptors; high levels of TGR5 mRNA were detected in the placenta, spleen, and monocytes/macrophages, whereas the nuclear receptors are mainly expressed in the liver, kidney, and intestine (2Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Google Scholar, 3Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G.

Although immunosuppressive effects of bile acids have been reported (6Keane R.M. Gadacz T.R. Munster A.M. Birmingham W. Winchurch R.A.

Hepatology. 1992; 16: 719-723Google Scholar), the precise mechanisms have remained unclear. The phagocytic capacity of the macrophages including Kupffer cells is depressed in cholestasis or obstructive jaundice (8Drivas G. James O. Wardle N. Br. Med. J. 1976; 26: 1568-1569Google Scholar). Furthermore, bile acids including DCA and CDCA have been reported to suppress LPS-induced production of cytokines in macrophages, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα (10Greve J.W. Gouma D.J. Buurman W.A. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 454-458Google Scholar, 11Calmus Y. Guechot J. Podevin P. Bonnefis M.T. Giboudeau J. Poupon R. Hepatology. 1992; 16: 719-723Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the immunosuppression is that bile acids might give damage to cell membranes. However, we confirmed that cell viabilities were more than 90% even after the treatment of rabbit AMs with bile acids up to 200 μm. It has been reported that cell viabilities of lymphocytes are not affected by the incubation with 250 μm DCA, CDCA, and ursodeoxycholic acid (6Keane R.M. Gadacz T.R. Munster A.M. Birmingham W. Winchurch R.A. Surgery. 1984; 95: 439-443Google Scholar). Taken together, it is unlikely that the immunosuppressive functions of bile acids are the results of damage to cell membrane. Greve et al. (10Greve J.W. Gouma D.J. Buurman W.A. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 454-458Google Scholar) demonstrate that bile acids such as DCA and CDCA inhibit LPS-induced TNFα secretion in human lymphocytes (10Greve J.W. Gouma D.J. Buurman W.A. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 454-458Google Scholar). They have demonstrated that these bile acids do not inactivate endotoxin directly, as measured in a chromogenic Limulus test, indicating that the effect of bile acids is not a result of direct interaction between bile acids and LPS. In our experiments, bile acids induced cAMP production in rabbit AMs and THP-TGR5 cells. It has been known that an increase of intracellular cAMP results in the suppression of LPS-stimulated cytokine production in macrophages (23Yoshimura T. Kurita C. Nagao T. Usami E. Nakao T. Watanabe S. Kobayashi J. Yamazaki F. Tanaka H. Inagaki N. Nagai H. Pharmacology. 1997; 54: 144-152Google Scholar). We showed here that TGR5 was abundantly expressed in monocytes/macrophages and that bile acids including LCA, DCA, and CDCA inhibited LPS-stimulated TNFα secretion in rabbit AMs. In addition, these bile acids clearly suppressed LPS-stimulated TNFα secretion in THP-TGR5 cells but not in parental THP-1 cells. These results suggest that the suppression of macrophage functions by bile acids is at least partly mediated via TGR5 through an increase of cAMP production. However, we could not directly demonstrate that the suppression of macrophage functions was mediated via TGR5 by means of loss-of-function experiments. To confirm the physiological functions of TGR5, we tried to design small interfering RNA for TGR5 to knock out the TGR5 functions, but we failed to obtain effective small interfering RNAs because TGR5 is encoded by a GC-rich sequence so that it was very difficult to design proper small interfering RNAs. We actually designed five different small interfering RNAs, but all of them were ineffective to suppress the expression of TGR5. We think that to solve this issue synthetic antagonists with high affinity will be necessary. Although our results suggest that TGR5 plays a role in the regulation of macrophage functions by bile acids, we do not rule out the possibility that TGR5 has other unknown important functions, because TGR5 mRNA is widely distributed not only in lymphoid tissues but also in other tissues. Our findings that TGR5 is responsive to bile acids will give an important clue in revealing the physiological functions of TGR5 in future studies. We thank Drs. Y. Sumino, O. Nishimura, and H. Onda for helpful discussions and Dr. H. Komatsu and A. Katano for collaboration."

We cloned ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) from a screen for mutants that suppress silencing of the Arabidopsis SUPERMAN (SUP) gene. The ago4-1 mutant reactivated silent SUP alleles and decreased CpNpG and asymmetric DNA methylation as well as histone H3 lysine-9 methylation. In addition, ago4-1 blocked histone and DNA methylation and the accumulation of 25-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that correspond to the retroelement AtSN1. These results suggest that AGO4 and long siRNAs direct chromatin modifications, including histone methylation and non-CpG DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1982352044,"The self-assembly of particles at fluid interfaces, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy, is well established. However, for nanoscopic particles, thermal fluctuations compete with interfacial energy and give rise to a particle-size-dependent self-assembly. Ligand-stabilized nanoparticles assembled into three-dimensional constructs at fluid-fluid interfaces, where the properties unique to the nanoparticles were preserved. The small size of the nanoparticles led to a weak confinement of the nanoparticles at the fluid interface that opens avenues to size-selective particle assembly, two-dimensional phase behavior, and functionalization. Fluid interfaces afford a rapid approach to equilibrium and easy access to nanoparticles for subsequent modification. A photoinduced transformation is described in which nanoparticles, initially soluble only in toluene, were transported across an interface into water and were dispersed in the water phase. The characteristic fluorescence emission of the nanoparticles provided a direct probe of their spatial distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2152124063,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia whose molecular etiology is poorly understood. We studied a family with hereditary persistent AF and identified the causative mutation (S140G) in the KCNQ1 (KvLQT1) gene on chromosome 11p15.5. The KCNQ1 gene encodes the pore-forming alpha subunit of the cardiac I(Ks) channel (KCNQ1/KCNE1), the KCNQ1/KCNE2 and the KCNQ1/KCNE3 potassium channels. Functional analysis of the S140G mutant revealed a gain-of-function effect on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE2 currents, which contrasts with the dominant negative or loss-of-function effects of the KCNQ1 mutations previously identified in patients with long QT syndrome. Thus, the S140G mutation is likely to initiate and maintain AF by reducing action potential duration and effective refractory period in atrial myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2126294926,"The distribution of plant species, the species compositions of different sites, and the factors that affect them in tropical rain forests are not well understood. The main hypotheses are that species composition is either (i) uniform over large areas, (ii) random but spatially autocorrelated because of dispersal limitation, or (iii) patchy and environmentally determined. Here we test these hypotheses, using a large data set from western Amazonia. The uniformity hypothesis gains no support, but the other hypotheses do. Environmental determinism explains a larger proportion of the variation in floristic differences between sites than does dispersal limitation; together, these processes explain 70 to 75% of the variation. Consequently, it is important that management planning for conservation and resource use take into account both habitat heterogeneity and biogeographic differences."

We report that in mice with the melanopsin gene ablated, RGCs retrograde-labeled from the suprachiasmatic nuclei were no longer intrinsically photosensitive, although their number, morphology, and projections were unchanged. These animals showed a pupillary light reflex indistinguishable from that of the wild type at low irradiances, but at high irradiances the reflex was incomplete, a pattern that suggests that the melanopsin-associated system and the classical rod/cone system are complementary in function."

The precise mechanism of action of nicotinic acid is unknown, although it is believed that activation of a Gi-G protein-coupled receptor may contribute. Utilizing available information on the tissue distribution of nicotinic acid receptors, we identified candidate orphan receptors. The selected orphan receptors were screened for responses to nicotinic acid, in an assay for activation of Gi-G proteins. Here we describe the identification of the G protein-coupled receptor HM74 as a low affinity receptor for nicotinic acid. We then describe the subsequent identification of HM74A in follow-up bioinformatics searches and demonstrate that it acts as a high affinity receptor for nicotinic acid and other compounds with related pharmacology.

The discovery of HM74A as a molecular target for nicotinic acid may facilitate the discovery of superior drug molecules to treat dyslipidemia. Nicotinic acid has been used in the treatment of dyslipidemia for many years, producing a very desirable modification of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, increasing high density lipoprotein, and decreasing very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and lipoprotein (a), which results in a reduction in mortality (1Tavintharan S. Kashyap M.L. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2001; 3: 74-82Google Scholar). Despite its long history of clinical use, the precise mechanism of action of nicotinic acid is unknown, although it is believed that inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis via the activation of a Gi-coupled receptor may contribute (2Aktories K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Arzneimittelforschung. 1980; 33: 1525-1527Google Scholar, 3Aktories K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 88-92Google Scholar, 4Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Google Scholar). It has been postulated that a reduction in free fatty acids liberated from adipose tissue results in a reduction of hepatic triglycerides available for very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein synthesis, which in part explains the hypolipidemic effects observed during nicotinic acid therapy. Because the identification of a molecular target for nicotinic acid would facilitate our understanding of its mode of action and potentially enable the discovery of superior drug molecules, we instigated a strategy to identify this receptor. To identify the Gi-G protein-coupled receptor for nicotinic acid, orphan receptors were selected based on their tissue expression profiles for a rational screening exercise. Recently, the pharmacological sites of action of nicotinic acid were shown to be largely restricted to adipose tissue and spleen (5Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Lang H. Andrianov V. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 349-357Google Scholar). Therefore, to identify this nicotinic acid receptor, we selected a subset of 10 orphan G protein-coupled receptors, which by mRNA distribution analysis (TaqMan) exhibited significant expression levels in both adipose tissue and spleen. These receptors were then expressed in an appropriate mammalian cell line to allow measurement of a functional response (GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; GIRK, G protein-regulated potassium channel; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; GIRK, G protein-regulated potassium channel; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary binding) following nicotinic acid treatment. This paper describes the identification of HM74 as a low affinity receptor for nicotinic acid and the subsequent indication of HM74A, a high affinity receptor for nicotinic acid. The identification of HM74A has allowed us to test additional compounds that have been reported to possess a similar pharmacology to nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid, nicotinuric acid, and nicotinamide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, 5-methyl nicotinic acid was from Maybridge, and pyridine-3-acetic acid was from ICN. LipofectAMINE, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. [35S]GTPγS (1160 Ci/mmol) and [5,6-3H]nicotinic acid (50–60 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Biotrend, respectively. Pertussis toxin was from Sigma-Aldrich. Acipimox, Acifran, and 5-methyl pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized by chemists within GlaxoSmithKline. The HM74 expressed sequence tag was identified from the public data base as a potential seven transmembrane-spanning receptor, and the predicted open reading frame was amplified using human placenta cDNA as template. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of HM74 with that of the published sequence revealed 15 nucleotide differences as well as a 5-nucleotide insertion at the 3′ end of the clone that resulted in a different 3′ coding sequence. The cloning procedure was performed twice more to confirm the changes in the amino acid sequence. To confirm the correct initiation methionine, a cDNA clone containing the entire coding region and the 5′-untranslated region was isolated using human placenta cDNA library. Sequence analysis of the clone, which we termed HM74A, showed the presence of a stop codon prior to the first initiation methionine. A murine sequence with significant homology to human HM74 was identified by searching public domain data bases with the peptide sequence for human HM74 taken from GenBankTM accession number D10923. A TBLASTN search produced significant alignment with accession numbers AJ300198 and AJ300199, which encode the Mus musculus PUMA-G gene for a putative seven transmembrane-spanning receptor (termed mHM74A). Using the human and murine sequence information, the PCR was used to amplify the corresponding rat gene. The accession number for human HM74A is AY148884. The cDNA sequence of rat HM74A is partially represented by EMM_patAR098624. Poly(A)+ RNA from 20 tissues of four different individuals (two males, two females except prostate) was prepared, reverse transcribed, and analyzed by TaqMan quantitative PCR as described previously (6Chapman C.G. Meadows H.J. Godden R.J. Campbell D.A. Duckworth M. Kelsell R.E. Murdock P.R. Randall A.D. Rennie G.I. Gloger I.S. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 82: 74-83Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was reverse transcribed using random priming, and the cDNA produced was used to make up to 1,000 replicate plates with each well containing the cDNA from 50 ng of poly(A)+ RNA. TaqMan quantitative PCR (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) was used to assess the level of each gene relative to genomic DNA standards. The data are presented as the means of mRNA copies detected per ng of poly(A)+ RNA from four individuals ± S.E. (n = 4). The gene-specific reagents were: HM74, forward primer, 5′-ACTACTATGTGCGGCGTTCAGAC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GGCGGTTCATGGCAAACA-3′; TaqMan probe, 5′-ACCAGCCGGCAAGGGATGTCC-3′; HM74A, forward primer, 5′-ACAACTATGTGAGGCGTTGGGA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TGGCGGTTCATAGCCAACA-3′; TaqMan probe, 5′-ATCAGCCGGCAAGGGATGTCC-3′; GPR81, forward primer, 5′-TCGGATGAAGAAGGCGACC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCTGGGCAGGTAGCATGTG-3′; and TaqMan probe, 5′-TGAACACAATTGCCACCACCATGTG-3′. For transient transfections, HEK293T cells (HEK293 cells stably expressing the SV40 large T-antigen) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were seeded in 90-mm culture dishes and grown to 60–80% confluence (18–24 h) prior to transfection with vectors containing the relevant DNA inserts using LipofectAMINE reagent. For transfection, 9 μg of DNA was mixed with 30 μl of LipofectAMINE in 0.6 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and was incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to the addition of 1.6 ml of Opti-MEM. The cells were exposed to the LipofectAMINE/DNA mixture for 5 h, and 6 ml of 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was then added. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Pertussis toxin treatment was carried out by supplementation into the medium at 50 ng ml−1 for 16 h. All of the transient transfection studies involved co-transfection of receptor together with the Gi/o G protein, Gαo1. For the generation of stable cell lines, the above method was used to transfect CHO-K1 cells seeded in six-well dishes grown to 30% confluence. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. 48 h post-transfection the medium was supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 for selection of antibiotic resistant cells. Clonal CHO-K1 cell lines stably expressing HM74A were confirmed by [35S]GTPγS binding measurements, following the addition of nicotinic acid. Plasma membrane-containing P2 particulate fractions were prepared from cell pastes frozen at −80 °C after harvest. All of the procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (buffer A), and by homogenization for 20 s with a Ultra Turrax followed by passage (5 times) through a 25-gauge needle. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min in a microcentrifuge to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells, and P2 particulate fractions were recovered by microcentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. P2 particulate fractions were resuspended in buffer A and stored at −80 °C until required. Saturation binding assays were carried out on plasma membrane-containing P2 particulate fractions from HEK293T cells transiently co-expressing HM74A and Gαo1 using 3H-labeled nicotinic acid as described (5Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Lang H. Andrianov V. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 349-357Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes (10 μg/point) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [5,6-3H]nicotinic acid (60 Ci/mmol; Biotrend) for 3 h at room temperature with agitation. The assay was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4 binding buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 500 μl. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 1 mm nicotinic acid. Membrane-bound ligand was recovered onto presoaked GF/B filters using a Brandel 48-well harvester, washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, and measured by liquid scintillation counting. [3H]Nicotinic acid (20 nm) displacement assays were performed using plasma membrane-containing P2 particulate fractions, prepared from either a stable CHO cell line expressing recombinant human HM74A or human adipocytes (Zen-Bio) as described (5Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Lang H. Andrianov V. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 349-357Google Scholar) and above. [35S]GTPγS binding assays were performed at room temperature in 96-well format as described previously (7Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 3-13Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes (10 μg/point) were diluted to 0.083 mg/ml in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) supplemented with saponin (10 mg/l) and preincubated with 10 μm GDP. Various concentrations of nicotinic acid or related molecules were added, followed by [35S]GTPγS (1170 Ci/mmol; AmershamBiosciences) at 0.3 nm (total volume of 100 μl), and binding was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min. Nonspecific binding was determined by the inclusion of 0.6 mm GTP. Wheat germ agglutinin SPA beads (AmershamBiosciences) (0.5 mg) in 25 μl of assay buffer were added, and the whole was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with agitation. The plates were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, and bound [35S]GTPγS was determined by scintillation counting on a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux scintillation counter. Capped cRNA (20–50 ng/oocyte) was injected into stage V–VI defolliculated oocytes (8Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-279Google Scholar), and two microelectrode voltage clamp recordings were made 3–7 days post-RNA injection from a holding potential of −60 mV. The oocytes were superfused with ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 at 25 °C) at a flow rate of 2 ml min−1. To facilitate the recording of GIRK1/GIRK4 potassium currents, the extracellular solution was switched to a high potassium solution (90 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES). The recording electrodes had a resistance of 0.5–1.0 MΩ when filled with 3 m KCl. The measurements of potassium currents were made from two batches of oocytes harvested on different days from different toads. Nicotinic acid was applied by addition to the superfusate, and cumulative concentration response curves were constructed for each individual oocyte tested. Human HM74A was subcloned into p426GPD adjacent to the promoter (9Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Google Scholar), transferred to pRS306, and integrated into theura3 locus of MMY16 (10Olesnicky N.S. Brown A.J. Dowell S.J. Casselton L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2756-2763Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays to measure FUS1-lacZ reporter gene induction were performed as described (11Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.M. Watson M.-A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C.J. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Google Scholar) except that nicotinic acid was omitted from the assay mix, and the substrate fluorescein-β-d-galactopyranoside (Molecular Probes; final concentration, 20 μm) was used in place of chlorophenol red-β-d-galactosidase. Nicotinic acid-mediated stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding was observed only in membranes from HEK293T cells co-transfected with the cDNA for HM74 and the G protein Gαo1 (Fig. 1 A). The nicotinic acid-induced stimulation was concentration-dependent and was found to be abolished following pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (50 ng ml−1 for 16 h), suggesting that the effect was Gi/o G protein-mediated (Fig. 1 B). However, the half-maximal effector concentration for nicotinic acid was estimated to be in excess of 1 mm, over 1000-fold higher than that previously reported in rat adipose tissue and spleen membranes (5Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Lang H. Andrianov V. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 349-357Google Scholar). Subsequent to the identification of HM74 as a low affinity receptor for nicotinic acid, we utilized a molecular biology approach to identify a novel paralogue of HM74, termed HM74A. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of HM74A and HM74 revealed 15 base changes as well as a 5-nucleotide insertion at the 3′ end of the clone resulting in HM74A possessing a shortened C-terminal tail (Fig.2 A). The two receptors are highly homologous, displaying 96% identity at the protein level and differing by only 15 amino acids. A third gene, GPR81, previously identified by customized searching of the GenBankTM high throughput genomic sequences data base (12Lee D.K. Nguyen T. Lynch K.R. Cheng R. Vanti W.B. Arkhitko O. Lewis T. Evans J.F. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 83-91Google Scholar), was also found to exhibit substantial homology to HM74 and HM74A (57 and 58% amino acid sequence identity, respectively). Despite their high degree of similarity, HM74 and HM74A are not simply polymorphic variants but are separate genes being co-located with GPR81 at chromosome 12q24.31 (part of this region of chromosome 12 is represented by accession number AC026362). Messenger RNA expression profiling of HM74 and HM74A using TaqMan quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis with probes designed and confirmed to discriminate between these two homologous receptors (data not shown) showed that both exhibited similar distribution patterns that were largely restricted to adipose tissue and spleen (Fig. 2 B). Hence, the expression patterns of HM74A and HM74 are concomitant with that of a nicotinic acid receptor. Interestingly, GPR81 appears to be highly restricted to adipose tissue.Figure 2HM74 and HM74A are highly homologous proteins with similar mRNA tissue distribution patterns and chromosomal location. A, amino acid sequences of human HM74 and human and rat HM74A aligned for comparison. Residues sharing identity between human and rat HM74A but not with HM74 are indicated withasterisks. B, TaqMan quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of mRNA levels in human tissues. The cDNA from the reverse transcription of 1 ng of poly (A)+ RNA from multiple tissues for four different nondiseased individuals was assessed for its HM74, HM74A, and GPR81 and housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), mRNA levels. The data are presented as the means (± S.E.) mRNA levels from four individuals for each tissue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of HM74A together with Gαo1 in HEK293T cells gave robust concentration-dependent responses to nicotinic acid with a half-maximal concentration (EC50 = 250 ± 27 nm) similar to that observed in rat adipose tissue and spleen membranes (5Lorenzen A.

Conversely, GPR81 responded to nicotinic acid only at relatively high concentrations (10 mm). Expression of HM74A, but not HM74 or GPR81, also produced saturable specific binding of 3H-labeled nicotinic acid with an affinity (K d 95.8 ± 9.5 nm) similar to that recorded from rat adipose tissue and spleen membranes (5Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Lang H. Andrianov V. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 349-357Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). We have not been able to quantify the levels of expression of HM74 and GPR81 because of their low affinity for nicotinic acid. Next, we expressed HM74A and HM74 inXenopus oocytes to study their coupling to the Gi-G protein-regulated potassium channels GIRK1 and GIRK4 (13Uezono Y. Bradley J. Min C. McCarty N.A. Quick M. Riordan J.R. Chavkin C. Zinn K. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 233-241Google Scholar). Concentration-dependent responses to nicotinic acid with a half-maximal concentration (EC50) of 130 ± 50 nm were observed for HM74A (four oocytes). Responses to nicotinic acid were also obtained at concentrations of 100 μm and above following expression of HM74 (5 oocytes) (Fig. 3 C). Finally, we investigated coupling to the pheromone response pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, measuring receptor activation with a reporter gene. Using nicotinic acid-free growth medium, we demonstrated concentration-dependent activation of HM74A in response to nicotinic acid (EC50 = 904 ± 28 nm; Fig. 3 D). The optimal agonist responses were observed with chimeric yeast/mammalian Gα subunits having the C-terminal 5 amino acids of Gi or the promiscuous Gα, G16 (Fig. 3 D and data not shown) (11Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.M. Watson M.-A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C.J. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Google Scholar). The yeast data confirm that HM74A is sufficient to confer the nicotinic acid response, because these cells lack endogenous G protein-coupled receptors capable of activating this pathway. A number of nicotinic acid analogues were employed to characterize HM74A using the [35S]GTPγS binding assay (TableI). Similar rank orders of potency were found at HM74A compared with those previously described in native rat tissue (5Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Lang H. Andrianov V. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 349-357Google Scholar), whereas all of the analogues displayed either no or very weak activity at HM74 (data not shown). All of the analogues were also inactive at GPR81 (data not shown). Furthermore, we also cloned the rat orthologue of HM74A, which was found to exhibit 82% identity at the protein level with its human counterpart (Fig. 2 A). As expected, no significant pharmacological differences were observed between recombinantly expressed rat and human HM74A (Table I).Table IComparison of functional activity of nicotinic acid analogues at human and rat HM74ACompoundEC50Human HM74ARat HM74AμmNicotinic acid0.25 ± 0.0270.4 ± 0.053-Pyridine-acetic acid5.5 ± 0.9513.7 ± 3.25-Methylnicotinic acid8.7 ± 4.022.4 ± 5.2Nicotinamide>1000>1000Nicotinuric acid>1000>10003-CyanopyridineinactiveinactivePotencies are given as means of the EC50 obtained from three separate experiments (± S.E.).

Acipimox (Olbetam) and Acifran (AY-25,712) are two molecules that have been reported to produce a pharmacological profile resembling that of nicotinic acid in rat and human studies (14Lovisolo P.P. Briatico-Vangosa G. Orsini G. Ronchi R. Angelucci R. Pharmacol. Res. Commun. 1981; 13: 163-174Google Scholar, 15Crepaldi G. Avogaro P. Descovich G.C. DiPerri T. Postiglione A. Sirtori C.R. Strano A.

Using the [35S]GTPγS binding assay, we found that Acipimox was a full agonist at HM74A (EC50 = 6 ± 1 μm) and exhibited weak activity at HM74 and no activity at GPR81. Acifran acted as a full and relatively potent agonist at both HM74A (EC50 = 2.1 ± 0.2 μm) and HM74 (EC50 = 20 ± 4 μm) but showed no significant agonism at GPR81 up to 1 mm (Fig.4 B). Acifran also activated HM74A in yeast (EC50= 3.0 ± 0.08 μm). The fact that Acifran has been identified as a high affinity ligand for HM74 (Fig. 4 B) strongly suggests that our transfection system is sufficiently efficient to allow agonist profiling. Furthermore, the signal to noise ratios observed with Acifran at both HM74A and HM74 are similar, which suggests that these receptors are expressed at similar levels. In addition, we have expressed HM74A and HM74 in a range of different systems (mammalian, yeast, and oocyte), and in all of these expression systems there is an ∼1000-fold separation in the potency of nicotinic acid, suggesting that this is a real observation. Acifran and Acipimox were included in a group of molecules with structural or pharmacological similarities with nicotinic acid that were tested in a [3H]nicotinic acid displacement assay performed in membranes from either a stable CHO cell line expressing recombinant human HM74A or human adipocytes (TableII). The rank order of potency for the displacement of [3H]nicotinic acid binding was nicotinic acid > 5-methyl pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid = pyridine-3-acetic acid > Acifran > 5-methyl nicotinic acid = Acipimox ≫ nicotinuric acid = nicotinamide. This rank order of potency was the same in both the stable CHO cell line expressing recombinant human HM74A and human adipocytes.Table IIA comparison of the potency of a range of HM74A agonists at displacing [3H]nicotinic acid from either CHO membranes expressing recombinant human HM74A or human adipocyte membranesMean IC50 ± S.E. for displacement of [3H]nicotinic acid from CHO membranes expressing human HM74AMean IC50 ± S.E. for displacement of [3H]nicotinic acid from human adipocyte membranesμmμmNicotinic acid0.081 ± 0.003 (n = 14)0.079 ± 0.003 (n = 8)5-Methyl pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid0.525 ± 0.041 (n = 11)0.518 ± 0.022 (n = 4)Pyridine-3-acetic acid0.535 ± 0.052 (n = 6)0.553 ± 0.061 (n = 4)Acifran1.12 ± 0.052 (n = 8)0.833 ± 0.050 (n = 4)5-Methyl nicotinic acid4.12 ± 0.063 (n = 7)3.68 ± 0.66 (n = 3)Acipimox5.10 ± 0.039 (n = 6)4.34 ± 0.51 (n = 4)Nicotinuric acid70.5 ± 2.76 (n = 7)63.8 ± 6.20 (n = 3)Nicotinamide92.3 ± 4.72 (n = 7)75.3 ± 3.41 (n = 3) Open table in a new tab HM74 was identified as a low affinity receptor for nicotinic acid following the screening of a panel of orphan receptors selected because of their tissue expression profile. HM74 is an orphan receptor that had been previously cloned from a cDNA library derived from human monocytes (18Nomura H. Nielsen B.W. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 1239-1249Google Scholar). The half-maximal effector concentration for nicotinic acid at HM74 was estimated to be in excess of 1 mm, ∼1000-fold higher than that previously reported in membranes produced from rat adipose tissue or spleen (5Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Lang H. Andrianov V. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 349-357Google Scholar). We considered three possible explanations for this discrepancy in nicotinic acid potency. First, close homologues of HM74 may act as higher affinity nicotinic acid receptors. Second, because G protein-mediated nicotinic acid effects on native tissue have almost always been recorded from rat, variation between human and rodent receptors may explain this phenomenon. Finally, differences in the pharmacological integrity of the recombinantly expressed receptor and its endogenously expressed counterpart may explain potency changes. A molecular biology approach resulted in the identification of a novel paralogue of HM74, termed HM74A. Despite their high degree of similarity, HM74 and HM74A are not simply polymorphic variants but are separate genes being co-located with GPR81 at chromosome 12q24.31. TaqMan analysis confirmed that the expression pattern of HM74A was very similar to HM74. When expressed in a variety of test systems, HM74A was confirmed as a high affinity receptor for nicotinic acid. The activity and affinity of nicotinic acid was in good agreement with that previously reported in the literature (5Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Lang H. Andrianov V. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 349-357Google Scholar). Furthermore, following the cloning of the rat orthologue of HM74A, we found no significant pharmacological differences between nicotinic acid derivatives tested against either human or rat HM74A. The murine variant of HM74A, PUMA-G, was recently reported to be an interferon γ-inducible gene in macrophages, suggesting a possible role in macrophage function (19Schaub A. Futterer A. Pfeffer K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3714-3725Google Scholar). This finding is further supported by a recent report describing a nicotinic acid receptor in a murine macrophage cell line (20Lorenzen A. Stannek C. Burmeister A. Kalvinsh I. Schwabe U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 645-648Google Scholar). Based on the TaqMan data generated for the distribution of human HM74A, there appears to be little or no expression in macrophages (Fig.2 B). This may indicate that species differences in the distribution of HM74A exist or is a reflection of the activation state of the macrophages used in this experiment. It will be of interest to determine whether the expression of HM74A can be up-regulated in human macrophages following incubation with interferon γ. In the [3H]nicotinic acid displacement assay, both the absolute potency and the rank order of potency of the HM74A ligands studied was the same, whether tested against the stable CHO cell line expressing recombinant human HM74A or human adipocytes. These data strongly suggest that HM74A is the Gi-G protein-coupled nicotinic acid receptor on human adipocytes. Acipimox and Acifran have also been identified as full agonists at HM74A. These compounds have also been reported to produce a pharmacological effect resembling that of nicotinic acid in rat and human studies (14Lovisolo P.P. Briatico-Vangosa G. Orsini G. Ronchi R. Angelucci R. Pharmacol. Res. Commun. 1981; 13: 163-174Google Scholar, 15Crepaldi G. Avogaro P. Descovich G.C. DiPerri T. Postiglione A. Sirtori C.R. Strano A. Ventura S. Musatti L. Atherosclerosis. 1988; 70: 115-121Google Scholar, 16Cayen M.N. Kallai-Sanfacon M.A. Dubec J. Greselin E. Dvornik D. Atherosclerosis. 1982; 45: 267-279Google Scholar, 17Hunninghake D.B. Edwards D.G. Sopko G.S. Tosiello R.L. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 38: 313-317Google Scholar). The other compounds identified that displace nicotinic acid from HM74A, 5-methyl pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, and 5-methyl nicotinic acid, have all previously been shown to inhibit adipocyte lipolysis (2Aktories K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Arzneimittelforschung. 1980; 33: 1525-1527Google Scholar, 23Credner K. Tauscher M. Jozic L. Brenner G. Arzneimittelforschung. 1981; 31: 2096-2100Google Scholar). Nicotinamide, which unlike nicotinic acid produces no alteration in lipoprotein profiles (22Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Oates J.A. Jackson-Roberts L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 812-815Google Scholar), acted only as a very weak agonist at HM74A. Indeed, nicotinamide was ∼1000-fold less potent than nicotinic acid, a level of activity that could be due to contaminant nicotinic acid (e.g. 0.1%). It would appear that activation of HM74A would account for the inhibition of lipolysis observed with these compounds. Therefore, of the compounds that have been tested in man, it would appear that potency at HM74A is linked with their efficacy at normalizing lipoprotein profiles. We have demonstrated that HM74A is a high affinity receptor for nicotinic acid and believe that this receptor is a likely candidate as a molecule target for the beneficial therapeutic effects observed with nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid is an effective therapeutic agent; however, it has to be administered at high doses and has a characteristic side effect profile defined by intense, but transient, prostaglandin-mediated cutaneous vasodilation (“flushing”) that affects patient compliance (21Stern R.H. Spence J.D. Freeman D.J. Parbtani A. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 50: 66-70Google Scholar, 22Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Oates J.A. Jackson-Roberts L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 812-815Google Scholar). Unlike HM74A, we were unable to identify rodent orthologues of HM74 using conventional gene cloning strategies and bioinformatics searches. This suggests that in humans HM74 may be the result of a relatively recent gene duplication event. Furthermore, of the compounds tested, only Acifran exhibited activity at HM74. In fact, Acifran is the first molecule that we have identified to date that exhibits significant potency at HM74. Because of the high degree of homology between HM74A and HM74 and the existence of highly selective ligands, site-directed mutagenesis may be a useful strategy in determining which amino acid residues play a key role in ligand binding. Indeed, 11 amino acid residues are conserved in human and rat HM74A but not in HM74 (Fig.2 A). Such residues may play key roles in determining the differences in ligand binding affinities between HM74A and HM74. The identification of HM74A as a molecular target for nicotinic acid will facilitate the discovery of potent and selective ligands for this receptor and may expedite the discovery of improved anti-hyperlipidemic drug molecules.

Dkc1m cells from G1 and G2 mice were impaired in ribosomal RNA pseudouridylation before the onset of disease. Reductions of telomere length in Dkc1m mice became evident only in later generations.

https://openalex.org/W2096043228,"A small molecule, α-(trichloromethyl)-4-pyridineethanol (PETCM), was identified by high-throughput screening as an activator of caspase-3 in extracts of a panel of cancer cells. PETCM was used in combination with biochemical fractionation to identify a pathway that regulates mitochondria-initiated caspase activation. This pathway consists of tumor suppressor putative HLA-DR–associated proteins (PHAP) and oncoprotein prothymosin-α (ProT). PHAP proteins promoted caspase-9 activation after apoptosome formation, whereas ProT negatively regulated caspase-9 activation by inhibiting apoptosome formation. PETCM relieved ProT inhibition and allowed apoptosome formation at a physiological concentration of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. Elimination of ProT expression by RNA interference sensitized cells to ultraviolet irradiation–induced apoptosis and negated the requirement of PETCM for caspase activation. Thus, this chemical-biological combinatory approach has revealed the regulatory roles of oncoprotein ProT and tumor suppressor PHAP in apoptosis."

To identify which adipocyte transcription factors might be targeted by TGF-β, we overexpressed key adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ in NIH3T3 cells and tested the ability of TGF-β to block adipogenesis. We show that TGF-β inhibits adipocyte differentiation driven by either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ without affecting C/EBP protein expression levels, suggesting that these C/EBPs are a direct target of TGF-β action. Because TGF-β inhibits adipogenesis by signaling through Smad3, we examined physical and functional interactions of Smad3 and Smad4 with C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and PPARγ2. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were found to physically interact with Smad3 and Smad4, and Smad3 cooperated with Smad4 and TGF-β signaling to repress the transcriptional activity of C/EBPs. Thus, repression of the activity of C/EBPs by Smad3/4 at C/EBP binding sites inhibited transcription from the PPARγ2 and leptin promoters. In contrast, PPARγ interacted only very weakly with Smad3 and its transcriptional activity was not repressed by Smad3/4 or in response to TGF-β. Smad3/4 did not reduce the ability of C/EBP to bind to its cognate DNA sequence, but repressed transcription by inhibiting the transactivation function of C/EBP."
https://openalex.org/W2002131406,"Bloom syndrome, characterized by a predisposition to cancer, is caused by mutation of the RecQ DNA helicase gene BLM. The precise function of BLM remains unclear. Previous research suggested that Drosophila BLM functions in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Most double-strand breaks in flies are repaired by homologous recombination through the synthesis-dependent strand-annealing pathway. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila BLM mutants are severely impaired in their ability to carry out repair DNA synthesis during synthesis-dependent strand annealing. Consequently, repair in the mutants is completed by error-prone pathways that create large deletions. These results suggest a model in which BLM maintains genomic stability by promoting efficient repair DNA synthesis and thereby prevents double-strand break repair by less precise pathways."

While full-length PS1 has a rapid turnover rate, the NTF and CTF stably accumulate at 1:1 stoichiometry as heterodimers that associate with nicastrin and other proteins to form high molecular weight complexes (22Thinakaran G. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 183-192Google Scholar). The absolute levels of PS1 fragments are maintained in a highly regulated and saturable manner (22Thinakaran G. J. Mol.

Therefore, only a subset of molecules is selected for the “cleavage” pathway and the remainder is targeted for “rapid degradation,” indicating that PS1 endoproteolytic cleavage is regulated by association with limiting cellular components (23Thinakaran G.

Furthermore, down-regulation of either PEN-2 or APH-1 (by RNAi) results in reduction of PS1 fragments and impaired γ-secretase activity, indicating that PEN-2 and APH-1 are crucial for γ-secretase activity (30Francis R.

However, the cellular mechanism by which PEN-2 and APH-1 regulate the PS1 complex and γ-secretase activity remains unknown. In the present study, we characterize endogenous PEN-2 in mammalian cells and demonstrate for the first time the function of PEN-2, with coordination of APH-1, in mediating the proteolytic processing/biogenesis of PS1 fragments. Mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells were maintained in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was used for CHO and HeLa cell cultures. Full-length humanpen-2 was amplified by PCR from I.M.A.G.E. clone 3901082. Expression construct was generated by inserting full-length cDNA in frame with HA in pRK5 (Genetech) at the amino terminus of PEN-2. Since inactivation of APH-1b only subtly reduces PS fragments in HeLa cells (33Lee S.F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Google Scholar), we mainly focused on APH-1a in current study. mAPH-1aL-Myc/His was described previously (33Lee S.F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Google Scholar). Nicastrin and presenilin expression constructs were described previously (26Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S.

Coexpression of multiple cDNA constructs was achieved by cotransfection of equal amount of DNA, resulting in comparable levels of protein expression. Small RNA duplexes were generated by Dharmacon Research, Inc. against mousePEN-2 (5′-AAGGCTATGTTTGGCGCTCAG), mouseAPH-1a (5′-AAGGCAGATGAGGGCTTAGCA), and humanPEN-2 (5′-AAAGGCTATGTCTGGCGCTCA). Control siRNA (5′AAATGTGTGTACGTCTCCTCC) was designed by random nucleotides selection without targeting any sequence in the genome (by Blast search). siRNAs were transfected into N2a cells or HeLa cells using oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) on the first and forth days. On the 6th day, RNA was extracted by Qiagen Rneasy miniprep kit combined with QIAshredder (Qiagen). Down-regulation of PEN-2 and APH-1aexpression was determined by RT-PCR using SuperScript one-step RT-PCR with Platium Taq (Invitrogen). Primers 5′-CAGCGCAACTATGAACTTGGAG and 5′-CATCCTGGGAGAAAGAACAGATC were used to amplify PEN-2 mRNA. Primers 5′-AGTATGGCCTCCTGATTTTTGGTG and 5′-CCTCCGGCTGTGATGAACG were used to amplify APH-1amRNA. Rabbit polyclonal antibody PNT2 was generated (in Dr. Thinakaran's laboratory at the University of Chicago) against the NH2-terminal 26 amino acids of PEN-2 and polyclonal antibody CR8 was generated (in Dr. Kim's laboratory at Columbia University) against the COOH-terminal 25 amino acids of PEN-2. Polyclonal antibodies Ab14 (35Xu H. Gouras G.K. Greenfield J.P. Vincent B. Naslund J. Mazzarelli L. Fried G. Jovanovic J.N. Seeger M. Relkin N.R. Liao F. Checler F. Buxbaum J.D. Chait B.T.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Google Scholar) specifically recognize epitopes at the NH2 terminus and within the hydrophilic loop domain of PS1. HA-tagged PEN-2 was detected using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma). Monoclonal γ-adaptin antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used in Western blot at 1:1000. For protein extract preparation and immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were solubilized with 1% CHAPSO in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 2 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). For subcellular fractionation, cells were homogenized using a ball-bearing cell cracker, and cell lysates were fractionated using sucrose density gradient as described (19Greenfield J.P. Tsai J. Gouras G.K. Hai B. Thinakaran G. Checler F. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 742-747Google Scholar, 36Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O. Veselits M.L. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Google Scholar). To investigate biological functions of endogenous mammalian PEN-2, polyclonal antibodies against the NH2 terminus (PNT2) or COOH terminus (CR8) of mammalian PEN-2 were generated. Western blot analysis of N2a cell lysates revealed that the PEN-2 antibody CR8 detected a polypeptide of ∼12 kDa, which is the predicted molecular weight of PEN-2. The antibody also recognized exogenous HA-PEN-2 that has a higher molecular weight due to the presence of the HA tag. The specificity of the antibody was further tested by immunoprecipitation. Significant amounts of endogenous PEN-2 were precipitated by CR8 but not by the preimmune serum (Fig.1 A). Consistent with the previous report (32Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Google Scholar), the level of endogenous PEN-2 is largely decreased in PS1/PS2 double knock-out embryonic stem cells (Fig.1 B), further confirming that the 12-kDa band detected by CR8 antibody is indeed endogenous PEN-2. As predicted from the primary amino acid sequence, PEN-2 is an integral membrane protein as detected only in the membrane-enriched fractions resulting from 10,000 × g and 100,000 ×g sedimentation (Fig. 1 C). As expected, subcellular fractionation studies using a well established sucrose gradient revealed that endogenous PEN-2 is localized in the ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1 D). The subcellular localization of endogenous APH-1 has been recently demonstrated to be mainly in the ER and cis-Golgi (34Gu Y. Chen F. Sanjo N. Kawarai T. Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Li W. Ruan X. Luthra A. Mount H.T. Tandon A. Fraser P.E. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (December 5, 10.1074/jbc.M209499200)Google Scholar). PEN-2 has been shown to be a functional component of γ-secretase complex, and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous PEN-2 and PS1 fragments using PS1 antibodies has been reported (32Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the interaction is also mediated through full-length PS1, as both PS1 full-length and fragments coexist in the precipitates. To further decipher the relationship between PEN-2 and PS1, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments in N2a cell extracts using PEN-2 antibody CR8 to precipitate endogenous PEN-2. Surprisingly, we only detected insignificant levels, if any (see darker exposure in Fig.2 A), of PS1 fragments from the precipitated products. To confirm this observation and to rule out the possibility that binding of the COOH-terminal PEN-2 antibody could have interfered with the association of PS1 fragments with PEN-2, another PEN-2 antibody raised against the NH2 terminus, PNT2, was also used in coimmuniprecipitation studies of N2a cells (data not shown) and mouse brain homogenates. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both PEN-2 antibodies failed to coimmunoprecipitate appreciable levels of PS1 CTF from mouse brain homogenates. In contrast, significant amounts of PS1 CTF were clearly immunoprecipitated by APH-1aL antibody H2D2 (33Lee S.F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Google Scholar) from N2a cells (Fig. 2 A) and mouse brain (Fig.2 B). The absence of readily detectable association between PS1 fragments and PEN-2 in coimmunoprecipitation studies led us to hypothesize that the interaction between PEN-2 and PS1 complex may be mediated via full-length PS1. Since the levels of endogenous full-length PS1 are extremely low in N2a cells, stably transfected cells overexpressing human PS1 were used for coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Similar to what was observed in naı̈ve N2a cells, anti-PEN-2 antibody failed to precipitate the fragments of PS1. However, a substantial amount of full-length PS1 was coimmunoprecipitated by PEN-2 antibody but not the preimmune serum (Fig. 2 C). These findings demonstrate that PEN-2 binds preferentially to full-length PS1, supporting our hypothesis that the interaction of PEN-2 with PS1 complex is likely through its association with full-length PS1. Previous studies have proposed that endoproteolysis of full-length PS1, required for the formation of the active and stable PS/γ-secretase complex, is facilitated by cellular factors available at limiting levels (23Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Google Scholar, 24Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Google Scholar). Our observation of robust interaction between PEN-2 and full-length PS1 prompted us to examine whether PEN-2 is a potential factor mediating PS1 proteolytic processing. To this end, we inhibited endogenous PEN-2 and APH-1a expression in N2a cells by siRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The diminution of endogenous PEN-2 and APH-1a mRNA by siRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig.3, A and B) and Northern blot analyses (data not shown). Consistent with earlier studies using Drosophila S2, HEK293, and HeLa cells (30Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J.

Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Google Scholar), down-regulation of APH-1a expression caused a reduction in the levels of PS1 fragments (CTF) in N2a cells (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, down-regulation of PEN-2 expression led to a significant accumulation of full-length PS1 and concomitant decrease in the levels of processed PS1 derivatives. A similar effect of PEN-2 siRNA was observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 A). The reduction of PS1 fragments may be attributed to either instability of the existing PS1 complex or a failure in de novogeneration of the fragments or a combination of both. In the case of PEN-2 siRNA-transfected cells, judging from the inverse relationship between the levels of PS1 holoprotein and processed fragments, the most likely explanation is that the reduced level of PS1 fragments resulted from a failure in their de novo generation by endoproteolysis of nascent PS1 holoprotein. Thus our findings from studies of RNA interference together with interaction between full-length PS1 and PEN-2 strongly suggest a role for PEN-2 in mediating the endoproteolysis of PS1. It has been found that newly synthesized full-length PS1 peptides are rapidly endoproteolytically cleaved into fragments, and excess full-length PS1 in transfected cells that fail to be converted to fragments is rapidly degraded (23Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Google Scholar). To explore whether the accumulation of full-length PS1 in PEN-2 siRNA transfected cells is due to its stabilization, we followed the decay of full-length PS1 in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, because pulse-chase analysis is ineffective when applied to studying presenilin processing or half-life (see Ref. 22Thinakaran G. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 183-192Google Scholar for detailed discussion). In agreement with previous reports (23Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Google Scholar, 24Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Google Scholar), in control cells the levels of full-length PS1 are quite low and decline rapidly (within 2 h of cycloheximide treatment), while PS1 fragments (CTF) were more abundant and long-lived (Fig. 3 B), supporting the notion that full-length PS1 readily enters the cleavage pathway. In cells where the endogenous PEN-2 was eliminated by siRNA, the levels of accumulated full-length PS1 remained fairly unchanged for up to 8 h, indicating that endoproteolysis and/or degradation of full-length PS1 are prevented in the absence of PEN-2. Given the fact that markedly lower levels of PS1 CTF are detected in PEN-2 siRNA transfected cells as compared with controls, and the remaining PS fragments were quite stable during the length of cycloheximide treatment (8 h) (Fig. 3 B), we conclude that accumulation of stabilized PS1 holoprotein and the concomitant diminution in the levels of PS1 fragment is a direct consequence of deficiency in endoproteolytic processing of PS1, further supporting our model that PEN-2 plays an indispensable role in the proteolytic cleavage of PS1. Furthermore, these results also indicate that accumulated full-length PS1 resulting from endoproteolysis defect stays as a stable pool, which is resistant to the degradation machinery, providing further evidence for the notion that full-length PS1 is stabilized by limiting cellular factors before endoproteolytic cleavage (23Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Google Scholar, 24Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that endogenous APH-1a associates with full-length PS1, suggesting a potential role of APH-1 in the maturation of PS1 complex (34Gu Y. Chen F. Sanjo N. Kawarai T. Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Li W. Ruan X. Luthra A. Mount H.T. Tandon A. Fraser P.E. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (December 5, 10.1074/jbc.M209499200)Google Scholar). Since APH-1 RNA interference does not result in the accumulation of full-length PS1 (Fig. 3 A), it is unlikely that APH-1 is directly involved in the cleavage step. Thus, we explored the possibility that APH-1 might serve a role in the stabilization of full-length PS1. As described above, rapid conversion of endogenous full-length PS1 to fragments makes it inaccessible to examine the stability of endogenous full-length PS1. Therefore, we eliminated APH-1a expression in N2a cells in which full-length PS1 accumulated due to PEN-2 siRNA. Interestingly, accumulation of full-length PS1 resulting from down-regulation of PEN-2 was alleviated by additional siRNA down-regulation of APH-1a (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that APH-1 is a cofactor essential for stabilizing nascent full-length PS1, and in the absence of APH-1, PS1 holoprotein is diverted to a rapid protein degradation pathway (24Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Google Scholar) rather than the endoprocessing pathway, which generates PS1 NTF and CTF. Nevertheless, these results do not formally rule out the possibility that APH-1 may also be involved in stabilizing PS1 fragments. To confirm the results obtained from RNA interference experiments, we overexpressed PEN-2 and/or APH-1a in CHO cells with or without coexpression of human PS1. As expected, endogenous PS1 NTF level was increased after overexpression of PEN-2 or coexpression with APH-1a (Fig. 4, lanes 1,2, and 4). Notably, overexpression of APH-1a alone did not increase the fragment level (Fig. 4, lane 3). This could suggest that APH-1a is not a limiting factor mediating generation of PS1 fragments and that endogenous APH-1a alone is sufficient to stabilize PS1. The role of PEN-2 in endoproteolysis of exogenously expressed human PS1 was also revealed. Overexpression of PS1 resulted in robust accumulation of full-length PS1 without noticeable increase in the level of PS1 NTF (Fig. 4, lane 5 versus lane 1), likely due to the paucity of limiting cellular factors necessary for PS1 endoproteolysis (23Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Google Scholar). However, when PEN-2 was overexpressed, a fraction of full-length PS1 was converted to fragments (Fig. 4, lane 6). In contrast, consistent with the endogenous PS1 results, overexpressing APH-1a had little effect on the levels of both full-length PS1 and its fragments (Fig. 4, lane 7). When PEN-2 and APH-1a were coexpressed, full-length PS1 was efficiently cleaved into fragments (Fig. 4, lane 8). The further increase in PS1 NTF by APH-1 might be explained by the potential function of APH-1 in stabilizing PS1 fragments. Based upon data presented in this study and those of other investigators, we propose that PEN-2 preferentially associates with full-length PS1 and plays a crucial role in PS1 endoproteolytic cleavage. We further demonstrate that APH-1 is crucial for stabilizing PS1 and coordinates with the function of PEN-2 in endoproteolysis and the formation of PS1 fragments (which are widely believed to be the central elements of the γ-secretase complex). In summary, our data reveal a novel function of PEN-2 and APH-1 in mediating proteolytic cleavage of full-length PS1 and provide a cellular mechanism underlying the regulation by PEN-2 and APH-1 of γ-secretase activity, which governs Notch signaling pathways and the production of the amyloidogenic Aβ peptides.

Netzer (The Rockefeller University) for critical reading of the manuscript."

The phase diagram and observed dielectric behaviors are typical of quantum paraelectricity, yet this zero-kelvin transition point namely, the quantum critical point, accompanies large quantum fluctuation of the molecular charge, as demonstrated by the molecular vibrational mode spectra. The result indicates that the π-electron transfer between donor and acceptor molecules is coupled with the zero-point lattice dynamics around the quantum critical point."

Our analysis suggests that the ocean stored 14.8 petagrams of anthropogenic carbon from mid-1980 to mid-1989 and 17.9 petagrams of carbon from mid-1990 to mid-1999, indicating an oceanwide net uptake of 1.6 and 2.0 +/- 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year, respectively. Our results provide an upper limit on the solubility-driven anthropogenic CO2 flux into the ocean, and they suggest that most ocean general circulation models are overestimating oceanic anthropogenic CO2 uptake over the past two decades."
https://openalex.org/W2057719162,"P-selectin expressed on activated platelets and vascular endothelium mediates adhesive interactions to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and colon carcinomas critical to the processes of inflammation and blood-borne metastasis, respectively. How the overall adhesiveness (<i>i.e.</i> the avidity) of receptor/ligand interactions is controlled by the affinity of the individual receptors to single ligands is not well understood. Using single molecule force spectroscopy, we probed <i>in situ</i>both the tensile strength and off-rate of single P-selectin molecules binding to single ligands on intact human PMNs and metastatic colon carcinomas and compared them to the overall avidity of these cells for P-selectin substrates. The use of intact cells rather than purified proteins ensures the proper orientation and preserves post-translational modifications of the P-selectin ligands. The P-selectin/PSGL-1 interaction on PMNs was able to withstand forces up to 175 pN and had an unstressed off-rate of 0.20 s<sup>−1</sup>. The tensile strength of P-selectin binding to a novel <i>O-</i>linked, sialylated protease-sensitive ligand on LS174T colon carcinomas approached 125 pN, whereas the unstressed off-rate was 2.78 s<sup>−1</sup>. Monte Carlo simulations of receptor/ligand bond rupture under constant loading rate for both P-selectin/PSGL-1 and P-selectin/LS174T ligand binding give distributions and mean rupture forces that are in accord with experimental data. The pronounced differences in the affinity for P-selectin/ligand binding provide a mechanistic basis for the differential abilities of PMNs and carcinomas to roll on P-selectin substrates under blood flow conditions and underline the requirement for single molecule affinity measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2169991415,"The small G protein RhoA is a convergence point for multiple signals that regulate smooth muscle cell functions. NO plays a major role in the structure and function of the normal adult vessel wall, mainly through modulation of gene transcription. This study was thus performed to analyze in vitro and in vivo the effect of NO signaling on RhoA expression in arterial smooth muscle cells. In rat or human artery smooth muscle cells, sodium nitroprusside or 8-(2-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP induced a rise in RhoA mRNA and protein expression, which was inhibited by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor (R p)-8-bromo-β-phenyl-1,N 2-ethenoguanosine 3′:5′-phosphorothioate. The NO/PKG stimulation of RhoA expression involved both an increase in RhoA protein stability and stimulation ofrhoA gene transcription. Cloning and functional analysis of the human rhoA promoter revealed that the effect of NO/PKG involved phosphorylation of ATF-1 and subsequent binding to the cAMP-response element. Chronic inhibition of NO synthesis inN ω-nitro-l-arginine-treated rats induced a strong decrease in RhoA mRNA and protein expression in aorta and pulmonary artery associated with inhibition of RhoA-mediated Ca2+ sensitization. These effects were prevented by oral administration of the cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil.

Small G proteins of the Rho family function as tightly regulated molecular switches that govern a wide range of cell functions (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Google Scholar). A large body of evidence has now been obtained regarding the important functions of Rho proteins in the vasculature, and RhoA has been shown to play a major role in vascular processes such as smooth muscle cell contraction, proliferation, and differentiation; endothelial permeability; platelet activation; and leukocyte migration (2Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Google Scholar, 3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V.

The activity of Rho is under the direct control of a large set of other regulatory proteins (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Google Scholar). In the inactive GDP-bound form, RhoA is locked in the cytosol by guanine dissociation inhibitors. The guanine nucleotide exchange factors catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate RhoA (5Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Google Scholar). Activation is then turned off by GTPase-activating proteins that hydrolyze GTP to GDP. Therefore, both the relative expression of these proteins (in particular, that of RhoA) and the fraction of active GTP-bound RhoA are key determinants of RhoA protein activity. Data are now accumulating regarding the regulation of the amount of active GTP-bound RhoA. In vascular smooth muscle cells, several agonists of G protein-coupled receptors, including thrombin, thromboxane A2, endothelin, carbachol, angiotensin, α-adrenergic agonists, sphingolipids, and extracellular nucleotides, stimulate RhoA activity through the activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and increases in the fraction of GTP-bound RhoA. This RhoA activation is accompanied by the membrane translocation of GTP-bound RhoA (5Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Google Scholar, 6Fujihara H. Walker L.A.

On the other hand, the NO, cGMP, and cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) 1The abbreviations used are: PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; SRE, serum response element; (R p)-8-Br-PET-cGMP-S, (R p)-8-bromo-β-phenyl-1,N 2-ethenoguanosine 3′:5′-phosphorothioate; 8-pCPT-cGMP, 8-(2-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphate; (R p)-8-CPT-cAMP-S, (R p)-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′:5′-phosphorothioate; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; CRE, cAMP-response element; dCRE, distal cAMP-response element; pCRE, proximal cAMP-response element; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; l-NNA, N ω-nitro-l-arginine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) 1The abbreviations used are: PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; SRE, serum response element; (R p)-8-Br-PET-cGMP-S, (R p)-8-bromo-β-phenyl-1,N 2-ethenoguanosine 3′:5′-phosphorothioate; 8-pCPT-cGMP, 8-(2-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphate; (R p)-8-CPT-cAMP-S, (R p)-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′:5′-phosphorothioate; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; CRE, cAMP-response element; dCRE, distal cAMP-response element; pCRE, proximal cAMP-response element; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; l-NNA, N ω-nitro-l-arginine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) signaling pathway exerts inhibitory action on RhoA functions in cells stimulated by these G protein-coupled receptor agonists. We have previously demonstrated that PKG phosphorylates RhoA at Ser188 in vitroand that the effects of PKG activation on actin cytoskeleton are lost in cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable RhoAA188mutant, suggesting that inhibitory effects of PKG on RhoA-mediated contraction and actin organization are due to phosphorylation of RhoA at Ser188 (9Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21722-21729Google Scholar). This effect involves inhibition of membrane translocation of GTP-bound RhoA. Several additional reports have now confirmed the inhibitory effect of the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway on the RhoA-dependent component of agonist-induced contraction (10Gohla A. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 221-227Google Scholar, 11Sawada N. Itoh H. Yamashita J. Doi K. Inoue M. Masatsugu K. Fukunaga Y. Sakaguchi S. Sone M. Yamahara K. Yurugi T. Nakao K. Biochem.

Hypertension. 2002; 39: 438-442Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that PKG inhibits RhoA-mediated serum response element (SRE)-dependent transcription (14Gudi T. Chen J.C. Casteel D.E. Seasholtz T.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37382-37393Google Scholar). PKG inhibits SRE-dependent transcription induced by serum, constitutively active Gα12 or Gα13, constitutively active Rho exchange factor p115RhoGEF, or constitutively active RhoAL63. This inhibition is associated with a decrease in the amount of active GTP-bound RhoA in cells stimulated with serum or constitutively active Gα12 or Gα13, but not in p115RhoGEF- or RhoAL63-expressing cells, suggesting that PKG can act both upstream and downstream of RhoA. The effect on steps downstream of RhoA has been confirmed by showing that SRE-dependent transcription mediated by a constitutively active RhoA effector (ROK, PKN, or PRK-2) is inhibited by PKG activation (14Gudi T. Chen J.C. Casteel D.E. Seasholtz T.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37382-37393Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway on membrane-bound active GTP-bound RhoA in stimulated cells are beginning to be well documented. Modulation of RhoA expression has been less extensively described; however, a few recent studies reported that the RhoA mRNA level or expression of the RhoA protein is increased in arteries from hypertensive (15Seasholtz T.M. Zhang T. Morissette M.R. Howes A.L. Yang A.H. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 488-495Google Scholar), aged (16Miao L. Calvert J.W. Tang J. Parent A.D. Zhang J.H. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 1757-1770Google Scholar), and diabetic (17Miao L. Calvert J.W. Tang J. Zhang J.H. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 1175-1185Google Scholar) rats and in atherosclerotic lesions (18Shimokawa H. Jpn. Circ. J. 2000; 64: 1-12Google Scholar). The functional consequences of these changes in RhoA expression have been suggested by other observations showing that RhoA-dependent pathways are involved in excessive contraction, migration, and proliferation associated with arterial diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis (4van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. van Hinsbergh V.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 300-311Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, the mechanisms of regulation of RhoA expression still have not been investigated. In the normal adult vessel wall, vascular smooth muscle cells are continuously subjected to the action of the basal release of NO from endothelial cells, regulating arterial tone, but also smooth muscle cell gene expression (19Lincoln T.M. Dey N. Sellak H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1421-1430Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the effect of the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway on RhoA expression in arterial smooth muscle cells. We show that long-term stimulation of PKG positively controlled RhoA expression both in vitro and in vivo through an increase in RhoA protein stability and stimulation of rhoA gene transcription. Our data suggest that the tonic release of NO is absolutely necessary to maintain RhoA expression in vascular smooth muscle. This mechanism might thus provide an important regulation level of RhoA functions in vascular smooth muscle cells. Mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody (26C4) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The plasmid encoding PKG Iα and rabbit anti-PKG I antiserum were provided by Dr. Suzanne Lohmann (Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Würzburg, Germany). (R p)-8-Br-PET-cGMP-S and 8-pCPT-cGMP were from Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). Sildenafil was purchased from Pfizer (Sandwich, UK), and Y-27632 was a gift from the Institut International de Recherche Servier. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). Rat aortic and human internal mammary artery smooth muscle cells were isolated by enzymatic dissociation as previously described (20Guibert C. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Marthan R. Savineau J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L450-L458Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Secondary cultures were obtained by serial passages after the cells were harvested with 0.5 g/liter trypsin and 0.2 g/liter EDTA and reseeded in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Only smooth muscle cells at passage 2 were used in this study. Stimulation of the NO/PKG pathway with sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 10 μm) or 8-pCPT-cGMP (50 μm) was performed in the absence of serum in the culture medium. Endothelium-denuded aortas or cells were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete (one tablet/50 ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by low speed centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured and adjusted; Laemmli sample buffer was added; and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto each lane of SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels, which were then electrophoresed and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The amounts of proteins were checked by staining with Ponceau red. Before immunoblotting, the membrane was blocked with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (16 ng/ml). Signals from immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL and quantified using QuantityOne. Equal loading was checked by reprobing the membrane with monoclonal anti-β- actin antibody. For PKG I expression analysis, lysates were prepared from Swiss 3T3 cells transfected with PKG Iα and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-PKG I antiserum (diluted 1:1000) to control PKG expression. The immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL and quantified using QuantityOne. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France), and reverse transcription was performed according to standard techniques. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were carried out with sequence-specific primer pairs on the iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad) using intercalation of SYBR Green as a fluorescent probe. A SYBR Green kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for real-time monitoring of amplification. Results were evaluated using iCycler iQ real-time detection system software (Bio-Rad). The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used to normalize the expression of RhoA mRNA. The primers used were as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CCATGCCATCACTGCCACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTCATCATACTTGGCAGGTTTC-3′ (reverse); and RhoA, 5′-GCAGGTAGAGTTGGCTTTATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTGTGTGCTCATCATT CCGA-3′ (reverse). Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto nylon membranes (HybondTM-N+, Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). Membrane filters were hybridized with [32P]dATP-random-primed cDNA probes prepared from a partial rhoA cDNA fragment amplified by PCR (sense primer, 5′-GCAGGTAGAGTTGGCTTTATGG-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-CTTGTGTGCTCATCATTCCGA-3′). Hybridized filters were washed under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC, 70 °C) and analyzed by autoradiography. Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by staining of the ribosomal RNA with ethidium bromide. Sequences of 913 and 118 bp upstream of the ATG codon of the human rhoA gene were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) by PCR using the 5′-GAAGATCTTCCAAATTAACTGGTCTTCCTGTCA-3′ sense primer (−913), the 5′-GAAGATCTTCATGGTTACCAAAGCATGTGTCAT-3′ sense primer (−118), the 5′-GAAGATCTTCTGCTGAAACACAAAACACAGAT-3′ antisense primer (−1), and the BAC clone RPCI-11–3B7 (CHORI-BACPAC Resources/Oakland, CA) as the matrix. These sequences were fused to the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) using a BglII restriction site. The entire sequence was verified by sequencing the insert with pGL1 and pGL2 primers (Promega). In vitro site-directed mutagenesis of the distal CRE (dCRE), the proximal CRE (pCRE), and the proximal SRE was carried out according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit instruction manual (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following PAGE-purified primers: p(dCRE) up, 5′-CGGATCATGAAATCACGATCAC-3′; p(dCRE) down, 5′-GTGATCGTGATTTCATGATCCG-3′; p(pCRE) up, 5′-GCCCCATGACTACCAAAGC-3′; p(pCRE) down, 5′-GCTTTGGTAGTCATGGGGC-3′; p(SRE) up, 5′-GCATGTGTTGTCCTATAAGCTACC; and p(SRE) down, 5′-GGTAGCTTATAGGACAACACATGC-3′. HeLa or Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were plated 24 h before transfection in 24-well plates to 60–70% confluency the day of transfection. The PKG Iα and RhoA plasmids and the different constructions of the rhoApromoter were transfected with jetPEI (PolyPlus Transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, 8-pCPT-cGMP (50 μm) or SNP (10 μm) was added to the medium for 6–24 h. Cells were then harvested and treated as described above for Western blot, Northern blot, or real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. For reporter assays, the pIRES-EGFP vector was always cotransfected to estimate the level of transfection (fluorescence measure from lysates with Victor2) and to normalize the luciferase activity measured with the luciferase reporter reagent (Promega) in a LB96V luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Wildbad, Germany). Full-length wild-type RhoA and RhoAA188 were cloned into the pSG5 vector (Stratagene), and full-length PKG Iα was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). RhoA or PKG Iα plasmids were transiently transfected into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with jetPEI according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 8-pCPT-cGMP (50 μm). Lysates from PKG I-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts or aortic smooth muscle cells treated with 8-pCPT-cGMP (50 μm) for 2 h were prepared as described (21Rolli M. Kotlyarov A. Sakamoto K.M. Gaestel M. Neininger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19559-19564Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose as described above. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-phospho-CREB/ATF-1 antibody and, after stripping, with rabbit anti-CREB antibodies (Cell Signaling). Immunoreactive proteins were detected as described above using a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling). DNA-protein binding assays were carried out with nuclear extract from 2-h 8-pCPT-cGMP (50 μm)-treated aortic smooth muscle cells prepared as described previously (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Synthetic complementary oligonucleotides were 3′-biotinylated using the biotin 3′-end DNA labeling kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and annealed for 2 h at room temperature. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are 5′-GCCCCATGGTTACCAAAGC-3′ for the wild-type pCRE, 5′-GCCCCATGACTACCAAAGC-3′ for the mutant pCRE, and 5′-CGGATCATGAGGTCACG ATCAC-3′ for the dCRE. Binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol in 1× binding buffer (LightShiftTM chemiluminescent EMSA kit, Pierce) using 20 fmol of biotin-end-labeled target DNA and 4 μg of nuclear extract. Unlabeled target DNA (4 pmol) or 2 μl of anti-CREB or anti-ATF-1 antibody (TransCRUZ, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added per 20 μl of binding reaction where indicated. Assays were loaded onto native 4% polyacrylamide gels pre-electrophoresed for 60 min in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA and electrophoresed at 100 V before being transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (HybondTM-N+) in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at 100 V for 30 min. Transferred DNAs were cross-linked to the membrane at 120 mJ/cm2 and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (LightShiftTM chemiluminescent EMSA kit) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four groups of male Wistar rats (250 g) were used. The control group received untreated drinking water, and the sildenafil-treated control group received sildenafil orally (25 mg/kg/day) for 15 days. The third group was given 0.5 g/literN ω-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA) in their drinking water for 2 weeks (l-NNA-treated rats), and the fourth group received bothl-NNA (0.5 g/liter) and sildenafil (25 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. At completion of this time, the main pulmonary artery and aorta were removed and dissected under binocular control, and the adventitial and medial layers were removed. Tissues were then prepared as indicated for tension measurements, RNA extraction, or Western blot analysis. NO synthesis inhibition was assessed by measurement of plasma NO x− concentration. Plasma NO x− concentration was determined by spectrophotometric analysis as described previously (23Nelin L.D. Thomas C.J. Dawson C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H8-H14Google Scholar). Plasma samples were diluted 1:10 with phosphate buffer. 50 μl of NADPH stock solution (0.8 μg of NADPH/ml of phosphate buffer) and 10 μl of a nitrate reductase stock solution (5 units of nitrate reductase/ml of phosphate buffer) were added to 500 μl of diluted plasma. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, Griess reagent was added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance of plasma samples was measured at 546 nm. A standard curve was prepared by addition of NaNO3 to phosphate buffer. The aorta and pulmonary artery were collected in physiological saline solution (130 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with HCl), cleaned of fat and adherent connective tissue, and cut into rings. Smooth muscle rings were then suspended under isometric conditions and connected to a force transducer (Pioden Controls Ltd., Canterbury, UK) in organ baths filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution (118.4 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose), maintained at 37 °C, and equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The preparations were initially placed under a resting tension of 1500 mg, left to equilibrate for 1 h, and washed at 20-min intervals. Tension responses were induced by stimulation with KCl (60 mm) and the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 (1 μm). Rings were blotted dry and weighed (in milligrams) at the end of the experiments, and amplitude of the contraction was expressed as milligrams/mg of tissue. Amplitude of the relaxation was expressed as percentage of the maximal amplitude of the contraction induced by phenylephrine recorded before carbachol or SNP application. Small muscle strips (∼200 μm wide and 4 mm long) were isolated from the media of the pulmonary artery and tied at each end with a single silk thread to the tips of two needles, one of which was connected to a force transducer (AE 801, SensoNor, Horten, Norway). After measuring contraction evoked by high K+ solution, the strips were incubated in normal relaxing solution (85 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris maleate, brought to pH 7.1 at 25 °C with KOH) for few minutes, followed by treatment with β-escin (50–70 μm) in relaxing solution for 35 min at 25 °C as previously described (24Horiuti K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 398: 131-148Google Scholar). The skinned muscle strip was then washed several times with fresh relaxing solution containing 10 mmEGTA. Calmodulin (1.5 μm) was added to the bathing solutions throughout the experiments. Tension developed by permeabilized muscle strips was measured in activating solutions containing 10 mm EGTA and a specified amount of CaCl2 to give a desired concentration of free Ca2+ (24Horiuti K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 398: 131-148Google Scholar). All results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of sample size n. Significance was tested by Student'st test. Probabilities <5% (p < 0.05) were considered significant. The effect of NO/cGMP/PKG signaling on the total levels of RhoA was examined by Western blot analysis. Stimulation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with SNP (10 μm) for 0.1–24 h induced a time-dependent increase in RhoA expression (Fig.1 A). The rise in the amount of RhoA protein could be observed after 3 h of incubation with SNP, and there was a 3–3.5-fold increase in RhoA by 24 h. Similar results were obtained in human artery smooth muscle cells (Fig.1 A). The role of PKG activation in the increase in RhoA expression has been assessed using the cGMP analog 8-pCPT-cGMP and the PKG inhibitor (R p)-8-Br-PET-cGMP-S (Fig.1 B). Activation of PKG by 8-pCPT-cGMP (50 μm, 24 h) produced an increase in RhoA expression similar to that obtained in the presence of SNP (10 μm, 24 h). Under both conditions, the effect on RhoA expression was abolished in the presence of (R p)-8-Br-PET-cGMP-S (100 nm), whereas (R p)-8-CPT-cAMP-S had no effect (data not shown), suggesting that cross-activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was not involved. The involvement of PKG in cGMP-dependent regulation of RhoA expression was further examined in Swiss 3T3 cells transfected or not with an expression vector for PKG Iα (Fig.2). PKG Iα overexpression induced a 2-fold rise in the basal level of RhoA expression. In addition, stimulation with the cGMP analog 8-pCPT-cGMP (50 μm) strongly increased RhoA expression in PKG Iα-expressing cells and had no effect in untransfected cells (Fig. 2). The effect of 8-pCPT-cGMP was inhibited in the presence of (R p)-8-Br-PET-cGMP-S (100 nm) (data not shown). These data thus demonstrate the role of PKG in SNP/cGMP-mediated control of RhoA expression. Regulation of protein stability has emerged as an important mechanism for controlling biological functions (25Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Google Scholar). To address the stability of RhoA in the context of PKG stimulation, we examined its fate in vascular smooth muscle cells in the presence and absence of SNP using cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) to abrogate new RhoA synthesis. At the times indicated, extracts of total protein were prepared and analyzed by RhoA immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.3 A, when protein neosynthesis was blocked by cycloheximide, RhoA expression gradually decreased from 0 to 10 h. In contrast, in the presence of SNP and cycloheximide, RhoA protein expression was maintained up to 6 h and then decreased and reached a level similar to that observed in the absence of SNP at 10 h. This observation suggests that PKG-mediated up-regulation of RhoA involved change in the rate of RhoA protein degradation. The rate of small G protein degradation has been shown to be regulated by the phosphorylation state of the protein (26Ulsh L.S. Shih T.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1647-1652Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that PKG-mediated phosphorylation of RhoA at Ser188 (9Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21722-21729Google Scholar) could slow down the degradation of RhoA. To assess this hypothesis, PKG-expressing Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with RhoA or the phosphorylation-resistant RhoA mutant (RhoAA188). RhoA expression was then assessed in cycloheximide-treated cells in the presence and absence of 8-pCPT-cGMP as described above (Fig. 3 B). Stimulation with 8-pCPT-cGMP decreased RhoA degradation in RhoA-expressing cells, but not in RhoAA188-expressing cells, suggesting that the PKG-mediated increase in RhoA stability depended on the phosphorylation of RhoA at Ser188. To address the possibility of increases in RhoA mRNA levels in response to PKG stimulation, the abundance of RhoA mRNA was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in arterial smooth muscle cells incubated with or without SNP or 8-pCPT-cGMP for the indicated times. Both agents stimulated RhoA mRNA expression, with a maximal 2.5-fold increase after 3 h of incubation (Fib. 4A). This effect was inhibited in the presence of the PKG inhibitor (R p)-8-Br-PET-cGMP-S. This result suggests that the observed modulation of RhoA protein expression induced by PKG stimulation also involved an increase in the amount of RhoA mRNA. To determine whether the observed changes in RhoA mRNA levels were due to stimulation of gene transcription or involved post-transcriptional RhoA mRNA stabilization, the RhoA mRNA half-life was determined using the RNA polymerase inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole in the absence and presence of SNP. The half-life of RhoA mRNA was 3.4 ± 0.5 h under control conditions and 3.6 ± 0.4 h (n = 3;p > 0.05) in the presence of 10 μm SNP, indicating that there was no significant difference in post-transcriptional regulation of RhoA mRNA after treatment of aortic smooth muscle cells with SNP (Fig.4 B). Therefore, PKG-induced stimulation of RhoA mRNA expression results from PKG-mediated stimulation of rhoA gene transcription. PKG is known to directly control gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors such as members of the CREB/ATF family and/or indirectly by controlling expression of immediate-early genes such as c-fos, which are themselves transcription factors (19Lincoln T.M. Dey N. Sellak H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1421-1430Google Scholar, 27"

Even when stimulated by an isotropic bath of chemoattractant, neutrophils exhibit persistent polarization and continued lamellipod formation at the front, suggesting that the cells establish an internal polarity. In this report, we show that perturbing lipid organization by depleting plasma membrane cholesterol levels reversibly inhibits cell polarization and migration. Among other receptor-mediated responses, β2 integrin up-regulation was unaffected, and initial calcium mobilization was only partially reduced by cholesterol depletion, indicating that this treatment did not abrogate initial receptor-mediated signal transduction. Interestingly, cholesterol depletion did not prevent initial activation of the GTPase Rac or an initial burst of actin polymerization, but rather it inhibited prolonged activation of Rac and sustained actin polymerization. Collectively, these findings support a model in which the plasma membrane is organized into domains that aid in amplifying the chemoattractant gradient and maintaining cell polarization.

Maxfield F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9471-9473Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that certain lipids preferentially associate and form lateral heterogeneities in the membrane (3Brown D. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar, 4Brown D. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 5Simons K. Ikonen E.

One type of membrane domain has been described as rafts, glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (GEMs), or detergent-resistant membrane domains (DRMs) because they are enriched in glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol, which make them resistant to solubilization by cold non-ionic detergents (7Brown D. Rose J. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). These lipid domains have been postulated to serve as centers for some signal transduction processes by virtue of their copurification with signaling molecules following cell lysis with cold nonionic detergents and floatation on sucrose density gradients (3Brown D. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). Because the direct visualization of lipid domains has been elusive, it is thought that they typically exist as dynamic submicron-sized regions within the plasma membrane (6Kurzchalia T. Parton R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 8Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 9Friedrichson T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). However, most of the surface area of cells such as fibroblasts and neutrophils is resistant to extraction by cold Triton X-100 (11Seveau S. Eddy R. Maxfield F. Pierini L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3550-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Mayor S. Maxfield F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 929-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 13Hao M. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, several studies now indicate that multiple types of membrane microdomains co-exist within the plasma membranes of cells (14Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 15Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J. Mira E. Lacalle R. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S. Martinez-A C. Proc.

Martinez-A C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is the most abundant lipid component of the plasma membrane, and it plays an important role in lipid organization. Extraction of cholesterol from the plasma membrane using the synthetic cholesterol chelator methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD)1 causes reorganization of lipids with preferences for both ordered and disordered domains (13Hao M. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13072-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). While the effects of cholesterol depletion on ordered, raft-like domains have been emphasized, additional effects on the overall organization of lipids also occur (13Hao M. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13072-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion has been used to examine the role of lipid domains in a multitude of cellular processes, including cell migration (15Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J. Mira E. Lacalle R. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S. Martinez-A C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 17Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C.

Disruption of lipid domain organization by MβCD treatment resulted in inhibition of motility of breast cancer-derived cells (17Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R. Keller P. Labrador J.

Science. 2000; 288: 1647-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and neutrophils (19Peyron P. Bordier C. N′Diaye E. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5186-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because cell motility and phagocytosis are mechanistically related, with both processes involving directional extension of actin-rich membranes, it seems likely that their inhibition following domain disruption may have the same underlying molecular basis. Migration of neutrophils and other immune cells is contingent upon their ability to adopt a polarized morphology in response to chemotactic stimulation. In the presence of chemoattractants, neutrophils rapidly transform from roughly spherical resting cells to migratory ones with distinctive leading and trailing edges. Actin polymerization occurs almost exclusively at the leading edge, resulting in a dramatic accumulation of F-actin at just one end of the cells (21Fechheimer M. Zigmond S. Cell Motil. 1983; 3: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Notably, this remarkable asymmetry occurs even when the external chemotactic signal is uniform, suggesting that at least one signaling step leads to an internal polarization of the cell. Given that chemoattractant receptors are typically distributed uniformly across the cell surface even after polarization (22Servant G. Weiner O. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J. Bourne H. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), this internal signal occurs somewhere between receptor occupancy and actin polymerization. The exact point at which polarization is induced is not known. However, the possibilities have been narrowed by an elegant study in neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells using the recruitment of a GFP-tagged plekstrin homology domain to the plasma membrane as a readout for polarization (22Servant G. Weiner O. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J. Bourne H. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). This study showed that amplification of polarization signals depends on one or more of the Rho GTPases, which anchor to the plasma membrane via lipid tails, and is downstream of the lipid products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (22Servant G. Weiner O. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J. Bourne H. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In other words, amplification of polarization occurs at or near the plasma membrane. This, together with our finding that the plasma membrane of neutrophils segregates into distinct lipid domains that comprise either pole of migrating neutrophils (11Seveau S. Eddy R. Maxfield F. Pierini L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3550-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), led us to hypothesize that signal amplification is dependent on plasma membrane domains. To test this, we used MβCD to disrupt membrane domain organization in human neutrophils and studied its effects on polarization and signaling. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were isolated from whole blood donated by healthy volunteers by centrifugation through Polymorphprep (Invitrogen). After lysis of contaminating erythrocytes by a 30-s hypotonic shock, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and then resuspended in incubation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). For all experiments, PMNs were plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslip dishes for 5 min at 37 °C, and then stimulated with 10 nm formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) for the indicated times. To visualize membrane domains, PMNs were plated and stimulated as above, and then extracted with ice-cold detergent. Specifically, cells were bathed in ice-cold cytoskeleton stabilizing buffer (CSB; 138 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.32m sucrose, 10 mm MES, pH 6) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (BD PharMingen) for 30 min, and then washed with ice-cold CSB. Samples were fixed with 3.3% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min on ice, and then incubated sequentially with a monoclonal anti-CD44 (clone HERMES-3, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and AlexaFluor 488-goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Anti-CD44-labeled cells were imaged immediately after completion of the labeling protocol. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Jena, Germany) or a Leica DMIRB widefield microscope, and then analyzed with MetaMorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downington, PA). Plasma membrane cholesterol was depleted by incubating PMNs (1.2 × 107/ml) in incubation buffer containing 10 mmMβCD (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C. At the end of this 15-min treatment, cells were diluted to 2.4 × 106/ml with incubation buffer (depleted cells). The extent of cholesterol depletion was determined by an enzymatic method using a commercially available kit (Free cholesterol C; Wako Biochemicals, Osaka). The cholesterol content of MβCD-treated cells was measured to be 20.9 ± 3.6% (mean ± s.d., n = 5) less than that of control cells. To replete membrane cholesterol, cholesterol-depleted cells were incubated with 5 mm Chol-MβCD for 2.5 min at 37 °C (repleted cells). After stimulation with fMLF, cells were fixed with 3.3% paraformaldehyde in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml saponin for 5 min at room temperature. When it was important to preserve the labile pools of F-actin, excess fluorescently conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was included during fixation and throughout the remaining labeling steps. Rac was visualized with a mouse monoclonal antibody against Rac1 and Rac2 (clone 23A8, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), followed by an AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells labeled for Rac were imaged by either confocal or wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Wide-field fluorescence images of all samples within one experiment were acquired under identical conditions and quantified using Metamorph image analysis software. Following background correction, the average fluorescence intensity per cell was measured for more than 100 cells per condition, and these measurements were normalized to the level of the unstimulated control cells. Cells were fixed in 2% buffered glutaraldehyde, washed with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.3, then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in sodium cacodylate buffer and washed. Samples were then dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, freeze-dried, and sputter-coated with gold-palladium. Samples were examined at 20 kV using a JEOL 100 CX-II electron microscope fitted with an ASID-scanning unit, and photographs were recorded on Polaroid Type 55 P/N film. PMNs in suspension were stimulated with fMLF (10 nm) for 5 min at 37 °C, then simultaneously fixed, permeabilized, and labeled for F-actin by the addition of an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline containing 6.6% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.5 mg/ml saponin, and 2 units/ml AlexaFluor 488 phalloidin. Cell-associated fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry (Beckman-Coulter XL, Fullerton, CA) for 2,000 cells per condition and from three separate experiments. Aliquots from each sample were removed and imaged by confocal microscopy. To verify the results in adherent cells, PMNs were plated, stimulated, fixed, and labeled with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin as described above. Wide-field images of fluorescent-labeled cells were obtained using a Leica DMIRB equipped with a 63 × 1.32 numerical aperture objective and a Princeton Instruments (Princeton, NJ) cooled CCD camera driven by MetaMorph Imaging System software. Following background correction, the average fluorescence intensity per cell was measured for over 150 cells per condition from three experiments on different days. The average fluorescence intensity per cell for cholesterol-depleted cells was 46 ± 8% (S.D.) of the value for control cells. Motility assays were performed as described (23Pierini L. Lawson M. Eddy R. Hendey B. Maxfield F. Blood. 2000; 95: 2471-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, motility of plated and stimulated PMNs was monitored for 4 min using a Leica DMIRB (Leica Mikroscopie und Systeme GmbH, Germany) set up for differential interference contrast microscopy. Time-lapse images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera driven by MetaMorph Imaging System software. Migrating PMNs were defined as those whose tail and leading lamella moved at least 7 μm from their initial starting position within 240 s. Separate dishes were used for each treatment, and at least three dishes were monitored for each treatment on at least three different days. To monitor changes in intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca2+]i), PMNs were loaded with the ratiometric fluorescent indicator, fura-2 as described (24Pierini L.M. Maxfield F.R. Guan J.-L. Signaling Through Cell Adhesion Molecules, CRC Methods in Signal Transduction Series. CRC Press, Boca Raton1999: 279-301Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in a 5 μm solution of acetoxymethyl ester-derivatized fura-2 (Fura-2/AM, Molecular Probes) for 40 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed and incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature to allow cleavage of the ester. Cells were treated with MβCD or not, and then placed on ice until use. 2-ml suspensions of fura-2-loaded PMNs (1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were maintained at 37 °C in cuvettes with continual stirring throughout each experiment. [Ca2+]i was monitored with a SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer (Aminco, Urbana, IL) operated in dual excitation mode (excitation 340 and 380 nm, emission 510 nm). In the absence of stimulation, there was a negligible upward drift of the signal due to leakage of dye from the cells (not shown). To quantify and compare peak responses, fractional responses (F) for each sample were calculated as the change in the ratio value induced by addition of fMLF (i.e. the difference between the peak ratio value attained and the basal ratio value: I peak −I basal) divided by the maximum range of ratio values (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The maximum range of ratio values was determined for each sample by addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 at the end of each experiment to obtain the maximum possible ratio value (I max), followed by addition of 4 mmEGTA to obtain the minimum ratio value (I min). In summary, fractional responses were calculated using the formula in Equation 1. F=(Ipeak−Ibasal)/(Imax−Imin)Equation 1 To verify the ability of PMNs to upregulate their integrins in response to fMLF, PMNs were incubated at 37 °C with Fab fragments of an anti-β2 integrin antibody (IB4) that was directly conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 in the presence or absence of fMLF, as indicated. At various time points after the start of the incubation period, aliquots of cells were removed and diluted into ice-cold incubation buffer to stop exocytosis. Cell-associated fluorescence was monitored using a Beckman-Coulter XL analytical flow cytometer. To account for any nonspecific binding of the IB4 Fab, fluorescence intensity of PMNs incubated with an irrelevant control AlexaFluor 488-conjugated Fab was set to an arbitrary value, and all other samples were measured relative to this value. Each data point represents measurements from 2,000 cells, and the data as a whole are representative of experiments from three different days. During plating, neutrophils were incubated with 10 μm myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, ML-7 (26Eddy R. Pierini L. Matsumura F. Maxfield F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then stimulated in the continued presence of ML-7 for the indicated times. In response to the chemoattractant, fMLF neutrophils undergo polarized morphological changes with actin-driven protrusion of a lamellipod at just one end of the cell. Because of the dramatic morphological and functional asymmetry exhibited by migrating cells, it has been suggested that the front and back of polarized cells may manifest different lipid environments (11Seveau S.

Indeed, we have shown that cold Triton X-100 preferentially removes a lipid marker of rafts, DiIC16, from the leading lamellae of polarized PMNs but extracts other non-raft lipid probes uniformly (11Seveau S. Eddy R. Maxfield F. Pierini L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3550-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Likewise, several protein constituents of rafts, including the GPI-linked CD16 and the transmembrane CD44, are retained preferentially at the rear of polarized PMNs following extraction with cold Triton X-100 (Fig.1 and Ref. 11Seveau S. Eddy R. Maxfield F. Pierini L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3550-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These findings, coupled with those from other laboratories (15Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J. Mira E. Lacalle R. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S. Martinez-A C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 17Manes S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), provide compelling evidence that the lipid environments at the front and back of polarized PMNs are dissimilar and may represent micron-scale membrane domains. MβCD, a chelator of cholesterol, has been used to selectively deplete plasma membrane cholesterol and thereby alter lipid organization in several cell types (8Varma R. Mayor S.

Another common method of depleting membrane cholesterol is long term treatment of cells with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins), which work by blocking cholesterol biosynthesis. Because the levels of mevalonate and other intermediates of cholesterol synthesis (including isoprenoids) are altered by treatment with statins, and because these intermediates are necessary for cell proliferation and other important cell functions, statins are likely to have pleiotropic effects on cells that may be explained by reasons other than cholesterol reduction (29Blanco-Colio L.

To avoid the non-cholesterol related effects of long-term cholesterol depleting strategies, we used MβCD to acutely deplete cholesterol from PMNs. To determine if cholesterol depletion by MβCD would also disrupt the large-scale lipid organization found in PMNs, we visualized domain organization in control (Fig. 1, a–c) and MβCD-treated (Fig. 1, d–f) cells. Domain organization was revealed by extracting cells with cold Triton X-100 and then labeling the cells by indirect immunofluorescence for the transmembrane protein, CD44, which localizes to raft-like domains in PMNs (11Seveau S. Eddy R. Maxfield F. Pierini L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3550-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (a′–c′) shows the progression of domain organization as control cells polarize in response to fMLF. As we reported previously, rafts are evenly distributed around the periphery of unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 a′), form larger patches after 15–30 s of stimulation (Fig. 1 b′), and finally coalesce into a cap toward the cell rear (Fig. 1 c′) (11Seveau S. Eddy R. Maxfield F. Pierini L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3550-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After the plasma membranes of cells have been cholesterol-depleted with MβCD (Fig. 1, d–f), the raft component CD44 is less well retained following detergent extraction; the average fluorescence intensity per cholesterol-depleted cell was decreased by 40.8% ± 3.2% (mean ± S.D.) compared with control cells. (The intensities of panels d′–f′ have been enhanced relative to panels a′–c′ to allow visualization of the CD44 distribution). In contrast to control cells, fMLF stimulation does not induce capping of CD44 in cholesterol-depleted cells; rather, the CD44 that is retained remains relatively uniformly distributed around the cell periphery (Fig. 1,d′–f′). That is, cholesterol depletion inhibits the redistribution of detergent-resistant raft components into a cap at the cell rear, indicating that MβCD treatment inhibits large scale lipid organization in addition to disrupting microdomains. Acute depletion of cholesterol by treatment with MβCD has dramatic effects on neutrophil polarization and migration (Fig.2). When cellular cholesterol is depleted by just ∼21% (see “Materials and Methods”), PMN migration is inhibited by >90% (Fig. 2 a), consistent with the report by Manes et al. (17Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R. Keller P. Labrador J. Martinez-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) that depletion of membrane cholesterol inhibits migration of MCF-7 cells. However, in contrast to the interpretation reported in Manes et al., we find that cholesterol depletion abolishes lamellipod formation (Fig.2 b, compare center to left panel). Inhibition of migration and polarization can be attributed to effects of cholesterol modulation as opposed to nonspecific effects of MβCD treatment since the ability to polarize and migrate is restored to previously cholesterol-depleted cells upon replenishing membrane cholesterol with cholesterol-chelated MβCD (chol-MβCD, Fig. 2,a and b, repleted). Because it has been reported, based on observation of cells by light microscopy, that cholesterol depletion does not affect membrane extension and ruffling (17Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R. Keller P. Labrador J. Martinez-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20Gatfield J. Pieters J. Science. 2000; 288: 1647-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), we further investigated whether lamellipod extension in PMNs was affected by changes in cholesterol levels. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that cholesterol-depleted cells are unable to form membrane extensions or ruffles in response to fMLF (compare Fig. 3, b toa). The lack of membrane ruffling in cholesterol-depleted cells is accompanied by an inhibition of stimulated actin polymerization. Following cholesterol depletion and stimulation with fMLF, cells were simultaneously fixed, permeabilized, and stained for F-actin with fluorescently conjugated phalloidin. Projections of confocal images show that control cells exhibited dramatic F-actin-rich ruffles within their lamellae (Fig. 3 c), whereas cholesterol-depleted cells had no F-actin-rich projections (Fig.3 d). Using flow cytometry, we quantified the fluorescent phalloidin binding to F-actin in parallel samples of suspended cholesterol-depleted and control cells, which had been stimulated with fMLF, or left unstimulated, for 5 min at 37 °C.

Flint M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 947-959Google Scholar and 2Seipelt J. Guarne A. Bergmann E. James M. Sommergruber W. Fita I. Skern T. Virus Res. 1999; 62: 159-168Google Scholar). Alternatively proteins may be generated by translational effects such as ribosomal frameshifting or read-through of “leaky” stop codons. Such programmed alterations of translation are not virus-specific but widespread (although rare) mechanisms of gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 3Baranov P.V. Gurvich O.L. Fayet O. Prere M.F. Miller W.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Giddings M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 264-267Google Scholar and 4Farabaugh P.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 507-528Google Scholar). In foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)1 and some other picornaviruses the oligopeptide (∼20 amino acid) 2A region of the polyprotein mediates cleavage at its own C terminus to release it from the 2B region. 2A is also active when placed between reporter proteins and, therefore, cleavage requires no viral (proteinase) sequences outside this short peptide (5Ryan M.D. Drew J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 928-933Google Scholar). Similarly, no host proteinases are known that cleave the 2A/2B site.Scission of 2A-containing polyproteins requires the correct protein rather than mRNA sequence (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar). However, synthetic peptides containing 2A and “2A-like” sequences from other viruses do not autoproteolyse (7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar). Furthermore, on translation in vitro the portion of a polyprotein N-terminal to 2A typically accumulates in excess over the C-terminal portion. This imbalance is not because of protein degradation or nonspecific transcription/translation termination (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar, 8Donnelly M.L. Gani D. Flint M. Monaghan S. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 13-21Google Scholar). Modeling of 2A and 2A-like sequences indicates that the majority of each peptide can form an amphipathic helix whereas the amino acids immediately preceding the “cleavage” site (-NPG⇓P-) form a tight turn (7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar). A co-translational model for the cleavage reaction has been proposed (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar, 7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar) in which the conformation of 2A places strain on the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome, re-positioning the peptidyl(2A)-tRNA ester linkage. This steric effect prohibits nucleophilic attack by the incoming (prolyl)-tRNA amide nitrogen that normally creates the new peptide bond. Instead, the N-terminal product is released from the ribosome by hydrolysis of the peptidyl(2A)-tRNA ester bond. A proportion of ribosomes then cease translation, while the remainder continue, effectively “initiated” by the prolyl-tRNA, to produce the downstream product as a discrete (“cleaved”) entity.Although published data support the proposal that 2A acts within the ribosome no direct evidence has been provided for this. Intraribosomal cleavage would not require cytosolic factors such as proteinases, and demonstration of this requires translation of 2A-containing proteins in a situation where cytosolic factors have no access to the nascent chain. Such “screening” occurs during co-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here the nascent chain is shielded from cytosolic factors by first the ribosome, then the translocation apparatus, before being partitioned into the ER lumen. Establishment of co-translational translocation requires the signal recognition particle (SRP; reviewed in Refs. 9Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar and 10Bui N. Strub K. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 135-145Google Scholar). SRP binds cis-acting hydrophobic signal sequences at the N terminus of nascent ER-targeted proteins as they emerge from the ribosome and concomitantly slows translation by the ribosome, a phenomenon termed elongation arrest (11Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 557-561Google Scholar, 12Wolin S.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2617-2622Google Scholar, 13Mason N. Ciufo L.F. Brown J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4164-4174Google Scholar). This ensures that ribosome-nascent chain complexes targeted to the translocon by SRP arrive with a short length of cytosolically exposed nascent chain. Once the ribosome-translocon junction is established the ribosomal nascent chain exit site lies directly over the translocon (14Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Google Scholar, 15Beckmann R. Spahn C.M. Eswar N. Helmers J. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Frank J. Blobel G. Cell. 2001; 107: 361-372Google Scholar, 16Menetret J. Neuhof A. Morgan D.G. Plath K. Radermacher M. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1219-1232Google Scholar). This junction is sufficiently tight to protect the nascent chain from externally added proteases (17Matlack K.E. Walter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6170-6180Google Scholar, 18Connolly T. Collins P. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 299-307Google Scholar) and even excludes small ions (19Crowley K.S. Liao S. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 461-471Google Scholar,20Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Google Scholar). Thus comparing the translation products of 2A-containing proteins with and without SRP-dependent signal sequences will reveal if 2A functions without the influence of cytosolic factors.The translocon has been proposed to have a signal sequence recognition function independent from that of targeting factors such as SRP (21Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Google Scholar,22Mothes W. Jungnickel B. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 355-364Google Scholar). Co-translational translocation of a 2A-containing polypeptide will result in amino acids C-terminal to 2A being presented to the translocon immediately after they have emerged from the ribosome. Therefore if 2A is active in a co-translationally targeted protein we reasoned that we could use this to ask two interdependent questions. First, where does cleavage take place? Second, can the translocon discern the presence or absence of a signal sequence on a nascent chain presented to it directly by the ribosome and in vivo? If cleavage does not take place inside the ribosome the portion of the protein downstream of 2A will arrive in the lumen of the ER. However, if the nascent chain cleaves within the ribosome a gap will occur in the polypeptide. The translocon may then “detect” this discontinuity in the nascent chain as it does the normal termination of translation, closing, and excluding the downstream protein from the ER. In contrast addition of a signal sequence to the N terminus of protein downstream of the 2A site and expression in vivo should result in reopening of the translocon and translocation of this protein into the ER.We chose the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for these studies. We demonstrate that the FMDV 2A sequence is functional in yeast, and that targeting through the SRP-dependent co-translational translocation pathway does not impair the cleavage reaction. In addition the released downstream product remains in the cytosol unless it contains its own signal sequence. Thus nascent chain cleavage takes place before the C-terminal portion of the protein initiates translocation and therefore within the ribosome. These data provide significant support for the proposal that 2A modifies the activity of the ribosome to promote scission of the nascent chain (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar,7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar) and are consistent with the notion that the translocon itself examines nascent chains for the presence of signal sequences.DISCUSSIONThe 2A sequence of FMDV directs production of separate proteins from one polyprotein open reading frame in a variety of higher eukaryotic and plant systems. As such it has great potential as a biotechnological tool, reducing the need for multiple vectors (e.g. Refs. 39Halpin C. Cooke S.E. Barakate A. El Amrani A. Ryan M.D. Plant J. 1999; 17: 453-459Google Scholar, 40Thomas C.L. Maule A.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1851-1855Google Scholar, 41Varnavski A.N. Khromykh A.A. Virology. 1999; 255: 366-375Google Scholar, 42De Felipe P. Izquierdo M. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 1921-1931Google Scholar). Previously the activity of FMDV 2A had not been examined in yeast. We found that it is active in vivo in yeast (Fig. 2). Thus, whatever features of higher eukaryotic cells allow 2A to promote scission of the polypeptide chain at the 2A C terminus are conserved to this “simpler” organism. This opens up the possibility of examining, in a genetically tractable system, how 2A functions and what trans-acting factors are required for or influence the cleavage reaction. A similar approach has been successfully applied to analysis of ribosomal frameshifting (43Harger J. Meskauskas A. Dinman J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 448-454Google Scholar), indicating that such examination of alterations to normal ribosome function in yeast is feasible.The proportion of 2A-containing proteins that were cleaved in yeast was similar to that seen previously in in vitro translation reactions, and the 2A-dependent reaction was unaffected by sequestering the nascent chain from cytosolic factors. As discussed above although SRP-dependent targeting functions similarly in yeast to higher eukaryotes (13Mason N. Ciufo L.F. Brown J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4164-4174Google Scholar, 44Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Google Scholar), translation and translocation are not efficiently coupled at short nascent chain lengths (37Johnsson N. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2686-2698Google Scholar). Both SRP-dependent substrates used in our analysis are of sufficient length to expect tight coupling between targeting and translocation for the great majority of individual protein chains. Thus if cytosolic factors were required for 2A-dependent cleavage, a significant reduction of the proportion of these proteins that were cleaved would have been expected. Instead the efficiency of cleavage was maintained when the protein containing it was co-translationally translocated and we conclude that extraribosomal cytosolic factors such as proteinases are not necessary for the 2A reaction.Determination of the fate of the separated C-terminal (GFP) portions of 2A-containing polyproteins yielded information both on (i) where cleavage took place and (ii) the gating function of the translocon. Even when polyproteins were co-translationally translocated into the ER, GFP remained cytosolic if it lacked a signal sequence. This exclusion was, as far as we could determine from fractionation experiments, quantitative and our view of how this occurs is shown in Fig. 6. For GFP to be excluded from the ER the cleavage reaction must have taken place before the N terminus of GFP was translocated and therefore our data demonstrate that the proposal that the break in the nascent chain is generated within the ribosome is correct (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar, 7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar). We suggest that the N terminus of GFP is treated as a new translocation substrate and is “surveyed” by the translocon for the presence of a signal sequence. Without a signal sequence the translocon remains closed and the ribosome-translocon complex dissociates. When a signal sequence is added to the N terminus of GFP (substrates DNαF-2A-Kar2-GFP and DNαF-2A-CPY-GFP) the translocon recognizes this and reopens. In addition to indicating that cytosolic proteases are not responsible for the cleavage reaction the cytoplasmic location of GFP released from ER-targeted proteins refutes other models of 2A activity such as one 2A sequence acting in trans on another nascent 2A-containing protein to cleave it, or 2A requiring release from the ribosome and folding before it becomes active in cis. Each of these possibilities would result in cleavage within the ER lumen, and thus the GFP portion of the polyproteins would have been found in the ER.The model above and in Fig. 6 is consistent with the recent finding that, upon completion of co-translational translocation in vitro, ribosomes remain attached to the translocon, competent to initiate translation of new mRNA species (45Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33828-33835Google Scholar, 46Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23314-23320Google Scholar). If these ribosomes encode proteins with signal sequences they are translocated directly into the ER independent of targeting by SRP, whereas if they do not contain a signal sequence the translating ribosomes detach and release the protein into the cytosol. This has been argued to represent a physiologically important mechanism by which the cell ensures correct partitioning of cytosolic and ER-targeted proteins. Assuming that the in vitro experiments (45Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33828-33835Google Scholar, 46Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23314-23320Google Scholar) reflect in vivo events, then translocation of Kar2-GFP and CPY-GFP released from DNαF-2A-Kar2-GFP and DNαF-2A-CPY-GFP likely represents direct recognition of signal sequences in vivo by the translocon. Thus 2A may provide a means by which we can, for the first time, examine the signal sequence recognition and gating activities of the translocon in vivo independent of targeting.Analysis of 2A and 2A-like sequences has revealed that the FMDV 2A reaction is far from unique. It is a strategy for creating separate proteins from one polypeptide chain used by a variety of picornaviruses and insect viruses, and active 2A-like sequences are also found in repeated sequences within the genomes of Trypanosoma species (8Donnelly M.L. Gani D. Flint M. Monaghan S. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 13-21Google Scholar, 26Donnelly M.L. Hughes L.E. Luke G. Mendoza H. ten Dam E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1027-1041Google Scholar, 47Hahn H. Palmenberg A.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6870-6875Google Scholar). Neither is 2A the only example of a nascent peptide chain that modifies the activity of the ribosome while within the ribosome exit tunnel (reviewed in Refs. 48Tenson T. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2002; 108: 591-594Google Scholar and 49Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Google Scholar). Other examples are sequences within the bacteriophage T4 gene 60 that promote “hopping” of the ribosome along the mRNA (50Herr A.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2671-2680Google Scholar), the TnaC leader peptide of theEscherichia coli tryptophanase operon that, in the presence of tryptophan, causes ribosomes to stall allowing expression of the downstream open reading frames (51Gong F. Yanofsky C. Science. 2002; 297: 1864-1867Google Scholar) and a peptide within SecM that causes ribosomes to stall unless the protein is engaged with the protein export machinery. Mutations that suppress the stalling activity of SecM have been identified in both RNA and protein components of the ribosome, these mapping to the nascent chain exit tunnel (52Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Google Scholar). Thus interactions between the nascent chain and the ribosome can have significant effects on translation and we expect that our further analysis may reveal similar interactions important for the activity of the 2A peptide. Positive-strand RNA viruses typically encode polyproteins that are cleaved by viral or host-encoded proteinases (proteolytic processing) to produce mature, individual proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Ryan M.D. Monaghan S. Flint M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 947-959Google Scholar and 2Seipelt J. Guarne A. Bergmann E. James M. Sommergruber W. Fita I. Skern T. Virus Res. 1999; 62: 159-168Google Scholar). Alternatively proteins may be generated by translational effects such as ribosomal frameshifting or read-through of “leaky” stop codons. Such programmed alterations of translation are not virus-specific but widespread (although rare) mechanisms of gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 3Baranov P.V. Gurvich O.L. Fayet O. Prere M.F. Miller W.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Giddings M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 264-267Google Scholar and 4Farabaugh P.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 507-528Google Scholar). In foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)1 and some other picornaviruses the oligopeptide (∼20 amino acid) 2A region of the polyprotein mediates cleavage at its own C terminus to release it from the 2B region. 2A is also active when placed between reporter proteins and, therefore, cleavage requires no viral (proteinase) sequences outside this short peptide (5Ryan M.D. Drew J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 928-933Google Scholar). Similarly, no host proteinases are known that cleave the 2A/2B site. Scission of 2A-containing polyproteins requires the correct protein rather than mRNA sequence (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar). However, synthetic peptides containing 2A and “2A-like” sequences from other viruses do not autoproteolyse (7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar). Furthermore, on translation in vitro the portion of a polyprotein N-terminal to 2A typically accumulates in excess over the C-terminal portion. This imbalance is not because of protein degradation or nonspecific transcription/translation termination (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar, 8Donnelly M.L. Gani D. Flint M. Monaghan S. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 13-21Google Scholar). Modeling of 2A and 2A-like sequences indicates that the majority of each peptide can form an amphipathic helix whereas the amino acids immediately preceding the “cleavage” site (-NPG⇓P-) form a tight turn (7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar). A co-translational model for the cleavage reaction has been proposed (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar, 7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar) in which the conformation of 2A places strain on the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome, re-positioning the peptidyl(2A)-tRNA ester linkage. This steric effect prohibits nucleophilic attack by the incoming (prolyl)-tRNA amide nitrogen that normally creates the new peptide bond. Instead, the N-terminal product is released from the ribosome by hydrolysis of the peptidyl(2A)-tRNA ester bond. A proportion of ribosomes then cease translation, while the remainder continue, effectively “initiated” by the prolyl-tRNA, to produce the downstream product as a discrete (“cleaved”) entity. Although published data support the proposal that 2A acts within the ribosome no direct evidence has been provided for this. Intraribosomal cleavage would not require cytosolic factors such as proteinases, and demonstration of this requires translation of 2A-containing proteins in a situation where cytosolic factors have no access to the nascent chain. Such “screening” occurs during co-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here the nascent chain is shielded from cytosolic factors by first the ribosome, then the translocation apparatus, before being partitioned into the ER lumen. Establishment of co-translational translocation requires the signal recognition particle (SRP; reviewed in Refs. 9Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar and 10Bui N. Strub K. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 135-145Google Scholar). SRP binds cis-acting hydrophobic signal sequences at the N terminus of nascent ER-targeted proteins as they emerge from the ribosome and concomitantly slows translation by the ribosome, a phenomenon termed elongation arrest (11Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 557-561Google Scholar, 12Wolin S.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2617-2622Google Scholar, 13Mason N. Ciufo L.F. Brown J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4164-4174Google Scholar). This ensures that ribosome-nascent chain complexes targeted to the translocon by SRP arrive with a short length of cytosolically exposed nascent chain. Once the ribosome-translocon junction is established the ribosomal nascent chain exit site lies directly over the translocon (14Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Google Scholar, 15Beckmann R. Spahn C.M. Eswar N. Helmers J. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Frank J. Blobel G. Cell. 2001; 107: 361-372Google Scholar, 16Menetret J. Neuhof A. Morgan D.G. Plath K. Radermacher M. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1219-1232Google Scholar). This junction is sufficiently tight to protect the nascent chain from externally added proteases (17Matlack K.E. Walter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6170-6180Google Scholar, 18Connolly T. Collins P. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 299-307Google Scholar) and even excludes small ions (19Crowley K.S. Liao S. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 461-471Google Scholar,20Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Google Scholar). Thus comparing the translation products of 2A-containing proteins with and without SRP-dependent signal sequences will reveal if 2A functions without the influence of cytosolic factors. The translocon has been proposed to have a signal sequence recognition function independent from that of targeting factors such as SRP (21Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Google Scholar,22Mothes W. Jungnickel B. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 355-364Google Scholar). Co-translational translocation of a 2A-containing polypeptide will result in amino acids C-terminal to 2A being presented to the translocon immediately after they have emerged from the ribosome. Therefore if 2A is active in a co-translationally targeted protein we reasoned that we could use this to ask two interdependent questions. First, where does cleavage take place? Second, can the translocon discern the presence or absence of a signal sequence on a nascent chain presented to it directly by the ribosome and in vivo? If cleavage does not take place inside the ribosome the portion of the protein downstream of 2A will arrive in the lumen of the ER. However, if the nascent chain cleaves within the ribosome a gap will occur in the polypeptide. The translocon may then “detect” this discontinuity in the nascent chain as it does the normal termination of translation, closing, and excluding the downstream protein from the ER. In contrast addition of a signal sequence to the N terminus of protein downstream of the 2A site and expression in vivo should result in reopening of the translocon and translocation of this protein into the ER. We chose the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for these studies. We demonstrate that the FMDV 2A sequence is functional in yeast, and that targeting through the SRP-dependent co-translational translocation pathway does not impair the cleavage reaction. In addition the released downstream product remains in the cytosol unless it contains its own signal sequence. Thus nascent chain cleavage takes place before the C-terminal portion of the protein initiates translocation and therefore within the ribosome. These data provide significant support for the proposal that 2A modifies the activity of the ribosome to promote scission of the nascent chain (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar,7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar) and are consistent with the notion that the translocon itself examines nascent chains for the presence of signal sequences. DISCUSSIONThe 2A sequence of FMDV directs production of separate proteins from one polyprotein open reading frame in a variety of higher eukaryotic and plant systems. As such it has great potential as a biotechnological tool, reducing the need for multiple vectors (e.g. Refs. 39Halpin C. Cooke S.E. Barakate A. El Amrani A. Ryan M.D. Plant J. 1999; 17: 453-459Google Scholar, 40Thomas C.L. Maule A.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1851-1855Google Scholar, 41Varnavski A.N. Khromykh A.A. Virology. 1999; 255: 366-375Google Scholar, 42De Felipe P. Izquierdo M. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 1921-1931Google Scholar). Previously the activity of FMDV 2A had not been examined in yeast. We found that it is active in vivo in yeast (Fig. 2). Thus, whatever features of higher eukaryotic cells allow 2A to promote scission of the polypeptide chain at the 2A C terminus are conserved to this “simpler” organism. This opens up the possibility of examining, in a genetically tractable system, how 2A functions and what trans-acting factors are required for or influence the cleavage reaction. A similar approach has been successfully applied to analysis of ribosomal frameshifting (43Harger J. Meskauskas A. Dinman J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 448-454Google Scholar), indicating that such examination of alterations to normal ribosome function in yeast is feasible.The proportion of 2A-containing proteins that were cleaved in yeast was similar to that seen previously in in vitro translation reactions, and the 2A-dependent reaction was unaffected by sequestering the nascent chain from cytosolic factors. As discussed above although SRP-dependent targeting functions similarly in yeast to higher eukaryotes (13Mason N. Ciufo L.F. Brown J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4164-4174Google Scholar, 44Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Google Scholar), translation and translocation are not efficiently coupled at short nascent chain lengths (37Johnsson N. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2686-2698Google Scholar). Both SRP-dependent substrates used in our analysis are of sufficient length to expect tight coupling between targeting and translocation for the great majority of individual protein chains. Thus if cytosolic factors were required for 2A-dependent cleavage, a significant reduction of the proportion of these proteins that were cleaved would have been expected. Instead the efficiency of cleavage was maintained when the protein containing it was co-translationally translocated and we conclude that extraribosomal cytosolic factors such as proteinases are not necessary for the 2A reaction.Determination of the fate of the separated C-terminal (GFP) portions of 2A-containing polyproteins yielded information both on (i) where cleavage took place and (ii) the gating function of the translocon. Even when polyproteins were co-translationally translocated into the ER, GFP remained cytosolic if it lacked a signal sequence. This exclusion was, as far as we could determine from fractionation experiments, quantitative and our view of how this occurs is shown in Fig. 6. For GFP to be excluded from the ER the cleavage reaction must have taken place before the N terminus of GFP was translocated and therefore our data demonstrate that the proposal that the break in the nascent chain is generated within the ribosome is correct (6Donnelly M.L. Luke G. Mehrotra A. Li X. Hughes L.E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Google Scholar, 7Ryan M.D. Donnelly M.L. Lewis A. Mehotra A.P. Wilke J. Gani D. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 55-79Google Scholar). We suggest that the N terminus of GFP is treated as a new translocation substrate and is “surveyed” by the translocon for the presence of a signal sequence. Without a signal sequence the translocon remains closed and the ribosome-translocon complex dissociates. When a signal sequence is added to the N terminus of GFP (substrates DNαF-2A-Kar2-GFP and DNαF-2A-CPY-GFP) the translocon recognizes this and reopens. In addition to indicating that cytosolic proteases are not responsible for the cleavage reaction the cytoplasmic location of GFP released from ER-targeted proteins refutes other models of 2A activity such as one 2A sequence acting in trans on another nascent 2A-containing protein to cleave it, or 2A requiring release from the ribosome and folding before it becomes active in cis. Each of these possibilities would result in cleavage within the ER lumen, and thus the GFP portion of the polyproteins would have been found in the ER.The model above and in Fig. 6 is consistent with the recent finding that, upon completion of co-translational translocation in vitro, ribosomes remain attached to the translocon, competent to initiate translation of new mRNA species (45Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33828-33835Google Scholar, 46Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23314-23320Google Scholar). If these ribosomes encode proteins with signal sequences they are translocated directly into the ER independent of targeting by SRP, whereas if they do not contain a signal sequence the translating ribosomes detach and release the protein into the cytosol. This has been argued to represent a physiologically important mechanism by which the cell ensures correct partitioning of cytosolic and ER-targeted proteins. Assuming that the in vitro experiments (45Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33828-33835Google Scholar, 46Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23314-23320Google Scholar) reflect in vivo events, then translocation of Kar2-GFP and CPY-GFP released from DNαF-2A-Kar2-GFP and DNαF-2A-CPY-GFP likely represents direct recognition of signal sequences in vivo by the translocon. Thus 2A may provide a means by which we can, for the first time, examine the signal sequence recognition and gating activities of the translocon in vivo independent of targeting.Analysis of 2A and 2A-like sequences has revealed that the FMDV 2A reaction is far from unique. It is a strategy for creating separate proteins from one polypeptide chain used by a variety of picornaviruses and insect viruses, and active 2A-like sequences are also found in repeated sequences within the genomes of Trypanosoma species (8Donnelly M.L. Gani D. Flint M. Monaghan S. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 13-21Google Scholar, 26Donnelly M.L. Hughes L.E. Luke G. Mendoza H. ten Dam E. Gani D. Ryan M.D. J. Gen.

Neither is 2A the only example of a nascent peptide chain that modifies the activity of the ribosome while within the ribosome exit tunnel (reviewed in Refs. 48Tenson T. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2002; 108: 591-594Google Scholar and 49Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Google Scholar). Other examples are sequences within the bacteriophage T4 gene 60 that promote “hopping” of the ribosome along the mRNA (50Herr A.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2671-2680Google Scholar), the TnaC leader peptide of theEscherichia coli tryptophanase operon that, in the presence of tryptophan, causes ribosomes to stall allowing expression of the downstream open reading frames (51Gong F. Yanofsky C. Science. 2002; 297: 1864-1867Google Scholar) and a peptide within SecM that causes ribosomes to stall unless the protein is engaged with the protein export machinery. Mutations that suppress the stalling activity of SecM have been identified in both RNA and protein components of the ribosome, these mapping to the nascent chain exit tunnel (52Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Google Scholar). Thus interactions between the nascent chain and the ribosome can have significant effects on translation and we expect that our further analysis may reveal similar interactions important for the activity of the 2A peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2014719030,"Anthrax lethal toxin produced by the bacterium<i>Bacillus anthracis</i> is the major cause of death in animals infected with anthrax. One component of this toxin, lethal factor (LF), inactivates members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or MEK family through proteolysis of their NH<sub>2</sub> termini. However, neither the substrate requirements for LF cleavage nor the mechanism by which proteolysis inactivates MEK have been demonstrated. By means of deletion mutant analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified an LFIR (LFinteracting region) in the COOH-terminal kinase domain of MEK1 adjacent to the proline-rich region, which is essential for LF-mediated proteolysis of MEK. Point mutations in this region block proteolysis but do not alter the kinase activity of MEK. Similar mutations in MEK6 also prevent proteolysis, indicating that this region is functionally conserved among MEKs. In addition, NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal proteolysis of MEK1 by LF was found to reduce not only the affinity of MEK1 for its substrate mitogen-activated protein kinase but also its intrinsic kinase activity, indicating that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of MEK is important not only for substrate interaction but also for catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2142623556,"Intracellular Ca2+-changes not only participate in important signaling pathways but have also been implicated in a number of disease states including acute pancreatitis. To investigate the underlying mechanisms in an experimental model mimicking human gallstone-induced pancreatitis, we ligated the pancreatic duct of Sprague-Dawley rats and NMRI mice for up to 6 h and studied intrapancreatic changes including the dynamics of [Ca2+]i in isolated acini. In contrast to bile duct ligation, pancreatic duct obstruction induced intra-pancreatic trypsinogen activation, leukocytosis, hyperamylasemia, and pancreatic edema and increased lung myeloperoxidase activity. Although resting [Ca2+]i in isolated acini rose by 45% to 205 ± 7 nmol, the acetylcholine- and cholecystokinin (CCK)-stimulated calcium peaks as well as the amylase secretion declined, but neither the [Ca2+]i-signaling pattern nor the amylase output in response to the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin nor the secretin-stimulated amylase release were impaired by pancreatic duct ligation. On the single cell level pancreatic duct ligation reduced the percentage of cells in which submaximal secretagogue stimulation was followed by a physiological response (i.e.Ca2+ oscillations) and increased the percentage of cells with a pathological response (i.e. peak plateau or absent Ca2+ signal). Moreover, it reduced the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ oscillation as well as the capacitative Ca2+ influx in response to secretagogue stimulation. Serum pancreatic enzyme elevation as well as trypsinogen activation was significantly reduced by pretreatment of animals with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. These experiments suggest that pancreatic duct obstruction rapidly changes the physiological response of the exocrine pancreas to a Ca2+-signaling pattern that has been associated with premature digestive enzyme activation and the onset of pancreatitis, both of which can be prevented by administration of an intracellular calcium chelator. Intracellular Ca2+-changes not only participate in important signaling pathways but have also been implicated in a number of disease states including acute pancreatitis. To investigate the underlying mechanisms in an experimental model mimicking human gallstone-induced pancreatitis, we ligated the pancreatic duct of Sprague-Dawley rats and NMRI mice for up to 6 h and studied intrapancreatic changes including the dynamics of [Ca2+]i in isolated acini. In contrast to bile duct ligation, pancreatic duct obstruction induced intra-pancreatic trypsinogen activation, leukocytosis, hyperamylasemia, and pancreatic edema and increased lung myeloperoxidase activity. Although resting [Ca2+]i in isolated acini rose by 45% to 205 ± 7 nmol, the acetylcholine- and cholecystokinin (CCK)-stimulated calcium peaks as well as the amylase secretion declined, but neither the [Ca2+]i-signaling pattern nor the amylase output in response to the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin nor the secretin-stimulated amylase release were impaired by pancreatic duct ligation. On the single cell level pancreatic duct ligation reduced the percentage of cells in which submaximal secretagogue stimulation was followed by a physiological response (i.e.Ca2+ oscillations) and increased the percentage of cells with a pathological response (i.e. peak plateau or absent Ca2+ signal). Moreover, it reduced the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ oscillation as well as the capacitative Ca2+ influx in response to secretagogue stimulation. Serum pancreatic enzyme elevation as well as trypsinogen activation was significantly reduced by pretreatment of animals with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. These experiments suggest that pancreatic duct obstruction rapidly changes the physiological response of the exocrine pancreas to a Ca2+-signaling pattern that has been associated with premature digestive enzyme activation and the onset of pancreatitis, both of which can be prevented by administration of an intracellular calcium chelator. Alterations in intracellular calcium signaling have previously been reported from an experimental animal model of acute pancreatitis that employs supramaximal secretagogue stimulation for the disease induction (1Ward J.B. Sutton R. Jenkins S.A. Petersen O.H. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 481-491Google Scholar). Moreover, the spatial and temporal distribution of intracellular calcium signals in response to either physiological or pathological stimuli has been found to be directly related to premature digestive enzyme activation in the pancreas and to acinar cell injury (2Hofbauer B. Saluja A.K. Lerch M.M. Bhagat L. Bhatia M. Lee H.S. Frossard J.L. Adler G. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G352-G362Google Scholar, 3Krüger B. Albrecht E. Lerch M.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 43-50Google Scholar, 4Grady T. Mah'Moud M. Otani T. Rhee S. Lerch M.M. Gorelick F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1010-G1017Google Scholar, 5Lerch M.M. Gorelick F.S. Med. Clin. N. Am. 2000; 84: 549-563Google Scholar). Intracellular activation of trypsinogen on the other hand can be completely prevented with agents that interfere with either the uptake of calcium, the maintenance of a calcium gradient across the plasma membrane, or the rapid release of calcium from apical intracellular stores (4Grady T. Mah'Moud M. Otani T. Rhee S. Lerch M.M. Gorelick F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1010-G1017Google Scholar, 6Raraty M. Ward J. Erdemli G. Vaillant C. Neoptolemos J.P. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13126-13131Google Scholar). All of these studies indicate clearly that the spatial and temporal distribution of intracellular calcium signals plays a critical role in the early cellular events that precede the onset of pancreatitis. The mechanism, however, that was used to induce acinar cell injury in these studies or in response to which intracellular calcium changes were characterized, supramaximal secretagogue stimulation, is not necessarily an event that is generally involved in the pathogenesis of clinical pancreatitis. In many parts of the world the most common etiological factor associated with acute pancreatitis is gallstone disease. Experimental (7Lerch M.M. Saluja A. Rünzi M. Dawra R. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 853-861Google Scholar) as well as clinical studies (8Acosta J.M. Rubio Galli O.M. Rossi R. Chinellato A.V. Pellegrini C.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1997; 184: 499-505Google Scholar, 9Lerch M.M. Weidenbach H. Hernandez C.A. Preclik G. Adler G. Gut. 1994; 35: 1501-1503Google Scholar) suggest that the onset of gallstone-induced pancreatitis requires migration of the offending stone through the biliary tract and its impaction at the duodenal papilla. Here, at the junction of the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct, the stone can impair the flow of pancreatic secretion or lead to a complete blockage of the pancreatic duct. It is now generally accepted that this impairment of pancreatic secretion (7Lerch M.M. Saluja A. Rünzi M. Dawra R. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 853-861Google Scholar, 10Hernandez C.A. Lerch M.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1371-1373Google Scholar,11Banks P.A. Feldman M. Scharschmidt B.F. Sleisinger M.H. Sleisinger and Fortran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 809-838Google Scholar), rather than a potential reflux of bile into the pancreas (13Opie E.L. Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. 1901; 12: 182-188Google Scholar), represents the critical pathophysiological event for the development gallstone-induced pancreatitis. To investigate whether this clinically relevant mechanism for the onset of pancreatitis is, in analogy to the secretagogue-induced animal models, associated with intracellular calcium changes and premature protease activation, we ligated the pancreatic duct of laboratory animals for up to 6 h. The results from our experiments indicate that pancreatic duct obstruction is indeed followed by rapid changes in the response of acinar cells to secretory stimuli, leads to complex pathological alterations in the intracellular Ca2+-signaling pattern, and induces premature digestive enzyme activation. In vivo administration of an intracellular Ca2+ chelator on the other hand can largely prevent hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia, and intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation. Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Cell-Tak was obtained from Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA. Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). All other reagents were of the highest purity available and were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. All animal experiments were approved by and conducted under the guidelines of the Animal Use and Welfare Committee of the University of Münster. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 350 g and adult male white NMRI mice weighing between 30 and 35 g (both species from Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were kept in Nalgene shoebox cages in a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with unlimited access to standard chow and water. All animals were adjusted to laboratory conditions over the course of 1 week before the experiments. After a 12-h fast with free access to drinking water and after anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (72 mg/kg of body weight), the abdomen was opened, and the pancreas was exposed. Above the head of the pancreas the common bile duct was ligated in all animals (bile duct controls and treatment group), and subsequently, the main pancreatic duct was ligated without affecting the splenic vessels in the treatment group. In addition to sham-operated controls for most experiments (laparotomy only) a bile duct-ligated control group was used for several reasons as follows. (a) Bile duct ligation alone is known to raise circulating cholecystokinin levels in the blood and could, by itself, exert a stimulatory effect on the pancreas (14Mizutani S. Miyata M. Izukura M. Tanaka Y. Matsuda H. Pancreas. 1995; 10: 194-199Google Scholar). (b) It has been suggested that bile duct obstruction could be a confounding or aggravating factor for the events involved pancreatic duct obstruction-induced pancreatitis (15Senninger N. Moody F.G. Coelho J.C. Van Buren D.H. Surgery. 1986; 99: 688-693Google Scholar, 16Schleicher C. Baas J.C. Elser H. Senninger N. Ann. Surg. 2001; 233: 528-536Google Scholar). (c) Ligation of the pancreatic duct system in mice without compromising the unimpaired flow of bile is technically more prone to surgical complications than ligation of both ducts and the latter is a more likely to reflect the situation that arises when a gallstone is impacted at the papilla. At time intervals of up to 6 h the anesthetized animals were killed by cervical dislocation, venous blood was collected from the right ventricle, and the pancreas was rapidly removed for either morphology, enzyme activity measurements, or fresh acinar cell isolation. In a series of experiments that were performed to modify the pathological calcium-signaling pattern in pancreatic acinar cells that was associated with pancreatic duct ligation we used the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM in in vivo experiments. BAPTA-AM was administered intraperitoneally in mice (10 μg/kg of body weight in 180 μl of propylene glycol as a solvent) by 2 single injections at 30 min before the operation and at the time of laparotomy. Controls received only propylene glycol vehicle intraperitoneally. Serum activities of amylase and lipase as well as trypsinogen activation peptide in the pancreas were measured 4 h after pancreatic duct ligation. After sacrifice pancreatic tissue was either fixed for morphological studies, snap-frozen for the assays outlined below, or desiccated for 12 h at 160 °C to determine the dry/wet weight ration as an indicator of pancreatic edema formation. The reason for using rats as well as mice for our studies was 2-fold. One reason was to test our hypotheses in different species of laboratory animals, and the second was the observation that rat pancreatic acini preparations permit a greater yield, whereas mouse pancreatic acinar cells are better suited for single cell microfluorometry. In the following we briefly outline the somewhat different protocols for acinar cell preparations from mouse and rat pancreas. The rat pancreas was immediately transferred to iced medium (preoxygenated for 10 min) composed of modified Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer containing NaCl (130 mm), KCl (5 mm), HEPES (20 mm), KH2PO4 (1.2 mm), MgSO4(2 mm), glucose (10 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm), soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml), bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (w/v) at pH 7.4. The tissue was rapidly minced with scissors, and acinar cells were dissociated by incubation in calcium-free medium containing collagenase type V (268 units/ml) for 25 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath (17Williams J.A. Korc M. Dormer R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: 517-524Google Scholar, 18Lerch M.M. Saluja A.K. Dawra R. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 1768-1779Google Scholar). The collagenase solution was discarded, and the cell suspension was washed 3 times with calcium-free medium, filtered through a nylon mesh, and centrifuged with medium containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Finally the cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium. For single cell studies mouse pancreas was rapidly removed, minced into small pieces on ice, and placed into buffer (pH 7.4) containing NaCl (130 mm), KCl (5 mm), HEPES (10 mm), KH2PO4 (1.2 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm), MgSO4 (1 mm), glucose (10 mm), and collagenase (100 units/ml Type V). After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C under continuous shaking (120 cycles/min) the digested tissue was washed 3 times in 10 ml of Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer without collagenase and again shaken 10 times to dissociate acini. Acini were then filtered through muslin gauze, centrifuged at 400 rpm for 3 min, and washed twice more in buffer containing 4% bovine serum albumin. After the second wash, acini were suspended in 8 ml of Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml) and bovine serum albumin (0.2% w/v). A stock suspension of acini was kept on ice for up to 4 h without significant reduction in cell viability (>95%) as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Pancreatic acini were transferred to 5-ml vials with aliquots of Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium and incubated with secretagogue at 37 °C and constantly agitated for 5 min. After centrifugation at 50 ×g for 5 min, amylase activity was measured in the supernatant by on-line fluorometry using amylopectin anthranilate as a substrate (19Rinderknecht J. Marbach E.P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1970; 29: 107-110Google Scholar, 20Matthews E.K. Petersen O.H. Williams J.A. J. Physiol. 1973; 234: 689-701Google Scholar). Amylase measurements were expressed as units/ml supernatant/100 mg of acinar cells. The values obtained were calibrated against an α-amylase activity standard. To determine the extend of premature and intracellular trypsinogen activation, a parameter that has been found to closely parallel the severity of pancreatitis (21Neoptolemos J.P. Kemppainen E.A. Mayer J.M. Fitzpatrick J.M. Raraty M.G. Slavin J. Beger H.G. Hietaranta A.J. Puolakkainen P.A. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1955-1960Google Scholar), we measured the generation and excretion of trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) 1The abbreviations used are: TAP, trypsinogen activation peptide; Ach, acetylcholine; CCK, cholecystokinin; BAPTA-AM, acetoxymethyl ester (AM) of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid in urine and pancreatic tissue of mice after pancreatic duct ligation using a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biotrin, Dublin, Ireland) as previously reported (22Karanjia N.D. Widdison A.L. Jehanli A. Hermon-Taylor J. Reber H.A. Pancreas. 1993; 8: 189-195Google Scholar, 23Halangk W. Lerch M.M. Brandt-Nedelev B. Roth W. Ruthenbuerger M. Reinheckel T. Domschke W. Lippert H. Peters C. Deussing J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 106: 773-781Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase activity in lung tissue was determined as previously described in detail (23Halangk W. Lerch M.M. Brandt-Nedelev B. Roth W. Ruthenbuerger M. Reinheckel T. Domschke W. Lippert H. Peters C. Deussing J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 106: 773-781Google Scholar) using purified myeloperoxidase (Calbiochem) as a standard. After removal of the pancreas of sham operated, bile duct-ligated and pancreatic duct-ligated animals small tissue sections of 2 mm were immediately fixed in an iced solution of 2% formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, embedded in Epon, post-fixed, and contrasted with osmium, uranyl, and lead. Semithin section were studied by light microscopy and thin sections evaluated on a Philips EM10 electron microscope as previously reported (24Lerch M.M. Saluja A.K. Rünzi M. Dawra R. Steer M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2222-2231Google Scholar). To study the acinar cell microfilament network after pancreatic duct ligation, tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 5-μm cryosections were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and incubated with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin for 20 min in the dark. The micrographs shown in Fig. 3 were taken by electron microscopy or fluorescence microscopy and are representative for four or more individual experiments. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were determined using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2. For acinar cell suspension experiments rat acinar cells were loaded with 1 μmfura-2/AM for 25 min at room temperature. After washing the cells were incubated for another 20 min in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium to permit complete de-esterification of the probe. Measurements were performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorimeter using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, and emitted light was collected at 510 nm. After each experiment the signals were calibrated according to Grynkiewicz et al. (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar) by incubating cells in either calcium-free medium (1 mm EGTA) or calcium-containing buffer in the presence of 100 μm digitonin for complete permeabilization. For microfluorometric studies of [Ca2+]i dynamics mouse acini were loaded with the AM-ester or fura-2 (5 μm) at room temperature for 20 min. Fura-2-loaded cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with Cell-Tak (1 μl/cm2) and kept at room temperature for 30 min before they were mounted in a perfusion chamber with an internal volume of 0.28 ml and placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot-TMD inverted microscope equipped with a Fluor ×100 oil immersion objective. Acini were continuously perfused with medium at a flow rate of 3 ml/min at room temperature. Fluorochrome excitation (340 and 380 nm for fura-2) was achieved using a xenon lamp in series with two chopper-linked monochromators that were coupled to the microscope via fiber optics. Emitted light was collected behind a band-pass filter (509 nm for fura-2) by a photomultiplier. In unloaded controls background fluorescence was found to be negligible. Ratios obtained from the dual excitation wavelengths probe fura-2 were converted to calcium concentrations as previously reported (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar, 26Mooren F.C. Turi S. Gunzel D. Schlue W.R. Domschke W. Singh J. Lerch M.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 659-672Google Scholar) using the formula [Ca2+]i = (R −R min)/(R max −R) × K d − (I ion-free/I ion-saturated)380 nm, in which R min and R maxare the minimal and maximal ratios obtained in either ion-free or ion-saturated solutions, respectively, K d is the dissociation constant of fura-2 for calcium, and I is the fluorescence intensity at the 380-nm wavelength of the free dye divided by the saturated ion-dye complex. All calibration parameters were obtained in separate experiments. Data shown in the figures are representative of six or more individual experiments in each group and indicate the means ± S.D. or S.E. Differences between groups were compared using Student's t test with Bonferroni correction where more than two groups were compared. Asterisks in the figures indicate statistically significant differences when thep values were <0.05. In the rat bile duct ligation alone had no effect on either serum amylase activity, acinar cell damage, or the basal and secretagogue-stimulated amylase secretion (Fig. 1, A andB). Over the 6-h course of duct ligation in rats no difference between the basal amylase release from acini of bile duct-ligated (16.47 ± 3.20 units/ml/100 mg; n = 23) and pancreatic duct-ligated animals (14.34 ± 3.01 units/ml/100 mg; n = 19) was found. In contrast, the acetylcholine (Ach; 10−7 mol/liter)-induced amylase secretion from isolated acini decreased to a nadir of ∼16% of bile duct controls, whereas serum amylase activity increased in parallel. These data indicate that acinar cell damage (Fig.1 A) and acinar cell secretory dysfunction (Fig.1 B), respectively, can already be detected as early as 2 h after pancreatic duct ligation. When we characterized pancreatic duct ligation-induced pancreatic damage in the mouse, serum amylase activity rose just as significantly as in the rat model (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, a premature and intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen could be demonstrated by increased TAP levels in pancreatic tissue and the urine of pancreatic duct-ligated mice at 4 h (Fig. 2,B and C). On ultrastructural morphology bile duct ligation alone had no effect on either pancreatic duct cell (Fig.3 A) or exocrine cell morphology (Fig. 3 B). The latter preserved their characteristic structure with zymogen granules grouped at the apical pole and around the lumen. After 4 h of combined pancreatic and bile duct ligation the ducts were found to be largely distended (arrow in Fig. 3 C), and some duct-lining cells had damaged cell membranes facing the lumen. Acinar cells on the other hand had not undergone any necrotic changes at this time; their lumen was only marginally distended (asterisk in Fig.3 C), and the most prominent intracellular change was a dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3 D). To study the actin microfilament network, which is known to be critically involved in fusion/fission events of zymogen granule exocytosis, we used phalloidin-labeled cryosections. In untreated control animals (Fig. 3 E) or animals after bile duct ligation (Fig.3 F) F-actin labeling was found at the terminal microfilament web surrounding the acinar lumen (asterisks) as well as along the lateral and basal membrane (arrows). After pancreatic duct ligation (Fig. 3 G) F-actin labeling remained unchanged at the apical locations, whereas it was redistributed from the basal acinar cell membrane to the basal cytosol surrounding the nuclei (circles in Fig. 3 G). This suggests that the apical microfilament web involved in zymogen granule fusion/fission events remains unaffected by pancreatic duct ligation. To permit a comparison between pancreatic duct ligation in rodents with other models of experimental pancreatitis we determined a variety of parameters that are known to reflect disease severity or systemic inflammatory response. As shown in Fig.4 and in contrast to bile duct ligation, pancreatic duct obstruction was followed by a significant increase in circulating leukocytes (Fig. 4 A), pancreatic edema (Fig.4 B), and lung myeloperoxidase activity, all of which have been reported to a comparable degree in other experimental models of acute pancreatitis, including the secretagogue-induced variety (23Halangk W. Lerch M.M. Brandt-Nedelev B. Roth W. Ruthenbuerger M. Reinheckel T. Domschke W. Lippert H. Peters C. Deussing J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 106: 773-781Google Scholar). To study the effect of a calcium-mobilizing secretagogue on the response of acini from bile and pancreatic duct-ligated animals we stimulated them with acetylcholine (10−5m). In suspensions of acini this typically resulted in a biphasic response of [Ca2+]i that begins with a rapid release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (peak phase) and is followed by a sustained Ca2+ influx (plateau phase, Fig. 5 A). Because the absolute resting levels of [Ca2+]i were already changed dramatically in acini from the pancreatic duct-ligated group (see Fig. 5 B), we compared secretagogue-induced changes in [Ca2+]i as increases over basal levels (Δ[Ca2+]i) in either the peak-phase (maximum Δ[Ca2+]i) or in the plateau-phase (Δ[Ca2+]i between 60 and 100 s after the peak). When we studied basal intracellular calcium concentrations in acini from control rats they were in the low nanomolar range (140 ± 5 nmol). In bile duct-ligated control animals the resting [Ca2+]i was slightly decreased in comparison to sham-operated controls but remained constant at this level throughout the 6-h observation period (Fig. 5 B). Ligation of the pancreatic duct on the other hand induced a gradual and consistent increase of resting [Ca2+]i in acinar cells to a maximum of 205 ± 7 mm after 6 h (Fig.5 B). During the rapid peak phase after acetylcholine stimulation the increase in [ΔCa2+]i in acini from bile duct-ligated animals remained roughly in the range of control animals, whereas it decreased significantly and continuously in acini from the pancreatic duct-ligated group (Fig. 5 C). The differences between the groups were even more pronounced during the subsequent plateau phase because Δ[Ca2+]i declined in acini from pancreatic duct-ligated animals and, at least in the last phase of up to 6 h, increased in the bile duct-ligated group (Fig.5 D). When we investigated other calcium-mobilizing agents in comparison to acetylcholine we found that the response to physiological concentrations of cholecystokinin (10−8m) was similarly impaired and consisted in a reduced amylase secretion by 75% (Fig. 6 A) as well as an equal reduction in either the peak or the plateau Δ[Ca2+]i after stimulation (Fig.6 C). In contrast, when we used thapsigargin (10−6m), an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPases that releases [Ca2+]i by a different, not receptor- or G-protein-coupled mechanism, we found that the subsequent amylase secretion was unimpaired in the acini from pancreatic duct-ligated animals (Fig. 6 A). This increase in [Ca2+]i, in response to thapsigargin, which does not follow a peak/plateau pattern (3Krüger B. Albrecht E. Lerch M.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 43-50Google Scholar) (these two phases are, therefore, not distinguished in Fig. 6 C), was even somewhat higher in the pancreatic duct-ligated animals. When we investigated amylase secretion in response to secretin, a cAMP-mediated stimulus, we found it, in analogy to the thapsigargin experiments, not to be impaired by pancreatic duct ligation (Fig. 6 B). These data indicate that the observed impairment of calcium-mediated secretion after pancreatic duct ligation affects, indeed, only calcium-mediated pathways and is not due to cellular damage in general. To further rule out that a disproportionate rate of acinar cell necrosis would account for some of the functional changes, we measured lactate dehydrogenase release from resting and stimulated acini after either bile or pancreatic duct ligation. Lactate dehydrogenase release did not exceed 1.5–2.3% of the total cellular lactate dehydrogenase in any of the groups or under any experimental conditions, and no differences between sham-operated, bile duct-ligated and pancreatic duct-ligated animals were found (data not shown), thus excluding significant necrosis or cellular leakage as a confounding factor for acinar cell impairment. On the single cell level pancreatic acinar cells are known to respond with a characteristic [Ca2+]i pattern in response to different concentrations of secretagogue, and pathological signaling patterns have been associated with the onset of pancreatitis (3Krüger B. Albrecht E. Lerch M.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 43-50Google Scholar, 27Mithofer K. Fernandez-del Castillo C. Frick T.W. Lewandrowski K.B. Rattner D.W. Warshaw A.L.

Med. 1991; 325: 382-387Google Scholar). Submaximal concentrations of either acetylcholine of cholecystokinin evoke repetitive Ca2+ peaks, so-called Ca2+ oscillations, whereas maximal or supramaximal concentrations induce an initial peak that is followed by a subsequent plateau phase. When we stimulated single acinar cells from the pancreas of control mice with submaximal concentrations of cholecystokinin (20 pm) almost 90% of the cells responded with Ca2+ oscillations, whereas 4% responded with a peak/plateau Ca2+ pattern. After 4 h of pancreatic duct ligation the percentage of cells that responded to the submaximal 20 pm cholecystokinin concentration with a peak/plateau Ca2+-pattern increased to 10% (Fig.7 A). The percentage of cell that had no [Ca2+]i response at all on the other hand increased from 4% in bile duct-ligated controls to 27% after pancreatic duct obstruction. The physiological pattern of Ca2+ oscillations that predominated in most cells (∼90%) from control pancreas was found in only 63% of cells after ligation of the pancreatic duct (Fig. 7 A). When we studied the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+oscillations by single cell microfluorometry we confirmed that individual resting [Ca2+]i levels were indeed increased after mouse pancreatic duct ligation (to 95 ± 5 nm versus 76 ± 5 nm in bile duct ligation controls). In terms of Ca2+ oscillations pancreatic duct ligation shifted the signaling pattern toward lower frequencies and lower amplitudes. Although the mean period of an oscillation was 76 ± 3 s (oscillatory frequency 0.79/min) in controls, it increased to 127 ± 10 s (frequency 0.47/min) after 4 h of pancreatic"

The copine target proteins were identified by yeast two-hybrid screening and the interactions were verified in vitro using purified proteins. In the majority of cases the copine binds to a domain of the target protein that is predicted to form a characteristic coiled-coil. A consensus sequence for the coiled-coil copine-binding site was derived and found to have predictive value for identifying new copine targets. We also show that interaction with copines may result in recruitment of target proteins to membrane surfaces and regulation of the enzymatic activities of target proteins.

They bind phospholipid membranes through the action of two “C2 domains” in the N-terminal portion that are activated by calcium. The C-terminal half of the copine molecule is distantly related to the “A domain” (3Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) (or “I domain”) that enables the extracellular portion of integrins to bind extracellular matrix proteins. The binding of the integrin A domain to matrix proteins is dependent upon the presence of a bound magnesium or manganese ion through a mechanism that has been termed MIDAS for metal-induced adhesion site (3Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence have led to the hypothesis that the copine A domain may also be involved in targeted protein-protein interactions. First, critical residues involved in the chelation of Mg2+ are conserved in the copine molecule (1Creutz C.E. Tomsig J.L. Snyder S.L. Gautier M.C. Skouri F. Beisson J. Cohen J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16163-16175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is, however, unknown whether the copine A domain is in fact a protein-protein interaction motif. We report here, based on in vivo and in vitro evidence obtained by yeast two-hybrid screening and “pull-down” experiments using immobilized copine partners, that the copine A domain binds to a number of intracellular target proteins. We also demonstrate that full-length copine mediates the Ca2+-dependent association of target proteins with phospholipids, a phenomenon that could influence the activities and intracellular localization of the target proteins. The copines may thus comprise another pathway for calcium signaling to proteins involved in a wide range of biological activities including growth control, exocytosis, mitosis, apoptosis, gene transcription, and cytoskeletal organization.CONCLUSIONMultiple copines are expressed in a given organism (1Creutz C.E.

Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1467-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), thus multiple independent and branching pathways for calcium signaling may exist within cells based on this family of proteins. Because of their ability to associate with membranes the copines may be particularly important for regulating signaling processes on membrane surfaces. With the exception of collagen, all of the copine target domains identified here are known or predicted to be on intracellular proteins or on the intracellular portions of membrane proteins. Therefore, these targets should be accessible to copines in vivo. In many cases the targets are signaling molecules themselves, including calcium-binding proteins, kinases, a phosphatase, ubiquitin (or NEDD8)-conjugating enzymes, and transcription modulators. Mutation of a copine inArabidopsis has been shown to lead to alterations of growth patterns and apoptotic responses to stress (24Hua J. Grisafi P. Cheng S.H. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2263-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Jambunathan N. Siani J.M. McNellis T.W. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2225-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Possibly this reflects alterations in calcium signaling networks based on copine-target interactions that underlie these processes. Calcium regulates a number of intracellular activities in stimulated cells by associating with specific motifs in calcium-binding proteins. In some cases the calcium-binding motif is embedded in an enzyme or structural protein that is directly regulated by calcium. However, in the case of the important signaling protein calmodulin, calcium first binds to calmodulin and then the calcium-calmodulin complex binds to and regulates a wide variety of “target” proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1998046127,"A variety of intracellular signaling pathways are linked to cell surface receptor signaling through their recruitment by Src homology 2 (SH2)/SH3-containing adapter molecules. p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is an effector of Rac/Cdc42 GTPases that has been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, proliferation, and cell survival signaling. In this study, we describe the specific interaction of PAK1 with the Grb2 adapter protein both in vitro and in vivo. We identify the site of this interaction as the second proline-rich SH3 binding domain of PAK1. Stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in HaCaT cells enhances the level of EGFR-associated PAK1 and Grb2, although the PAK1-Grb2 association is itself independent of this stimulation. A cell-permeant TAT-tagged peptide encompassing the second proline-rich SH3 binding domain of PAK1 simultaneously blocked Grb2 and activated EGFR association with PAK1, in vitro and in vivo, indicating that Grb2 mediates the interaction of PAK1 with the activated EGFR. Blockade of this interaction decreased the epidermal growth factor-induced extension of membrane lamellae. Thus Grb2 may serve as an important mechanism for linking downstream PAK signaling to various upstream pathways."

PTD mediated delivery of a peptide inhibitor of the IL-1β-induced IκB kinase (IKK), derived from IKKβ (NBD; Nemo-binding domain), and completely blocked the detrimental effects of IL-1β on islet function and NF-κB activity, in a similar manner to Ad-IκB. We also demonstrate that mouse islets can be transduced in situ by infusion of the transduction peptide through the bile duct prior to isolation, resulting in 40% peptide transduction of the β-cells. Delivery of the IKK inhibitor transduction fusion peptide (PTD-5-NBD) in situto mouse islets resulted in improved islet function and viability after isolation.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by an inflammatory response resulting in selective destruction of the insulin secreting β-cells of the pancreas. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1β, interleukin-1β; 6CF, 6-carboxyfluorescein; IKK, IκB kinase; NBD, NEMO-binding domain; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; NO, nitric oxide; PTD, peptide transduction domain 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1β, interleukin-1β; 6CF, 6-carboxyfluorescein; IKK, IκB kinase; NBD, NEMO-binding domain; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; NO, nitric oxide; PTD, peptide transduction domain and interferon-γ and the free radical, nitric oxide (NO), have been implicated to play key roles in the initial destruction of β-cells leading to the development of the disease (1Stassi G. De Maria R. Trucco G. Rudert W. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Giordano C. Trucco M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1193-1200Google Scholar). In particular, IL-1β is released by resident macrophages in islets in response to a variety of stimuli that can stimulate NO production by β-cells (1Stassi G. De Maria R. Trucco G. Rudert W. Testi R.

Cytokine-induced NO production by rodent and human β-cells results in islet dysfunction and inhibition of insulin secretion. This NO-mediated damage has been shown to be attenuated by inducible nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors (5Southern C. Schulster D. Green I.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 42-44Google Scholar, 6Corbett J.A.

Approaches to inhibit the adverse effects of IL-1β on islets, such as through gene transfer of the IL-1 inhibitor IL-1Ra, have been shown to improve islet function and viability (9Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Ghivizzani S.C. Gambotto A. Ricordi C. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1730-1736Google Scholar). In addition to the adverse effects of IL-1β, islets undergo enzymatic, osmotic, mechanical, and ischemic stresses during isolation, resulting in loss of viability, reduction of cell number, and initiation of apoptosis (10Cattan P. Berney T. Schena S. Molano R.D. Pileggi A. Vizzardelli C. Ricordi C. Inverardi L. Transplantation (Baltimore). 2001; 71: 857-862Google Scholar, 11Cattan P. Berney T. Schena S. Molano R.D. Pileggi A.

The loss of viability of isolated islets has been associated with detachment from the surrounding extracellular matrix, leading to activation of caspase-3 and NF-κB (15Wang R.N. Rosenberg L. J.

The promoters for a number of cytokine-sensitive genes, including inducible nitric-oxide synthase, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), Fas, and FasL contain binding sites for the NF-κB family of transcription factors (19Taylor B.S. de Vera M.E.

Med. 1999; 189: 999-1004Google Scholar). Proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to stimulate NF-κB activity in human and rodent islets in vitro, resulting in β-cell impairment (23Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Google Scholar). NF-κB binds to a family of naturally occurring repressors termed IκB (24Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Google Scholar, 25Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar), resulting in retention of the transcription factor complex in the cytoplasm. A variety of inflammatory agents including cytokines, endotoxin, double stranded RNA, and the viral transactivator Tax activate the NF-κB by rapid phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the IκB repressor (24Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Google Scholar, 26Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 27Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

These agents increase the activity of the two related IκB kinases, IKK-α and IKK-β, which phosphorylate IκB. The release and degradation of IκB following phosphorylation allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to its cognate enhancer/promoter elements upstream of certain proinflammatory genes (24Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Google Scholar, 29Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Google Scholar). In particular, IκB has been shown to inhibit inducible nitric-oxide synthase gene expression by associating with NF-κB and preventing its translocation to the nucleus (30De Vera M.E. Taylor B.S. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G1290-G1296Google Scholar). Intracellular expression of an IκB mutant that is nonphosphorylatable and thus unable to be degraded prevented the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB proteins, even in the presence of cytokines (31Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418Google Scholar, 32Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Google Scholar). In addition to IKK-α and IKK-β, a regulatory protein known as IKK-γ/NEMO has been shown to be a critical component of IKK complex (33Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Google Scholar, 34Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Google Scholar). IKK-γ/NEMO also was identified independently in biochemical studies as an essential component of the high molecular weight IKK complex (33Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B.

Cells that do not express IKK-γ/NEMO are unable to assemble the high molecular weight IKK complex, preventing stimulation of IKK activity in response to agents that stimulate the NF-κB pathway (33Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Google Scholar, 34Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G.

Furthermore, inhibition of the IKKβ-IKK-γ/NEMO interaction and subsequent activation of NF-κBin vivo and in vitro using a cell-permeable PTD-NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide fusion has been reported recently (38Donepudi M. Raychaudhuri P. Bluestone J.A. Mokyr M.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6491-6499Google Scholar, 39May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Google Scholar). In our earlier studies we have shown protection of human islets from the effect of IL-1β by adenoviral gene transfer of several different genes including IL-1Ra, soluble IL-1 receptors, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (9Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Ghivizzani S.C. Gambotto A. Ricordi C. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1730-1736Google Scholar, 40Giannoukakis N. Mi Z. Rudert W.A. Gambotto A. Trucco M. Robbins P. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 2015-2022Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated that adenoviral gene transfer of the nondegradable form of IκB repressor was able to block IL-1β-mediated dysfunction and apoptosis (41Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36509-36513Google Scholar). These results suggest that specific inhibition of NF-κB is able to inhibit the adverse effects of IL-1β on β-cells. Although it has been shown that virus-mediated transfer of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 into islets in culture inhibits apoptosis (42Thomas F.T. Contreras J.L. Bilbao G. Ricordi C. Curiel D. Thomas J.M. Surgery. 1999; 126: 299-304Google Scholar, 43Rabinovitch A. Suarez-Pinzon W. Strynadka K. Ju Q. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Korbutt G.S. Rajotte R.V.

Med. 1999; 190: 1135-1146Google Scholar), this class of genes is unable to block the adverse effects of IL-1β on islet function. Moreover, even though adenoviral vectors do not appear to interfere with β-cell function in vitro, the inherent immunogenicity of these viral vectors may be detrimental to islet transplantation. Although there are promising preclinical results with lentiviral and adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer to islets, there currently is no clinically appropriate method for improving islet function and viability by gene transfer. Recently it was shown that large protein complexes can be delivered directly to cells when they are linked to protein transduction domains (PTDs). PTDs are short, positively charged domains that can freely cross cell membranes through a receptor and energy independent process (45Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Google Scholar, 46Joliot A. Pernelle C. Deagostini-Bazin H. Prochiantz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1864-1868Google Scholar, 47Elliott G. O'Hare P.

Proteins fused to the PTD derived from HIV/Tat or theDrosophila Antennapedia homeobox protein (Antp) transduce a variety of different cell types and are even able to cross the blood/brain barrier when administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection (49Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Google Scholar, 50Barka T. Gresik E.W. van Der Noen H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1453-1460Google Scholar, 51Cao G. Pei W. Ge H. Liang Q. Luo Y. Sharp F.R. Lu A. Ran R. Graham S.H. Chen J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5423-5431Google Scholar). Previously we have identified a series of cationic peptides that were able to transduce certain cell types as or more efficiently than the Tat PTD (52Mai J.C. Shen H. Watkins S.C. Cheng T. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30208-30218Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated that a specific PTD, termed PTD-5, was able to transduce human islets efficiently in culture (53Mi Z. Mai J. Lu X. Robbins P.D. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 339-347Google Scholar). Given that gene transfer of IκB was effective in preventing islet dysfunction and apoptosis, we hypothesized that peptide-mediated transduction of NF-κB inhibitors into islet cells would result in improved viability and function following IL-1β exposure. Thus, we have examined the ability of PTD-5-mediated transduction of the NBD peptide to block islet dysfunction and loss of viability. Here we demonstrate that transduction of mouse islets in culture with the PTD-5-NBD fusion peptide can prevent IL-1β-dependent suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin release and NF-κB activation. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of transducing mouse islets in situ by infusion of the transduction peptide into the mouse pancreas via the common bile duct prior to islet isolation. Administration of the PTD-5-NBD fusion peptide into mouse islets in situ before isolation increased their viability and function following isolation. These results suggest that peptide-mediated transduction of an NF-κB inhibitor is able to protect islets from the adverse effects associated with islet isolation. Clinically, this approach could be used to improve the viability, function, and mass of human islets following isolation byin situ delivery of PTD-5-NBD to islets prior to isolation. BALB/c mice were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). All animals were housed at the University of Pittsburgh, Center for Biotechnology animal facility in compliance with the United States Department of Agriculture and National Institutes of Health regulations. All animal manipulations were conducted and monitored under protocols reviewed and approved by the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee. Peptides PTD-5 (RRQRRTSKLMKR) and PTD-5-NBD (RRQRRTSKLMKRGGTALDWSWLQTE) were synthesized by the peptide synthesis facility (University of Pittsburgh) by the solid-phase procedure on an automated peptide synthesizer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) synthesis protocols. Peptides were N-terminal conjugated to fluorescent probe using 6-carboxyfluorescein (6CF, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene OR) and were subsequently purified and characterized by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The construction of the peptide-eGFP fusion protein has been described previously (53Mi Z. Mai J. Lu X. Robbins P.D. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 339-347Google Scholar). Mouse (BALB/c) pancreatic islets were isolated by intraductal collagenase digestion (Type V, 1.75 mg/ml, Sigma) as described, with modifications (54Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1976; 1: 35-39Google Scholar, 55Alexander A.M. Crawford M. Bertera S. Rudert W.A. Takikawa O. Robbins P.D. Trucco M. Diabetes. 2001; 51: 356-365Google Scholar). For thein situ peptide transduction, prior to collagenase infusion, 200 μl of a solution of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm peptide or 200 μg of PTD-5-eGFP fusion protein (6.25 μm) was injected into the common bile duct followed by 2–3 ml of collagenase infusion. The isolated islets were purified by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were handpicked under a stereomicroscope. In all the experiments, islets of 150–200 μm diameter were used. The purity of the islets was determined by dithizone staining and was >95% in all isolations. Islets were maintained in CMRL-1066 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; complete CMRL) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. In addition, isolated islets were maintained in media containing 200 μm peptide. Human islets were obtained from the islet isolation core of the University of Pittsburgh. Pancreas obtained from cadaveric donors were subjected to digestion, isolation, and purification as described by Ricordi et al. (56Ricordi C. Lacy P.E. Scharp D.W. Diabetes. 1989; 38 Suppl. 1: 140-142Google Scholar), with modifications (57Bottino R. Balamurugan A.N. Bertera S. Pietropaolo M. Trucco M. Piganelli J.D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2561-2567Google Scholar). The purity of islets was usually greater than 75% as determined by dithizone staining. Viability of the cultured islets was usually greater than 80% as assessed by Calcein AM and propidium iodide staining. The isolated islets were cultured in complete CMRL. The construction and propagation of the adenoviral E1/E3-deleted vectors expressing IκB and LacZ from the cytomegalovirus promoter has been described previously (41Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36509-36513Google Scholar). For the Ad-IκB infection experiments, groups of 200 islets were washed in serum-free CMRL-1066 and subsequently infected with adenoviral vectors encoding IκB and β-galactosidase at 100 multiplicity of infection for 1 h at room temperature (55Alexander A.M. Crawford M. Bertera S. Rudert W.A. Takikawa O. Robbins P.D. Trucco M. Diabetes. 2001; 51: 356-365Google Scholar). Following infection, islets were washed 2–3 times with fresh medium and then cultured for 48 h in complete CMRL. To determine the protective effects of NF-κB inhibition in the presence and absence of IL-1β treatment, static glucose-stimulated insulin release was used as a functional assay.In vitro transduced, adenovirus-infected, and control islets were incubated in the presence of 50 units of recombinant mouse IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for a period of 24–30 h prior to insulin release studies. The IL-1β containing medium was then removed and the islets were washed twice in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.35) containing 10 mm HEPES, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and a group of 100 islets in triplicate were conditioned by preincubation for 1 h at 37 °C under low glucose concentrations (2.8 mm). The preincubation buffer was discarded and replaced with Krebs-low glucose buffer for a subsequent 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the Krebs buffer was removed and stored, and the buffer was replaced with Krebs containing high glucose (20 mm) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After 1 h, the high glucose buffer was collected and replaced with Krebs low glucose buffer for a final 1-h incubation. The insulin content of the buffers collected after each incubation step was determined by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ALPCO, Windham, NH). The islets isolated after in situtreatment, with or without PTD-5-NBD, were cultured overnight and then handpicked, washed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, and glucose-stimulated insulin release was determined as described above. To examine the protective effects of NBD peptide from IL-1β exposure on NF-κB activity in vitro, the isolated islets were transduced with NBD peptide for 2 h, and the islets were subsequently treated with 50 units of IL-1β for an additional 2 h. As controls, transduced and nontransduced islets with NBD peptide, with and without IL-1β treatment, were used. All islet groups were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −80 °C until whole cell extracts were prepared. A total of 10 μg of cellular protein from each group was analyzed for p65 binding activity according to the manufacturers instructions, using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based Trans-AMTM NF-κB p65 transcription factor assay kit (ActiveMotif, Carlsbad, CA). The specificity of NF-κB DNA binding activity was confirmed by competition with a wild type or mutant oligonucleotide with an immobilized oligonucleotide probe containing the NF-κB consensus site. NF-κB binding activity was measured at 450 nm and the OD reading normalized to protein content was measured using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Islets isolated with infusion of PTD-5–6CF peptide in situ were dispersed into individual cells by treatment with Hank's based enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 5–10 min and incubated in complete CMRL for 2 h at 37 °C prior to cell sorting. β-Cells were analyzed based on size and endogenous FAD fluorescence as described (6Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Misko T.P. Rodi C.P. McDaniel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C48-C54Google Scholar, 58Pipeleers D.G. In't Veld P.A. Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Google Scholar), using a FACStar flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), with a laser illuminated at 488 nm and with the gated cells having forward scatter monitored at 515–535 nm. Under this selection the majority of the cells gated (>70%) are β-cells (59Nielsen D.A. Lernmark A. Berelowitz M. Bloom G.D. Steiner D.F. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 299-306Google Scholar). In addition, following uptake of biotinylated PTD-5 coupled to streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes Inc.) in β-cells, the human islets also were dissociated into single cells and peptide transduction was measured by flow cytometry as described above. The biotinylated PTD-5 coupled to streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 was prepared as previously described (52Mai J.C. Shen H. Watkins S.C. Cheng T. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30208-30218Google Scholar). Viable cells convert Calcein AM into green fluorescent products and dead cells incorporate propidium iodide in the nucleus, resulting in an intense red fluorescence (60Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Google Scholar). A working phosphate buffer solution containing 1 μg/ml Calcein AM and 10 μg/ml propidium iodide was freshly prepared according to the manufacturer guidelines (Molecular Probes Inc.). Islets were incubated in the presence of the dyes for 30 min at 37 °C prior to evaluation under a fluorescence microscope. Pictures were captured by a two-photon confocal microscope and percent viability was analyzed using MetaMorphTM software package version 4.6r9 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Percentage of viable cell aggregates over the total was determined by scoring greenversus red fluorescence in at least 25–30 islet cell aggregates. All data collected were expressed as mean ± S.E. and statistics were performed using the SPSS package, and a p value of less than 0.05 by analysis of variance was used to indicate statistically significant differences. Earlier studies have demonstrated that PTDs are capable of mediating internalization of heterologous peptides and proteins in a receptor- and energy-independent manner into nearly 100% of a variety of cell types (45Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Google Scholar, 46Joliot A. Pernelle C. Deagostini-Bazin H. Prochiantz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1864-1868Google Scholar, 47Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Google Scholar, 48Hawiger J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 89-94Google Scholar, 49Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Google Scholar). In particular, we have demonstrated that human islets can be transduced with a specific PTD, PTD-5 marker protein complex in culture (53Mi Z. Mai J. Lu X. Robbins P.D. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 339-347Google Scholar). To examine further the transduction efficiency of PTD-5 into isolated islets, mouse and human islets were incubated with fluorescently labeled PTD-5. As shown in Fig. 1, both mouse (B) and human islets (D) were efficiently transduced with PTD-5 compared with controls (A and C). Analysis of transduction of human β-cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 E) demonstrated that the majority of the β-cells within the intact islets, as determined by size and endogenous FAD fluorescence, were transduced with biotinylated PTD-5 linked to streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488. To determine whether transduction with PTD-5 affected islet function, the ability of the treated islets to respond to glucose was determined. As shown in Fig. 1 F, both the PTD-5-treated and control islets produced similar levels of insulin in response to increasing concentrations of glucose. These experiments demonstrate that islets and, in particular, β-cells can be efficiently transduced with cationic peptides in vitro without any apparent impairment of glucose signaling and insulin production. We have previously demonstrated that adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of IκB was able to block IL-1β-mediated islet dysfunction in cultured islets (41Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36509-36513Google Scholar). This result suggests that islet integrity and function, at least in culture, can be preserved by inhibition of NF-κB activity in β-cells. To determine whether peptide-mediated transduction of an NF-κB inhibitor into islets is able to inhibit NF-κB activity, blocking IL-1β-mediated islet dysfunction, a peptide containing PTD-5 fused to the IKKβ peptide inhibitor of IKK kinase (NBD) through a diglycine spacer was synthesized (PTD-5-NBD) and used for islet transduction experiments (39May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Google Scholar). As a positive control for the effects of NF-κB inhibition, the Ad-IκB vector was also used for gene transfer. As shown in Fig. 2, transduction of mouse islets with the PTD-5-NBD fusion peptide was able to prevent IL-1β-induced impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin release by cultured islets. Moreover, the inhibition of IL-1β-mediated islet dysfunction by the fusion peptide was similar to that conferred by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of IκB. Thus, PTD-mediated delivery of an inhibitor of the IκB kinase is effective in blocking the detrimental effects of IL-1β on islet function. To demonstrate that transduction of the NBD peptide inhibited NF-κB activation, analysis of the NF-κB binding activity was performed using a NF-κB p65 transcription factor assay on PTD-5-NBD-transduced islets. As shown in Fig. 3, NF-κB activity was significantly increased in nontransduced islets following treatment with IL-1β. However, in the NBD peptide-treated islets exposed to IL-1β, the NF-κB level was similar to control nontransduced islets. These results demonstrate that transduction of islets with the NBD peptide blocked IL-1β-mediated induction of NF-κB binding activity. We have demonstrated above that PTD-5 is able to efficiently transduce human and mouse islets and that inhibition of NF-κB activity by transduction with the PTD-5-NBD fusion peptide prevents IL-1β-mediated islet dysfunction in culture. However, significant damage to islets occurs during the isolation period, reducing islet viability and function in culture. Thus, it was of significant interest to determine whether islets can be transducedin situ prior to isolation to deliver agents, such as the NBD peptide, that are able to prevent islet dysfunction and apoptosis. To determine whether islets can be transduced in situ, pancreas from BALB/c mice were injected with a PTD-5–6CF peptide as well as with a PTD-5-eGFP fusion protein and an eGFP control protei"
https://openalex.org/W2044606549,"Abstract The arachidonate-regulated, Ca2+-selective ARC channels represent a novel receptor-activated pathway for the entry of Ca2+ in nonexcitable cells that is entirely separate from the widely studied store-operated, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+channels. Activation of ARC channels occurs specifically at the low agonist concentrations typically associated with oscillatory Ca2+ signals and appears to provide the predominant mode of Ca2+ entry under these conditions (Mignen, O., Thompson, J. L., and Shuttleworth, T. J. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35676–35683). In this study we demonstrate that ARC channels are present in a variety of different cell types including both cell lines and primary cells. Examination of their pharmacology revealed that currents through these channels are significantly inhibited by low concentrations (< 5 μm) of Gd3+, are unaffected by 100 μm2-aminoethyoxydiphenyl borane, and are not activated by the diacylglycerol analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (100 μm). Their selectivity for Ca2+ was assessed by determining the EC50 for external Ca2+ block of the monovalent currents observed in the absence of external divalent cations. The value obtained (150 nm) indicates that the Ca2+ selectivity of ARC channels is extremely high. Examination of the ability of various fatty acids, including arachidonic acid, to activate the ARC channels demonstrated that activation does not reflect any nonspecific membrane fluidity or detergent effects, shows a high degree of specificity for arachidonic acid over other fatty acids (especially monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids), and is independent of any arachidonic acid metabolite. Moreover, studies using the charged analogue arachidonyl coenzyme A demonstrate that activation of the ARC channels reflects an action of the fatty acid specifically at the internal face of the plasma membrane. Whether this involves a direct action of arachidonic acid on the channel protein itself or an action on some intermediary molecule is, at present, unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2074374065,"In search of chemical substances applicable for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders, we studied the signal transduction of Dictyosteliumdifferentiation-inducing factors (DIFs) in mammalian cells mainly using HeLa cells. Although DIF-1 and DIF-3 both strongly inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 arrest, DIF-3 was more effective than DIF-1. DIF-3 suppressed cyclin D1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas the overexpression of cyclin D1 overrode DIF-3-induced cell cycle arrest. The DIF-3-induced decrease in the amount of cyclin D1 protein preceded the reduction in the level of cyclin D1 mRNA. The decrease in cyclin D1 protein seemed to be caused by accelerated proteolysis, since it was abrogated byN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, a proteasome inhibitor. DIF-3-induced degradation of cyclin D1 was also prevented by treatment with lithium chloride, an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), suggesting that DIF-3 induced cyclin D1 proteolysis through the activation of GSK-3β. Indeed, DIF-3 dephosphorylated Ser9 and phosphorylated tyrosine on GSK-3β, and it stimulated GSK-3β activity in an in vitro kinase assay. Moreover, DIF-3 was revealed to induce the nuclear translocation of GSK-3β by immunofluorescent microscopy and immunoblotting of subcellular protein fractions. These results suggested that DIF-3 activates GSK-3β to accelerate the proteolysis of cyclin D1 and that this mechanism is involved in the DIF-3-induced G0/G1 arrest in mammalian cells.

Differentiation-inducing factors (DIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: DIF, differentiation-inducing factor; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase 1The abbreviations used are: DIF, differentiation-inducing factor; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase were identified inDictyostelium discoideum as the morphogens required for stalk cell differentiation of Dictyostelium (1Morris H.R. Taylor G.W. Masento M.S. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 811-814Google Scholar). In the DIF family, DIF-1 (1-(3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-hexanone) was the first to be identified, and DIF-3, the monochlorinated analogue of DIF-1, is a natural metabolite of DIF-1 in Dictyostelium(2Morris H.R. Masento M.S. Taylor G.W. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 903-906Google Scholar). However, the actions of DIFs are not limited toDictyostelium. They also have strong effects on mammalian cells. DIF-1 and/or DIF-3 strongly inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation in several leukemia cells, such as the murine erythroleukemia cell line B8, human leukemia cell line K562, and human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 (3Asahi K. Sakurai A. Takahashi N. Kubohara Y. Okamoto K. Tanaka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1036-1039Google Scholar, 4Kubohara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 418-422Google Scholar). DIF-3 has been reported to have the most potent antiproliferative effect on mammalian leukemia cells among DIF analogues examined to date (5Kubohara Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 57-62Google Scholar). Recently, we found that DIF-1 strongly inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation in human vascular smooth muscle cells, indicating that cells sensitive to DIFs are not limited to transformed cells (6Miwa Y. Sasaguri T. Kosaka C. Taba Y. Ishida A. Abumiya T. Kubohara Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 68-75Google Scholar).However, the target molecule (receptor) of DIFs is unknown, and it is not clear even in Dictyostelium how DIFs induce an antiproliferative effect and cell differentiation. DIFs are small hydrophobic molecules and are therefore expected to be able to cross cell membranes without requiring channels or carriers. Also, the rapidity with which DIFs induce prestalk cell-specific gene expression suggests that they directly regulate gene expression. Therefore, the target molecule(s) for DIFs may be located in cytoplasm or nucleus (7Insall R. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3323-3328Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms underlying their antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects are not yet known, we found that DIF-1 induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase by suppressing the expression of cyclin D1 (6Miwa Y. Sasaguri T. Kosaka C. Taba Y. Ishida A. Abumiya T. Kubohara Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 68-75Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 is synthesized early in G1 phase and plays a key role in the initiation and progression of this phase. When cells enter the S phase, cyclin D1 is rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolysis (8Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar).Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the DIF-induced inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. We particularly paid attention to the possible involvement of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), because this serine/threonine protein kinase has been shown to regulate not only cyclin D1 gene transcription by phosphorylating β-catenin but also cyclin D1 proteolysis by directly phosphorylating cyclin D1 itself (9Ferkey D.M. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 471-479Google Scholar, 10Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Google Scholar, 11Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Google Scholar, 12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Google Scholar). Here we show for the first time that DIF-3, which is more effective than DIF-1 in inhibiting cell proliferation, induces the rapid degradation of cyclin D1 and the activation of GSK-3β.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we showed that DIF-3 accelerated the degradation of cyclin D1 by activating GSK-3β mainly using HeLa cells. However, this effect of DIF-3 was also found in other cell species including transformed and normal (untransformed) cells. As an example, we have demonstrated the results obtained in vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, DIF-3 may ubiquitously activate GSK-3β in the wide variety of cell types. Since HeLa cells express human papilloma virus antigens E6 and E7, which inactivate retinoblastoma protein (8Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar), it is not clear whether cyclin D1 is required for their cell cycle progression. However, lithium chloride prevented both the degradation of cyclin D1 and the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by DIF-3. Therefore, cyclin D1 may be required for proliferation, and the disappearance of cyclin D1 may be responsible for the anti-proliferative effect of DIF-3 in HeLa cells. Furthermore, overexpression of cyclin D1 prevented DIF-3-induced cell cycle arrest in untransformed endothelial cells. Taken together, cyclin D1 degradation seemed to be a main mechanism for DIF-3 to induce cell cycle arrest.DIF-3, naturally generated from DIF-1 as its first metabolite, is much weaker than DIF-1 in the ability to induce stalk cell differentiation in Dictyostelium (2Morris H.R. Masento M.S. Taylor G.W. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 903-906Google Scholar). However, in contrast, the antiproliferative effect of DIF-3 was significantly stronger than that of DIF-1 in HeLa cells, consistent with a previous report that DIF-3 is more effective than DIF-1 at inhibiting proliferation in K562 human leukemia cells (5Kubohara Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 57-62Google Scholar). This species difference in the sensitivity to DIFs may be caused by a difference in the nature of the target molecule (such as the affinity for DIFs) between mammalian andDictyostelium cells.We found that DIF-3 not only elevated the activity of GSK-3β but also induced nuclear translocation of the kinase. GSK-3β was initially considered to be a soluble protein expressed in cytoplasm; however, GSK-3β would have no access to nuclear proteins such as cyclin D1 if it resided in cytoplasm. Recent evidence has indicated that GSK-3β in nucleus phosphorylates nuclear proteins, such as cyclin D1 (12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Google Scholar), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (17Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Google Scholar), heat shock factor-1 (18Xavier I.J. Mercier P.A. McLoughlin C.M. Ali A. Woodgett J.R. Ovsenek N. J. Biol.

Indeed, GSK-3β has been identified from the nuclei of cell cycle-arrested NIH-3T3 cells (12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Google Scholar). Therefore, DIF-3 seems to make it possible for GSK-3β to phosphorylate cyclin D1 by translocating GSK-3β into the nucleus.Not only a rapid proteolysis but also a reduction in cyclin D1 mRNA expression was induced by DIF-3, although this latter effect took much longer time. Cyclin D1 gene expression is activated by β-catenin, the degradation of which is also initiated by GSK-3β (22Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of GSK-3β was expected to lead to a reduction in both protein and mRNA levels of cyclin D1 through independent pathways. Our results agreed well with this rationale. The proteolysis and mRNA reduction both seemed to be explained by DIF-3-induced GSK-3β activation.The target molecule for DIFs is still unknown even inDictyostelium. Since DIF-3 activates GSK-3β, a target for DIF-3 may be a protein closely related to the regulation of GSK-3β activity. The activity of GSK-3β is decreased by phosphorylation of Ser9 and increased by phosphorylation of Tyr216(9Ferkey D.M. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 471-479Google Scholar, 10Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Google Scholar, 11Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Google Scholar). We found that DIF-3 decreased the phosphorylation level of Ser9 and increased the phosphorylation level of Tyr216 on GSK-3β. Akt activated by PI3K and p90RSK activated by the MAPK cascade are the candidate molecules to modulate GSK-3β activity by Ser9phosphorylation (16Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Google Scholar). Although DIF-3 did not affect the Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, it strongly induced phosphorylation on Ser380 of p90RSK. However, we were not able to elucidate the role of DIF-3-induced p90RSK activation, since this kinase did not seem to be involved in cyclin D1 degradation induced by DIF-3 (Fig.6 B). DIF-3 also enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation on GSK-3β. Recently, a novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, ZAK-1, has been found to directly activate GSK-3 in Dictyostelium (23Kim L. Liu J. Kimmel A.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 399-408Google Scholar). However, a ZAK-1 counterpart in mammals has not yet been discovered. A target molecule for DIF-3 might be a novel protein kinase or phosphatase controlling GSK-3β activity in mammalian cells. Recently, it has been reported that not only phosphorylation but also distribution regulates GSK-3β activity (21Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Google Scholar). Thus, DIF-3-induced accumulation of GSK-3β in nuclei might have an important role to regulate GSK-3β activity. In addition, if mammalian cells have a target molecule for DIFs as Dictyostelium, one could hypothesize that mammals also produce DIF-like substances to control growth and differentiation.The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, microtubule dynamics, and cell motility. Several mutations have been identified in the components of the Wnt pathway in a variety of malignant tumors. For instance, most human colon cancers have mutations in the APC gene that result in the accumulation of β-catenin (24Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Google Scholar). Mutations in β-catenin, which amplify the accumulation of β-catenin itself, also have been identified in colon cancers (25Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Google Scholar), malignant melanomas (26Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I. Porfiri E. Polakis P. Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Google Scholar), prostate cancers (27Voeller H.J. Truica C.I. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2520-2523Google Scholar), and hepatocellular carcinomas (28Miyoshi Y. Iwao K. Nagasawa Y. Aihara T. Sasaki Y. Imaoka S. Murata M. Shimano T. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2524-2527Google Scholar). β-Catenin accumulated to an abnormal level would produce an excessive amount of cyclin D1 mRNA and promote tumor growth (29Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Google Scholar). Therefore, chemicals that activate GSK-3β, such as DIFs, may be useful for the treatment of several cancers.Recently, it has been reported that proapoptotic stimuli, such as heat shock and staurosporine, activate GSK-3β and induce its accumulation in nucleus (21Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Google Scholar). However, cytotoxic or proapoptotic agents damage not only cancer cells but also normal cells, which would cause severe adverse drug events. Distinct from staurosporine and other proapoptotic agents, DIF-3 did not induce the activation of caspase-3 (data not shown). Therefore, the antiproliferative effect of DIF-3 did not seem to be caused by the induction of apoptosis. DIF-3 is a unique compound that activates GSK-3β but does not induce apoptotic cell death. Differentiation-inducing factors (DIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: DIF, differentiation-inducing factor; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase 1The abbreviations used are: DIF, differentiation-inducing factor; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase were identified inDictyostelium discoideum as the morphogens required for stalk cell differentiation of Dictyostelium (1Morris H.R. Taylor G.W. Masento M.S. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 811-814Google Scholar). In the DIF family, DIF-1 (1-(3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-hexanone) was the first to be identified, and DIF-3, the monochlorinated analogue of DIF-1, is a natural metabolite of DIF-1 in Dictyostelium(2Morris H.R. Masento M.S. Taylor G.W. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 903-906Google Scholar). However, the actions of DIFs are not limited toDictyostelium. They also have strong effects on mammalian cells. DIF-1 and/or DIF-3 strongly inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation in several leukemia cells, such as the murine erythroleukemia cell line B8, human leukemia cell line K562, and human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 (3Asahi K. Sakurai A. Takahashi N. Kubohara Y. Okamoto K. Tanaka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1036-1039Google Scholar, 4Kubohara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 418-422Google Scholar). DIF-3 has been reported to have the most potent antiproliferative effect on mammalian leukemia cells among DIF analogues examined to date (5Kubohara Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 57-62Google Scholar). Recently, we found that DIF-1 strongly inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation in human vascular smooth muscle cells, indicating that cells sensitive to DIFs are not limited to transformed cells (6Miwa Y. Sasaguri T. Kosaka C. Taba Y. Ishida A. Abumiya T. Kubohara Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 68-75Google Scholar). However, the target molecule (receptor) of DIFs is unknown, and it is not clear even in Dictyostelium how DIFs induce an antiproliferative effect and cell differentiation. DIFs are small hydrophobic molecules and are therefore expected to be able to cross cell membranes without requiring channels or carriers. Also, the rapidity with which DIFs induce prestalk cell-specific gene expression suggests that they directly regulate gene expression. Therefore, the target molecule(s) for DIFs may be located in cytoplasm or nucleus (7Insall R. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3323-3328Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms underlying their antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects are not yet known, we found that DIF-1 induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase by suppressing the expression of cyclin D1 (6Miwa Y. Sasaguri T. Kosaka C. Taba Y. Ishida A. Abumiya T. Kubohara Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 68-75Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 is synthesized early in G1 phase and plays a key role in the initiation and progression of this phase. When cells enter the S phase, cyclin D1 is rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolysis (8Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the DIF-induced inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. We particularly paid attention to the possible involvement of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), because this serine/threonine protein kinase has been shown to regulate not only cyclin D1 gene transcription by phosphorylating β-catenin but also cyclin D1 proteolysis by directly phosphorylating cyclin D1 itself (9Ferkey D.M. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 471-479Google Scholar, 10Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Google Scholar, 11Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Google Scholar, 12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Google Scholar). Here we show for the first time that DIF-3, which is more effective than DIF-1 in inhibiting cell proliferation, induces the rapid degradation of cyclin D1 and the activation of GSK-3β. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we showed that DIF-3 accelerated the degradation of cyclin D1 by activating GSK-3β mainly using HeLa cells. However, this effect of DIF-3 was also found in other cell species including transformed and normal (untransformed) cells. As an example, we have demonstrated the results obtained in vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, DIF-3 may ubiquitously activate GSK-3β in the wide variety of cell types. Since HeLa cells express human papilloma virus antigens E6 and E7, which inactivate retinoblastoma protein (8Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar), it is not clear whether cyclin D1 is required for their cell cycle progression. However, lithium chloride prevented both the degradation of cyclin D1 and the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by DIF-3. Therefore, cyclin D1 may be required for proliferation, and the disappearance of cyclin D1 may be responsible for the anti-proliferative effect of DIF-3 in HeLa cells. Furthermore, overexpression of cyclin D1 prevented DIF-3-induced cell cycle arrest in untransformed endothelial cells. Taken together, cyclin D1 degradation seemed to be a main mechanism for DIF-3 to induce cell cycle arrest.DIF-3, naturally generated from DIF-1 as its first metabolite, is much weaker than DIF-1 in the ability to induce stalk cell differentiation in Dictyostelium (2Morris H.R. Masento M.S. Taylor G.W. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 903-906Google Scholar). However, in contrast, the antiproliferative effect of DIF-3 was significantly stronger than that of DIF-1 in HeLa cells, consistent with a previous report that DIF-3 is more effective than DIF-1 at inhibiting proliferation in K562 human leukemia cells (5Kubohara Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 57-62Google Scholar). This species difference in the sensitivity to DIFs may be caused by a difference in the nature of the target molecule (such as the affinity for DIFs) between mammalian andDictyostelium cells.We found that DIF-3 not only elevated the activity of GSK-3β but also induced nuclear translocation of the kinase. GSK-3β was initially considered to be a soluble protein expressed in cytoplasm; however, GSK-3β would have no access to nuclear proteins such as cyclin D1 if it resided in cytoplasm. Recent evidence has indicated that GSK-3β in nucleus phosphorylates nuclear proteins, such as cyclin D1 (12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Google Scholar), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (17Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Google Scholar), heat shock factor-1 (18Xavier I.J. Mercier P.A. McLoughlin C.M. Ali A. Woodgett J.R. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29147-29152Google Scholar), and cAMP-response element-binding protein (19Bullock B.P. Habener J.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3795-3809Google Scholar). Indeed, GSK-3β has been identified from the nuclei of cell cycle-arrested NIH-3T3 cells (12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Google Scholar), cardiomyocytes stimulated with endothelin-1 (20Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 117-130Google Scholar), and heat shock- and staurosporine-treated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (21Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol.

Distinct from staurosporine and other proapoptotic agents, DIF-3 did not induce the activation of caspase-3 (data not shown). Therefore, the antiproliferative effect of DIF-3 did not seem to be caused by the induction of apoptosis. DIF-3 is a unique compound that activates GSK-3β but does not induce apoptotic cell death. We thank Katsuyuki Tamai (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Nagano, Japan) for kindly providing human cyclin D1 cDNA, Hiroki Yoshida (Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University) for technical advice, and Toyama Chemical Co. for synthesizing DIF-3."

Nature. 1991; 350: 121-124Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The active site is located at the C termini of the β strands of the classic TIM barrel fold and is shaped by the loops connecting the β strands to the following α helices. Of special importance for substrate binding are loops 6, 7, and 8, of which loops 6 and 7 undergo conformational changes as the substrate is bound. In the unliganded state, loop 6 interacts with loop 5, whereas in the liganded state, it interacts with the YGGS motif (residues Tyr210-Gly211-Gly212-Ser213) of loop 7. Oη of Tyr210 and Oγ of Ser213are hydrogen-bonded to the main chain nitrogen atoms of Ala178 and Gly175 in loop 6, respectively. N of Gly173 is hydrogen-bonded to one of the phosphate oxygens of the substrate. In the conformational switch from the open to the closed state, the tip of loop 6 (near Gly175) moves 7 Å as a rigid body (2Wierenga R.K. Noble M.E. Postma J.P. Groendijk H. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Opperdoes F.R. Proteins. 1991; 10: 33-49Google Scholar), whereas in loop 7, the peptide planes after Gly211 and Gly212 rotate 90° and 180°, respectively. The rotation of these peptide planes allows for the tight binding of the phosphate moiety and for the conformational switch of the Glu167 side chain (3Kursula I. Partanen S. Lambeir A.M. Antonov D.M. Augustyns K. Wierenga R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5189-5196Google Scholar). The closure of loop 6 has also been studied by NMR (4Williams J.C. McDermott A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8309-8319Google Scholar, 5Rozovsky S. Jogl G. Tong L. McDermott A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 271-280Google Scholar, 6Rozovsky S. McDermott A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 259-270Google Scholar) and molecular dynamics calculations (7Joseph D. Petsko G.A. Karplus M. Science. 1990; 249: 1425-1428Google Scholar, 8Derreumaux P. Schlick T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 72-81Google Scholar). The calculations indicate that the loop starts to open in the region Lys176-Val177 (7Joseph D. Petsko G.A. Karplus M. Science. 1990; 249: 1425-1428Google Scholar) and that this is initiated by the loosening of the hydrogen bond between Gly175 and Ser213 (8Derreumaux P. Schlick T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 72-81Google Scholar). The region 176–178 (Lys-Val-Ala) is also referred to as the C-terminal hinge of loop 6 (9Xiang J. Sun J. Sampson N.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1103-1112Google Scholar). The opening/closing motion of loops 6 and 7 appears to be partially rate-limiting for the catalysis of the reaction in both directions (5Rozovsky S. Jogl G. Tong L. McDermott A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 271-280Google Scholar, 6Rozovsky S. McDermott A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 259-270Google Scholar). It is unclear which structural features are associated with the energy barrier of this conformational switch (8Derreumaux P. Schlick T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 72-81Google Scholar, 10Noble M.E. Zeelen J.P. Wierenga R.K. Proteins. 1993; 16: 311-326Google Scholar, 11Yüksel K.U. Sun A.Q. Gracy R.W. Schnackerz K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5005-5008Google Scholar). The catalytic residues are Glu167, His95, Lys13, as reviewed by Knowles (1Knowles J.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 121-124Google Scholar), and Asn11(3Kursula I. Partanen S. Lambeir A.M. Antonov D.M. Augustyns K. Wierenga R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5189-5196Google Scholar, 12Cui Q. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2284-2290Google Scholar). These residues are in loops 6, 4, 1, and 1, respectively. The catalytic mechanism of TIM has been extensively studied by means of x-ray crystallography, NMR, infrared spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and enzymology, including the use of labeled substrates (1Knowles J.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 121-124Google Scholar). Three planar transition state analogues (see Fig. 1) have been used for experimental studies on the reaction mechanism. In addition, detailed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations of the TIM reaction have been performed recently (13Cui Q. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3093-3124Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of information, no atomic resolution structures of TIM complexed with ligands have been reported, and not all aspects of the reaction mechanism are understood. For example, how does the enzyme environment allow for the proton abstraction by the glutamate. Also, there are two alternative proposals for the intermediate proton transfer steps, the relative importance of which is not clear (12Cui Q. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2284-2290Google Scholar, 14Harris T.K. Cole R.N. Comer F.I. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16828-16838Google Scholar). The reaction is started with the abstraction of the pro-Rproton from the C1 carbon of the substrate, DHAP, by Glu167, leading to a planar enediolate intermediate. In the absence of enzyme, this is energetically a very unfavorable reaction due to the high pK a of the C1 atom of the substrate. In the enzyme environment, several residues contribute to facilitating this step, in particular those residues that stabilize the negative charge on the oxygen atom of the adjacent carbonyl group. These are Nζ of Lys13 and Nε2 of His95 if the substrate is DHAP and Nε2 of His95 and Nδ2 of Asn11 if the substrate is DGAP. Alternative mechanisms have been discussed for the steps following the initial proton abstraction (reviewed in Ref. 12Cui Q. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2284-2290Google Scholar), in particular the “classic” and the “criss-cross” mechanism. In the classic mechanism, the proton abstracted by Glu167 is delivered to the adjacent carbon, unless, in the mean time, exchanged with solvent (15Knowles J.R. Albery W.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1977; 10: 105-111Google Scholar). In the criss-cross mechanism, this proton is transferred to O2 (Fig.1) of the substrate. NMR experiments have indicated that in wild-type TIM, both mechanisms contribute to the reaction (14Harris T.K. Cole R.N. Comer F.I. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16828-16838Google Scholar). The mode of binding of 2-phosphoglycolate (PGA) to TIM has been studied ever since this compound was proposed to be a transition state analogue of the TIM reaction (16Wolfenden R. Nature. 1969; 223: 704-705Google Scholar). 31P NMR studies indicate that PGA binds to TIM as a trianion (17Campbell I.D. Jones R.B. Kiener P.A. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1979; 179: 607-621Google Scholar). It is assumed that the tight binding of PGA is largely due to electrostatic interactions between PGA and the protonated Glu167 and neutral His95 side chains (18Lolis E. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6619-6625Google Scholar). Here, we report on an atomic resolution structure ofLeishmania mexicana TIM complexed with PGA and discuss its implications for the reaction mechanism. For these experiments, the superstable E65Q variant of L. mexicana TIM was used, in which Glu65 has been mutated to Gln. The kinetic properties of this variant and the wild type enzyme are the same (19Kohl L. Callens M. Wierenga R.K. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 331-338Google Scholar, 20Lambeir A.M. Backmann J. Ruiz-Sanz J. Filimonov V. Nielsen J.E. Kursula I. Norledge B.V. Wierenga R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2516-2524Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified and crystallized as described before (3Kursula I. Partanen S. Lambeir A.M. Antonov D.M. Augustyns K. Wierenga R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5189-5196Google Scholar, 19Kohl L. Callens M. Wierenga R.K. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 331-338Google Scholar, 20Lambeir A.M. Backmann J. Ruiz-Sanz J. Filimonov V. Nielsen J.E. Kursula I. Norledge B.V. Wierenga R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2516-2524Google Scholar). The crystals grew at room temperature in less than a week from a mother liquor containing 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 in 0.1 macetic acid/NaOH, pH 4.5, to a size of ∼0.8 × 0.4 × 0.2 mm. The crystals belong to the space group C2, and there is one subunitper asymmetric unit. Two complete sets of diffraction data were collected at beamlines I711, MAX-Lab, Lund, Sweden (to 0.90-Å resolution) and BW7B, EMBL/DESY, Hamburg, Germany (to 0.83-Å resolution) on a MAR345 image plate at 100 K. The crystals were flash-frozen in the cryo stream after a brief soak in a cryoprotectant consisting of the mother liquor supplemented with 23% glycerol and additional 2% polyethylene glycol 6000 for cryo protection. The wavelengths used were 0.9600 and 0.8453 Å on I711 and BW7B, respectively. The data collection was carried out, respectively, in two and three passes for high, medium, and low resolution data from a single crystal. The data were processed and scaled with Denzo and Scalepack (21Otwinovski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The data processing statistics for the 0.83-Å structure are summarized in Table I. Truncate (22Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) was used to calculate the Wilson statistics for the 0.83-Å structure, indicating a Wilson B-factor of 6.9 Å2 (Table I).Table IData collection statistics of the 0.83-Å structureWavelength (Å)0.8453Data collection T (K)100Space groupC2Cell dimensionsa,b,c (Å)100.07, 50.58, 58.88α,β,γ (°)90.00, 118.09, 90.00Mosaicity (°)0.5WilsonB-factor (Å2)6.9Resolution range (Å)25–0.83 (0.84–0.83)Number of unique reflections241,678 (11,796)Redundancy4.3Completeness (%)99.3 (97.2)I/ςI33.9 (3.0)R merge (%)2.9 (39.4)Values in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.

Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar). For the 0.90-Å structure, the previously solved 2-Å structure of the E65Q variant ofL. mexicana TIM (1IF2 (3Kursula I. Partanen S. Lambeir A.M. Antonov D.M. Augustyns K. Wierenga R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5189-5196Google Scholar)) was used as the search model. The structure was refined first with Refmac (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 55: 247-255Google Scholar) using isotropicB-factors and in the later stages anisotropically using SHELX97 (25Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Google Scholar) to R and R free values of 0.1205 and 0.1385, respectively. The resulting model was used as the initial model for the refinement of the 0.83-Å structure. The refinement of the 0.83-Å structure was carried out using SHELX97 (25Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Google Scholar) adding the high resolution data gradually as the refinement proceeded. At this stage, the default geometric restraints and weighting scheme were used. Model building was done with O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). A test set of 2% of all reflections was used to calculateR free. During the first six cycles, the model was refined isotropically. At this stage, water molecules were added to the structure, but other solvent molecules or disordered residues were not modeled. The following cycles of refinement were done anisotropically, and a detailed description of the model with disordered side chains and solvent was built. Most hydrogens were clearly visible in the F o − F cmaps after moving to anisotropic refinement, as can be seen for example in Fig. 8, and were added to the model at the 16th cycle of refinement. For the last cycles, the geometric restraints were released for the protein part and removed for PGA. The refinement was continued until the highest peaks in the F o − F cmap were below 0.5 e−/Å3; the r.m.s.d. of the final F o − F c map is 0.07 e−/Å3. At this stage, the highest peaks were due to disordered solvent or side-chain atoms not located close to the active site. The final crystallographic R andR free values were 0.0949 and 0.1085, respectively. The final statistics of the resulting model are presented in Table II. The programs O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y.

Altogether, 42 of the 250 residues have been built in more than one conformation. Nevertheless, some of the solvent-exposed side chains had to be considered as highly disordered with no preferred conformations. Those side chains have been included in the model as one or two conformations, depending on the electron density, but sometimes there was residual electron density in the surroundings that could not be explained by the model. Mostly, the alternative conformations occur in the side chains, but in a few cases, also the main chain is disordered. For example, the tip of the flexible loop 6 (residue Gly175) has two distinct conformations. In the major conformation (60% occupancy), the peptide proton of N(Gly175) points to Oγ of Ser213, providing a reasonable hydrogen-bonding interaction (Oγ(Ser213)-N(Gly175) distance is 3.29 Å). In the minor conformation, this interaction is weakened and Gly175 is unfavorably close to Oγ of Ser213; for instance, the distance Cα(Gly175)-Oγ(Ser213) is 3.21 Å. This disorder seems to reflect the intrinsic loop-opening properties of loop 6, which is also visualized by the anisotropic B-factors of residues adjacent to Gly175 (Thr174 and Lys176) (Fig. 2). In the active site, PGA is bound in two conformations (Fig.3). In both of them, the O11 atom of PGA is hydrogen-bonded to Oε2 of Glu167. In the predominant conformation (70% occupancy), O12 of PGA is at a hydrogen-bonding distance to Nζ of Lys13 and Nε2 of His95, whereas in the minor conformation (30% occupancy), it points further down and is weakly hydrogen-bonded to Nε2 of Asn11 (Fig.3). In the predominant conformation, the Nε2(Asn11)-O12(PGA) distance is 4.17 Å, whereas in the minor conformation this distance is 3.22 Å. The difference between the two conformations concerns a rotation about the C1–C2 bond of PGA. The torsion angle O1P–C2–C1–O12 is −35° for the major conformation and 0° for the minor conformation. The Glu167 side chain is also 2-fold-disordered. The disorder concerns the position of Oε1, whereas Oε2 adopts always the same position, being hydrogen-bonded to O11 of PGA. The structural disorder of the carboxylate moieties of PGA and the Glu167 side chain appears not to be a concerted motion, instead, the active-site geometry (Fig. 3) suggests that these two groups move independently of each other, while keeping the O11(PGA)-Oε2(Glu167) hydrogen bond intact. In the major conformation of Glu167 (80% occupancy, χ1 = −52, χ2 = −169, χ3 = −66), the Oε1 atom points to Sγ of Cys126 at a distance of 4.12 Å, whereas in the minor conformation (χ1 = −50, χ2 = −161, χ3 = −53), Oε1 is rotated away from Sγ of Cys126 at a distance of 4.69 Å. This structural disorder appears to be correlated with heterogeneity of Sγ of Cys126, because there exists a minor conformation in which this atom is rotated into the space created by the rotation of Oε1 of Glu167. In both Glu167 side-chain conformations, the Oε1 atom is within a hydrogen-bonding distance from O11 of PGA as well as Wat28(Fig. 3). This water is the first water of a network between Glu167 and bulk solvent. It consists of waters 28, 114, 38A, and 58. Wat58 is also hydrogen-bonded to Oγ of Ser96 (Fig. 3). There also exists an alternative arrangement for this network, consisting of waters 28, 114, 38B, 107, and 58. The large amount of data at this high resolution allowed for expanding the description of the model to anisotropic displacement parameters. The anisotropic description was applied to all atoms, including solvent molecules, which caused a significant drop in both R and R free. As seen in other structures at atomic resolution, none of the atoms agree with the traditional isotropic description. As examined by PARVATI (28Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1109-1117Google Scholar) and Rastep (30Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Google Scholar), the mean anisotropy of all protein atoms in the structure is 0.53 (with a ς of 0.1) deviating significantly from the value 1, which means perfect isotropy. The anisotropy value refers to the ratio of the shortest and longest principal axis of the thermal ellipsoid describing the anisotropic scattering properties of an atom (28Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1109-1117Google Scholar). The mean isotropic B of the protein atoms is 11.8 Å2. In this crystal form, the dimer 2-fold axis coincides with a crystallographic axis, and consequently, the molecular center is on this 2-fold axis. The analysis of the mean anisotropy of the protein atoms of the dimer as a function of the distance from the dimer center shows the least anisotropy at the center (with a mean anisotropy of 0.9), which increases smoothly to a mean anisotropy of 0.3 at the extremities (25 Å away from the center). A more detailed analysis of the variation of the anisotropy along the polypeptide chain is shown in Fig. 4. Consistently, very low anisotropy is seen at the C termini of the β strands. This correlates with the low isotropic B-factors of these regions. The regions with the highest anisotropy are in the TIM-barrel framework α helices, in particular at their C termini. In the active site, the side chain of His95 shows significant anisotropic behavior with an anisotropy value of 0.47 for Nε2. This anisotropic movement occurs in the plane of the imidazole ring (Fig. 5). The side chains of Lys13 and Asn11 are less anisotropic with anisotropy values of 0.63 for Nζ of Lys13 and 0.62 for Nδ2 of Asn11. Glu167, which is present in two conformations, displays significant anisotropy in the minor conformation with anisotropy values of 0.59, 0.41, 0.37, and 0.54 for Cγ, Cδ, Oε1, and Oε2, respectively. For the major conformation, the corresponding anisotropy values are 0.66 (Cγ), 0.87 (Cδ), 0.50 (Oε1), and 0.43 (Oε2). The mean anisotropy of PGA is 0.47 and 0.43 for the major and minor conformation, respectively. It is interesting to note the relatively high anisotropy of PGA and the side chain of the catalytic glutamate, despite the fact that the main chain regions defining the active site have relatively low anisotropy as well as low isotropic B-factors (Fig. 4). For example, the anisotropy of the Cα atoms of Lys13, His95, Asn11, and Glu167 are 0.86, 0.77, 0.84, and 0.69, respectively. The anisotropy of the flexible loop 6 has a direction parallel to the loop opening/closure event. The anisotropy is more pronounced at the C-terminal end of the loop, concerning residues Gly173-Ala178 (Fig. 2). The most anisotropic part concerns residues Thr174 and Gly175 when only the main chain atoms are considered, whereas the side chain of Lys176 has one of the highest anisotropy values in the whole structure (0.10 for the Cβ atom). Fig. 6highlights important hydrogen bonding interactions in the active site, in particular the hydrogen bonds of the major conformations of PGA and the Glu167 side chain. The phosphate moiety is hydrogen-bonded to main chain N atoms from loops 6, 7, and 8 (Fig. 3), whereas the triose moiety forms hydrogen bonds to side-chain atoms, in particular Lys13, His95, and Glu167(Fig. 3). The phosphate moiety is also hydrogen-bonded via four water molecules to the protein: via Wat44 to Lys13and via Wat186, Wat8, and Wat1 to loops 7 and 8. Wat1 is a buried water molecule, not part of a hydrogen bonding network to bulk solvent. Wat1 is buried between the ligand and protein and hydrogen-bonded to N of Gly212, O2P of PGA, and O of Leu232. It is at 3.69 Å distance from C2 of PGA. The side chains of Lys13 and His95 are well hydrogen-bonded to the bulk of the protein. Nζ of Lys13is tightly fixed to its position by three hydrogen bonds to Oε1 of Glu97, O2 of PGA, and Wat45. Nε2 of His95 is hydrogen-bonded to O12 of PGA (2.74 Å), whereas the side-chain position of His95 is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Nδ1 and N of Glu97 (2.96 Å). The Glu167 side chain is only weakly interacting with the rest of the protein. The Glu167 side-chain carboxylate oxygen atoms span the region between Cα of Gly211 (at 3.39 Å from Oε2), O of Leu232 (at 3.60 Å from Oε2) and Sγ of Cys126 (at 4.12 Å from Oε1). The hydrogen atom on Sγ of Cys126 points toward the main-chain oxygens of 124 and 93 (Figs. 6 and 7), as is also confirmed by the residual positive density in the F o− F c map; therefore, the Oε2(Glu167)-Sγ(Cys126) is a van der Waals contact. Oε1 is at a distance of 3.29 Å from Nε2 of His95, but the geometry does not allow for a good hydrogen bond (Fig. 3). Two other fully conserved side chains (Ile172 in loop 6 and Leu232 at the beginning of loop 8) also contact the Glu167 carboxylate group (Fig.7). None of these contacting protein atoms allow for good hydrogen bonding. A good hydrogen bond is observed with Wat28 (Figs.3 and 7). This hydrogen bond exists in both the major and the minor conformation of the Glu167 side chain with distances of 2.71 and 2.80 Å. In both the major and the minor conformation, there exists a short (2.61/2.55 Å) hydrogen bond between Oε2 of Glu167 and O11 of PGA. The Cδ–Oε2 and Cδ–Oε1 bond distances in Glu167 are 1.26 and 1.19 Å, respectively, whereas the C1–O11 and C1–O12 bond distances are 1.22 and 1.19 Å, respectively. These distances are in the range of the C–O bond distances of the carboxyl moiety of the fully protonated crystal structure of PGA (33Lis T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1993; 49: 696-705Google Scholar), which are 1.23 Å for the C=O double bond and 1.31 Å for the C–OH single bond. In the trianionic species of PGA, the C–O distances of the carboxylate group are 1.24 and 1.26 Å (33Lis T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1993; 49: 696-705Google Scholar). The active site is at the dimer interface, and the well-defined conformations of Asn11 and Lys13 are stabilized due to the tight interactions with loop 3 of the second subunit; for example, Thr75 at the tip of this loop is hydrogen-bonded to Nδ2 of Asn11 and Oε2 of Glu97, which forms a salt bridge to Nζ of Lys13 (Figs. 6 and 7). Analysis of the B-factors (Fig. 4) shows that the tip of this loop is very rigid (B CαGly76 = 5.4 Å2) and the anisotropy is very low (A CαGly76 = 0.82). The reaction catalyzed by TIM is conceptually rather simple, because it only concerns shuttling of protons (Fig. 1). The active site can be seen to consist of two parts: a binding pocket for the phosphate moiety and a catalytic site for the binding of the triose moiety. During the catalytic cycle, the phosphate group of the substrate has to be held in plane with respect to the rest of the molecule to avoid phosphate elimination (18Lolis E. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6619-6625Google Scholar). Therefore, mechanistically, the reaction becomes complicated, also because C–H bonds are very stable (34Morrison R.T. Boyd R.N. Organic Chemistry. 2nd. Ed. Allyn and Bacon Inc., Boston, MA1966: 46Google Scholar, 35Matthews C.K. van Holde K.E. Ahern K.G. Biochemistry. 3rd. Ed. Benjamin/Cummins, San Francisco, CA2000: 27Google Scholar). For example, the pK a value of methane is estimated to be 40 (36). Consequently, under physiological conditions, a deprotonated carbon atom is very unstable. If the resulting carbanion is stabilized, for example in the presence of an adjacent carbonyl function, then the pK a is much lower, near 20 (37). This is still considerably different from the pK a of a glutamate side chain, which is known to extract the proton from DHAP in the first step of the TIM reaction (1Knowles J.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 121-124Google Scholar, 15Knowles J.R. Albery W.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1977; 10: 105-111Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the active-site geometry of TIM allows for efficient proton shuttling. The active site is located at the C termini of the TIM-barrel β strands and in fact, residues from each of the strands (or subsequent loops) contribute to the active site (Fig. 7). Thr75 from loop 3 of the opposing monomer is hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Asn11 and Glu97, thus providing essential stabilizing interactions. In the atomic resolution structure of the current study, the active site of TIM is complexed with the transition state analogue PGA. It is observed that the triose moiety of PGA occurs in two conformations, whereas the phosphate moiety is bound in a well-defined single conformation. The P–O1P (O1P is bond"

Our laboratory has been interested in the identification of additional protein components that are involved in the formation of the pol δ replication complex. In this study we report the identification of two novel proteins, PDIP38 and PDIP46, that interact with the p50 subunit of pol δ by the use of the yeast two-hybrid (15Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar,16Hollenberg S.M. Sternganz R. Chang P.-F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell.

PDIP38 was shown to be a PCNA-binding protein, and its interaction with pol δ was established by additional experiments.DISCUSSIONThe motivation for these studies was to identify novel proteins that interact with pol δ using the yeast two-hybrid system. pol δ, rigorously isolated from mammalian tissues, has been shown to consist of a tightly associated heterodimer of the p125 and p50 subunits. Two less tightly associated subunits, p68 and p12, have recently been identified as homologues of the so-called third and fourth subunits inS. pombe (11Zhang P. Mo J. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L.

In S. cerevisiae, evidence for the presence of the third subunit has been obtained, but so far a homologue of the S. pombe fourth subunit (10Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) has not been identified. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human cDNA library using the p125 and p50 subunits was carried out. Our yeast two-hybrid screening using p50 as the bait revealed three positives. Two of these were proteins of unknown function, and the third was identified as p21.Obviously, protein-protein interactions revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system do not necessarily indicate that the native (non-fusion) proteins are capable of interaction, nor do they provide any evidence that such interactions take place in a cellular context. In these studies, we have further characterized the interaction of PDIP38 with the p50 subunit of pol δ.The ability of PDIP38 to interact with p50 and also with PCNA was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Pull-down experiments using bacterially expressed p50 and PCNA established that the interactions were direct. These experiments were important for the validation of the coimmunoprecipitation experiments from cell extracts. The coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PDIP38 interacts with the pol δ complex in cell extracts, in that we could show the coimmunoprecipitation of p125 as well as p50. The results indicate that PDIP38 is able to bind to p50 when the latter is in association with p125. More significantly, an association of PDIP38 with pol δ activity during immunoaffinity chromatography was established. An association of PDIP38 with pol δ was also demonstrated by native gel electrophoresis of 293 cell lysates. These studies strongly support the view that the interaction of PDIP38 with the pol δ complex is physiological, i.e. that this interaction takes place in a cellular context and is likely to play some physiological relevant function. The issues of whether it is an accessory protein for pol δ or could be considered to be a subunit of pol δ is currently under investigation.Whereas the functions of PDIP38 are still unknown, our studies have shown that it possesses one property that is of relevance to the functions of pol δ, viz. the ability to bind to PCNA. PCNA has been shown to bind a number of proteins through a short peptide motif (18Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Gulbis J.M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Burgers P.M.J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Lee, unpublished observations. In this respect, the properties of PDIP38 parallel those of the third subunit of pol δ. This similarity raises a possibility that PDIP38 might be able to substitute p68 to form a variant pol δ holoenzyme. This is an intriguing consideration, bearing in mind that pol δ can be regarded as taking part in a number of cellular functions that include (a) synthesis at the leading strand, (b) synthesis at the lagging strand, and (c) DNA repair and recombination processes. Each of these processes may require a specific and likely different assembly of proteins surrounding the pol δ core heterodimer. This issue is also important in considerations of attempts to isolate a pol δ replication complex from tissues or cells, because there may exist different multiprotein complexes involving pol δ. Further studies using the isolated PDIP38 protein are currently underway to determine its ability to interact with the purified pol δ complex and to assess its functional effects on pol δ activity.Although the functions of PDIP38 are at this point unknown, a protein that binds to both p50 and PCNA could serve as a structural role to strengthen the interaction of the pol δ heterodimer with PCNA by binding to pol δ and PCNA, as already noted for p68 (14Liu L. Mo J. Rodriquez-Belmonte E.M. Lee Marietta Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18739-18744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This possibility is consistent with studies of S. pombe Cdc27, where the three-subunit enzyme in which Cdc27 is absent was found to bind much less strongly to PCNA than did the four-subunit pol δ (31Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Given the trivalent nature of PCNA, there is also the possibility that PDIP38 could serve as a bridging protein between two pol δ-PCNA complexes. This could be envisioned as a linking of two pol δ-PCNA assemblies via PDIP38 in which it is attached to one assembly via PCNA and to the other via p50.Data base analysis showed that PDIP38 has a striking conservation between the C-terminal 111 residues with the bacterial APAG proteins. A similar conservation has been found for one other mammalian protein, the F box A protein (22Ilyin G.P. Rialland M. Pigeon C. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Genomics. 2000; 67: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We suggest this conserved region in PDIP38 be called the APAG domain. The conservation of the APAG domain across a wide evolutionary range argues that it is likely to have some significant biological function. The functions of the APAG protein or of the members of the family (Fig. 3) that includes PDIP38 are unknown. The presence of the highly conserved GXGXXG motif suggests the presence of a pyrophosphate-binding domain,i.e. that they may be able to bind either pyrophosphate or nucleotide triphosphates (27Aravind L.

The FBA protein contains an F box at its N terminus (residues 9–58). The latter motif provides the family of F box proteins with the ability to bind to the core of the ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, Skp1-cullin-F box protein (33Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M61-M70PubMed Google Scholar). The F box proteins bind to specific substrates, which are thereby targeted for intracellular degradation via the proteosome. The presence of an APAG domain in the F box A protein would suggest that it may be a protein interaction domain; however, the target of the F box A protein is currently unknown.The current work establishes that p50 interacts with PDIP38, and it is noteworthy that p50 has also been reported to interact with a protein termed p36 also known as PDIP1 (polymerase δ interacting protein 1) and the Werner helicase (34He H.

This suggests that p50 may serve as a nexus or scaffold for the interaction of other subunits or accessory proteins with pol δ.In summary, we have identified two novel proteins, PDIP38 and PDIP46, that interact with the p50 subunit of pol δ. The interaction of PDIP38 with p50 was extensively characterized, and although its functions are currently unknown, these findings indicate that the number of proteins that may be involved in the formation of the pol δ enzyme complex may involve additional proteins besides the four known subunits.

Our laboratory has been interested in the identification of additional protein components that are involved in the formation of the pol δ replication complex. In this study we report the identification of two novel proteins, PDIP38 and PDIP46, that interact with the p50 subunit of pol δ by the use of the yeast two-hybrid (15Fields S. Song O.

PDIP38 was shown to be a PCNA-binding protein, and its interaction with pol δ was established by additional experiments. DISCUSSIONThe motivation for these studies was to identify novel proteins that interact with pol δ using the yeast two-hybrid system. pol δ, rigorously isolated from mammalian tissues, has been shown to consist of a tightly associated heterodimer of the p125 and p50 subunits. Two less tightly associated subunits, p68 and p12, have recently been identified as homologues of the so-called third and fourth subunits inS. pombe (11Zhang P. Mo J. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L.

In S. cerevisiae, evidence for the presence of the third subunit has been obtained, but so far a homologue of the S. pombe fourth subunit (10Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) has not been identified. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human cDNA library using the p125 and p50 subunits was carried out. Our yeast two-hybrid screening using p50 as the bait revealed three positives. Two of these were proteins of unknown function, and the third was identified as p21.Obviously, protein-protein interactions revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system do not necessarily indicate that the native (non-fusion) proteins are capable of interaction, nor do they provide any evidence that such interactions take place in a cellular context. In these studies, we have further characterized the interaction of PDIP38 with the p50 subunit of pol δ.The ability of PDIP38 to interact with p50 and also with PCNA was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Pull-down experiments using bacterially expressed p50 and PCNA established that the interactions were direct. These experiments were important for the validation of the coimmunoprecipitation experiments from cell extracts. The coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PDIP38 interacts with the pol δ complex in cell extracts, in that we could show the coimmunoprecipitation of p125 as well as p50. The results indicate that PDIP38 is able to bind to p50 when the latter is in association with p125. More significantly, an association of PDIP38 with pol δ activity during immunoaffinity chromatography was established. An association of PDIP38 with pol δ was also demonstrated by native gel electrophoresis of 293 cell lysates. These studies strongly support the view that the interaction of PDIP38 with the pol δ complex is physiological, i.e. that this interaction takes place in a cellular context and is likely to play some physiological relevant function. The issues of whether it is an accessory protein for pol δ or could be considered to be a subunit of pol δ is currently under investigation.Whereas the functions of PDIP38 are still unknown, our studies have shown that it possesses one property that is of relevance to the functions of pol δ, viz. the ability to bind to PCNA. PCNA has been shown to bind a number of proteins through a short peptide motif (18Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Gulbis J.M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Burgers P.M.J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

FVIII is a heterodimeric multidomain protein that consists of a heavy chain (domains A1, a1, A2, a2, and B) and a light chain (domains a3, A3, C1, and C2). Both chains contribute to high-affinity interaction with LRP. One LRP-interactive region has previously been located in the C2 domain, but its affinity is low in comparison with that of the entire FVIII light chain. We now have compared a variety of FVIII light chain derivatives with the light chain of its homolog FVa for LRP binding. In surface plasmon resonance studies employing LRP cluster II, the FVa and FVIII light chains proved different in that only FVIII displayed high-affinity binding. Because the FVIII a3-A3-C1 fragment was effective in associating with LRP, this region was explored for structural elements that are exposed but not conserved in FV. Competition studies using synthetic peptides suggested that LRP binding involves the FVIII-specific region Lys1804–Ala1834 in the A3 domain. In line with this observation, LRP binding was inhibited by a recombinant antibody fragment that specifically binds to the FVIII sequence Glu1811–Lys1818. The role of this sequence in LRP binding was further tested using a FVIII/FV chimera in which sequence Glu1811–Lys1818 was replaced with the corresponding sequence of FV. Although this chimera still displayed residual binding to LRP cluster II, its affinity was reduced. This suggests that multiple sites in FVIII contribute to high-affinity LRP binding, one of which is the FVIII A3 domain region Glu1811–Lys1818. This suggests that LRP binding to the FVIII A3 domain involves the same structural elements that also contribute to the assembly of FVIII with FIXa.

The B domain and the acidic region that borders the A3 domain are then removed from the molecule (10Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Google Scholar). The α-chain contains four clusters of a varying number of complement-type repeats that mediate the binding of many structurally and functionally unrelated ligands (25Moestrup S.K. Hotlet T.L.

Both the A2 domain region Arg484–Phe509and a so far unidentified region within the light chain are involved in the high-affinity interaction with LRP (18Lenting P.J. Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M.M.

Previously, we showed that an anti-C2 domain antibody inhibits high-affinity binding of the FVIII light chain to LRP, suggesting a major role for the C2 domain in the interaction (18Lenting P.J.

However, the isolated recombinant C2 domain demonstrates low-affinity binding to LRP compared with the intact FVIII light chain (18Lenting P.J. Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M.M. Clijsters P.P.F.M.

In the present study, we investigated the apparently paradoxical role of the C2 domain in the interaction of the FVIII light chain with LRP. To this end, the interaction between the FVIII light chain and LRP is addressed using purified recombinant FVIII light chain fragments, synthetic peptides, recombinant antibody fragments, and a chimeric FVIII light chain variant. This approach allowed us to identify the FVIII light chain region Glu1811–Lys1818 as a sequence that contributes to the interaction with LRP.

Microtiter plates (Maxisorp), cell culture flasks, Opti-MEM I medium, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen (Breda, The Netherlands). Grace's insect medium, Insect-XPRESS medium, and fetal calf serum were purchased from BioWhittaker (Alkmaar, The Netherlands). Plasma-derived FVIII light chain and its FXa-cleaved derivative were prepared as described previously (28Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol.

Single-chain variable domain antibody fragments (scFv fragments) directed against the light chain of FVIII were expressed in Escherichia coli strain TG1 and purified by metal chelate chromatography (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) as described previously (31van den Brink E.N.

The anti-FVa light chain monoclonal antibody CLB-FV5 was obtained by standard hybridoma techniques and will be described in detail elsewhere. 2M. H. A. Bos, D. W. E. Meijerman, C. van der Zwaan, and K. Mertens, manuscript in preparation. Synthetic peptides encompassing human FVIII regions Trp1707–Arg1721 (WDYGMSSSPHVLRNR), Lys1804–Lys1818 (KNFVKPNETKTYFWK), Tyr1815–Ala1834 (YFWKVQHHMAPTKDEFDCKA), His1822–Ala1834 (HMAPTKDEFDCKA), Thr1892–Ala1901 (TENMERNCRA), Glu1908–His1919 (EDPTFKENYRFH), Thr1964–Lys1972 (TVRKKEEYK), Lys2049–Gly2057 (KLARLHYSG), and Asp2108–Gly2117 (DGKKWQTYRG) were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry following the manual “T-bag” method (33Houghton R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Google Scholar) or employing an Applied Biosystems Model 430A instrument (Amersham Biosciences, Roosendaal, The Netherlands; Medprobe AS, Oslo, Norway). Peptides were >95% pure as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis, and their identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Purified placenta-derived LRP (34Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. S. K. Moestrup (University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark). The bacterial vector encoding glutathioneS-transferase-fused receptor-associated protein was kindly provided by Dr. J. Kuiper (Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands). Glutathione S-transferase-fused receptor-associated protein was expressed in E. coli strain DH5α and purified on glutathione-Sepharose as described (35Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Google Scholar). Baby hamster kidney cells expressing recombinant LRP ligand-binding clusters II and IV have been described previously (27Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. H. Pannekoek (Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Human serum albumin (HSA) was from the Division of Products of CLB. Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using HSA as a standard. The plasmid pCLB-BPVdB695, encoding the FVIII B domain deletion variant FVIII-Δ(868–1562), has been described previously (37Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. van Leen R.W. de Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M.P. Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-142Google Scholar) and was used as a template to construct the plasmid coding for the FVIII-(1811–1818)/FV chimera. Oligonucleotide primers derived from the FVIII light chain sequence containing the FVIII/FV codon replacements (see Table II) were employed to construct the plasmids using the overlap extension PCR mutagenesis method (38Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology Current Innovations. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL1994: 71-72Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed to verify the presence of the mutations in the plasmid. Transfection of FVIII-encoding plasmids into murine fibroblasts (C127) cells was performed as described previously (37Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. van Leen R.W. de Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M.P. Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-142Google Scholar). Stable cell lines expressing wild-type FVIII or the FVIII-(1811–1818)/FV chimera were maintained in cell factories in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 0.8 μg/ml deoxycholate. FVIII-containing medium was harvested three times/week. The medium was subsequently filtered to remove cell debris and concentrated ∼10-fold employing a hollow fiber cartridge (Hemoflow F5, Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany). Benzamidine was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and concentrates were stored at −20 °C. FVIII was purified from the concentrated medium by immunoaffinity chromatography employing antibody CLB-CAg117 and Q-Sepharose chromatography according to an established procedure (37Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. van Leen R.W. de Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M.P. Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-142Google Scholar). FVIII light chains were prepared by incubating the purified FVIII-(1811–1818)/FV chimera and wild-type FVIII in buffer containing 40 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mmTris (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, the FVIII-(1811–1818)/FV and wild-type FVIII light chains were purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography. Recombinant proteins were eluted in buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and stored at 4 °C. The construction of the plasmid encoding the recombinant C2 domain (i.e.Ser2173–Tyr2332) has been described previously (16Fijnvandraat K. Celie P.H.N. Turenhout E.A.M. van Mourik J.A. ten Cate J.W. Mertens K. Peters M. Voorberg J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2347-2352Google Scholar). The plasmid pACgp67b-His-a3-A3-C1, encoding the FVIII a3-A3-C1 fragment (i.e. Glu1649–Asn2172), was constructed by PCR employing the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TTACTCGAGGAAATAACTCGTACTACTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AATGCGGCCGCTTCAATTTAAATCACAGCCCAT-3′ (antisense) using pCLB-BPVdB695 as a template (37Mertens K.

The amplified DNA fragment was purified, digested with XhoI and NotI, and ligated into pBluescript. The resulting construct was verified by sequencing. Subsequently, pBluescript-a3-A3-C1 was digested with EspI andNotI, and the obtained fragment was purified and ligated into the EspI/NotI-digested pACgp67b-80K plasmid (39Fijnvandraat K. Turenhout E.A.M. van den Brink E.N. ten Cate J.W. van Mourik J.A. Peters M. Voorberg J. Blood. 1997; 89: 4371-4377Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding a polyhistidine tag (5′-ATTGGATCCGGCCATCATCATCATCATCATGGCGGCAGCCCCCGCAGCTTTCAAAAGCCCGGGGCCATGGGA-3′) was digested with BamHI and NcoI and cloned into the BamHI/NcoI-digested pACgp67b-a3-A3-C1 plasmid. Using the baculovirus expression system, recombinant a3-A3-C1 and C2 fragments were obtained by infection of insect cells as described (16Fijnvandraat K. Celie P.H.N. Turenhout E.A.M. van Mourik J.A. ten Cate J.W. Mertens K. Peters M. Voorberg J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2347-2352Google Scholar). The a3-A3-C1 fragment was purified from Insect-XPRESS medium by immunoaffinity chromatography using the anti-A3 domain antibody CLB-CAgA coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B as an affinity matrix. CLB-CAgA-Sepharose was incubated with medium containing the a3-A3-C1 fragment for 16 h at 4 °C. After binding, the immunoaffinity matrix was collected; washed with buffer containing 1 mNaCl and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4); and eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 55% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 50 mmlysine (pH 11). Elution fractions were immediately neutralized with 1m imidazole (pH 6); dialyzed against 150 mmNaCl, 50% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4); and stored at −20 °C. The recombinant C2 domain was purified employing the same immunoaffinity chromatography technique, except that the anti-C2 domain antibody CLB-CAg117 was used instead of CLB-CAgA.Table IKinetic parameters for binding of the FVIII light chain and its derivatives to immobilized LRPk offk onK ds −1m −1 s −1nmFVIII light chainClass 1(2.8 ± 0.7) × 10−3(1.6 ± 0.3) × 10518 ± 6Class 2(6.9 ± 1.4) × 10−2(1.2 ± 0.2) × 10659 ± 15FXa-cleaved light chainClass 1(3.0 ± 0.3) × 10−3(1.3 ± 0.2) × 10522 ± 4Class 2(5.6 ± 0.7) × 10−2(0.9 ± 0.3) × 10660 ± 23a3-A3-C1 fragmentClass 1(4.1 ± 0.7) × 10−3(1.6 ± 0.4) × 10526 ± 7Class 2(8.0 ± 0.7) × 10−2(1.1 ± 0.3) × 10674 ± 20C2 domain Class 1(1.3 ± 0.1) × 10−1(3.6 ± 1.7) × 1043602 ± 1743Association and dissociation of various concentrations of the FVIII light chain (10–250 nm), the 67-kDa fragment (10–250 nm), the a3-A3-C1 fragment (10–250 nm), or the C2 domain (500–2000 nm) to immobilized LRP (16 fmol/mm2) were assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data obtained were analyzed to calculate association (k on) and dissociation (k off) rate constants using a one- or two-site binding model.

Half-maximum inhibition constants (IC50) represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. Human FV was obtained from human plasma provided by our institute (Sanquin Plasma Products). Full-length FV was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography.2 The FVa light chain was prepared by incubating FV (10 μm) with thrombin (2 μm) in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 37 °C. Thrombin was inactivated by hirudin (Sigma), and the FVa light chain was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on CNBr-Sepharose 4B coupled to the anti-FV light chain monoclonal antibody CLB-FV5 (3 mg/ml). The immunoaffinity matrix was washed with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and eluted with 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 55% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Purified FVa light chain was dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and stored at −20 °C. Recombinant LRP clusters II and IV were expressed in baby hamster kidney cells using Opti-MEM I medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (27Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Google Scholar). After harvesting of the medium, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Purification of LRP clusters II and IV from the conditioned medium was performed by a single purification step using glutathione S-transferase-fused receptor-associated protein coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B as an affinity matrix. The matrix was collected in a column; washed with buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4); and eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmEDTA, and 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Subsequently, purified LRP cluster preparations were concentrated in Centricon 10 concentrators (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) by successive rounds of centrifugation at 4000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, the preparations were dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and stored at 4 °C. Recombinant LRP cluster II or IV (1 pmol/well) was adsorbed onto microtiter wells in 50 mmNaHCO3 (pH 9.8) in a volume of 50 μl for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 2% (w/v) HSA, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) in a volume of 200 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the FVIII light chain was incubated at various concentrations in a volume of 50 μl of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1% (w/v) HSA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 37 °C. After three rapid washes (<5 s each) with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), bound ligand was detected by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody CLB-CAg12 in the same buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. During this latter incubation period, one would expect that the FVIII light chain would completely dissociate from the immobilized LRP clusters. However, subsequent rebinding of the FVIII light chain to the LRP clusters allows the formation of new FVIII·LRP cluster complexes, which can be detected by this sensitive method. In surface plasmon resonance (SPR), this is prevented by a continuous buffer flow. Because of these differences in experimental approach, the solid-phase binding assay is compared only with SPR analysis in a qualitative manner. Antibody CLB-CAg12 did not interfere with binding of FVIII fragments to LRP or its clusters (data not shown). In competition experiments, the FVIII light chain (25 nm) was incubated with wells containing immobilized LRP clusters either in the presence or absence of serial dilutions of competitor in a volume of 50 μl for 2 h at 37 °C. Residual FVIII binding was detected as described above. Data were corrected for binding to empty microtiter wells, which was <5% relative to binding to wells containing immobilized LRP clusters. The kinetics of protein interactions was determined by SPR analysis using a BIAcoreTM 2000 biosensor system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala). LRP (16 fmol/mm2), the FVIII light chain (71 fmol/mm2), the a3-A3-C1 fragment (67 fmol/mm2), the FVa light chain (76 fmol/mm2), or scFv EL14 (67 fmol/mm2) was covalently coupled to the dextran surface of an activated CM5 sensor chip via primary amino groups using the amine coupling kit (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as recommended by the supplier. One control flow channel was routinely activated and blocked in the absence of protein. Association of analyte was assessed in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) for 2 min at a f"

We propose that this approach may be used to produce reliable topology models on a proteome-wide scale. hemagglutinin endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase synthetic medium lacking uracil The topology of a membrane protein, i.e. a specification of its transmembrane segments and their in/out orientation relative to the membrane, is a basic structural characteristic that is a very powerful guide to experimental studies when no three-dimensional structure is available. Most proteins for which experimentally derived topology models exist are from bacteria; only a handful of topologies are known for yeast membrane proteins. As an example, the widely used MPtopo data base (1Jayasinghe S. Hristova K. White S.H. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) currently holds a total of 92 experimentally determined topology models, of which only 3 are for yeast proteins. The preponderance of known topologies for bacterial proteins is mainly a result of the relative ease with which they can be determined experimentally by making series of C-terminal-truncated versions of the target protein fused to topology reporters such as PhoA, LacZ, Bla, or green fluorescent protein (2Manoil C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3Drew D. Sjöstrand D. Nilsson J. Urbig T. Chin C.N. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2690-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This approach often yields clear-cut results, and reliable topology models can be proposed. Although a couple of topology reporters have also been developed for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Sengstag C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), they seem to yield less definitive results than can be obtained in bacterial systems (5Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and have not been much used. We have recently shown that highly reliable topology predictions can be obtained for a subset of membrane proteins for which many different topology prediction methods (five in our case) give the same prediction (6Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). When some limited experimental information (such as the in/out location of the C terminus of a protein) is available, consensus predictions are even more useful, and a combination of C-terminal reporter fusions and consensus predictions has been shown to make it possible to rapidly produce reliable topology models forEscherichia coli inner membrane proteins (3Drew D. Sjöstrand D. Nilsson J. Urbig T. Chin C.N. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2690-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have further shown that this basic approach can be even more widely applied by using the experimentally determined location of the C terminus as a constraint on the topology predictions produced by the TMHMM program (8Käll L. Sonnhammer E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Considering that topology mapping based on reporter fusions to truncated target proteins may be problematic in yeast, it appeared to us that approaches based on a combination of C-terminal fusions to the full-length protein, which should be minimally disruptive to the structure of the proteins, and theoretical topology prediction should be particularly useful for yeast membrane proteins. In this pilot study, we report results for C-terminal reporter fusions to 40 S. cerevisiae membrane proteins. We find that only one of the 40 proteins that we cloned initially cannot be expressed using either of two vectors that we have tried, that the dual Suc2/His4C reporter (9Deak R. Wolf D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10663-10669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) that we have used yields consistent results for 37 of the 39 expressed proteins, and that the location of the C terminus as predicted by our consensus method (6Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) is correct for 31 proteins of these 37. One of the two proteins for which the experimental results are inconsistent is a mitochondrial protein. We have also used the experimentally determined C-terminal locations to constrain the predictions from the TMHMM method, and we report TMHMM reliability scores for all proposed topology models. Our results suggest that large-scale topology mapping strategies where limited but reliable experimental information is combined with topology prediction will be successful in yeast. All plasmids were constructed by homologous recombination (10Oldenburg K.R. Vo K.T. Michaelis S. Paddon C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Plasmid pJK90, 1Kim et al., submitted for publication. which contains theOST4 gene fused to three hemagglutinin (HA)2 epitopes, a part of theSUC2 gene, and the HIS4 gene, was treated withSmaI to linearize the vector between the end of TPI promoter and the start codon of OST4. The 5′-end homologous recombination region was selected to match the 3′-end ofSmaI-digested pJK90, and the 3′-end homologous region was chosen to match the linker between the end of OST4 and the start of the HA sequence. Each homologous region comprised 35 nucleotides, (5′-AGGTGGTTTGTTACGCATGCAAGCTTGATATCGAA-3′ and 5′-GATGGTCTAGAGGTGTAACCACTTGAGTTCTTAGG-3′). A gene of interest was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as a template and two primers, a 5′-end primer complementing the start codon of the gene with the homologous region sequence and a 3′-end primer complementing the end of the gene excluding the stop codon with the homologous region sequence. Genomic DNA was isolated as described (11Breeden L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) from W303–1a (MATa, ade2, can1, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3) and from W303–1α (MATα, ade2, can1, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3).

Transformation was carried out by the lithium acetate protocol (13Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic medium lacking uracil (SD−Ura). Plasmids were isolated and verified by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. Plasmids were named as pJK92 (gene name) using gene names from the Saccharomyces genome data base (14Dwight S.S. Harris M.A. Dolinski K. Ball C.A. Binkley G. Christie K.R. Fisk D.G. Issel-Tarver L. Schroeder M. Sherlock G. Sethuraman A. Weng S. Botstein D. Cherry J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For construction of plasmids with an inducible Gal promoter, the fragment carrying the gene, HA epitope, SUC2, andHIS4C was amplified by PCR using pJK92(YEL059C) or pJK92(YJL028W) as a template. The two primers used in this PCR carried the homologous region sequences with the EcoRI-digested 424GALS (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The PCR product and the linearized 424GALS plasmid were transformed into strain STY50, and transformants were selected on −Trp plates. The correct construction of the plasmid was confirmed by yeast colony PCR. Yeast transformants carrying TPI promoter plasmids were grown to OD600 0.8 to 1 in 10 ml of SD−Ura. Harvested cell pellets were washed with 5 ml of dH2O and left at −20 °C for at least 1 h. Frozen cells were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β -mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.0025% bromphenol blue), incubated at 60 °C for 10 to 15 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microfuge. Soluble fractions were transferred to new tubes and subjected to Endo H digestion. Transformants carrying the GALS promoter were grown to OD600 1 to 2 in 5 ml of −Trp media. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and diluted to 4-fold with −Trp media supplemented with galactose instead of glucose as carbon source and grown for 5 h at 30 °C. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Whole-cell lysates were supplemented with a final concentration of 80 mm potassium acetate, pH 5.6, and 2 μl of Endo H (1 unit/200 μl, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 to 2 h. Mock samples were treated and incubated in the same way but without Endo H. Solublized proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-HA antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA). Transfomants carrying each fusion construct were streaked on SD−Ura medium lacking histidine but containing 6 mm histidinol. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 to 4 days.

The detailed TMHMM outputs corresponding to the predictions given in column 11 are provided as an Electronic Supplement. To select S. cerevisiae membrane proteins for this study, we first searched all predicted open reading frames in the yeast genome (15Goffeau A. Aert R. Agostini-Carbone M. Ahmed A. Aigle M.

Chillingworth T. Christiansen C. Chuat J. Chung E. Churcher C. Churcher C. et al.Nature. 1997; 387 (suppl.): 1-105Google Scholar) for membrane proteins for which five prediction methods (TOPPRED, TMHMM, HMMTOP, MEMSAT, and PHD) all give the same predicted topology. From our previous work (6Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar), we anticipated that the predicted topologies should be correct for a high proportion of these proteins. We further required that the TMHMM method predict at least two transmembrane helices in each protein because currently available bioinformatics tools cannot reliably distinguish between N-terminal signal-anchor sequences and cleavable signal peptides and thus may mistakenly identify secreted proteins as single-spanning, N-terminal anchored membrane proteins. This initial screen produced a list of 55 proteins. Three genes carrying introns (YDR376W, YML052W, YMR292W) were excluded from the original list, as were seven genes annotated as questionable open reading frames (YCL023C, YDR526C, YFL032W, YGL024W, YGL204C, YGR228W, YNL266W). A gene encoding a known mitochondrial protein (Q0275) was excluded because the glycosylation assay cannot be used for mitochondrial proteins. Five additional proteins could not be analyzed. YNL323W was not amplified by PCR, the cloned sequence of YOL137W turned out to be different from the expected sequence, the cloned sequences of YDL196W and YNL101W contained frameshifts relative to the published sequences, and protein expression of YJL028W was not detected. We successfully made and expressed C-terminal reporter fusions to the remaining 39 proteins (Table I). For this study, we chose a 125-kDa dual Suc2/His4C topology reporter (4Sengstag C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to determine the location of a protein's C terminus in either the cytosol or the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (9Deak R. Wolf D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10663-10669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The histidinol dehydrogenase activity of the His4C moiety converts histidinol to histidine only when it is localized in cytosol. Thus, only cells expressing fusion proteins with the reporter domain in the cytosol can grow on histidine-free media supplemented with histidinol. The part of the SUC2 gene that is present in the reporter encodes a segment of invertase containing eight N-glycosylation acceptor sites. When this domain is localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the fusion protein becomes heavily glycosylated. The cytosolic/non-cytosolic location of the C terminus of each of the 39 Suc2/His4C fusion proteins was determined by Endo H treatment (to identify a glycosylated, lumenally oriented reporter) Fig. 1 and growth on histidine-free media containing histidinol (to identify a cytosolically oriented reporter), Fig. 2. We did not observe any general growth defects of the yeast transformants carrying these fusion constructs, indicating that the addition of the reporter domain to the target proteins had no obvious harmful effects.Figure 2Growth of his4cells expressing the 39 fusion proteins analyzed in this study on a medium lacking histidine but including histidinol. Strains that grow well are indicated by underlining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For 35 of the 39 fusion proteins, the results from the glycosylation and histidinol growth assays were entirely consistent (Table I). Some of these proteins are known to be localized to the membranes of secretory organelles and the plasma membrane, but most have no known localization or function annotated in the Saccharomycesgenome data base (14Dwight S.S. Harris M.A. Dolinski K. Ball C.A. Binkley G. Christie K.R. Fisk D.G. Issel-Tarver L. Schroeder M. Sherlock G. Sethuraman A. Weng S. Botstein D. Cherry J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) or in MIPS (23Mewes H.W. Frishman D. Guldener U. Mannhaupt G. Mayer K. Mokrejs M. Morgenstern B. Munsterkotter M. Rudd S. Weil B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Because these 35 fusion proteins were either glycosylated or had histidinol dehydrogenase activity, it is reasonable to assume that their natural locations are in the membranes along the secretory pathway, although we cannot completely rule out that some of the unglycosylated proteins are located in mitochondria with their C terminus facing either the cytosol or the intermembrane space. The initial results from the glycosylation and histidinol growth assays were inconsistent for four proteins. Growth on histidinol was seen for YGR290W, despite the fact it was efficiently glycosylated. A small amount of unglycosylated protein possibly representing molecules where the reporter is cytosolically oriented was evident, however, and given the high level of expression seen for this protein this may be enough to allow growth on histidinol. We thus conclude that YGR290W has its C terminus in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. We further found that YEL059W was not expressed from the constitutive TPI promoter. However, a low level of expression was seen when the inducible Gal promoter was used, Fig. 2. The fusion protein was sensitive to Endo H digestion, indicating that the C terminus of the protein was glycosylated and located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Because YEL059W was only expressed from the inducible Gal promoter, growth on histidinol could not be assayed. Finally, in the case of YKR065C and YER185W, the fusion proteins were expressed, but neither became glycosylated nor allowed growth on histidinol. We considered that a possible explanation for this observation might be that the proteins are localized to mitochondria with their C termini in the matrix space. YKR065C is strongly predicted to have an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide both by TargetP (24Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3560) Google Scholar) and a predictor specifically developed for yeast proteins (25Drawid A. Gerstein M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1059-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, YKR065C has recently been identified as a mitochondrial inner membrane protein with a cleavable, matrix-targeting presequence. 3N. Pfanner, personal communication. The location of YER185W is so far unknown. We also roughly estimated the relative expression levels based on Western blotting with HA antibodies (Table I). It appears that small fusion proteins with few transmembrane helices tend to be better expressed than large proteins, but the correlation is not very strong. As shown in Table I, the consensus predictions for the location of the C termini of the 37 proteins for which this could be deduced from the fusion protein data matched the experimental results in 31 cases (84%). Thus, for six proteins the consensus prediction does not yield a good topology model. As a more direct way of integrating the experimental results into the final predictions, we took advantage of a recent improvement to the TMHMM program that allows predictions to be constrained by experimental information (8Käll L. Sonnhammer E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This new version of TMHMM also calculates a reliability score for each prediction that correlates strongly with prediction accuracy. The TMHMM results with inclusion of the experimentally determined C-terminal location are shown in Table I, together with the corresponding reliability score and the estimated probability that the prediction is correct (the “expected accuracy”). In contrast to the situation for bacterial inner membrane proteins, experimentally derived topology models are available for only a handful of yeast membrane proteins. This lack of data is aggravated by the fact that theoretical topology prediction methods seem to perform less well on yeast membrane proteins than on both bacterial and mammalian ones (8Käll L. Sonnhammer E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 4K. Melén, A. Krogh, and G. von Heijne (2003) J. Mol. Biol., in press. In this study, we have applied and extended a strategy initially proposed for bacterial inner membrane proteins (3Drew D. Sjöstrand D. Nilsson J. Urbig T. Chin C.N. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2690-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) to a set of 39 predicted membrane proteins from the yeast S. cerevisiae. The strategy is based on the premise that reliable topology models can be produced rapidly by combining limited experimental information with topology predictions. The experimental information generated is the cytosolic/non-cytosolic location of the C terminus of the target proteins, and we show that this can be easily and reliably obtained by fusion of the full-length protein to a C-terminal, dual topology reporter (9Deak R. Wolf D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10663-10669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) composed of a hemagglutinin tag for immunodetection, a part of Suc2p that contains eight acceptor sites forN-linked glycosylation, and the His4p enzyme that converts histidinol to histidine. Because N-linked glycosylation can only be carried out in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and histidinol cannot be transported into this compartment, the cytoplasmic/non-cytoplasmic location of the reporter (and thus of the C terminus of the target protein) is easily assayed by checking whether Endo H can digest any N-linked glycans and whetherhis4 cells expressing the target protein-reporter fusion can grow on histidinol-containing media lacking histidine. 38 of the 39 fusion proteins could be expressed from the constitutive TPI promoter in amounts sufficient for analysis; one protein could be expressed only from the inducible Gal4 promoter (which precludes use of the histidinol growth assay). Only one protein that was included in our initial set could not be expressed from either promoter. It thus appears that nearly all membrane proteins in S. cerevisiaecan be analyzed by our procedure. The results from the two topology assays were entirely consistent for 35 of the 39 proteins, and the location of the reporter could be reliably inferred also for 2 of the remaining 4. In only two cases did we fail to observe both glycosylation and growth on histidinol; a possible explanation is that these proteins are not targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum but rather are imported into the mitochondrial inner membrane and have their C termini in the matrix space. In fact, one of the two proteins (YKR065C) has recently been identified as being located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, 5N. Pfanner, personal communication. although its membrane topology is not yet known. When combined with theoretical predictions, the experimentally mapped C-terminal locations allow us to propose what we consider are reliable topology models for 37 yeast proteins for which no such information was previously available. To this end, we have used two approaches. First, all our target proteins were selected from the full set of predicted yeast open reading frames in such a way that five different topology prediction methods all gave the same prediction for each protein. We have previously shown that such consensus predictions are highly reliable for bacterial inner membrane proteins (6Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The experimentally determined C-terminal location was the same as the predicted one for 31 of the 37 proteins, and we thus regard the topology models for these proteins as very likely to be correct. Second, we constrained the TMHMM predictions by fixing the C-terminal end of each protein to the experimentally determined location, because this is known to substantially increase the prediction accuracy (8Käll L. Sonnhammer E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We further calculated a reliability score for each predicted topology, both without and with a fixed C-terminal location, Table I. Because there is an approximately linear relationship between the reliability score and the probability that a particular prediction is correct (8Käll L. Sonnhammer E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), such probability values (expected accuracy) were also calculated. Most of the 37 proteins have high scores compared with the score distribution calculated for all predicted S. cerevisiae membrane proteins (8Käll L. Sonnhammer E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This was expected, because the proteins in our set were selected based on the requirement that five different topology prediction methods should all give the same predicted topology. We also note that the changes in the reliability score for the 37 proteins seen after the inclusion of the experimentally determined C-terminal location in the prediction have a distribution that is very similar to the one derived for the much larger set of bacterial inner membrane proteins analyzed previously (8Käll L. Sonnhammer E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (data not shown). It is interesting to compare the 37 proteins studied here with TMHMM predictions for the whole S. cerevisiae membrane proteome (16Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8739) Google Scholar). The overall distribution of proteins with different numbers of transmembrane helices is roughly the same for the set of 37 proteins and the whole proteome, with peaks at 2 helices and 10–12 helices. Proteins with an even number of predicted transmembrane helices are 1.8-fold more numerous than proteins with an odd number of helices among the 37 proteins and are 1.7-fold more numerous in the whole proteome (excluding the single-spanning proteins). There are 1.8 times more proteins with Cin as compared with Coutorientation in our set (1.7 times more in the whole proteome) and 4.3 times more proteins that are predicted to have Nin as compared with Nout orientation in our set (1.6 times more in the whole proteome). The proteins analyzed here thus seem to represent a rough cross-section of the whole proteome, except that their topologies are easier to predict and have higher TMHMM reliability scores than the proteome as a whole. In summary, we have shown that reliable topology models for S. cerevisiae membrane proteins can be produced on a reasonably large scale by a combination of C-terminal reporter fusion analysis and theoretical prediction. This approach not only reduces the experimental efforts required but also avoids the pitfalls inherent to fusions between a truncated target protein and topology reporters.

To clarify this hypothesis, we have characterized the binding activity of LF to HCV E2 envelope protein and have endeavored to determine which region(s) of LF are important for this binding activity. Several regions of human LF have been expressed and purified as thioredoxin-fused proteins in Escherichia coli. Far-Western blot analysis using these LF fragments and the E2 protein, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, revealed that the 93 carboxyl amino acids of LF specifically bound to the E2 protein. The 93 carboxyl amino acids of LFs derived from bovine and horse cells also possessed similar binding activity to the E2 protein. In addition, the amino acid sequences of these carboxyl regions appeared to show partial homology to CD81, a candidate receptor for HCV, and the binding activity of these carboxyl regions was also comparable with that of CD81. Further deletion analysis identified 33 amino acid residues as the minimum binding site in the carboxyl region of LF, and the binding specificity of these 33 amino acids was also confirmed by using 33 maltose-binding protein-fused amino acids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the 33 maltose-binding protein-fused amino acids prevented HCV infection in cultured human hepatocytes. In addition, the site-directed mutagenesis to an Ala residue in both terminal residues of the 33 amino acids revealed that Cys at amino acid 628 was determined to be critical for binding to the E2 protein. These results led us to consider the development of an effective anti-HCV peptide.

HCV is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA (9.6 kb) virus belonging to the Flaviviridae (5Kato N. Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M. Ohkoshi S. Sugimura T. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The HCV genome encodes a large polyprotein precursor of about 3,000 amino acid (aa) residues, which is cleaved by the host and viral proteases to generate at least ten proteins: the core, E1 (envelope 1), E2, p7, NS2 (nonstructural protein 2), NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (8Hijikata M.

The most characteristic feature of the HCV genome is its remarkable sequence heterogeneities and variations, and to date at least six major HCV genotypes, which have been further grouped into more than 50 subtypes, have been identified (13Bukh J. Miller R.H. Purcell R.H. Semin. Liver Dis. 1995; 15: 41-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 14Simmonds P. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 570-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Purcell R.

The genetic complexity of HCV is thus a major hindrance to the development of the vaccines. To date, interferon has been the sole effective antiviral reagent used in the clinical therapy of hepatitis C, but its effectiveness is limited to about 30% of the reported cases (17Shiratori Y. Kato N. Yokosuka O. Imazeki F. Hashimoto E. Hayashi N. Nakamura A. Asada M. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Arakawa Y. Omata M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 558-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Combined treatment of interferon and ribavirin has been shown to be more effective than treatment with interferon alone (18McHutchison J.G. Gordon S.C. Schiff E.R. Shiffman M.L. Lee W.M. Rustgi V.K. Goodman Z.D. Ling M.H. Cort S. Albrecht J.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). The side effects of interferon are also in some cases severe enough to lead to treatment cessation. Although the entry mechanism of HCV, as well as that of hepatitis B virus, remains unclear, it was reported recently that human CD81 (19Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Sience. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar) and scavenger receptor class B type I (20Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R.M. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) could be bound by a truncated, soluble form of the E2 protein; such findings suggest that these proteins may act as receptors for HCV on the cell surface. Low density lipoprotein receptor (21Agnello V. Abel G. Elfahal M. Knight G.B. Zhang Q.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12766-12771Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) was also reported as a putative HCV receptor in endocytosis experiments using isolated HCV-lipoprotein complexes. However, because of the lack of a reproducible and efficient HCV proliferation system, it is not known whether these candidate receptors for HCV serve as the functional receptor on human hepatocytes (22Kato N. Shimotohno K. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 261-278PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that non-neoplastic human hepatocyte-derived PH5CH8 cells supported HCV replication, although HCV proliferation was at a fairly low level; in that study, we also demonstrated the antiviral effects of interferon-α in HCV-infected PH5CH8 cells (23Ikeda M. Sugiyama K. Mizutani T. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Sekihara H. Shimotohno K. Kato N. Virus Res. 1998; 56: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Using a PH5CH8 cell culture system, we found that bovine and human lactoferrin (LF), a milk glycoprotein belonging to the iron transporter family, specifically prevented HCV infection in the cells (24Ikeda M. Sugiyama K. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Sekihara H. Shimotohno K. Kato N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, Matsuura et al. (25Matsuura Y. Tani H. Suzuki K. Kimura-Someya T. Suzuki R. Aizaki H. Ishii K. Moriishi K. Robison C.S. Whitt M.A. Miyamura T. Virology. 2001; 286: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) also showed that bovine LF specifically inhibited infection by the pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus possessing chimeric HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins. LF has a molecular mass of 80 kDa and consists of two homologous globular lobes (an N-lobe and a C-lobe), each with a single iron (Fe3+) binding site. There is a notable degree of internal homology between the two lobes, i.e. ∼35% identical amino acid residues have been identified in the corresponding portions (26Levay P.F. Viljoen M. Haematologica. 1995; 80: 252-267PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of human and bovine LFs have been clarified by crystallographic studies (27Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 28Moore S.A. Anderson B.F. Groom C.R. Haridas M. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Although the overall structure of LF is similar to that of transferrin (TF) (∼60% amino acid sequence homology to LF), LF has two distinct features that may be functionally important. First, the association constant of LF for iron is 300 times that of TF (29Aisen P. Leibman A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 257: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Second, in contrast to TF, LF possesses strong inhibitory activity against bacterial growth. The antimicrobial activity of LF has been ascribed to the basic N-terminal region (“lactoferricin”) (30Bellamy W. Takase M. Yamauchi K. Wakabayashi H. Kawase K. Tomita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Lactoferricin (24 aa residues) shows activity against a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi (30Bellamy W. Takase M. Yamauchi K. Wakabayashi H. Kawase K. Tomita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). LF is present in the milk of most mammals, and the LF content in milk changes substantially during the lactation period. The concentrations of LF in mature milk are 0.1–0.4 mg/ml in bovines and 1–3 mg/ml in humans, and LF is especially enriched in the colostrum (0.8 mg/ml in bovines and 10 mg/ml in humans) (31Sanchez L. Aranda P. Perez M.D. Calvo M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Nagasawa T. Kiyosawa I. Kuwahara K. J. Dairy Sci. 1972; 55: 1651-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is well established that LF plays an important role in the newborn as the primary nonspecific defense against pathogenic microorganisms (26Levay P.F. Viljoen M. Haematologica. 1995; 80: 252-267PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it has been reported that rats fed a 2% bovine LF diet displayed no significant side effects (33Sekine K. Watanabe E. Nakamura J. Takasuka N. Kim D.J. Asamoto M. Krutovskikh V. Baba-Toriyama H. Ota T. Moore M.A. Masuda M. Sugimoto H. Nishino H. Kakizoe T. Tsuda H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1997; 88: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This low risk of severe side effects presents a major clinical advantage of bovine LF; hence, clinical pilot studies have been performed recently. The results have shown that bovine LF was effective in some patients with chronic hepatitis C (34Tanaka K. Ikeda M. Nozaki A. Kato N. Tsuda H. Saito S. Sekihara H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,35Iwasa M. Kaito M. Ikoma J. Takeo M. Imoto I. Adachi Y. Yamauchi K. Koizumi R. Teraguchi S. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2002; 97: 766-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study by our group (36Ikeda M. Nozaki A. Sugiyama K. Tanaka T. Naganuma A. Tanaka K. Sekihara H. Shimotohno K. Saito M. Kato N. Virus Res. 2000; 66: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) suggested that the prevention of HCV infection in these cells was because of interactions of LF with HCV rather than with the cells themselves; our study demonstrated that LF inhibited viral entry into the cells by interacting directly with HCV (36Ikeda M. Nozaki A. Sugiyama K. Tanaka T. Naganuma A. Tanaka K. Sekihara H. Shimotohno K. Saito M. Kato N. Virus Res. 2000; 66: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Yi et al. (37Yi M. Kaneko S. Yu D.Y. Murakami S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) independently demonstrated that HCV envelope proteins (E1 and E2) could bind to human and bovine LFs, although their binding specificities have not been clarified. E2 protein expressed in mammalian cells specifically binds to human target cells (38Rosa D. Campagnoli S. Moretto C. Guenzi E. Cousens L. Chin M. Dong C. Weiner A.J. Lau J.Y.N. Choo Q.L. Chien D. Pileri P. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and such binding is associated with HCV particles binding to target cells in vitro, as well as with HCV infection in vivo (38Rosa D. Campagnoli S. Moretto C. Guenzi E. Cousens L. Chin M. Dong C. Weiner A.J. Lau J.Y.N. Choo Q.L. Chien D. Pileri P. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition, the level of antibody response to E2 protein has been shown to correlate with protection against HCV in animal models (39Farci P. Shimoda A. Wong D. Cabezon T. De Gioannis D. Strazzera A. Shimizu Y. Shapiro M. Alter H.J. Purcell R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and with occasional clearance of HCV in cases of natural infection (40Ishii K. Rosa D. Watanabe Y. Katayama T. Harada H. Wyatt C. Kiyosawa K. Aizaki H. Matsuura Y. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Miyamura T. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that the E2 protein is the major receptor-binding protein. For these reasons, we focused on the interactions between LF and E2 proteins to understand the mechanism by which LF prevents HCV infection of target cells. In this study, we have characterized the binding activity of LF to the E2 protein and have endeavored to determine which region(s) of LF are important for this binding activity. Here, we report the finding of 33 human LF-derived amino acids possessing binding activity to the E2 protein of HCV, which leads to inhibition of HCV infection in target cells. Far-Western blot analysis was carried out according to a method described previously (37Yi M. Kaneko S. Yu D.Y. Murakami S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 0.5 μg of human and bovine LFs (Sigma) and various recombinant LF fragments were resolved by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then blocked in N-buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25% gelatin) with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature in N-buffer containing 2% BSA, and the secreted form of E2 protein (E2–681) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was used as a probe (41Inudoh M. Nyunoya H. Tanaka T. Hijikata M. Kato N. Shimotohno K. Vaccine. 1996; 14: 1590-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After 1 h of incubation, the membranes were washed with N-buffer three times for 10 min at room temperature, blocked once again with N-buffer with 2% BSA, and incubated at room temperature with rat monoclonal antibody, MO-2 or MO-12, against E2 protein (42Inudoh M. Kato N. Tanaka Y. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 42: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Normal rat serum (Invitrogen) was used as a control instead of MO-2 or MO-12. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the membranes were washed with 0.1% Tris saline three times for 5 min at room temperature. Immunocomplexes on the membranes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human and bovine LFs (10 μg each; Sigma) were denatured with 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100 °C and were then treated with 2,000 units of peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF; New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 for 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were immediately used for the Far-Western blot analysis. Total RNAs (2 μg each) from human cancer breast tissue (43Kato N. Pfeifer-Ohlsson S. Kato M. Larsson E. Rydnert J. Ohlsson R. Cohen M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), normal bovine breast tissue, and normal horse peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as templates for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to obtain the full-length LF cDNAs. The total RNA (2 μg) from PH5CH8 cells was also used as a template for RT-PCR to obtain the TF cDNA encoding aa 587–679 and the CD81 cDNA encoding the large extracellular loop (LEL; aa 113–201). Oligo(dT) was used to prime the cDNA synthesis using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplification by PCR with a highly efficient proofreading DNA polymerase, KOD-plus (Toyobo) was performed for 20 cycles using each primer set (see Table I) arranged from the nucleotide sequences of human LF (X52941), bovine LF (M63502), horse LF (AJ010930), human TF (S95936), and human CD81 (M33680) cDNAs. The PCR product containing the coding region of full-length human LF was cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the pHookTM-2 (Invitrogen), as described previously (44Kato N. Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M. Ohkoshi S. Shimotohno K. Mol. Biol. Med. 1990; 7: 495-501PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products containing the coding region of full-length bovine and horse LFs were also cloned into the NotI andHpaI sites of pCXbsr (45Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), as described previously (46Naganuma A. Nozaki A. Tanaka T. Sugiyama K. Takagi H. Mori M. Shimotohno K. Kato N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8744-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PCR products containing the human TF fragment (aa 587–678) and the CD81 LEL were cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pET32a (Novagen), respectively. The nucleotide sequences of obtained cDNA clones encoding human, bovine, and horse LF, and human TF and CD81 were determined by Big Dye terminator-cycle sequencing on an Applied Biosystem 310 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT). It was confirmed that these cDNAs had identical nucleotide sequences to those in the databases.Table IOligonucleotides used for construction of expression plasmidsOligonucleotideSequenceDirectionExpressed proteinshLF(B)attatGGATCCGGCCGTAGGAGAAGGAGTGTTCAGForwardFull-length human LFhLFCRHtaataAAGCTTTTACTTCCTGAGGAATTCACAGGCReverseFull-length human LF, lactoferricin-truncated human LF, human LF C-lobe and C-s3, human LF (aa 610–692, 624–692, 640–692, 653–692)hLFB1tgataGGATCCCAGGCCATTGCGGAAAACAGGGCCForwardLactoferricin-truncated human LF human LF N-lobe and N-s1hLFH1taataAAGCTTGGGCTCAGGTGGACCCGReverseHuman LF N-s1hLFB2tgataGGATCCATTGAGGCAGCTGTGGCCAGGTTCForwardHuman LF N-s2hLFH2taataAAGCTTGGCATGAGAAGGGACCCGGGReverseHuman LF N-s2hLFB3tgataGGATCCGTTGTGGCACGAAGTGTGTGAATGGCForwardHuman LF N-s3hLFNRHtgataAAGCTTAGCCACTTCCTCCTCACTTTTCCTCReverseHuman LF N-lobe and N-s3hLFCBtgataGGATCCGCCCGGCGTGCGCGGGTCGTGTGGForwardHuman LF C-lobe and C-s1hLFH3taataAAGGTTAAATTTGCAGGAGCCCGTCTGReverseHuman LF C-s1hLFB5tgataGGATCCGATGAATATTTCAGTCAAAGCTGForwardHuman LF C-s2hLFH4taataAAGCTTGGCATGATTCGGGGCCATGGReverseHuman LF C-s2hLFB6tgataGGATCCGTGGTGTCTCGGATGATAAGGForwardHuman LF C-s3, human LF (aa 600–622, 600–627, 600–632, 600–637, 600–642, 600–647, 600–652, 600–670)C3ABRtaataAAGCTTTTATGCGACATACTGTGGTCCCReverseHuman LF (aa 600–670)C3ARZtaataAAGCTTTTAGGCCAGACACTCAGTGTTGTCReverseHuman LF (aa 590–652, 600–652, 605–652, 610–652)C3HFtgataGGATCCAGACTCCATGGCAAAACAACATATGForwardHuman LF (aa 653–692)C3HFAtgataGGATCCCTGAAACAGGTGCTGCTCCACForwardHuman LF (aa 610–692, 610–652)C3HFBtgataGGATCCAATGGATCTGACTGCCCGGACForwardHuman LF (aa 624–692)C3HFCtgataGGATCCAAAAACCTTCTGTTCAATGACForwardHuman LF (aa 640–692)590FtgataGGATCCCTGCCATCTTGCCATGGCCCCGForwardHuman LF (aa 590–652)605FtgataGGATCCGATAAGGTGGAACGCCTGAAACAGGForwardHuman LF (aa 605–652, 605–632)622RtaataAAGCTTTTACCCAAATTTAGCCTGTTGGTGGReverseHuman LF (aa 600–622)627RtaataAAGCTTTTAGTCAGATCCATTTCTCCCAAATTTAGCReverseHuman LF (aa 600–627)632RtaataAAGCTTTTAAAACTTGTCCGGGCAGTCAGATCCReverseHuman LF (aa 600–632, 605–632)637RtaataAAGCTTTTAAGACTGGAATAAGCAAAACTTGTCCReverseHuman LF (aa 600–637)642RtaataAAGCTTTTAAAGGTTTTTGGTTTCAGACTGGAATAAReverseHuman LF (aa 600–642)647RtaataAAGCTTTTAGTTGTCATTGAACAGAAGGTTTTTGGReverseHuman LF (aa 600–647)CD81BtgataGGATCCTTTGTCAACAAGGACCAGForwardHuman CD81 LEL (aa 113–201)CD81RbHtaataAAGCTTCTTCCCGGAGAAGAGGTCATCGReverseHuman CD81 LEL (aa 113–201)bLF(N)attatGCGGCCGCCACCATGAAGCTCTTCGTCCCCGCCCTForwardFull-length bovine LFbLFR(H)attatGTTAACTCATTACCTCGTCAGGAAGGCGCAGGReverseFull-length bovine LFbLFC3FtgataGGATCCGTGGTGTCTGGAGCGATAGGGForwardBovine LF (aa 597–689, 597–629)bLFC3RtaataAAGCTTTTACCTCGTCAGGAAGGCGCAGGCReverseBovine LF (aa 597–689)bLF632RtaataAAGCTTTTAAAACTTGTCCGGGCAGTTTTTTCCReverseBovine LF (aa 597–629)hoLF(N)attatGCGGCCGCCACCATGGCCCCTAGGAAAAGCGTTCGForwardFull-length horse LFhoLF(H)attatGTTAACTCATTATGCCCTCAGGAAGGCGCAGGCReverseFull-length horse LFhoLFC3FtgataGGATCCGTGGTATCTCAGAGTGATAGGGCForwardHorse LF (aa 597–689)hoLFC3RtaataAAGCTTTTATGCCCTCAGGAAGGCGCAGGCReverseHorse LF (aa 597–689)C3TFtgataGGATCCGTGGTCACACGGAAAGATAAGGForwardHuman TF (aa 587–679)C3TRtaataAAGCTTTTAAGGTCTACGGAAAGTGCAGGCReverseHuman TF (aa 587–679) Open table in a new tab The pET32a was used for the production of LF, TF, or CD81 fragments as thioredoxin (TRX)-fused proteins in E. coli. For the expression of human, bovine, and horse LFs, the inserts of obtained cDNA clones were transferred into the BamHI andHindIII sites of the pET32a. Based on these pET32a plasmids containing the coding regions of the full-length LFs, the pET32a expression plasmids encoding the various regions of LF were constructed by inserting the PCR product amplified using the primer sets listed in Table I into the BamHI-HindIII site of the pET32a. The pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used for the production of human LF fragment (aa 600–632) as maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fused protein in E. coli. The DNA fragment encoding the human LF fragment (aa 600–632), which was obtained from the pET32a expression vector by digestion with BamHI andHindIII, was transferred into theBamHI-HindIII sites of the pMAL-c2X. The single-amino acid substitutions (i.e. changed to an Ala residue) were introduced into pET32a containing the coding region of human LF fragment (aa 600–632) by site-directed mutagenesis, as described previously (47Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the mutation primer sets. The obtained pET32a mutants were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Expression plasmids for TRX-fused human LF fragments were transformed into the E. coli strain AD494(DE3) (Novagen). The transformants were cultured in 10 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (15 μg/ml) at 37 °C overnight and were then transferred to 200 ml of LB medium; the culture period was then for 4 h at 37 °C. One mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture and then continued for 4–5 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 3,400 × g for 10 min, the harvested cells were suspended in 10 ml of B-PERTM (Pierce) by pipetting until the cell suspension became homogenous and was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 15 min, the supernatant obtained as the soluble fraction was used for the purification of LF fragments and CD81 LEL using a His-Bind purification kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, because these TRX-fused proteins possesses His tag sequences. On the other hand, the pellets obtained as the insoluble fraction were suspended in 10 ml of B-PERTM; 200 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml; Sigma) was then added, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min, the pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of 10-fold diluted B-PERTM, and the treatment was repeated two times. The pellets obtained by this method were then dissolved in 10 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 6m urea) as purified inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies thus obtained were also used for the purification of several LF fragments using a His-Bind purification kit in the presence of 6m urea. The purity of obtained LF fragments and CD81 LEL was evaluated to be more than 95%, as determined by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. The protein concentration was determined by using Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). TRX (22 kDa) produced from the pET32a vector, with the linker sequence-derived 26 amino acids in the C-terminal portion, was used as a control protein. The expression plasmid for the MBP-fused human LF fragment (aa 600–632) was transformed into the E. colistrain JM109. The transformants were cultured in 100 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and glucose (2 mg/ml) at 37 °C until an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm was reached. At this point, 1 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture, and the culture was continued for 4 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 3,400 × g for 10 min, the harvested cells were resuspended in 5 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and were then disrupted by sonication for 2 min with short pulses. Insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained as the soluble fraction was applied onto an amylose resin affinity column (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of column buffer to remove the unbound proteins. The bound protein was eluted with 10 mmmaltose under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The purity of the obtained MBP-fused protein was evaluated to be more than 95% by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. The concentration of the purified MBP-fused protein was determined by using Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). The MBP2 (43 kDa) produced from the pMAL-c2X with a stop codon inserted into the XmnI site was used as a control protein. A previously described ELISA-based binding assay was used to examine the binding affinity between the E2 protein and MBP-fused human LF fragment (48Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter immunoplates (Maxisorp; Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with the secreted form of the E2 protein (E2–681) (50 μl/well, 10 μg/ml) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA) (41Inudoh M.

Physiological hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of the heart resulting from repeated endurance exercise. This form of cardiac hypertrophy is both beneficial and reversible. It is characterized by increased total RNA and total protein with increased abundance of the adult contractile isoforms, α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC)1 and cardiac α-actin. The adult isoforms of the contractile proteins provide greater contractility making it possible to pump more blood per contraction than the fetal isoforms (4Kozakova M. Galetta F. Gregorini L. Bigalli G. Franzoni F. Giusti C. Palombo C. Hypertension. 2000; 36: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Li Z.B. Gao Y.Q. Tang Z.S. Sheng Li Xue Bao. 1998; 50: 551-556PubMed Google Scholar). These features make the physiological hypertrophic heart more efficient and powerful. Physiological hypertrophy also occurs during the neonatal period as the heart adapts to the increased energy demands of postnatal life (6Shiojima I. Yefremashvili M. Luo Z. Kureishi Y. Takahashi A.

Colan S.D. Circulation. 1996; 94: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Prolonged hypertrophy, usually secondary to other pathology (e.g. hypertension), often leads to irreversible cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The pathological hypertrophic response is characterized by the transcriptional activation of fetal genes encoding contractile proteins such as β-MHC and skeletal α-actin (8Izumo S. Lompre A.M.

Alonso S. Buckingham M. Circ. Res. 1986; 59: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The synthesis of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is also induced, presumably mimicking the cardiac response to pressure overload (10Arai H. Nakao K. Saito Y. Morii N. Sugawara A. Yamada T. Itoh H. Shiono S. Mukoyama M. Ohkubo H. et al.Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These changes are believed to reflect a change in gene expression intended to achieve an “energy sparing” rather than a “contractile efficiency” status and illustrate the fact that cardiac gene expression is closely linked to energy demand (11Schwartz K.

The intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the cardiac hypertrophic response are poorly understood as are the molecular mechanisms controlling whether a hypertrophic response is pathological or physiological. In recent years, efforts to identify signaling pathways associated with cardiac hypertrophy have largely focused on the role of calcium signaling in mediating the cardiac hypertrophic response (12Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). In this regard the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway has received the most attention (12Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 13Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, in eukaryotic cells one of the most important intracellular transducers of growth-related signaling is the rapamycin-sensitive pathway associated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a phosphatidylinositol kinase-related protein kinase that is regulated in response to growth factors and nutritional status (14Gao X. Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). mTOR functions at a nexus of protein kinase signaling, receiving input from numerous upstream signaling pathways and delivering instructions to a variety of downstream effectors controlling the cellular response to mitogenic stimuli (15Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). mTOR plays an especially important role in sensing and responding to nutrient status, particularly amino acid availability (16Rohde J. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Downstream consequences of mTOR activation include effects on transcription, translation, protein degradation, and cytoskeletal organization (16Rohde J. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Very little is known regarding the role of mTOR-mediated signaling in cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac gene regulation. We chose to use amino acid availability, specifically that of glutamine, as an experimental tool to probe the role of mTOR signaling in regulating cardiac gene expression. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the blood, with a concentration of ∼2.5 mm (17Abumrad N.N. Rabin D. Diamond M.P. Lacy W.W. Metabolism. 1981; 30: 936-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 18Ham R.G. McKeehan W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 44-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that glutamine is a major gluconeogenic precursor and vehicle for interorgan carbon transport in man (19Nurjhan N. Bucci A. Perriello G. Stumvoll M. Dailey G. Bier D.M.

It has long been known that under certain physiological circumstances glutamine serves as major fuel for the gut (20Rhoads J.M. Argenzio R.A. Chen W. Rippe R.A. Westwick J.K. Cox A.D.

Many lines of cultured mammalian cells utilize glutamine, in preference to glucose, as their major carbon source to meet energetic and biosynthetic needs (24Wu G.Y. Field C.J. Marliss E.B. Biochem.

Glutamine perfusion of the ischemic heart provides significant protection from damage resulting from loss of energy charge (31Khogali S.E. Harper A.A. Lyall J.A. Rennie M.J. J. Mol. Cell.

We show here that the addition of glutamine as a major nutrient for cultured cardiomyocytes produces an increase in myocyte size and in the organization of actin into myofibrillar arrays. The maturation of cardiomyocytes is associated with the induction of the adult isoforms of the contractile proteins, α-MHC and cardiac α-actin, features associated with physiological hypertrophy. Markers of the pathological hypertrophic response, such as β-MHC, skeletal α-actin, and ANF, are not induced. However, the adult isoforms of two metabolic enzymes, muscle carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-1) and muscle adenylosuccinate synthetase (ADSS1), were also induced. These are the muscle-specific isoforms of enzymes associated with cardiac fatty acid metabolism and adenine nucleotide metabolism, respectively. Adss1 gene expression is induced ∼5-fold in glutamine-treated rat neonatal cardiac myocytes. The induction is mediated through the protein kinase A (PKA) and mTOR signaling pathways and requires a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) associated with the promoter region of the Adss1 gene. These results highlight glutamine as a major nutrient regulator of cardiac gene expression and show that PKA and mTOR signaling pathways are required for the cardiomyocyte transcriptional response. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (1–2 days old) were isolated as described previously (13Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone). Cells were plated in six-well dishes (21 cm2 per well) at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well for RNA isolation, total cellular protein isolation, and transient transfection experiments (34Xia Y. Wen H.Y. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24601-24608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For some experiments cells were plated on coverslips for fluorescent microscopy. After 24 h cells were rinsed and then maintained for the remainder of the experiment in serum-free DMEM, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. The cardiac myocytes on the coverslips were treated by glutamine from 4 to 16 mm in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. All the cardiac myocytes used for RNA isolation, total protein isolation, and transient transfections were treated with 16 mm glutamine. Other cardiac myocytes were maintained in the serum-free DMEM without glutamine as control. For some experiments, 1 μm H-89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, or 5 μmG06983, a protein kinase C inhibitor, was added to both the control and glutamine-treated cells. Forskolin was added to both the control and glutamine-treated cells at 1 μm concentration. The morphological changes in cardiac myocyte size and sarcomere alignment were visually determined for control and glutamine-treated cells. After 48 h on coverslips the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma), and stained for actin with BODIPY FL phallacidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The fluorescent images were viewed with an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope equipped with dark-field optics and photographed using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostics, Sterling Height, MI). Following the pretreatment by different inhibitors for 30 min and then with glutamine or angiotensin II (Ang II) for another 30 min, cardiomyocytes were extracted with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 25 mm glycerophosphate, and 100 nm okadaic acid. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using BCA (Pierce) reagent (34Xia Y. Wen H.Y. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24601-24608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Total cellular protein (30–50 μg) from control, Ang II-treated, and glutamine-treated cells, in the presence or absence of rapamycin (100 ng/ml) or LY294002 (20 μm), were boiled with SDS-sample buffer for 5 min and fractionated in 10% SDS denaturing polyacrylamide gels at 100 volts for 1 h. The separated proteins were transferred from the gel onto nitrocellulose membranes at 100 volts for 1 h. The blot was blocked with 5% milk in TBST solution for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-p70S6 kinase (i.e. S6K1) and anti-phosphothreonine 389-p70S6 kinase, anti-tuberin, and anti-phosphothreonine-1462-tuberin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) at 1:1500 dilution in 1% milk-TBST overnight at 4 °C, respectively, and followed 5-min washes in TBST three times. Finally the blot was incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:2000 dilution in 1% milk-TBST for 1 h at room temperature and followed with 5-min washes in TBST three times. The signal was detected by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated by using a Trizon RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Total cellular RNA (10 μg/lane) was electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose under denaturing conditions as described previously (35Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following multiple stringent washings the membranes were subjected to autoradiography for 24–48 h at −70 °C. The reporter construct, 1.9Adss1/CAT, has been described before (13Xia Y. McMillin J.B.

Rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were cultured as above, transfected with plasmid vectors, and assayed for CAT activity and β-galactosidase as described (13Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M.

In each case 100 ng of total RNA (extracted as described above) was reverse transcribed for 30 min at 42 °C with 400 nm specific reverse primer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3 (at 20 °C), 500 μm deoxynucleotides and 0.1 mU reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. Subsequently, 8 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction was used for quantitative two-step PCR (95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 12 s, 60 °C for 1 min) in the presence of reverse primer, 100 nm specific fluorogenic probe, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3 (at 20 °C), 200 μmdeoxynucleotides, and 1.2 units of Taq polymerase (Sigma) in a final volume of 50 μl. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was determined by Student'st test or analysis of variance test. A value ofp < 0.05 was interpreted to mean that observed experimental differences were statistically significant. To study the role of glutamine in the growth and differentiation of cardiac myocytes, cells were incubated in serum free minimal medium in the presence of different concentrations of glutamine (4–16 mm). After 24 h the cells were fixed and subsequently stained with the immunofluorescent probe, BODIPY phallacidin, to identify actin filaments. Dramatic differences between the control and glutamine-treated cardiac myocytes were evident, not only in size but also in the organization of actin from punctate cores of actin characteristic of immature cardiac myocytes into striated arrays of well organized mature actin filaments. (Fig.1). These alterations were accompanied by a significant increase in protein content (75.4 ± 4.8 to 113.67 μg ± 3.3/106 cells,p < 0.05) and RNA content (1.85 ± 0.85 to 3.32 μg ± 0.55/106 cell, p < 0.05) in the glutamine-treated cells. These results indicate that the addition of glutamine to minimum essential medium leads to an increase in cardiomyocyte size (hypertrophy) and the organization of actin into myofibrillar arrays (maturation). Similar results were obtained with certain other amino acids, including alanine, aspartate, asparagine, and glutamate (data not shown). Because glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the circulation and because of the special importance of glutamine in energy metabolism and nitrogen metabolism we chose to focus on glutamine for the remainder of our studies. To evaluate the impact of glutamine on the pattern of cardiomyocyte gene expression we used quantitative PCR to determine the abundance of specific mRNAs encoding a diverse group of proteins associated with cardiac hypertrophy. We initially examined mRNAs encoding various cardiac contractile proteins, a metabolic enzyme, a peptide hormone, and a transcription factor. The results (Fig.2) show that the abundance of cardiac α-actin and α-MHC mRNAs increased in response to the presence of glutamine. Messenger RNA encoding CPT-1, a mitochondrial transport protein associated with fatty acid metabolism, was also induced by the presence of glutamine. The abundance of mRNAs encoding skeletal α-actin and β-MHC, fetal isoforms characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, did not change significantly following glutamine treatment. Evaluation of mRNA from control and glutamine-treated cells also showed that the cardiac hypertrophic marker gene encoding the polypeptide hormone, ANF, was not induced. The abundance of c-fos mRNA increased slightly in response to the presence of glutamine. Overall, these results show that stimulation of cardiomyocyte growth and maturation by glutamine was accompanied by increased expression of genes encoding the adult isoforms of cardiac proteins (e.g.cardiac α-actin, α-MHC, and muscle CPT-1), with no effect on the fetal isoforms. Genes normally induced as a result of pathological hypertrophy, i.e. those encoding skeletal α-actin, β-MHC, and ANF, were not induced in response to the presence of glutamine as a major nutrient. ADSS1 is an enzyme of purine nucleotide synthesis that functions at a metabolic branch point controlling the synthesis of adenine nucleotides. Glutamine is a required biosynthetic precursor and intermediate in adenine nucleotide synthesis. Additionally,Adss1 gene expression in cardiomyocytes is stimulated in response to cardiac hypertrophic stimuli (13Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 40Wen H.Y. Xia Y. Young M.E. Taegtmeyer H. Kellems R.E. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2002; 6: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For these reasons we chose Adss1 as a marker gene to study the cardiac transcriptional response to glutamine. We initially determined the effect of glutamine on the abundance of Adss1 mRNA in cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes. Northern hybridization showed that the abundance of Adss1 mRNA was elevated relative to control cardiomyocytes by 6 h of glutamine exposure and continued to increase for at least 24 h (Fig.3A). To determine whether the increased abundance of Adss1 mRNA reflected increased transcription of the Adss1 gene we conducted transfection experiments with Adss1/CAT reporter constructs. Transfection assays showed that Adss1 promoter activity increased 6–7-fold in response to glutamine (Fig. 3B). These results imply that intracellular signaling pathways link the presence of glutamine with transcriptional activation of the Adss1gene. Previous studies indicate that glutamine controls gene expression through cyclic AMP-mediated signaling pathways in epithelial cells (21Rhoads J.M. Argenzio R.A. Chen W. Graves L.M. Licato L.L. Blikslager A.T. Smith J. Gatzy J. Brenner D.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 90-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify signaling pathways associated with the glutamine induction ofAdss1 gene expression in cardiomyocytes, we tested the effects of forskolin (an activator of adenylyl cyclase) and glutamine on Adss1 promoter activity. In addition, we tested the effect of protein kinase A and protein kinase C inhibitors onAdss1 promoter activity in the presence and absence of glutamine. Transfection assays showed that forskolin treatment alone increased Adss1 transcriptional activity ∼4-fold. Glutamine alone resulted in a 6-fold induction. Glutamine and forskolin together increased Adss1 promoter activity in an additive way for a total of 11-fold. The protein kinase C inhibitor (G06983) had no effect on Adss1 promoter activity, suggesting that protein kinase C is not involved in the activation of theAdss1 promoter by glutamine (data not shown). In contrast, the protein kinase A inhibitor, H-89, completely blocked the activation of the Adss1 promoter by glutamine but had no effect on its basal expression in the absence of glutamine (Fig.4). These results suggest that the protein kinase A signaling pathway contributes to the induction ofAdss1 promoter activity by glutamine. However, although H-89 is well known as a PKA inhibitor, it is also a potent inhibitor of p70S6K1, a growth-regulated kinase under the control of mTOR. Thus, it is possible that the mTOR signaling pathway is involved in the activation of Adss1 gene expression by glutamine. Studies in yeast (41Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar) and Xenopus laevis (42Christie G.R. Hajduch E. Hundal H.S. Proud C.G. Taylor P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9952-9957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have highlighted the importance of mTOR in the cellular response to glutamine availability. Recent studies have linked the mTOR pathway with cAMP-induced transcriptional events suggesting an interplay between mTOR and cAMP nutrient signaling pathways (43Fimia G.M. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1971-1972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44de Groot R.P. Ballou L.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 45de Groot R.P. Ballou L.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To explore the role of mTOR in the regulation of Adss1 gene expression we determined the effect of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR activity, on the induction ofAdss1 promoter activity following glutamine treatment. Transfection assays showed that glutamine treatment resulted in a 4-fold induction of Adss1 promoter activity and that this induction was inhibited by ∼50% by the presence of rapamycin (Fig.5). Similar results were obtained with angiotensin II in the absence and presence of rapamycin (Fig. 5). These results suggest that mTOR activation contributes to the induction ofAdss1 gene expression in response to glutamine, a nutrient, and angiotensin II, a growth factor. A key downstream mediator of mTOR activation is the protein kinase, p70S6K1 (46Avruch J. Belham C. Weng Q. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 115-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 47Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 101-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Activation of p70S6K1 is characterized by the phosphorylation of a specific threonine residue at amino acid position 389. The phosphorylation of p70S6K1 at threonine 389 is a feature commonly used to monitor the activation status of mTOR (48Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We, too, used this approach to determine the effect of glutamine treatment on mTOR activity. Treatment of serum-starved cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II or glutamine resulted in the phosphorylation of p70S6K1 at Thr-389 (Fig. 6A). In each case the increased phosphorylation of p70S6K1 was blocked by the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 6A). These results provide confirmation that the mTOR signaling pathway is activated in response to treatment with Ang II or glutamine. The PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, blocked the phosphorylation of p70S6K1 at Thr-389 induced by Ang II but not by glutamine. These results indicate that Ang II activates mTOR through PI3 kinase signaling pathway, whereas glutamine does not. To further assess the role of mT"

Because of the role of apoE in VLDL metabolism, apoE recycling may influence lipoprotein assembly or remnant uptake. However, apoE is also a HDL protein, and apoE recycling may be related to reverse cholesterol transport. To investigate apoE recycling, apoE−/− mouse hepatocytes were incubated (pulsed) with wild-type mouse lipoproteins, and cells and media were collected at chase periods up to 24 h. When cells were pulsed with VLDL, apoE was resecreted within 30 min. Although the mass of apoE in the media decreased with time, it could be detected up to 24 h after the pulse. Intact intracellular apoE was also detectable 24 h after the pulse. ApoE was also resecreted when cells were pulsed with HDL. When apoA-I was included in the chase media after a pulse with VLDL, apoE resecretion increased 4-fold. Furthermore, human apoE was resecreted from wild-type mouse hepatocytes after a pulse with human VLDL. Finally, apoE was resecreted from mouse peritoneal macrophages after pulsing with VLDL. We conclude that 1) HDL apoE recycles in a quantitatively comparable fashion to VLDL apoE; 2) apoE recycling can be modulated by extracellular apoA-I but is not affected by endogenous apoE; and 3) recycling occurs in macrophages as well as in hepatocytes, suggesting that the process is not cell-specific.

Finally, apoE is a major HDL protein and may have a role in HDL formation, maturation, and hepatic uptake (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Google Scholar, 15Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y.

Based on the multiple and critical roles for apoE in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, it has been hypothesized that apoE may follow unique pathways of secretion and internalization, allowing it to have maximum impact on cellular functions. Recent studies from our laboratory have given support to this hypothesis and have shown that a portion of apoE internalized on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is spared degradation and is resecreted (18Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Google Scholar, 19Swift L.L. Farkas M.H. Major A.S. Valyi-Nagy K. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22965-22970Google Scholar). Radiolabeled apoE was found associated with nascent hepatic Golgi lipoproteins after injecting [125I]VLDL into C57BL/6 mice (18Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Google Scholar). We also found apoE with nascent Golgi lipoproteins recovered from the livers of apoE−/− mice reconstituted with bone marrow from C57BL/6 mice (19Swift L.L. Farkas M.H. Major A.S. Valyi-Nagy K. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22965-22970Google Scholar). Furthermore, primary cultures of hepatocytes from these transplanted apoE−/− mice secreted apoE, a clear indication that internalized apoE can survive degradation and find its way out of the cell. Studies from other laboratories have also shown that apoE internalized on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by rat liver, hepatoma cell lines, or fibroblasts is not completely degraded and is resecreted (20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Google Scholar, 21Heeren J. Grewal T. Jackle S. Beisiegel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42333-42338Google Scholar, 22Rensen P.C.N.

The results from these studies establish the presence of a unique intracellular processing pathway for apoE-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins leading to recycling. Although the evidence supporting apoE recycling is convincing, little is known regarding the cell biology and physiologic relevance of the process. It is not clear whether apoE recycles from specific lipoprotein particles or whether recycling is dependent upon the entry pathway into the cell. Furthermore, the possibility that the recycling process can be modulated has not been explored. To address these questions, we have developed a model utilizing primary hepatocytes from apoE−/− mice and a pulse-chase protocol using unlabeled lipoproteins from wild-type mice. Using this model, we demonstrate apoE recycling when either VLDL or HDL is the source of the apoprotein. In addition, we report that resecretion of apoE is increased by the presence of apoA-I in the chase media. Using hepatocytes from wild-type mice, we demonstrate that apoE recycles from human VLDL and that apoE is recycled in the presence of endogenous apoE production. Finally, we show that apoE recycles from mouse peritoneal macrophages, demonstrating that recycling is not specific for the liver cell. ApoE-deficient mice (apoE−/−) on the C57BL/6 background were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). ICR mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). All of the mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle and were fed a normal mouse chow diet (RP5015, PMI Feeds Inc., St. Louis, MO). Food and water were available ad libitum. All of the animal procedures were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines with approval from the Animal Care Committee of Vanderbilt University. Hepatocytes were isolated from apoE−/−and ICR mice as described previously (19Swift L.L. Farkas M.H. Major A.S. Valyi-Nagy K. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22965-22970Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 6-well (35 mm) BioCoat mouse collagen IV-coated dishes (BD Biosciences) at a density of 4.5 × 105 viable cells/ml in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mm oleate, 0.167 μg/ml insulin (4 milliunits/ml), 0.02 μg/ml dexamethasone, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. This medium was used for isolation and plating of hepatocytes in all of the experiments and did not contain serum to avoid introduction of exogenous apoE into the system. Mice were anesthetized using a ketamine/xylazine mixture, and blood was collected from the inferior vena cava. EDTA was added to each sample to a final concentration of 12.5 mm. Plasma lipoprotein fractions (d < 1.019 g/ml and d 1.100–1.210 g/ml) were isolated and washed using TLA 100.4 and 120.2 rotors in an Optima TLX Tabletop Ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard and modified to eliminate interference by lipid (23Morton R.E. Evans T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 332-334Google Scholar). Apoprotein composition of the fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE as described above. Gels were stained with 0.01% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (5% acetic acid, 50% methanol), destained (5% acetic acid, 7.5% methanol), and dried. Human VLDL was isolated at d < 1.019 g/ml from healthy donors and washed as described above. The protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained prior to obtaining blood. Media d < 1.006 g/ml lipoproteins for the degradation experiment were isolated using the same rotors as described above. Primary hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as described above. After overnight culture (12–16 h), fresh media supplemented with apoE-containing lipoproteins (d < 1.019 g/ml or d 1.10–1.21 g/ml) were added and cells were pulsed for 2 h. Medium was aspirated, and hepatocytes were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated with heparin (10 mg/ml in PBS) for 3 min, and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Fresh medium without lipoproteins was added, and hepatocytes were chased for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min and 24 h. In some experiments, purified human apoA-I was added to the chase media (25 μg/ml, Calbiochem). Medium was collected at each time period, and cells were washed with PBS. The PBS wash was added to the medium for analysis of resecreted apoE. Cells were collected by the addition of TriZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Protease inhibitors were added to the medium, and samples were stored at −20 °C until analysis. TriZOL-treated cells were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Peritoneal macrophages were collected from apoE−/− mice 3 days after an intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate. Cells were plated onto 6-well dishes at 3 × 106 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The following day cells were washed and pulsed with media containing 7.7 μg of VLDL collected from C57BL/6 mice or control media with no VLDL. After 2 h, the cells were washed four times with PBS and 1.2 ml of fresh media containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum was placed on the cells. At 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min and 24 h after placement in pulse media, cells were washed twice with 400 μl of PBS, and the pulse media and washes were pooled. Cells were collected by addition of TriZOL reagent, and protein was prepared as described below. Lipoproteins were adsorbed from the media using Liposorb (PHM-L Liposorb,Calbiochem) as described previously (19Swift L.L. Farkas M.H. Major A.S. Valyi-Nagy K. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22965-22970Google Scholar). The recovery efficiency of medium apoE by Liposorb was determined to be ∼70% with equal adsorption of lipoprotein classes (data not shown). Adsorbed proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described below. Cellular proteins were isolated using TriZOL reagent per the manufacturer's instructions. Protein pellets were dried under nitrogen gas, 1% SDS was added, and samples were incubated at 60 °C for 50 min with vigorous vortexing every 10 min. Unsolubilized material was pelleted, and the supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated using the NuPage system (Invitrogen) with 4–12% bis-tris gels and MOPS-SDS buffer. Samples were solubilized in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using the NuPage system. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with primary antibodies, washed extensively, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega). The primary antibody to mouse apoE was produced by the Protein Immunology Core of the Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at Vanderbilt University. The anti-human apoE antibody was purchased from Medical and Biological Laboratories International Corporation (Watertown, MA). Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). Films were scanned using a Bio-Rad GS700 imaging densitometer, and relative amounts of protein were estimated using Molecular Analyst software. Hepatocytes from wild-type ICR and apoE−/− mice were isolated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing bovine serum albumin and oleic acid as described above. After overnight culture, medium was collected from ICR hepatocytes, and the d < 1.006 g/ml fraction was isolated. The lipoprotein fraction was incubated with conditioned media (24 h) from apoE−/− hepatocytes in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors in a 35-mm dish at 37 °C. Aliquots were collected at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h, and lipoproteins were adsorbed using Liposorb. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Primary hepatocytes from apoE−/− mice were isolated and cultured as described above. After overnight culture, medium was removed and the cells were incubated in fresh medium for 1 or 2 h. HDL (150 μg/ml) isolated from ICR mice was added to the 1-h and 2-h conditioned media, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 and 2 h, respectively. Lipoprotein fractions (d < 1.019 g/ml, d > 1.019 g/ml) were isolated by centrifugation for 3 h at 120,000 rpm in the 120.2 rotor. Aliquots of the d < 1.019 g/ml and d > 1.019 g/ml were diluted in 1 ml of PBS. Lipoproteins were adsorbed using Liposorb, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed for apoE. A Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gel of typical VLDL and HDL preparations is shown in Fig. 1. ApoE was clearly present in the VLDL fraction (lane 2), and there was no albumin contamination. The HDL fraction (lane 4) also contained apoE and only trace amounts of albumin. To demonstrate apoE recycling in the in vitro model, hepatocytes from apoE−/− mice were incubated with VLDL for 2 h. Cells and media were collected after various chase periods up to 24 h and analyzed for the presence of apoE by Western blotting (Fig. 2). ApoE was present in the media at all time points (Fig. 2 A). Densitometric analyses of the films showed that approximately equal amounts of apoE are present in the media in the 30-, 60-, and 120-min samples. ApoE was seen in the cells for up to 240 min in this experiment (Fig. 2 B). An analysis of cellular apoE showed that one-half of the total uptake (0 min) of apoE is present in the cells at the 30-min time point. Cellular apoE decreased over the course of the experiment, although the change was less dramatic than from 0 to 30 min. In some experiments, apoE was found inside the cells at 24 h. To exclude the possibility that the decrease in apoE in the media resulted from extracellular degradation, conditioned medium (24 h) from apoE−/− hepatocytes was incubated with apoE-containing VLDL for 0, 8, 16, and 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2 C, there was no significant decrease in apoE with time, indicating that extracellular degradation does not play a role in the reduced appearance of apoE at later time points in the recycling experiments. To determine whether apoE recycling was unique for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, pulse-chase experiments were carried out using apoE-containing HDL. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.3. ApoE appeared in the media up to 240 min after the pulse with relatively similar amounts present at each chase period (Fig. 3 A). Cellular apoE decreased during the 30-min incubation by almost 50% and then remained constant through 240 min. There was little apoE remaining within the cell at the 24 h period (Fig. 3 B). Because apoE−/− hepatocytes secrete large apoE-deficient VLDL and because apoE can easily exchange from HDL to VLDL, consideration was given to the possibility that recycling apoE in the HDL experiments was actually internalized as part of VLDL particles. To test this possibility, HDL was incubated in conditioned media from apoE−/− hepatocytes. Thed < 1.019 g/ml and d > 1.019 g/ml fractions were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation, and equal aliquots from each lipoprotein fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE. The results from the Western blot show that the apoE is contained almost exclusively in the d > 1.019 g/ml fraction (Fig. 3 C). To determine whether apoE resecretion is enhanced by the presence of extracellular acceptors of cholesterol, apoA-I was added to the chase media after pulsing the cells with VLDL (Fig.4). The presence of apoA-I increased the resecretion of apoE by ∼4-fold at 30, 60, 120, and 240 min (Fig.4 A). The amount of apoE recovered in cells chased for 30 min in the absence of apoA-I was greater than that found in hepatocytes chased in the presence of apoA-I (Fig. 4 B). With longer chase periods, the mass of apoE in the cells was similar regardless of whether the cells were chased in the presence or absence of apoA-I. Because the previous experiments utilized hepatocytes from apoE−/− mice, we also investigated apoE recycling in wild-type liver cells to determine whether this phenomenon is driven or modulated by endogenous apoE. To investigate apoE recycling in the presence of endogenous apoE production, hepatocytes from ICR mice were incubated in the presence or absence of human d < 1.019 g/ml lipoproteins for 2 h and chased in media without lipoproteins for 0 and 30 min. Resecretion of human apoE was monitored using an antibody specific to human apoE. Human apoE appeared in the media during the 30-min chase (Fig. 5). ApoE was also present in the cells at both the 0 and 30 min time points (Fig. 5). To determine whether the process of apoE recycling is specific for the hepatocyte, peritoneal macrophages from apoE−/− mice were pulsed with apoE-containing VLDL from wild-type mice. Cells and media were collected after various chase periods up to 24 h and analyzed for the presence of apoE by Western blotting (Fig.6). ApoE was present in the media at all time points and was present in the cells up to 24 h after the pulse. ApoE recycling has been explored using a new model in which hepatocytes from apoE−/−mice are pulsed with apoE-containing lipoproteins and chased in the absence of lipoproteins. Using this model, we have shown that apoE recycles when either VLDL or HDL is the source of the apoprotein. Furthermore, we show that resecretion of apoE is enhanced when apoA-I is included in the chase medium, providing the first evidence that the recycling process can be modulated and that it is related to HDL metabolism. Finally, we demonstrate recycling of human apoE in the presence of endogenous apoE production. In addition, we provide the first evidence that the recycling of exogenous apoE also occurs in peritoneal macrophages from apoE null mice. These studies demonstrate clearly that apoE internalized with VLDL is spared degradation within hepatocytes and is then resecreted (Fig. 2). The apoprotein appears in the media within 30 min of instituting the chase, suggesting that recycling occurs rapidly. With time, there is a decrease in the amount of apoE found in the media. This decrease does not result from extracellular degradation (Fig. 2 C) but presumably reflects intracellular degradation. We hypothesize that recycling is a continual process in which apoE is internalized and then either targeted for degradation or routed back out of the cell. With each cycle, a portion of apoE is degraded, thus explaining the reduction of apoE in the media over time. Clearly, the amount of apoE within the cell decreases with time, but a fraction of the protein can remain intact for up to 24 h. It is unclear whether this intracellular apoE represents a pool of apoE retained within a specific storage compartment or whether it represents a fraction of apoE that is continually recycled. Previous studies from our laboratories (18Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Google Scholar, 19Swift L.L. Farkas M.H. Major A.S. Valyi-Nagy K. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22965-22970Google Scholar) as well as from other investigators (20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Google Scholar, 21Heeren J. Grewal T. Jackle S. Beisiegel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42333-42338Google Scholar, 22Rensen P.C.N. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J.C. Biessen E.A.L. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8564-8571Google Scholar) have provided evidence that apoE recycles when presented to cells on triglyceride-rich particles. Our current study is the first to demonstrate that apoE also recycles when HDL is the source of the apoprotein (Fig. 3). Pulse-chase studies with apoE−/− hepatocytes and mouse HDL led to the appearance of apoE in the media. Because apoE is an exchangeable apoprotein and apoE−/− hepatocytes secrete large triglyceride-rich VLDL, we were concerned that apoE may exchange from HDL to newly synthesized VLDL, which in turn was internalized, leading to apoE recycling. However, the incubation of apoE-containing HDL with conditioned media from apoE−/− hepatocytes demonstrated that apoE remains associated almost exclusively with the HDL fraction (Fig.3 C). Thus, apoE was not recycling from VLDL but was indeed recycling from HDL. The pathway for HDL-apoE recycling may or may not be the same as that for VLDL-apoE recycling. In fact, there may be multiple recycling pathways based on entry point into the cell. Importantly, the discovery that apoE recycles even when associated with HDL adds significantly to our knowledge of this process, as it indicates that this phenomenon is not specific for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and may be physiologically correlated to reverse cholesterol transport. ApoE mediates endocytosis of lipoprotein particles by binding to the LDL receptor (2Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Google Scholar, 24Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Arnold K.S. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ApoE-containing HDL has been shown to be taken up by the LDL receptor (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Google Scholar, 17Koo C. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11934-11943Google Scholar) LRP (15Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Google Scholar) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (16Ji Z.S. Dichek H.L. Miranda R.D. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31285-31292Google Scholar). The cell entry of apoE through these different pathways may result in alternate trafficking routes with different subcellular destinations and different recycling times. Studies by Rensen et al. (22Rensen P.C.N. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J.C. Biessen E.A.L. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8564-8571Google Scholar) suggest that apoE internalized on VLDL by the LDL receptor is spared degradation and is resecreted, whereas Heeren et al. (20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Google Scholar) provide evidence that LRP may be the predominant recycling pathway of apoE on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We have shown previously that apoE recycles in the absence of the LDL receptor (18Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Google Scholar). Although these studies do not exclude recycling of apoE through the LDL receptor, they suggest that there may be alternate recycling pathways. Our working hypothesis is that apoE recycles because it binds more tightly to its receptor than it does to the lipoprotein at the point of pH drop in the endosome. In this scenario, apoE could engage the LDL receptor, LRP, or heparan sulfate proteoglycans from the surface of either VLDL or HDL. Conversely, given the significant functional difference between VLDL and HDL in delivering lipid cargo to the liver cell, one could postulate that when HDL docks to the membrane via SR-BI (28Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar), apoE diffuses away from the particle and becomes membrane-bound and internalized as such or as part of an incoming remnant lipoprotein. Clearly additional studies are required to determine whether the point of entry into the cell is important for the intracellular routing and recycling of apoE. The addition of apoA-I to the chase medium resulted in a 4-fold increase in the appearance of apoE in the media (Fig. 4), suggesting an effect on either the rate or mass of apoE recycling. The mechanism through which apoA-I enhances the recycling of apoE is unknown. It is interesting to speculate that it may be related to cholesterol efflux from the cell as both apoE and apoA-I have been shown to play crucial roles in this process. ApoE has been shown to promote cholesterol efflux from the cell (8Mazzone T. Reardon C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1345-1353Google Scholar), whereas apoA-I serves as an acceptor for cholesterol efflux (29Hara H. Yokayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Google Scholar, 30Kritharides L. Jessup W. Mander E.L. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 276-289Google Scholar) in a process probably mediated through the ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) pathway (31Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Google Scholar, 32Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Google Scholar, 33Bortnick A.E.

In addition, there is evidence that binding of HDL/apoA-I to the cell surface mobilizes cholesterol from intracellular pools to the cell surface (34Slotte J.P. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12904-12907Google Scholar, 35Walter M. Gerdes U. Seedorf U. Assman G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 850-856Google Scholar) where the lipid could be transported out of the cell via ABCA1. We speculate that the addition of apoA-I to the media mobilizes intracellular cholesterol and activates the ABCA1 pathway that in turn stimulates apoE resecretion. Huang et al. (36Huang Z.H. Lin C.Y. Oram J.F. Mazzone T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2019-2025Google Scholar) have presented evidence that cholesterol efflux from macrophages mediated by endogenous apoE production is not dependent on ABCA1; however, this does not preclude a role for recycling apoE in cholesterol efflux via the ABCA1 pathway. On the other hand, Remaley et al. (37Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Duverger N.J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer J., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 818-823Google Scholar) demonstrated that HeLa cells transfected to express ABCA1 had increased the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid to apoE, suggesting a role for ABCA1 in apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux. Rees et al. (38Rees D. Sloane T. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27925-27933Google Scholar) demonstrated that apoA-I stimulates the secretion of apoE by macrophages but concluded that apoA-I primarily stimulated the secretion of newly synthesized apoE with little effect on a cell surface pool. However, it should be noted that stimulation of apoE secretion was seen only after 8 h of incubation with apoA-I. In contrast, we found a 4-fold increase in apoE resecretion within 30 min, suggesting that recycling apoE may respond more rapidly to extracellular signals than does newly synthesized apoE. Our studies also demonstrate the recycling of human apoE internalized on triglyceride-rich particles by wild-type mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 5). These results are significant for two reasons. They provide preliminary evidence suggesting that apoE recycling may be an important process in humans and show that recycling is not an aberrant process induced by the absence of apoE. However, it is possible that the recycling pathways for apoE in the presence and absence of endogenous apoE production are not the same. Finally, our studies demonstrate that apoE recycling is not limited to hepatocytes but occurs in macrophages as well. This finding is important in light of the role of apoE in cellular cholesterol homeostasis and the reverse cholesterol transport mentioned above (8Mazzone T. Reardon C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1345-1353Google Scholar,35Walter M. Gerdes U. Seedorf U. Assman G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 850-856Google Scholar), as macrophages trapped in the arterial intima would benefit from the potential to recycle apoE to maintain adequate cholesterol efflux. Analyses of the influence of HDL and apoA-I on macrophage apoE recycling will provide further insight into this important process. In summary, our studies demonstrate that apoE recycling is not limited to uptake via triglyceride-rich lipoproteins but occurs after internalization on HDL particles as well. This finding suggests that there may be multiple entry pathways into the cell that lead to recycling and proposes a possible role for recycling apoE in HDL metabolism. The finding that apoA-I enhances apoE recycling suggests that the process can be modulated and may provide a key to understanding its physiologic relevance. Because apoA-I increases cholesterol efflux from the cell through an ABCA1-mediated mechanism and because ABCA1 plays an obligatory step in HDL metabolism, it is possible that apoE recycling is linked to reverse cholesterol transport both by serving as a signaling mechanism for HDL cholesterol entry into the cell and by increasing cholesterol efflux out of the cell via an ABCA1-mediated mechanism. Whereas the former mechanism might be at play in the hepatocyte, it is tempting to speculate that the latter is used by the macrophage to control intracellular cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2049916785,"Progesterone has long been considered the primary mediator of Xenopus oocyte maturation. We have recently shown, however, that androgens, which are equal or more potent promoters of maturation and are present at higher levels in ovulating frogs, may also be playing an important physiologic role in mediating maturation. Here, we examined the role of CYP17, a key enzyme mediating sex steroid synthesis, in Xenopus ovarian androgen production. We found that the 17,20-lyase activities ofXenopus CYP17 exceeded the 17α-hydroxylase activities in both the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways; thus, Xenopus CYP17 rapidly converted pregnenolone and progesterone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively. This remarkably robust activity exceeds that of CYP17 from most higher vertebrates, and likely explains why virtually no progesterone is detected in ovulating frogs. Additionally, ovarian CYP17 activity was present exclusively in oocytes, although all other enzymes involved in sex steroid production were expressed almost entirely in surrounding follicular cells. This compartmentalization suggests a “two-cell” model whereby Xenopus ovarian androgen production requires both follicular cells and oocytes themselves. The requirement of oocytes for ovarian androgen production further introduces the unusual paradigm whereby germ cells may be responsible for producing important steroids used to mediate their own maturation.

The requirement of oocytes for ovarian androgen production further introduces the unusual paradigm whereby germ cells may be responsible for producing important steroids used to mediate their own maturation. The phenomenon of steroid-induced maturation of Xenopusoocytes has served as a model for studying cell cycle and nongenomic steroid signaling for several decades (1Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Dev. Biol. 1969; 19: 281-309Google Scholar, 2Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Dev. Biol. 1971; 25: 232-247Google Scholar, 3Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Google Scholar, 4Maller J.L.

During this time, progesterone has been considered the primary physiologic mediator of oocyte maturation, perhaps through interactions with classical progesterone receptors expressed in the oocyte (6Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Google Scholar, 7Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Google Scholar). We have recently shown, however, that testosterone, rather than progesterone, may be the primary physiologic mediator of Xenopus oocyte maturation (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar). This dominant role of testosterone is evidenced by the observation that testosterone is a substantially more potent activator of oocyte maturation than progesterone, and that testosterone levels are significantly higher than progesterone (which is nearly undetectable) in the serum and ovaries of β-HCG 1The abbreviations used are: β-HCG, β-human chorionic gonadotropin; AD, androstenedione; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; XeCYP17, Xenopus CYP17; HuCYP17, human CYP17; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 17OHPreg, 17-hydroxypregnenolone; 17OHProg, 17-hydroxyprogesterone; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MBSH, modified Barth's solution -stimulated frogs. In addition, we have shown that, in vitro, isolated oocytes rapidly convert exogenously added progesterone to the androgen androstenedione (AD), which is an equally potent promoter of maturation when compared with progesterone. These data suggest that both AD and progesterone are likely inducing maturation under in vitroconditions typical for “progesterone-mediated” maturation. The high levels of ovarian testosterone in the absence of detectable progesterone imply that Xenopus ovaries are extremely efficient at metabolizing progesterone. Additionally, the ability of isolated oocytes to rapidly convert progesterone to androgens suggests that the oocytes themselves may be important contributors to progesterone metabolism in the ovary. To explain the lack of in vivo progesterone accumulation, as well as to characterize the role of oocytes in ovarian androgen production, we separated oocytes from surrounding follicular cells and examined the ability of both cell types to metabolize progesterone and other androgen precursors. We focused on the function of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP17 in ovarian androgen production, as it is known to play a pivotal role in the synthesis of androgens (Fig. 1). CYP17, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound multifunctional enzyme (9Zuber M.X. John M.E. Okamura T. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2475-2482Google Scholar, 10Zuber M.X.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15992-15998Google Scholar), exhibits two enzymatic activities. Its 17α-hydroxylase activity converts pregnenolone and progesterone into their respective 17α-hydroxylated products 17α-hydroxypregnenolone (17OHPreg) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHProg). The second 17,20-lyase activity cleaves the steroid side chains of 17OHPreg and 17OHProg to yield dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and AD, respectively. CYP17 is expressed in several steroidogenic tissues (12Chung B.C. Picado-Leonard J. Haniu M. Bienkowski M. Hall P.F. Shively J.E. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas earlier work implicates the presence of CYP17 in oocytes (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar), the kinetic characteristics of theXenopus CYP17 (XeCYP17), as well as its expression levels in other ovarian cell types, is not known. Furthermore, expression levels of other important steroidogenic enzymes in various ovarian cell types have not been examined. We show here that XeCYP17 has high 17α-hydroxylase, and even more pronounced 17,20-lyase, activities in both the Δ5 (pregenenolone) and Δ4 (progesterone) pathways (Fig. 1). This differs from most known CYP17 isoforms, which generally favor one pathway over the other, and rarely have 17,20-lyase activity that rivals their 17α-hydroxylase activity. Furthermore, we show that ovarian CYP17 activity is present exclusively in oocytes, whereas other important steroidogenic enzymes, including 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD, are located primarily in the surrounding follicular cells. Finally, we propose a “two-cell” model for androgen synthesis in the Xenopus ovary that involves both oocytes and follicular cells. This model implies that germ cells themselves are critical for Xenopus ovarian androgen production, which in turn may play an important physiologic role in promoting their own maturation. Ovaries were harvested from Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) and oocytes were isolated by incubation with 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at room temperature for 4 h in modified Barth's solution (MBSH) as previously described (14Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 15Williams J.A. McChesney D.J. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. Logsdon C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4939-4943Google Scholar). Oocytes were then washed and incubated overnight at 16 °C in MBSH with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml Ficoll, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Stage V–VI oocytes were selected and examined microscopically to confirm the absence of follicular cells. Follicular cells were isolated by incubating ovaries in collagenase as above for 1 h. Oocytes were allowed to settle by gravity for ∼5 min, and the supernatant containing follicular cells was then centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The pelleted cells were washed 3 times with MBSH, and any remaining oocytes were removed manually under a dissecting microscope. Similar numbers of follicular cells were used in all of the metabolism experiments. In addition, nearly identical results were obtained using follicular cells removed from oocytes after up to 4 h of treatment with collagenase, or using follicular cells separated from oocytes by incubation with trypsin (16Arellano R.O. Miledi R. J. Physiol. 1995; 488: 351-357Google Scholar). Crude oocyte membranes were prepared as previously described (17Lutz L.B. Kim B. Jahani D. Hammes S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41512-41520Google Scholar). In short, stage V–VI oocytes were homogenized in membrane buffer (83 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min and the supernatant containing the membranes was removed and centrifuged two more times at 800 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in membrane buffer. Membranes were centrifuged two more times at 15,000 × g and resuspended in MBSH. Protein concentrations were then measured using the BCA kit (Pierce), and samples were frozen at −80 °C until needed. We saw no significant drop in CYP17 activity after a single freeze/thaw cycle of the membranes. 17α-Hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in oocyte membranes were performed as previously described (18Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Google Scholar). Membranes were assayed under initial rate kinetics by incubation in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.03–1 μm steroid (Sigma and Steraloids, Newport, RI) and 1 mm of the cofactor NADPH in a 500-μl total volume at 16 °C for 30 min. Each reaction contained 50 μg of membranes and 50,000 cpm of [7-3H]pregnenolone (19Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Cell Physiol. 1968; 72: 141-148Google Scholar), [3H]17α-hydroxypregnenolone, [1,2,6,7-3H]progesterone, or [1,2,6,7-3H]17α-hydroxyprogesterone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Steroids were extracted with 3 ml of 3:2 ethyl acetate:hexane. Amounts of radioactivity were measured using a scintillation counter, with >90% recovery from medium. Steroids were concentrated under nitrogen and separated by TLC using 3:1 chloroform:ethyl acetate. Quantitation of steroids was measured by cutting out the steroid spots on the TLC plate and measuring radioactivity using liquid scintillation (20Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Google Scholar). Kinetic behavior was approximated as a Michaelis-Menten system for data analysis. The identities of all steroids in these and the other metabolism experiments were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. HEK-293 cells were grown in complete medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed on 12-well plates. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar, 21Gao T. Marcelli M. McPhaul M.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 9-20Google Scholar) with either pcDNA3.1 (mock) or pcDNA3.1 containing cDNA encoding the Xenopus or human CYP17 protein (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were placed in fresh complete medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 60,000 cpm/well of radiolabeled progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, pregnenolone, or 17α-hydroxypregnenolone at the indicated concentrations. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, and medium was removed at the specified times. Steroids were extracted with 5 ml of 3:2 ethyl acetate:hexane, the organic layer was concentrated, and TLC followed by autoradiography and quantitation was performed as described above. Ovaries (∼500 mg/sample), isolated oocytes (30 oocytes per sample), follicular cells, or recombined follicular cells and oocytes (20 oocytes per sample) were incubated with ∼500,000 cpm of [1,2,6,7-3H]progesterone, [7-3H]pregnenolone, [1,2,6,7-3H]androstenedione, or [1,2,6,7-3H]DHEA in 1 ml of MBSH for 4 h at 16 °C. Medium was removed from the ovaries, oocytes, or follicular cells, and steroids were extracted with 3:2 ethyl acetate:hexane and treated as above. Ovarian fragments of ∼100–200 mg were washed in MBSH and treated for 1 h in 2 ml of MBSH with either ethanol or 100 nm VN/85-1 (a gift from A. Brodie, University of Maryland). Ethanol concentrations were kept constant. β-HCG was then added at a concentration of 100 units/ml, and the ovarian fragments were incubated at 16 °C for ∼12 h. The MBSH was removed, and steroids were extracted and analyzed by radioimmunoassay (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar). Oocytes were manually removed from the ovarian fragments and maturation was determined by visualization of a white spot on the animal pole. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that β-HCG or pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) stimulation of Xenopusovaries in vivo and in vitro produced high levels of testosterone and small to moderate amounts of androstenedione. In contrast, little to no androgen precursors, including pregnenolone, 17OHPreg, progesterone, and 17OHProg, were detected (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar). To determine whether Xenopus ovaries could convert sex steroid precursors to androgens in the absence of gonadotropins, we examined pregnenolone and progesterone metabolism by incubating ovarian tissue with the respective radiolabeled steroids. Both pregnenolone and progesterone were rapidly converted to testosterone (Fig.2), with more than 90% loss of each steroid by 2 h. Virtually no intermediates or further metabolites of testosterone (e.g. estrogen or dihydrotestosterone) were detected in both the pregnenolone- and progesterone-treated ovaries (<10% of total counts at all time points). These data suggest thatXenopus ovaries contain all of the enzymatic machinery necessary for the conversion of sex steroid precursors to testosterone independent of gonadotropin stimulation. Furthermore, this ability to rapidly metabolize pregnenolone and progesterone likely explains why both steroids are nearly undetectable in gonadotropin-stimulated ovaries both in vivo and in vitro (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar). The rapid conversion of progesterone and pregenenolone to androgens implies that the Xenopus ovary contains CYP17, the first key enzyme in the conversion of these sex steroid precursors to androgens (22Picado-Leonard J. Miller W.L. DNA (N. Y .). 1987; 6: 439-448Google Scholar,23Sparkes R.S. Klisak I. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 359-365Google Scholar). Indeed, we previously cloned the XeCYP17 enzyme from an oocyte cDNA library and demonstrated its ability to catalyze two enzymatic reactions: the hydroxylation of progesterone to 17OHProg, and the conversion of 17OHProg to AD (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar). To further characterize the XeCYP17 enzyme, and to determine its role in Xenopus ovarian androgen production, we used membrane preparations from isolated oocytes to measure the kinetic characteristics of XeCYP17. Representative Lineweaver-Burk plots for the 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in both the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways are shown in Fig. 3, with the calculated averageK m and V max values for five separate experiments shown in Table I. The K m values for the 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in both the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways ranged between 26 and 117 nm. The maximal velocities (V max) for 17α-hydroxylase activity in both the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways were similar in magnitude, ranging from 1.3 to 5.2 pmol/mg of protein/min. Surprisingly, XeCYP17 contained remarkably high 17,20-lyase activity in both the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways, with V max = 2.3 pmol/mg of protein/min for the conversion of 17OHPreg to DHEA (Δ5 pathway), andV max = 12.3 pmol/mg of protein/min for the conversion of 17OHProg to AD (Δ4 pathway). This relatively high 17,20-lyase activity could be seen more clearly by examining the ratio of V max values for the 17,20-lyaseversus 17α-hydroxylase reactions in both pathways (TableI). The lyase/hydroxylase values were 1.8 in the Δ5 pathway, and 2.5 in the Δ4 pathway, indicating that XeCYP17 catalyzed the 17,20-lyase reaction even more quickly than the 17α-hydroxylase reaction in both pathways. Furthermore, these results suggest that, in theXenopus ovary, androgens can be rapidly and efficiently produced via both the Δ4 or Δ5 pathways.Table IKinetic parameters of XeCYP17 in Xenopus oocyte membranesK mV maxV maxrationmpmol/mg protein/minlyase/hydroxylaseΔ4 17α-hydroxylase (PROG → 17OHPROG,AD)26 ± 55.2 ± 1.02.5 ± 0.3Δ4 17,20-lyase (17OHPROG → AD)117 ± 812.3 ± 0.9Δ5 17α-hydroxylase (PREG → 17OHPREG,DHEA)22 ± 41.3 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.4Δ5 17,20-lyase (17OHPREG → DHEA)93 ± 122.3 ± 0.3The kinetic parameters of XeCYP17 expressed in Xenopusoocyte membranes were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in both the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways are indicated, as are the steroid substrates and end products for each reaction (parentheses).

TheV max ratios of lyase: hydroxylase activity for the two pathways are indicated in the right column. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 5). The high 17,20-lyase activity of XeCYP17 in both the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways is rather unusual, as most CYP17 isoforms favor one pathway over the other (12Chung B.C. Picado-Leonard J. Haniu M. Bienkowski M. Hall P.F. Shively J.E. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 407-411Google Scholar, 18Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Google Scholar, 24Higuchi A. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 240-246Google Scholar). For example, the human CYP17 (HuCYP17) has little to no 17,20-lyase activity in the Δ4 pathway; thus, human sex steroid synthesis is felt to involve primarily the Δ5 pathway (18Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Google Scholar). To directly compare the kinetic profiles of the Xenopus and human CYP17 enzymes, and to confirm that the observed enzymatic activities in theXenopus oocyte membranes were in fact mediated by the cloned XeCYP17 enzyme, we expressed the human and Xenopus CYP17 proteins individually in HEK-293 cells. Fig.4, A and B, shows that XeCYP17 converted progesterone to 17OHProg, and then to AD (40% of total counts by 8 h), confirming that both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities are carried by this protein. In contrast, HuCYP17 contained high 17α-hydroxylase, but very little 17,20-lyase, activity in the Δ4 pathway (Fig. 4, A and C, 6% conversion to AD by 8 h). Calculated K mvalues for HuCYP17-mediated 17α-hydroxylase reactions in the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways were ∼0.54 and 0.28 μm, respectively (data not shown), which correlate well with published values (18Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Google Scholar). This confirms that the enzyme is functioning as expected in our HEK-293 expression system. Comparison of the calculated lyase/hydroxylaseV max ratios in HEK-293 cells confirmed that XeCYP17 had high 17,20-lyase activity in both pathways, with lyase/hydroxylase V max ratios of approximately unity (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, the 17α-hydroxylase reaction was dominant in both pathways for the HuCYP17, with ratios of ∼0.3 in the Δ5 pathway and <0.05 in the Δ4 pathway. The lower lyase/hydroxylase ratios of XeCYP17 expressed in the HEK-293 cells when compared with the oocyte membranes could be because of many factors, including the availability of important cofactors such as NADPH and the flavoprotein reductase(s), or the species compatibility of the 17,20-lyase cofactor cytochrome b 5 in humanversus Xenopus tissues. The 17,20-lyase activity in HEK-293 cells was still relatively high, however, thus these experiments appear to confirm that the cloned XeCYP17 enzyme is indeed responsible for the potent 17,20-lyase activity seen in oocyte membranes. Notably, similar results were qualitatively seen in COS cells; however, the presence of endogenous CYP17 in these cells precluded their use for quantitative studies. Having established thatXenopus CYP17 can metabolize sex steroid precursors equally well in both the Δ4 and Δ5 pathways, we next determined which cells within the ovary contained CYP17 activity. As mentioned, we had previously shown that isolated Xenopus oocytes possess high CYP17 activity in the Δ4 pathway (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of CYP17 in Xenopus oocytes, we separated oocytes from surrounding follicular cells and performed steroid metabolism experiments. Notably, isolated oocytes were examined very carefully both under the dissecting microscope and by staining of oocyte sections to exclude the presence of follicular cell contamination in our preparations. Fig. 5 represents one of over 50 different hematoxylin/eosin-stained oocyte sections, with no detectable follicular cell contamination. As expected, isolated oocytes contained high CYP17 activity in both the Δ5 and Δ4 pathways, as radiolabeled pregnenolone and progesterone were rapidly metabolized to only DHEA and AD, respectively (Fig.6 A). Interestingly, the isolated oocytes did not appear to significantly express any of the other enzymes responsible for the various stages in the production of sex steroids. For example, 3β-HSD is responsible for the conversion of Δ5 to Δ4 steroids (Fig. 1). The rapid conversion of radiolabeled pregnenolone to DHEA in the absence of detectable Δ4 steroid production (Fig. 6 A, left panel) argues strongly that oocytes lack significant 3β-HSD activity. Likewise, 17β-HSD is necessary for the conversion of DHEA to androstenediol, and of androstenedione to testosterone (Fig. 1). The lack of detectable androstenediol in the pregnenolone-treated cells, as well as the near absence of testosterone in progesterone-treated cells (<10% of the total counts at all time points measured), suggests that oocytes contain little 17β-HSD activity (Fig. 6 A). Finally, stimulation of isolated oocytes with β-HCG did not promote significant steroid production by radioimmunoassay (data not shown), suggesting that they contain little CYP11A1 or steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (stAR) activity, both of which are necessary to augment formation of pregnenolone (Fig. 1). If oocytes have no significant 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD activity, then these enzymes must be present in the surrounding ovarian follicular cells to complete ovarian androgen synthesis. In support of this hypothesis, small amounts of radiolabeled pregnenolone were converted to progesterone by isolated ovarian follicular cells, indicating the presence of 3β-HSD in these cells (Fig. 6 B, left panel). Similar numbers of follicular cells converted radiolabeled DHEA to AD at a significantly higher rate (Fig. 6 B, middle panel), thus confirming the presence of 3β-HSD and suggesting that DHEA may be preferred over progesterone as a substrate for Xenopusovarian 3β-HSD. Finally, radiolabeled AD was very efficiently converted to testosterone (Fig. 6 B, middle andright panels), thereby demonstrating the presence of 17β-HSD in the follicular cells as well. Surprisingly, follicular cells did not hydroxylate progesterone or pregnenolone at all (Fig.6 B, left panel, and data not shown), indicating that ovarian CYP17 activity is contained exclusively in the oocytes themselves. Because separation of oocytes and follicular cells revealed differential expression of the steroidogenic enzymes, the isolated cell types were recombined to determine whether the complete steroidogenic pathway from pregnenolone to testosterone could be reconstituted. The recombination of follicular cells and oocytes resulted in testosterone production (Fig. 6 C), confirming that these two populations of cells were indeed sufficient to mediate complete steroidogenesis. Several intermediate steroids were also produced, including progesterone, DHEA, and AD, suggesting that the reconstituted system was less efficient than the intact ovary in producing testosterone. To confirm the physiologic importance of CYP17-mediated androgen production in Xenopus oocyte maturation, intact ovarian follicles were stimulated with β-HCG alone or in combination with the potent CYP17 inhibitor VN/85-1. The maximum amount of oocyte maturation induced by 100 units/ml β-HCG over 12 h was 47% (TableII, ethanol), which is consistent with more than 8 similar studies using identical conditions (data not shown). This amount of maturation is also similar to that seen when ovarian follicles were treated with 500 nm AD (TableII), 2W-H. Yang, L. B. Lutz, and S. R. Hammes, unpublished data. suggesting that ∼50% maturation is likely the maximum attainable under these conditions. Inhibition of CYP17 with VN/85-1 significantly decreased β-HCG-mediated oocyte maturation by 28%. As expected, VN/85-1 also decreased, but did not eliminate, both testosterone and AD production. Interestingly, although progesterone production increased slightly in the presence of VN/85-1, progesterone levels still remained quite low, suggesting that very little was being produced in vivo, even the presence of a CYP17 inhibitor. This result confirms the data in Fig. 6, where pregnenolone was shown to be inefficiently converted to progesterone by follicular cells. Together, these data suggest that CYP17-mediated androgen production may indeed be important for maturation in vivo. Incomplete inhibition of maturation by VN/85-1 was likely because of induction by the remaining AD and testosterone (which is 10-fold more potent than AD and progesterone (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar)), as well as perhaps by the slightly higher amounts of progesterone. Addition of 500 nm AD rescued the inhibitory effects of VN/85-1 by increasing AD and testosterone levels (Table II). Addition of exogenous progesterone also rescued the effects of VN/85-1 by increasing progesterone levels while androgen levels remained low. These data are consistent with earlier work where progesterone promoted maturation of isolated oocytes treated with ketoconazole (8Lutz L.B. Cole L.M. Gupta M.K. Kwist K.W. Auchus R.J. Hammes S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13728-13733Google Scholar), and suggest that, although low endogenous progesterone production precludes its importance relative to androgens in vivo, exogenous progesterone is still capable of promoting maturation in vitro.Table IIInhibition of β-HCG-induced oocyte maturation in Xenopus ovariesAntagonistInhibition of maturationSteroid concentrationTestosteroneADProgesterone%ng/g tissueEthanol095 ± 1057 ± 2.21.3 ± 0.26500 nmVN/85–128 ± 5.32.3 ± 2.46.0 ± 4.67.1 ± 3.0500 nm VN/85–1 + 500 nmAD6.4 ± 2.9106 ± 1081 ± 8.19.7 ± 3.6500 nm VN/85–1 + 500 nmprogesterone6.4 ± 0.94.0 ± 1.013 ± 5.5147 ± 6Ovarian fragments were treated with 100 units/ml of β-HCG in the presence of the indicated antagonist and steroids.

https://openalex.org/W2068033271,"Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen. COX assembly requires the coming together of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded subunits and the assistance of a large number of nuclear gene products acting at different stages of maturation of the enzyme. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of cytochrome c, encoded by CYC1 andCYC7, is required not only for electron transfer but also for COX assembly through a still unknown mechanism. We have attempted to distinguish between a functional and structural requirement of cytochrome c in COX assembly. Acyc1/cyc7 double null mutant strain was transformed with the cyc1–166 mutant gene (Schweingruber, M. E., Stewart, J. W., and Sherman, F. (1979) J. Biol.

The COX content of the cyc1/cyc7 double mutant strain harboring non-functional iso-1-cytochrome c has been characterized spectrally, functionally, and immunochemically. The results of these studies demonstrate that cytochrome c plays a structural rather than functional role in assembly of cytochrome coxidase. In addition to its requirement for COX assembly, cytochromec also affects turnover of the enzyme. Mutants containing wild type apocytochrome c in mitochondria lack COX, suggesting that only the folded and mature protein is able to promote COX assembly.

Iso-1-cytochrome c, encoded byCYC1 (1Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Margoliash E. Parker J. Campbell W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 1498-1504Google Scholar), accounts for ∼95% of the total cytochromec in mitochondria (2Sherman F. Taber H. Campbell W. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 21-39Google Scholar). The homologous and less abundant iso-2-cytochrome c is encoded by CYC7 (3Downie J.A. Stewart J.W. Brockman N. Schweingruber A.M. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 369-384Google Scholar). Even though iso-2-cytochrome c represents only 5% of the total cytochrome c, it is sufficient to support respiration and growth, albeit at a somewhat reduced rate on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol and ethanol (4Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Jackson M. Gilmore R.A. Parker J.H. Genetics. 1974; 77: 255-284Google Scholar). Mutations in both isoforms lead to a respiratory defect (3Downie J.A. Stewart J.W. Brockman N. Schweingruber A.M. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 369-384Google Scholar). In addition to the absence of cytochrome c, the double mutant is also deficient in cytochrome oxidase (COX) 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochromec oxidase; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; YPGal, 2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone; kb, kilobase (5Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20879-20882Google Scholar). The same phenotype is observed in cyc3 mutants that are blocked in the covalent attachment of heme to apocytochromec (6Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Hampsey D.M. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Google Scholar). The biochemical defect of cytochrome cmutants has all the hallmarks of COX assembly mutants. Mitochondria lack the absorption bands corresponding to cytochromeaa 3, and the steady-state concentrations of the mitochondrially encoded subunits 1, 2, and 3 of COX are reduced, presumably as a result of increased turnover of unassembled subunits (5Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20879-20882Google Scholar). The function of cytochrome c in COX assembly is not understood. Oxidized cytochrome c can accept electrons from cytochrome c 1 of the bc 1complex and cytochrome b 2 of lactate dehydrogenase. The principle function of reduced cytochromec is to donate electrons to cytochrome oxidase. Conceivably, cytochrome c could also promote an oxidation or reduction event essential for COX assembly. The obvious possibility that cytochrome c may be involved in heme A biosynthesis has been excluded (7Barros M.H. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 119-123Google Scholar). Alternatively, cytochrome c could be required in a structural capacity. For example, its interaction with a COX intermediate may be necessary for some step in the assembly pathway. In the present study we have tried to distinguish between a functional and structural requirement of cytochrome c in COX assembly. A cyc1/cyc7 double null mutant was transformed with a cyc1 mutant gene that was previously reported to express stable but catalytically inactive cytochrome c (8Schweingruber M.E. Stewart J.W. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4132-4143Google Scholar). The COX content of the cyc1/cyc7 mutant containing the non-functional form of iso-1-cytochrome c has been characterized spectrally, functionally, and immunochemically. The results of these analyses are consistent and point to a structural rather than functional role of cytochrome c in COX assembly. The genotypes and sources of the strains of S. cerevisiae used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast strains were routinely grown in 2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone (YPGal). The compositions of solid media have been described elsewhere (12Myers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A.

Open table in a new tab Wild type and mutant yeast were grown to stationary phase in YPGal. Unless otherwise indicated, mitochondria were prepared by the procedure of Faye et al. (13Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Google Scholar), except that zymolyase 20,000 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) instead of Glusulase was used at 24 °C to convert cells to spheroplasts. CYC1 was cloned as aXmaI-HindIII fragment into pUC18. The resultant plasmid pCYC1/ST1 was used to delete the gene with the bi-directional primers 5′-GGCGGTACCTATTAATTTAGTGTGTGTATTG and 5′-GGCGGTACCAACAGGCCCCTTTTCCTTTGTC. The PCR-amplified product containing 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences but lacking the entireCYC1 coding sequence was digested with KpnI and ligated to a 1-kb KpnI fragment containing the yeastURA3 gene. This plasmid (pCYC1/ST3) was used as a source of a linear 1.5-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment with the Δcyc1::URA3 allele. To delete CYC7, the gene was first PCR-amplified from yeast nuclear DNA with primers 5′-GGCGGATCCGAAGGGTCTGCAGTCCCCCGCC and 5′-GGCGGATCCCTGTAAGCGGAAGCGCCTCCAG. The 800-bp fragment containingCYC7 and flanking sequences was digested withBamH1 and cloned in YEp352B (this plasmid is identical to YEP352 (14Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Google Scholar) except that the multiple cloning sequence is replaced by a single BamH1 site), yielding pCYC7/ST2. CYC7 was deleted from CYC7/ST2 with the bi-directional primers 5′-GGCGAATTCGTTTTGTTTATGATGTAATGTAGTT and 5′-GGCGAATTCGGCTATGTCGTCGGAGGAG. The linear product containing 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences but lacking CYC7 was digested withEcoR1 and ligated to a 1.7-kb EcoR1 fragment containing the yeast TRP1 gene. The resultant plasmid pCYC7/ST4 was digested with BamH1 to obtain a linear 2-kb fragment with the Δcyc7::TRP1allele. The respiratory competent haploid yeast W303–1B was transformed with the linear 1.5-kb EcoR1-HindIII fragment containing the cyc1 null allele. A uracil prototrophic transformant was verified by PCR to be deleted for CYC1. This mutant, designated W303ΔCYC1, was transformed with the linear fragment containing the cyc7 null allele. Several uracil- and tryptophan-independent clones obtained from the transformation were confirmed by PCR to have the CYC7 deletion. One of the double mutants, W303ΔCYC1,7, was used for further studies. Thecyc1–166 mutation (8Schweingruber M.E. Stewart J.W. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4132-4143Google Scholar) was introduced into CYC1by PCR amplification of the region between the XmaI and internal KpnI site of pCYC1/ST1 with primers 5′-GGACCCGGGAGCAAGATCAAGATG and 5′-CTTGGTACCAGGAATATATTTCTTTGGGTTAGTCAAGTACTCTGACATGTTATTTTCGTCCGACAACACG. The fragment with the mutation was digested with a combination ofXmaI and KpnI and was substituted for the corresponding fragment in pCYC1/ST1, yielding pCYC1/W65S. The mutant gene was recovered as an XmaI-HindIII fragment and was transferred to YIp351 and YEp351 (14Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Google Scholar), yielding pCYC1/ST11 and pCYC1/ST12, respectively. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the insert in pCYC1/ST11. The mutant gene was integrated at theleu2 locus of W303–1B after linearization of pCYC1/ST11 at the ClaI site of the LEU2 marker in the plasmid. COX was assayed either spectrophotometrically by following the oxidation of ferro-cytochromec at 550 nm (15.Wharton, D. C., and Tzagoloff, A. (1967) 10,245–250.Google Scholar) or polarographically by measuring oxygen utilization with ascorbate plusN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) as the substrate. In the latter assay the reaction contained 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm ascorbic acid, 0.1 mm TMPD, and 50–100 μg of mitochondrial protein. Both assays were carried out at 24 °C. Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Yeast strains were transformed by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (17Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein synthesis was assayed in vivo in the presence of cycloheximide as described previously (11Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by PAGE in the buffer system of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Cytochromec was detected on Western blots using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against SDS-denatured yeast cytochrome cpurchased from Sigma. Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by a secondary reaction with the Super Signal detection kit (Pierce). Alternatively Western blots were first treated with antibody against cytochrome c followed by incubation with125I-protein and quantitation of the signals with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Deletion ofCYC1 reduces the rate but does not abolish growth of yeast on rich glycerol/ethanol medium (Ref. 4Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Jackson M. Gilmore R.A. Parker J.H. Genetics. 1974; 77: 255-284Google Scholar, Fig.1 A). In contrast, deletion of both CYC1 and CYC7 completely blocks growth on the non-fermentable carbon sources (Fig. 1 A). Wild type yeast has been shown to contain 95% iso-1-cytochrome cencoded by the CYC1 gene and 5% iso-2-cytochromec encoded by CYC7 (2Sherman F. Taber H. Campbell W. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 21-39Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of mitochondrial iso-2-cytochrome c expressed in thecyc1 null mutant is 12% of the total cytochromec detected in the parental wild type strain (Fig.1 B). This value is 2–3 times higher than the 5% iso-2-cytochrome c reported previously. This could be because of a difference in the strains or carbon sources used in two studies. It is also possible that the absence of CYC1results in an increased expression of iso-2-cytochromec. The spectral properties of the single and double null mutants are consistent with earlier studies showing that cyc1 andcyc7 mutants are able to synthesize COX, whereascyc1/cyc7 double mutants are totally deficient in the cytochrome aa 3 components of this respiratory complex (Ref. 4Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Jackson M. Gilmore R.A. Parker J.H. Genetics. 1974; 77: 255-284Google Scholar, Fig. 2). The spectral properties of the mutants correlate with the results of enzymatic assays. Spectrophotometric and polarographic assays indicate a reduction of COX activity in the single cyc1 mutant and a complete absence of activity in the double mutant (TableII).Table IIRespiratory and enzymatic activities in cyc mutants and transformantsStrainSpecific activityAscorbate-TMPD oxidation2-aThe specific activity is expressed as μmol of O2 consumed/min/mg of protein.Cyt.c oxidase2-bThe specific activities are expressed as μmol of cytochrome c (Cyt.c) oxidized or reduced/min/mg of protein.

Open table in a new tab Most COX mutants display a decreased incorporation of radioactive precursors into Cox1p but not Cox2p or Cox3p when mitochondrial translation is measured in vivo in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit cytoplasmic protein synthesis. 2A. Barrientos and A. Tzagoloff, unpublished information. This characteristic is shared by the cyc1/cyc7double mutant (Fig. 3). The in vivo assays also show that the absence of cytochrome cdoes not significantly affect the stability of Cox2p and Cox3p during a 90-min chase period. The double mutant also displays greatly reduced steady-state levels of the mitochondrially translated Cox1p and Cox2p as reported previously (Ref. 4Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Jackson M. Gilmore R.A. Parker J.H. Genetics. 1974; 77: 255-284Google Scholar and Fig.4). Although there is some reduction in Cox3p and some of the imported subunits (Cox4p and Cox5p), these constituents appear to be more stable (Fig. 4).Figure 4Steady-state levels of COX subunits in mutants and transformants. Mitochondria were prepared from the following strains grown at 24 °C on rich galactose medium (YPGal). W303–1B (W303), the wild type parental strain; W303ΔCYC1 (ΔCYC1), the cyc1 null mutant; W303ΔCYC1,7 (ΔCYC1,7), the cyc1, cyc7 double mutant; W303ΔCYC1,7/ST7 (ΔCYC1,7/ST7), the double mutant with a chromosomally integrated copy ofCYC1; W303ΔSCO1 (ΔSCO1), a sco1null mutant; W303ΔCOX15 (ΔCOX15), a cox15null mutant; W303ΔMSS51 (ΔMSS51), a mss51null mutant. Total mitochondrial proteins (20 μg for detection of cytochrome c and 40 μg for detection of COX subunits) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and reacted with antibodies to cytochrome c (Cyt. c) and COX subunits 1 (Cox1p), 2 (Cox2p), 3 (Cox3p), 4 (Cox4p), and 5 (Cox5p). The antibody-antigen complexes were visualized with the Super Signal chemiluminescent kit (Pierce).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Several mutant alleles ofcyc1 were previously shown to express catalytically inactive forms of iso-1-cytochrome c (4Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Jackson M. Gilmore R.A. Parker J.H. Genetics. 1974; 77: 255-284Google Scholar). One such allele (cyc1–166), coding for a W65S amino acid substitution, produces a protein that is stable at 24 °C but is unable to mediate electron transfer from the bc 1 complex to COX (8Schweingruber M.E. Stewart J.W. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4132-4143Google Scholar). These properties of iso-1-cytochrome c with the W65S mutation made it possible to examine if COX assembly depends on a redox active protein. A gene with the cyc1–166 mutation was made by PCR amplification of the appropriate coding region with the mutation in one of the primers. The mutant gene was integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the cyc1/cyc7 double mutant by targeted insertion at theleu2 locus (W303ΔCYC1,7/ST11). The mutant was also transformed with the gene on a high copy plasmid (W303ΔCYC1,7/ST12). Even though mitochondria from both transformants had immunochemically detectable cytochrome c (Fig. 1 B), neither the multicopy nor the integrated mutant gene was able to rescue the growth defect of the W303ΔCYC1,7 strain on glycerol at either 24 or 30 °C (Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis of mitochondria from the transformant with the integrated mutant gene indicated that the level of cytochrome c is ∼75% that seen in wild type (Fig. 1). The mitochondrial concentration of cytochrome c was somewhat lower in the transformant with the gene on a high copy plasmid (60% of wild type). The failure of the W65S mutant protein to support growth on non-fermentable carbon sources is in agreement with the previously noted deleterious effect of the mutation on the catalytic activity of iso-1-cytochrome c (8Schweingruber M.E. Stewart J.W. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4132-4143Google Scholar). The cyc1–166 mutant was reported to contain spectrally detectable cytochrome c but at lower concentrations than wild type yeast (8Schweingruber M.E. Stewart J.W. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4132-4143Google Scholar). This was also true of the cyc1/cyc7null strain transformed with the cyc1–166 gene in the integrative or episomal plasmid (Fig. 2 A). The spectra of mitochondria from both strains indicated only a partial restoration of cytochrome c (compare the double mutant with the ST11, ST12 transformants in Fig. 2 A). The concentrations of cytochromec in mitochondria of the transformant with the integrated mutant gene and of the wild type strain were determined from spectra of extracts obtained by sonic disruption of mitochondria in the presence of salt. Under these conditions most of the cytochrome c is rendered soluble, whereas other cytochromes associated with the respiratory chain complexes remain in the membrane fraction (Fig.2 B). The concentrations of cytochrome c in wild type and the mutant mitochondria were estimated to be 0.32 and 0.08 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. The mutant iso-1-cytochromec represents only 25% of cytochrome c in wild type yeast. Because the amount of iso-2-cytochrome c in the mutant detected immunologically is 75% of wild type (Fig.1 B), only 30% of the W65S protein contains heme. The status of COX in the cyc1/cyc7 null strain harboring thecyc1–166 allele was examined in several ways. Spectra of mitochondrial cytochromes indicated the presence of cytochromesaa 3 when the mutant protein was expressed either from the chromosomally integrated or plasmid-borne gene (Fig. 2). The presence of the integrated or episomal copy of the cyc1–166allele restored cytochrome aa 3 to more than 50% of the level seen in wild type mitochondria (Fig. 2 A). The ability of iso-1-cytochrome c with the W65S mutation to rescue the COX deficiency of the cyc1/cyc7 strain was confirmed by enzyme assays and by Western analysis of COX subunits proteins, which indicated that the steady-state levels of the mitochondrially encoded Cox1p, Cox2p, and Cox3p were restored to nearly wild type levels (compare Fig. 4 and see Fig. 6 C). Two different assays were used to measure COX activity. The first relied on the reduction of endogenous cytochrome c in mitochondria by ascorbate in the presence of TMPD. Using this assay thecyc1 null mutant had 40% of wild type COX, whereas no activity was detected in the cyc1/cyc7 double mutant (TableII). Predictably, the double mutant transformed with thecyc1–166 gene was also completely inactive in catalyzing ascorbic acid oxidation by oxygen (Table II). When the assays were repeated in the presence of exogenous cytochrome c, the specific activity of COX in the cyc1 mutant was raised to 70% that of wild type, whereas thecyc1/cyc7 strain with the integratedcyc-166 gene was comparable with that of wild type (TableII). Similar results were obtained when the COX activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring oxidation of substrate amounts of reduced cytochrome c (Table II). Surprisingly, the COX activity measured by both assays was lower in the transformant expressing the W65S protein from a multicopy plasmid. This was not true of the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activities, which were nearly the same in all the strains (Table II). The spectrum of mitochondrial cytochromes also showed a lower concentration of cytochromes aa 3 in the high copy transformant than in the strain with the integrated gene (Fig. 2). The lower COX activity in the multicopy transformant could be explained by a kinetic block because of limited accessibility or exchange of the wild type substrate cytochrome c with the W65S mutant protein. This was tested by depletion of the iso-1-cytochromec from mitochondria before the assay. After sonic irradiation of wild type mitochondria in the presence of 1m KCl, COX activity was reduced to 15% of the starting values (Table III). The specific activity returned to normal levels when the depleted mitochondria were assayed polarographically or spectrophotometrically in the presence of added cytochrome c. Under these conditions, however, the specific activity of mitochondria from the high copy transformant measured in the presence of cytochrome c was even lower after depletion (Table III). At present, therefore, the reason for the observed difference COX between the single and multicopy transformants is not clear.Table IIIEffect of cytochrome c depletion on the NADH-cytochrome c and COX activities of cyc mutantsStrainSpecific activityAscorbate-TMPD oxidation3-aSpecific activity is expressed as μmol of O2consumed/min/mg of protein.Cyt.c oxidase3-bSpecific activities are expressed as μmol of cytochromec (Cyt. c) oxidized or reduced/min/mg of protein.

ND, not determined. The difference in the amount of spectrally (25% of wild type) and immunochemically (75% of wild type) detectable iso-1-cytochrome c in thecyc1/cyc7 null strain transformed with thecyc1–166 gene (Figs. 1 and 2) indicates that only 30% of the protein associated with mitochondria contains heme. The intra-mitochondrial location of the wild type and of the W65S mutant proteins was compared by testing their sensitivity to proteinase K in mitochondria and mitoplasts. Most of the iso-1-cytochrome cin the strain with the chromosomally integrated cyc1–166allele was found to be susceptible to digestion by the protease in intact mitochondria (Fig. 5, upper panel). A small fraction corresponding to 10%, however, was in a proteinase K-protected compartment. Even though all the protein sedimented with mitoplasts, it was completely sensitive to proteinase K. In contrast, cytochrome c in wild type mitochondria is digested by the protease only when they are converted to mitoplasts (Fig. 5, lower panel). Sco1p, an inner membrane protein previously shown to face the intermembrane space (22Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 372: 33191-33196Google Scholar), cytochromeb 2, a soluble intermembrane marker, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, a soluble matrix protein, showed the expected properties in the mitochondria and mitoplasts (Fig.3 B). These results indicate that some 90% of the mutant protein is associated with mitochondria in a manner that makes it accessible to proteinase K. Whether it is bound to the outer membrane or is only partially inserted into the intermembrane space has not been determined. The small fraction of W65S protein resistant to proteinase K in mitochondria probably corresponds to mature protein located in the intermembrane space, whereas the more abundant fraction digested by the protease is probably mostly mutant apoprotein. Because transport of cytochrome c to the intermembrane space of mitochondria has been shown to be coupled to heme addition (23Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Google Scholar), the protease sensitivity of most of the W65S protein suggests, notwithstanding the fact that the tryptophan at residue 65 is not covalently linked to heme, its replacement by a serine must reduce the efficiency of heme attachment to the apoprotein. Mutations in the cysteine ligands of heme have also been shown to impede apocytochrome c import into mitochondria in vitro (23Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Google Scholar). In these studies most of the mutant apocytochrome c was also found to cosediment with mitochondria even though it was not protected against the protease (23Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Google Scholar). The absence of COX in cyc1/cyc7 mutants has been interpreted to indicate that cytochrome c plays a role in assembly of this respiratory complex (5Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20879-20882Google Scholar). Alternatively, cytochrome c could protect COX against proteolysis. The partial instability of the W65S protein at 37 °C (8Schweingruber M.E. Stewart J.W. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4132-4143Google Scholar) made it possible to examine the effect of cytochrome c on the half-life of COX. The wild type parental strain and the cyc1/cyc7 mutant with the chromosomally integrated cy1c-166 gene were grown to early stationary phase at 24 °C in rich galactose medium. The cultures were treated with cycloheximide to prevent synthesis of new proteins and were further incubated at 37 °C for different times. Approximately 80% of the protein was degraded as early as 1 h after the temperature switch. Longer times at 37 °C led to progressively greater destruction, with only 4% of the starting protein remaining after a 14-h incubation. Wild type cytochromec was also reduced at the higher temperature, although the extent, even after overnight incubation, was much less (Fig.6 A). Incubation of the mutant cells at 37 °C caused greater than 90% loss of COX activity after 14 h of incubation (Fig.6 A). The decrease in the specific activity was accompanied by a partial reduction in the cytochromes aa 3absorption bands (Fig. 6 B). The loss of enzymatic activity, however, preceded the reduction in the cytochromeaa 3 bands. For example, even though less than 25% of the starting activity remained after 4 h at 37 °C, the cytochromes aa 3 peaks were only marginally reduced (Fig. 6, A and B). Western analyses of COX subunits also indicated very partial losses of Cox1p, Cox2p, Cox3p, and Cox5p during the first 4 h at 37 °C (Fig. 6 C). The most significant change was a large decrease of Cox1p in the mutant after the overnight incubation. In the wild type strain COX was highly stable at 37 °C, with more than 90% of enzyme and activity after 14 h of incubation at the high temperature (Fig. 6 A). Western analysis also failed to reveal any significant reductions in the COX subunits after different times at 37 °C. The NADH-cytochromec reductase activities decreased to approximately the same extent in the wild type and the mutant. At present it is not clear if this is caused by a destabilization of the dehydrogenase, thebc 1 complex, or the coenzyme Q pool at 37 °C. The spectrum of mitochondria from mutant cells grown exponentially at 37 °C exhibited an almost complete absence of cytochromes aa 3, similar to thecyc1,7 double mutant (Fig. 6 D). The marked decrease of COX activity in mutant cells exposed to 37 °C for 4 h even though cytochromes aa 3 and steady-state concentrations of COX subunits are unaffected during this period suggests some more subtle changes in the quaternary structure or some other aspect of the enzyme. This is also seen in the wild type strain but to a lesser degree. These results suggest that the main role of cytochrome c is in assembly but that it also contributes toward the stability of the enzyme. The latter role is especially evident after prolonged incubation at 37 °C, which leads to turnover of Cox1p, more extensive loss of cytochromesaa 3, and a virtually complete absence of enzyme activity (Fig. 6). The degradation of COX in mutant cells undergoing cytochrome c degradation may be similar to the loss of COX induced by mitochondrial cytochrome c release in wild type yeast committed to programmed cell death (24Ludovico P. Rodrigues F. Almeida A. Silva M.T. Barrientos A. Corte-Real M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2598-2606Google Scholar). Apocytochromec is imported into the intermembrane space of mitochondria, where it is matured by covalent attachment of protoheme (23Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Google Scholar, 25Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19034-19042Google Scholar). This reaction, catalyzed by the heme lyase product of CYC3, fixes the mature heme protein in the intermembrane space. Apocytochromec exits from the intermembrane space when heme attachment is blocked as a result of mutations in the lyase. Hence cyc3mutants like cyc1/cyc7 mutants are COX-deficient (Ref. 5Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20879-20882Google Scholar, Fig.7 A). To test if apocytochrome c is able to promote COX assembly, a cyc3 null mutant was transformed with CYC1 andCYC7 on high copy plasmids (ST13 and ST5, respectively. Both yeast transformants accumulate some apocytochrome c (Fig.7 B). The concentration of apocytochrome c in mitochondria of the cyc3 mutant transformed with the respective genes was lower than in wild type and was further reduced after treatment with proteinase K. The mitochondrial concentrations of iso-1 or iso-2-apocytochrome c in the proteinase K-protected compartment is comparable with the amount of iso-2-cytochromec present in the cyc1 mutant, which is able to express at least 70% of the normal amount of COX (Fig.8). Neither of the two cyc3transformants, however, contained COX either by spectral (Fig.7 A) or enzymatic criteria (not shown). Additionally, Western analysis of COX subunits indicated that despite the presence of apocytochrome c in mitochondria of the two transformants, there was no increase in the steady-state concentrations of Cox2p and Cox3p. These results indicate that apocytochrome c is unable to promote COX assembly. The present study shows that assembly of COX depends on the presence of cytochrome c in mitochondria even when the latter is unable to function in electron transport. The requirement for cytochromec, therefore, is not related to either reduction or oxidation of some group in a subunit or assembly intermediate of COX. We estimate that the molar concentration of cytochrome c in mitochondria of wild type yeast is approximately the same as that of COX. Assembly of COX, therefore, does not depend on stoichiometric concentration of cytochrome c. Iso-2-cytochromec, whose concentration in a cyc1 mutant is only 12% of the total amount of cytochrome c in wild type yeast, is able to support the expression of 70% of normal amounts of COX. This lack of requirement for stoichiometry is also supported by the results obtained with the W65S mutant. Because the apoprotein cannot substitute for the mature cytochrome, the function of cytochromec probably depends on a properly folded protein. This is consistent with a structural role in COX assembly. In addition to its requirement for assembly, the results of obtained with the W65S mutant exposed to 37 °C indicate that cytochrome c also affects turnover of COX. Note Added in Proof-It has been brought to our attention that in the article by Komar-Panicucci et al. (Komar-Panicucci, S., Sherman, F., and McLendon, G. (1996) Biochemistry 35,4878–4885), mutations affecting the redox potential of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c and resulting in its lower reactivity with the ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase complex were found to lead to increased expression of cytochrome oxidase."

In his Perspective, [Shindell][1] shows that models have difficulty reproducing these changes, raising doubt over their ability to elucidate the causes of the observed changes or predict future trends. He argues that these difficulties can largely be attributed to gravity waves, which are not yet well represented in the models. These waves are generated by atmospheric disturbances such as storm fronts, strong wind shears, and flow over mountains and play a key role in many of the observed changes.

https://openalex.org/W2151739319,"Abstract The TR4 orphan receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that modulates gene expression via binding to the AGGTCA direct repeat hormone response element. Here we report a functional study of TR4 interaction with the core promoter of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that TR4 can bind to the direct repeat 1 sequence element (AGGTTAAAGGTCT, nucleotide coordinates 1757–1769, TR4RE-HBV) on the HBV core promoter. TR4 also can enhance the activity of a synthetic luciferase reporter linked with four copies of TR4RE-HBV in either liver HepG2 or non-liver H1299 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, TR4 represses the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the entire HBV genome sequences. Moreover, mutation of this TR4RE-HBV site in the HBV core promoter diminishes the TR4 suppression effect. This TR4-induced suppression of HBV core promoter activity is further confirmed by primer extension analysis of the HBV core RNAs, showing that TR4 represses both pre-core and core mRNAs. Further dissection of this repressive mechanism indicates that TR4 may suppress the HBV core promoter activity via repressing HNF4α-mediated transactivation by protein-protein interactions without inhibition of HNF4α DNA binding. Furthermore, our results indicate that the N- and C-terminal regions of TR4 protein are required for TR4-HNF4α interaction. It is possible that TR4-HNF4α interaction may block the HNF4α function that results in the suppression of HBV gene expression. Together, these results demonstrate that TR4 can serve as a negative modulator in the transcriptional regulation of HBV core gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2041299584,"When blood coagulation factor IX is converted to activated factor IX (factor IXa), it develops enzymatic activity and exposes the binding sites for both activated factor VIII and the endocytic receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In the present study we investigated the interaction between factor IXa and LRP in more detail, using an affinity-purified soluble form of LRP (sLRP). Purified sLRP and full-length LRP displayed similar binding to factor IXa. An anti-factor IX monoclonal antibody CLB-FIX 13 inhibited factor IXa·sLRP complex formation. Both the antibody and a soluble recombinant fragment of LRP (i.e. cluster IV) interfered with factor IXa amidolytic activity, suggesting that the antibody and LRP share similar binding regions near the active site of factor IXa. Next, a panel of recombinant factor IXa variants with amino acid replacements in the surface loops bordering the active site was tested for binding to antibody CLB-FIX 13 and sLRP in a solid phase binding assay. Factor IXa variants with mutations in the region Phe342–Asn346, located between the active site of factor IXa and factor VIII binding helix, showed reduced binding to both antibody CLB-FIX 13 and sLRP. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the variant with Asn346 replaced by Asp displayed slower association to sLRP, whereas the variant with residues Phe342–Tyr345 replaced by the corresponding residues of thrombin showed faster dissociation. Recombinant soluble LRP fragment cluster IV inhibited factor IXa-mediated activation of factor X with IC50 values of 5 and 40 nm in the presence and absence of factor VIII, respectively. This inhibition thus seems to occur via two mechanisms: by interference with factor IXa·factor VIIIa complex assembly and by direct inhibition of factor IXa enzymatic activity. Accordingly, we propose that LRP may function as a regulator of blood coagulation.

Accordingly, we propose that LRP may function as a regulator of blood coagulation. Factor IX (FIX) 1The abbreviations used are: FIX, factor IX; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HSA, human serum albumin; FIXa, activated factor IX; FVIII, factor VIII; FVIIIa, activated factor VIII; FX, factor X; FXa, activated factor X; LMW, low molecular weight; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; pNA, para-nitroanilide; RAP, receptor-associated protein; sLRP soluble LRP, SPR, surface plasmon resonance is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease precursor that, upon activation, participates in the blood coagulation process (1Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-706Google Scholar). Its relevance for hemostasis is demonstrated by the fact that the absence of functional FIX is associated with severe hemophilia B. FIX circulates in plasma as a 56-kDa single-chain zymogen. Upon initiation of blood coagulation, FIX is converted into its active form FIXa by means of limited proteolysis mediated by factor VIIa·tissue factor complex or factor XIa (2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Google Scholar). During this process, the activation peptide is cleaved off resulting in a two-chain molecule comprising covalently linked light and heavy chains. The NH2-terminal light chain (18 kDa) is composed of a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing domain and two epidermal growth factor-like domains (3Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Google Scholar, 4Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal heavy chain (28 kDa) contains a trypsin-like protease domain that carries the enzymatic activity of FIXa (5Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6461-6464Google Scholar). Upon activation, FIXa forms a complex with activated factor VIII (FVIIIa). This complex then catalyzes FX activation in the presence of Ca2+ ions and phospholipid surface, which leads to further propagation of blood coagulation (6van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Google Scholar, 7Mertens K. van Wijngaarden A. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 654-660Google Scholar). Various mechanisms have been proposed to control FIXa activity. First, FIXa may be inactivated via limited proteolysis mediated by elastase or plasmin (8Takaki A. Enfield D.L. Thompson A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1706-1715Google Scholar, 9Samis J.A. Kam E. Nesheim M.E. Giles A.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 1287-1296Google Scholar, 10Samis J.A. Ramsey G.D. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. Giles A.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 943-951Google Scholar). Second, FIXa may form a complex with the serine protease inhibitors antithrombin or protease nexin-2 (11Bjork I. Jackson C.M. Jornvall H. Lavine K.K. Nordling K. Salsgiver W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2406-2411Google Scholar, 12Schmaier A.H. Dahl L.D. Rozemuller A.J. Roos R.A. Wagner S.L. Chung R. van Nostrand W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2540-2545Google Scholar, 13Rosenberg J.S. McKenna P.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8883-8888Google Scholar). It has been reported that the FIXa·protease nexin-2 complex is recognized and internalized by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (14Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the FIXa enzyme itself is a ligand for LRP as well (15Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Mertens K. ter Maat H. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. Lenting P.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3459-3465Google Scholar). LRP, also known as α2-macroglobulin receptor or CD91, is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family of transmembrane glycoproteins (16Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964Google Scholar, 17Neels J.G. Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M. Pannekoek H. Zonneveld A.-J. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1998; 12: 219-240Google Scholar). LRP consists of two noncovalently associated chains: the amino-terminal extracellular α-chain (515 kDa) and the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane β-chain (85 kDa). The cytoplasmic part of the β-chain contains the endocytosis-specific signal motif, whereas the α-chain contains 4 regions enriched in complement-type repeats, also called LRP clusters I, II, III, and IV (18Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Google Scholar). LRP clusters II and IV have been identified to be predominant in terms of ligand binding (19Neels J.G. van Den Berg B.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Google Scholar). LRP exhibits a remarkable ability to bind a broad range of structurally and functionally unrelated ligands (16Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964Google Scholar,17Neels J.G. Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M. Pannekoek H. Zonneveld A.-J. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1998; 12: 219-240Google Scholar). This implies that LRP may participate in a number of processes that include lipoprotein metabolism, cell growth and migration, neuronal regeneration, fibrinolysis, and blood coagulation. LRP is most prominently present in the brain, liver, lung, and placenta. The many cell types that express LRP are, among others, parenchymal cells, Kupffer cells, neurons, astrocytes, smooth muscle cells, monocytes, adipocytes, and fibroblasts (20Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Google Scholar). A truncated form of LRP, referred to as soluble LRP or sLRP, circulates in plasma (21Quinn K.A. Grimsley P.G. Dai Y.P. Tapner M. Chesterman C.N. Owensby D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23946-23951Google Scholar). It comprises the complete ligand binding α-chain and the NH2-terminal portion of the β-chain (22Quinn K.A. Pye V.J. Dai Y.P. Chesterman C.N. Owensby D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 433-441Google Scholar). It has been shown that low molecular weight heparin effectively interferes with the binding of FIXa to LRP (15Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Mertens K. ter Maat H. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. Lenting P.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3459-3465Google Scholar). Because FIXa binds heparin with high affinity (23Jordan R.E. Oosta G.M. Gardner W.T. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10073-10080Google Scholar), this suggests that heparin and LRP might require the same structural determinants for their interaction with FIXa. Nevertheless, FIX zymogen also exhibits high affinity heparin binding (24Andersson L.O. Borg H. Miller-Andersson M. Thromb. Res. 1975; 7: 451-459Google Scholar), yet it fails to bind to LRP. Clearly, additional regions that become available upon FIX activation must participate in FIXa interaction with LRP. The aim of the present study was to identify regions within the FIXa molecule that contribute to the interaction with LRP. By using monoclonal anti-FIX antibodies and recombinant FIXa chimeric molecules, we have found that the FIXa surface region Phe342–Asn346 contributes to the interaction between FIXa and LRP. Moreover, we show that LRP binding affects the enzymatic function of FIXa. CNBr-Sepharose 4B, Q-Sepharose FF, glutathione-Sepharose, and Protein A-Sepharose were from AmershamBiosciences.

BIAcoreTM-2000 and -3000 biosensor system and reagents (amino-coupling kit and CM-5 biosensor chips) were from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). sLRP was purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography employing receptor-associated protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-RAP) being coupled to Sepharose, with 1 mg of GST-RAP (see the following section) coupled per ml of CNBr-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma was centrifuged and the supernatant was filtrated through a 0.4-μm filter. The filtrate was supplemented with 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, 50 units/ml heparin, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) by the addition of 10 times concentrated buffer. 400 ml of filtrate was then loaded onto a RAP-Sepharose column (20 ml). The column was extensively washed with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and bound sLRP was subsequently eluted using the same buffer, but then with CaCl2 replaced by 20 mm EDTA. Remaining contaminants were removed by ion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column employing a gradient from 0.025 to 1 m NaCl in 5% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm Hepes (pH 8.0). Purified sLRP was subsequently concentrated on the same column by elution with 1 m NaCl in the presence of 10 mm Pefabloc. Concentrated sLRP was extensively dialyzed against the buffer containing 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4).

GST-RAP was purified employing glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because the GST tag does not interfere with binding properties of RAP (25Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Google Scholar), GST-RAP was used in the present study. Full-length human LRP was generously provided by Dr. S. Moestrup, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark. Transfected baby hamster kidney cell lines (a kind gift of Dr. H.

Stable cell lines producing FIX variants were obtained by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method and selection with geneticin (32Kolkman J.A. Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29087-29093Google Scholar). As reported previously, the expression system used in this study yields recombinant FIX molecules with normal calcium-dependent properties and similar activities for recombinant wild type and plasma-derived FIXa (26Lenting P.J. ter Maat H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20214-20220Google Scholar). Recombinant FIX was purified by affinity chromatography employing anti-FIX monoclonal antibody CLB-FIX 14 from concentrated medium obtained by culturing cell lines producing FIX in 1-liter cell factories (35Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. Maat H. Rees D.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25332-25337Google Scholar). FIX was converted into FIXa by limited FXIa-mediated proteolysis as described (26Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Google Scholar). FIXa was purified from the activation mixture employing anion exchange chromatography (26Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), using HSA as a standard. FIX antigen levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay employing a previously described method (26Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Google Scholar). FIXa concentrations were determined by active-site titration with antithrombin in the presence of heparin (26Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Google Scholar). FIXa amidolytic activity was measured as described previously (26Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14884-14890Google Scholar). Shortly, the conversion of 2.5 mm CH3-SO2-LGR-pNA by FIXa was determined in a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar) in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2% (w/v) HSA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4 or 8.4) by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. FX activation was performed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine in 1 to 1 m ratio), essentially as previously described (30Mertens K. Cupers R. van Wijngaarden A. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 599-605Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles (100 μm) and calcium ions were preincubated in siliconized glass tubes for 10 min in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.5% (w/v) ovalbumin, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). After preincubation, FIXa (15 nm) with or without the LRP clusters II or IV (also preincubated for 10 min) was added. The reaction was started by addition of FX (200 nm). When FX activation was measured in the presence of FVIII, FVIII (0.3 nm) and thrombin (5 nm) were added 1 min before the reaction was started. FIXa concentration was then 0.3 nm. Subsamples were drawn in time and the reaction was terminated in buffer containing EDTA and 1 unit/ml hirudin. The amount of FXa generated was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm, employing Pefachrome Xa substrate as previously described (30Mertens K. Cupers R. van Wijngaarden A. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 599-605Google Scholar). Studies were performed using the BIAcoreTM biosensor system, based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. SPR analysis was performed essentially as described previously (38Lenting P.J. Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Clijsters P.P. Meijerman D.W. Pannekoek H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23734-23739Google Scholar). Proteins were immobilized onto CM5 sensorchips using the amine coupling method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Routinely, a control channel was activated and blocked in the absence of protein. Binding to coated channels was corrected for binding to noncoated channel (<5% of binding to coated channel). SPR analysis was performed in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at 25 °C with a flow of 20 μl/min. The sensorchips were regenerated by incubating with 100 mm H3PO4 for 30 s at a flow of 20 μl/min. For quantitative measurements of FIXa binding to LRP or sLRP, experiments were performed using 7 different concentrations (6–110 nm) of FIXa. BIAevaluation 3.1 software (Biacore AB) was used to analyze the association and dissociation curves of the sensorgrams. Interaction constants were determined by performing nonlinear global fitting of data corrected for bulk refractive index changes. Data were fitted according to various models available within the software. A model describing the interaction between FIXa and two independent binding sites (heterologous ligand, parallel reactions) was found to provide the best fit of the experimental data for both sLRP and full-length LRP. This same model was previously used by us to describe the interaction between FIXa and full-length LRP (15Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Mertens K. ter Maat H. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. Lenting P.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3459-3465Google Scholar). Purified sLRP was adsorbed onto microtiter wells (88 fmol/well) in 50 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.5) for 16 h at 4 °C in a volume of 50 μl/well. The wells were then blocked with 2% (w/v) HSA in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 37 °C in a volume of 100 μl. After washing, 50 μl of FIXa was added in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.1% (w/v) HSA, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Bound FIXa was detected by incubating with peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody CLB-FIX 11 for 15 min at 37 °C in a volume of 50 μl. Monoclonal antibodies CLB-FIX 13 or CLB-FIX 14 were adsorbed onto the microtiter wells (3.3 pmol/well and 0.33 pmol/well respectively) in 50 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.5) for 16 h at 4 °C in a volume of 50 μl/well. The wells were blocked with 2% (w/v) HSA in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 37 °C in a volume of 100 μl. After washing, 50 μl of FIXa in concentrations between 0 and 10 nm was added in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.1% (w/v) HSA, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Bound FIXa was detected by incubating with 50 μl of peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody CLB-FIX 11 for 1 h at 37 °C. Experiments were performed under pseudo first-order rate conditions essentially as previously described (39Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 nm FIXa was incubated with 1.5 μmantithrombin and 400 nm LMW heparin at 37 °C in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2% HSA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Subsamples of 50 μl were drawn in regular intervals between 10 s and 5 min and pipetted into a 96-well microtiter plate containing Polybrene (1 mg/ml final concentration) to stop the action of heparin immediately. Chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 was added at a final concentration of 1.5 mm and residual FIXa activity was measured at 405 nm. The time-dependent inhibition of FIXa activity was fitted to a first-order rate equation to obtain values for the apparent pseudo first-order rate constant. To study FIXa-LRP interaction we made use of the truncated soluble form of LRP (sLRP) (21Quinn K.A. Grimsley P.G. Dai Y.P. Tapner M. Chesterman C.N. Owensby D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23946-23951Google Scholar). sLRP was purified from human plasma employing RAP-GST based affinity chromatography. The product obtained was homogeneous as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, sLRP efficiently bound GST-RAP, FVIII light chain, and FIXa (data not shown), all of which are established ligands for LRP. The interaction between FIXa and both full-length LRP and sLRP was analyzed in more detail by assessing the association and dissociation rate constants. For both LRP species, the experimental data displayed a faster and a slower phase in FIXa binding and could be adequately described employing a heterologous two-site binding model, indicating the presence of (i) an interaction site with fast binding and somewhat lower affinity, and (ii) an interaction site with slower binding but high affinity for FIXa (class 1 and class 2 binding sites, respectively). The calculated association (k on) and dissociation (k off) rate constants that followed from this model were similar for full-length LRP and sLRP (Table I), indicating that sLRP and full-length LRP are indistinguishable in terms of FIXa binding. Binding of FIXa to sLRP was further analyzed in an immunosorbent assay by incubating immobilized sLRP with FIXa in various concentrations. Bound FIXa was detected using monoclonal anti-FIX antibody CLB-FIX 11, which is directed against the Gla domain of FIXa (40Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Cherel G. Boon-Spi"
https://openalex.org/W2012839060,"Abstract A conserved sequence motif within the class 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) domain of CTP synthases was identified. The sequence motif in the Lactococcus lactisenzyme is 429GGTLRLG435. This motif was present only in CTP synthases and not in other enzymes that harbor the GATase domain. Therefore, it was speculated that this sequence was involved in GTP activation of CTP synthase. Other members of the GATase protein family are not activated allosterically by GTP. Residues Thr-431 and Arg-433 were changed by site directed mutagenesis to the sterically similar residues valine and methionine, respectively. The resulting enzymes, T431V and R433M, had both lost the ability for GTP to activate the uncoupled glutaminase activity and showed reduced GTP activation of the glutamine-dependent CTP synthesis reaction. The T431V enzyme had a similar activation constant, KA , for GTP, but the activation was only 2–3-fold compared with 35-fold for the wild type enzyme. The R433M enzyme was found to have a 10–15-fold lower KA for GTP and a concomitant decrease in V app. The activation by GTP of this enzyme was about 7-fold. The kinetic parameters for saturation with ATP, UTP, and NH4Cl were similar for wild type and mutant enzymes, except that the R433M enzyme only had half theV app of the wild type enzyme when NH4Cl was the amino donor. The mutant enzymes T431V and R433M apparently had not lost the ability to bind GTP, but the signal transmitted through the enzyme to the active sites upon binding of the allosteric effector was clearly disrupted in the mutant enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2071605848,"The analysis of the active site region in the crystal structures of template-primer-bound KlenTaq (Klenow fragment equivalent of Thermus aquaticus polymerase I) shows the presence of an ∼18-Å long H-bonding track contributed by the Klenow fragment equivalent of Asn845, Gln849, Arg668, His881, and Gln677. Its location is nearly diagonal to the helical axis of the template-primer. Four base pairs in the double stranded region proximal to 3′ OH end of the primer terminus appear to interact with individual amino acid components of the track through either the bases or sugar moieties. To understand the functional significance of this H-bonding network in the catalytic function of Klenow fragment (KF), we generated N845A, N845Q, Q849A, Q849N, R668A, H881A, H881V, Q677A, and Q677N mutant species by site-directed mutagenesis. All of the mutant enzymes showed low catalytic activity. The kinetic analysis of mutant enzymes indicated that K m.dNTP was not significantly altered, but K D.DNA was significantly increased. Thus the mutant enzymes of the H-bonding track residues had decreased affinity for template-primer, although the extent of decrease was variable. Most interestingly, even the reduced binding of TP by the mutant enzymes occurs in the nonproductive mode. These results demonstrate that an H-bonding track is necessary for the binding of template-primer in the catalytically competent orientation in the pol I family of enzymes. The examination of the interactive environment of individual residues of this track further clarifies the mode of cooperation in various functional domains of pol I.

Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I E. coli DNA polymerase I dithiothreitol template-primer Klenow fragment equivalent of T. aquaticus DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment equivalent of B. stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I wild-type Sequence alignment of various nucleic acid polymerases has revealed the presence of several conserved motifs (motifs A–E) in diverse DNA polymerase families (1Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Google Scholar, 2Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Google Scholar, 3Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Google Scholar). Two of these motifs (motifs A and C) are absolutely conserved in all DNA polymerase families, whereas the conservation of other motifs is restricted to individual families. Two conserved aspartates, one belonging, respectively, to motifs A and C each, serve as ligands for divalent cations (4Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J.

Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Google Scholar, 2Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Google Scholar, 7Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Google Scholar). The Klenow fragment (KF)1 ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I has been extensively used as a model system for understanding the structural basis for the polymerase reaction mechanism. The crystal structures have shown the 68-kDa KF folds into two distinct domains, a ∼200-amino acid long 3′-5′ exonuclease domain at the N-terminal, and a ∼400-residue polymerase domain at the C-terminal (8Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Google Scholar, 9Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Google Scholar, 10Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14095-14101Google Scholar). The polymerase domain, which anatomically resembles a half-open right-hand, consists of a cleft formed by three subdomains designated as fingers, palm, and thumb (8Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Google Scholar, 10Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14095-14101Google Scholar). These subdomains have been implicated in different functions of polymerases (7Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Google Scholar). The active site constituted by motifs A and C resides at the palm subdomain, the dNTP binding site at the fingers subdomain, and the template-primer binding site at the thumb subdomain (7Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Google Scholar). The crystal structures of several DNA polymerases complexed with template-primer and dNTP have shown the participation of individual amino acid residues in the respective polymerase function (4Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Google Scholar, 6Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Google Scholar, 11Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Google Scholar,12Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Google Scholar). In particular, the crystal structures of binary and ternary complexes of the Klenow fragment of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I (KlenTaq) can be considered to represent the snapshots of initial steps of the nucleotidyltransferase reaction pathway of DNA polymerases (11Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Google Scholar). The analyses of these crystal structures together with the crystal structure of apo-KlenTaq revealed that the binding of template-primer to the enzyme induces a conformational rearrangement of the side chains of several residues present at the active site. We noted that resulting from this conformational change in the side chains is the formation of a predominately hydrogen bonded network of ∼18 Å long at the bottom of the cleft (Fig. 1). This network of hydrogen bonding (called “H-bonding track” hereafter) is present in both binary and in the “open” and “closed” conformations of the ternary complexes. The residues that participate in the formation of the H-bond track are highly conserved in the pol I family of DNA polymerases. They are equivalent to the E. coli pol I residues Asn845, Gln849, Arg668, His881, and Gln677. To understand the significance of the H-bonding track residues at the active site of pol I and their functional contribution, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of Asn845, Gln849, Arg668, His881, and Gln677. These residues were mutated to both conserved and nonconserved (alanine) residues. Properties of the mutant proteins were then investigated to assess their individual participation in the catalytic function of KF. All of the mutants showed decreased catalytic activity, albeit to different degrees, suggesting the involvement of these residues in the catalytic function of pol I. Most importantly, all of the mutant enzymes showed significantly reduced (15–75-fold) template-primer binding affinity compared with wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, neither the conservative nor the nonconservative mutant enzymes showed ability to form prepolymerase binary or ternary complexes. Similarly, unlike the wild-type enzyme, the enzyme-TP covalent complexes generated for individual mutant species of all five residues failed to catalyze in situ addition of substrate dNTP. These results together with the structural analysis of the binary and ternary complexes of pol I family DNA polymerases strongly implicate the function of H-bonding track residues in the binding of template-primer at the proper position and orientation, which is prerequisite for the nucleotidyltransferase function of polymerases. An examination of the location of some of the highly conserved residues present in the different motifs of pol I, in the context of the H-bonding track, further reveals the coordinated participation of all of these motifs in the catalytic function. All mutant enzymes were generated from the plasmid (pCJ141) generously provided by Dr. Catherine Joyce of Yale University. This construct contains the E. coli polA gene encoding the Klenow fragment (13Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Google Scholar). The maintenance and expression strains for plasmid pCJ141 (E. coli CJ406 andE. coli CJ376, respectively) were also obtained from Dr. Joyce. PFU-turbo polymerase used for PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was from Stratagene. Restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polynucleotide kinase from either Invitrogen Corp. or PerkinElmer Life Sciences was used. The PCR grade dNTPs were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Radiolabeled nucleotides were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The DNA extraction kit was from Qiagen, whereas DNA oligonucleotides were from MWG-Biotechnologies. All32P-5′-end labeled oligomers were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. We used the PCR-based protocol described in Stratagene's QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit to generate the desired mutations of KF. The plasmid pCJ141 (13Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Google Scholar, 14Polesky A.H. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Google Scholar) was used for the generation of KF protein and to construct the desired H-bonding track mutant derivative. This plasmid contains the E. coli KF gene carrying a mutation, D424A. This mutation confers deficiency in 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. The wild-type KF used for this study and its Asn845, Gln849, Arg668, His881, and Gln677 mutants are therefore exonuclease-deficient. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Isolation and purification of N845A, N845Q, Q849A, Q849N, R668A, H881A, H881V, Q677A, and Q677N mutant enzymes were carried out as described before (15Arrigo C.J. Singh K. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1653-1661Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA from mutant clones was used to transfect E. coli CJ376, an expression strain used for this study (13Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Google Scholar, 16Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1830-1834Google Scholar). Briefly, an overnight inoculum of the expression strain was used to initiate a 500-ml cell culture at 30 °C, in an incubator shaker. At A 595 = 0.3, the incubation temperature was raised to 42 °C to heat induce overproduction of the enzyme. After 4–5 h of incubation, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 30 min), and the supernatant was passed through a DEAE column to remove DNA. The flow-through was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, using 60 and 85% saturations. The pellet obtained with 85% ammonium sulfate was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA), dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of the same buffer, and applied to a Bio-Rex 70 column prewashed with Buffer I. A 50–500 mm linear gradient of NaCl in Buffer I was used to elute the bound protein. Peak fractions (representing a 68-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled and concentrated with polyethylene glycol (8000). The samples were further dialyzed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford colorimetric assay (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) and the enzyme stocks (in 30% glycerol) were stored at 20 °C. Enzymatic activity of the various mutants was determined at 37 °C for 5 min on one heteropolymeric (49/17-mer) and two homopolymeric (dA36/dT18 and dC60/dG18) template-primers (Chart 1). The reaction was carried out in a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 nm of the template-primer, 5 mmMgCl2, and 25 μm [32P]dNTP (0.5 μCi/assay) corresponding to the homo- and heteropolymeric template-primers. Reactions with the heteropolymeric template-primer contained all four dNTPs at a concentration of 25 μm, with two of them radiolabeled. Unless otherwise indicated, the final enzyme concentration was 7.5 nm. The reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and terminated by the addition of 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mmPPi. The acid-precipitated material was collected on Whatman GF/B filters and counted for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter, as described elsewhere (18Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J.

The values are expressed relative to the wild-type and were performed using Mg2+ as the divalent cation. One hundred percent activity of KF with dA36/dT18 and dC60/dG18 was 1.10 × 104 and 1.16 × 104 units/mg protein, respectively. For the 49/18-mer template/primer, 100% activity of KF equals 1.21 × 104units/mg of protein.

One unit is defined as the activity necessary to incorporate 1 nmol of dNMP into acid-insoluble material in 30 min at 37 °C. To determine the binding affinity of template-primer to the desired enzymes, gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (19Gangurde R. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14552-14559Google Scholar). The binding of 33/20 + ddC-mer and 21/12 + ddC, the dideoxy-terminated template-primers (Chart 1), to various concentrations of enzyme was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The concentration of32P-labeled template/primer was 50–100 pm. Different protein concentrations were used to bracket theK D.DNA value. Samples were electrophoresed at 100 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, using 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.2, buffer. Gels were dried, then scanned in a PhosphorImager and quantitated by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The percent enzyme-TP binding was calculated by quantifying the amount of uncomplexed TP in each lane. Percent binding values were then used for the determination of K D.DNA by interpolation, using nonlinear regression for one-site binding (hyperbola) with GraphPad Prism software. Determination of steady-state kinetic parameters was carried out as described earlier (15,18) on homopolymeric dC60/dG18 and dA36/dT18template-primers, in the presence of varying amounts of complementary dNTPs (dGTP and dTTP, respectively). Saturating concentrations of a homopolymeric dA36/dT18 and dC60/dG18 were used as the template-primers, to mimic the first-order reaction conditions. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 1 μm respective template-primers, 1 μCi/reaction [α-32P]dNTP, 1–1000 μm respective dNTPs, 5 nm WT KF, and activity normalized mutant enzymes. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mmMgCl2. The acid-precipitable material was filtered on a Whatman glass fiber filter and the radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. Steady-state parameters K mand V max were determined from Eadie-Hoftsee plots, using the Enzyme Kinetic program. Steady-state values ofk cat were calculated from the equation:V max = [ E]total k cat. Our method for assessing stable ternary complex formation is based on the procedure described by Scott and colleagues (20Tong W. Lu C.D. Sharma S.K. Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5749-5757Google Scholar, 21Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Google Scholar), where nondenaturing gel electrophoresis is used to identify the enzyme-TP-dNTP ternary complex. Briefly, in a final volume of 10 μl, the desired enzyme quantity (1.2 nm of the wild-type and different amount of mutant enzymes) is mixed with 21-mer 5′-end labeled dideoxynucleotide-terminated primer annealed to a 33-mer template (final concentration of primer is ∼100 pm) in a standard buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The enzyme-DNA complexes were allowed to form on ice. To one of the duplicate samples, cognate nucleotide was added at 200 μm concentration to induce ternary complex formation. The stability of the enzyme-TP binary complex and enzyme-TP-dNTP ternary complex was then assessed by the degree of persistence of DNA in the enzyme-TP complex, upon addition of 500-fold excess of the same unlabeled template-primer. We find that under these conditions, DNA from enzyme-TP binary complexes completely dissociates, whereas ternary complexes exhibit significant retention of radiolabeled template-primer by enzyme protein. All samples were resolved on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel, and the positions of the radioactive bands representing enzyme-DNA and free DNA were visualized by exposure in a PhosphorImager. The effect of the complementary and noncomplementary nucleotide on the binding affinity of wild-type and mutant enzymes was assessed in a manner similar to that used for the stable ternary complex formation assay. The enzyme-TP binary complexes were allowed to form in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 4 °C in duplicate. To one of the duplicate samples, the correct incoming dNTP (200 μm dGTP) was added. The incorrect dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, and dTTP, 100 μm each) were added to the second sample. The reaction mixture was further incubated on ice for 10 min, prior to loading on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, under the same conditions as those used for K D.DNAdetermination. The UV-mediated photochemical enzyme-TP cross-linking was performed essentially as described before (18Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Google Scholar, 22Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21828-21834Google Scholar, 23Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 32P-5′-end labeled 33/20 + ddC or 21/12 + ddC template-primer and the desired amount of enzyme were incubated on ice for 10 min. The samples were exposed to UV light (wavelength = 254 nm) at a dose rate of 3700 mJ/cm2for 3 min. The wild-type KF was 30 pmol, and the mutant proteins were varied to obtain nearly equal extent of the enzyme-template-primer cross-linked species. Measurement of covalent attachment of labeled TP or dNTP to enzyme protein was assessed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by the exposure of gel to PhosphorImager and analysis of exposed gel by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleotidyltransferase activity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes, containing covalently cross-linked template-primer, was carried out as described previously (22Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21828-21834Google Scholar). The wild-type KF and various mutant enzymes were cross-linked to 32/19-mer template-primer in a reaction mixture, in a final volume of 50 μl, containing 35 pmol of the unlabeled TP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mmDTT, and 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction contained 30 pmol of the wild-type KF, whereas the amount of individual mutant enzymes was varied to yield near equal quantities of enzyme-TP cross-linked species. The nucleotidyltransferase reactions were then initiated by the addition of 1 m NaCl together with 5 μCi of complementary [α-32P]dTTP at a final concentration of 0.5 μm. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and terminated by the addition of protein solubilizing solution. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by phosphorimaging and analysis by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The structural analysis of the template-primer and template-primer-dNTP bound crystal structures of KlenTaq andBacillus stearothermophilus (11Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Google Scholar, 24Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Google Scholar) showed the presence of a network of interactions (mainly H-bonds) near the active site of these polymerases. The constituent residues in these two enzymes (KlenTaq and Bst) are equivalent to Asn845, Gln849, Arg668, His881, and Gln677 of E. coli pol I (Fig.1). In the template-primer-bound binary complex of KlenTaq (Protein Data Bank file 4ktq), the H-bonds exist between Asn845–Gln849, Gln849–Arg668, and His881–Gln677. The interaction between Arg668 and His881 (which would complete the H-bonding track) is van der Waals in nature. As mentioned by Franklinet al. (12Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Google Scholar) for T7 DNA polymerase I, the equivalent residue to Arg668 in KlenTaq (Arg573) is buttressed by the His881 equivalent amino acid (His784). The fact that these crystal structures have been solved at 2.3 Å or lower resolution, it is possible that slightly altered modeling of the side chain conformation of His784 (equivalent to His881 of KF) would result in an H-bond between Arg573 and His784. Therefore, for simplicity, we have the interactions among these five residues designated as the H-bonding track. A total of 9 mutants, viz. N845A, N845Q, Q849A, Q849N, R668A, H881A, H881V, Q677A, and Q677N of Klenow fragment were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures” (18Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Google Scholar, 22Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21828-21834Google Scholar). All side chains were replaced by alanine, a nonhomologous side chain, or by homologous side chain, except in the H881V mutant. The H881V mutation results in a KF sequence (VDE), which mimics the sequence present at topologically conserved positions in reverse transcriptases (VDD/MDD). The mutant enzymes were greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The levels of expression, solubility, and yield as well as the chromatographic characteristics of all mutant proteins were identical to that of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting no significant change in the folding pattern of the mutant enzymes. For studies involving characterization of the DNA polymerization reaction, template-primer binding, cross-linking of dNTP, and template-primer and in situ addition, the WT and H-bonding track mutant proteins also contained the D424A mutation at the 3′-5′ exonuclease active site, rendering them exonuclease-deficient. Thus, the mutant protein D424A is referred to as WT and R668A (also containing D424A mutant) as R668A mutant for the polymerase activity studies. The polymerase activity of mutant enzymes was determined with two homopolymeric (dA36/dT18and dC60/dG18) and one heteropolymeric (49/17-mer) template-primer in the presence of Mg2+ as metal cofactor. The activities of different mutant enzymes expressed as a percentage of WT are summarized in Table I. All mutants showed a significantly decreased activity with dA36/dT18 ranging between 0.2 and 32% of the level in the wild-type enzyme. Generally, the two His881 mutants (H881A and H881V) appeared to retain relatively higher activity with all three template-primers, namely dA36/dT18, dC60/dG18(homopolymers), and 49/17-mer (heteropolymer). Among the three template-primers, the least activity of individual mutant enzymes was seen with dA36/dT18. The most severe effect on the catalytic activity was noted with the N845Q, Q849N, R668A, and Q677N mutant species of KF. Surprisingly, the conserved substitutions of residues Asn845, Gln849, and Gln677 consistently exhibited greater loss of activity with all of the template-primers, compared with nonconserved substituents at these positions. These activity data suggested that the side chains of Asn845, Gln849, Arg668, His881, and Gln677 have some important role in the polymerase function of KF. The steady-state kinetic parameters, k cat for the polymerase reaction and K m for dNTP utilization, were determined for the WT and each mutant protein, with two homopolymeric DNA substrates (dA36/dT18 and dC60/dG18). The rates of incorporation of α-32P-labeled dNTP into products at increasing concentrations of dNTP were measured, and k catfor the polymerase reaction and K m for dNTP were determined by Eadie-Hofstee plots from the rate data. The results are summarized in Table II. The wild-type enzyme exhibited a K m.dNTP of ∼5 μm with both homopolymeric template-primers. The mutant N845A showed almost no change inK m.dNTP with either template-primer, whereas the catalytic efficiency was decreased by ∼6-fold with dA36/dT18 template-primer. The catalytic efficiency with dC60/dG18 template-primer was not changed significantly for the N845A mutant. However, the conserved mutant, N845Q, showed a drastic change of ∼85-fold in catalytic efficiency. The mutants of Gln849 exhibited a moderate change in K m.dNTP only with dC60/dG18 template-primer (∼5–10-fold). However, the steady-state catalytic rate (k cat) was significantly reduced with both template-primers (20-fold with dA36/dT18 and 60-fold with dC60/dG18). The change in bothK m.dNTP and k catwas r"

However, how bulky base damage such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers elicits a checkpoint response has remained elusive. Nucleotide excision repair represents the main pathway for UV dimer removal that results in strand interruptions. However, we demonstrate here that Rad53p hyperphosphorylation, an early event of checkpoint signaling inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, is independent of nucleotide excision repair (NER), even if replication as a source of secondary DNA damage is excluded. Thus, our data hint at primary base damage or at UV damage (primary or secondary) that does not need to be processed by NER as the relevant substrate of damage-sensing checkpoint proteins.

Thus, our data hint at primary base damage or at UV damage (primary or secondary) that does not need to be processed by NER as the relevant substrate of damage-sensing checkpoint proteins. Checkpoints arrest cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage to facilitate DNA repair and prevent genetic instability (1Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.-B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar, 3Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Google Scholar). There is now a considerable amount of information available that characterizes signal transmission mechanisms and downstream targets in lower and higher eukaryotic cells. However, the precise roles of the initial damage-sensing proteins and their relevant DNA or chromatin substrates have remained largely elusive. Characterization of candidate proteins supports the notion that the underlying mechanisms are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution (4Melo J.A. Toczyski D.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Google Scholar, 5Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 17-25Google Scholar, 6Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 655-661Google Scholar, 7Carr A.M. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 983-994Google Scholar). Consequently, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae will continue to play an important role as a relevant model system. A damage sensor function has been suggested for the PCNA 1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; ATR, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and Rad3-related; NER, nucleotide excision repair; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting -like complex composed of the budding yeast proteins Rad17p, Ddc1p, and Mec3p, also termed 9-1-1 complex (following the nomenclature adapted for human cells andSchizosaccharomyces pombe) (8Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Bermudez V.P. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11236-11241Google Scholar, 9Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2809-2821Crossref Google Scholar, 10Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1136-1143Google Scholar, 11Kondo T. Wakayama T. Naiki T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Science. 2001; 294: 867-870Google Scholar). Although direct evidence is still missing, it is likely that this ring-shaped complex (12Griffith J.D. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15233-15236Google Scholar) encircles DNA and is loaded onto DNA by a replication factor C-related complex in which the largest replication factor C subunit is replaced by the checkpoint protein Rad24p (13Green C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Google Scholar). The phosphoinositol kinase-related protein Mec1p (an ortholog of the human ATR protein) has been identified as an independent damage-sensor candidate (9Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2809-2821Crossref Google Scholar, 11Kondo T. Wakayama T. Naiki T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Science. 2001; 294: 867-870Google Scholar). Mec1p forms a complex with Lcd1p, a protein with an affinity for DNA double-stranded breaks, and thus Mec1p kinase activity can be targeted to sites of DNA damage (14Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 857-869Google Scholar). Mec1p and its downstream target Rad53p are involved in virtually all DNA damage and replication- related checkpoints. Other potential sensor proteins responding to double-stranded breaks are represented by the Rad50p·Xrs2p·Mre11p complex. This complex plays a well established role in non-homologous endjoining and homologous recombination, whereas a function in checkpoint arrest following treatment with strand break-inducing agents has only recently been uncovered (15Grenon M. Gilbert C. Lowndes N.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 844-847Google Scholar, 16D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2238-2249Google Scholar). Although such putative damage recognition complexes appear to be formed independently from each other, their combined action is frequently necessary for the generation of a downstream signal. A key player in signal transmission is the Rad53p kinase that is phosphorylated in a Mec1p-dependent fashion in response to DNA damage (17Sanchez Y. Desany B.A. Jones W.J. Liu Q. Wang B. Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 271: 357-360Google Scholar). A pool of hyperphosphorylated Rad53p is generated through autophosphorylation in trans, mediated through complex formation with Rad9p following Mec1p-dependent Rad9p phosphorylation (18Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Google Scholar). In higher and lower eukaryotes, several studies have indicated that even a single DNA double strand break can result in checkpoint activation if not immediately repaired (19Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Google Scholar, 20Pellicoli A. Lee S.E. Lucca C. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 293-300Google Scholar, 21Huang L.-C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4827-4832Google Scholar). Other observations point to the significance of single-stranded DNA tracts (21Huang L.-C. Clarkin K.C.

Surprisingly however, little is known regarding the recognition of base damage that is not directly associated with double strand breaks, even for such a generally well studied case as UV damage. Exposure of DNA to ultraviolet light (mainly UV-C) results in the dimerization of adjacent pyrimidine residues, giving rise to cyclobutane-type dimers and 6-4 photoproducts (23Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). These types of bulky DNA damage are readily recognized and repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER), which functions by the introduction of single strand breaks bracketing the lesion, followed by the removal of a single-stranded DNA fragment (24de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Google Scholar). A global NER system and a repair system that is targeted by inhibition of transcription to the site of the lesion can be distinguished. The established correlation of double-stranded breaks and possibly single-stranded DNA with checkpoint arrest could hint at a NER intermediate involving free DNA ends as the effective recognized lesion following UV treatment. However, any single-stranded gaps arising directly from NER will be small and short-lived. In S. cerevisiae, two studies have analyzed in some detail checkpoint responses at the G1/S transition in NER-deficient cells (25Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Google Scholar, 26Neecke H. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4485-4497Google Scholar). An S-phase delay was observed in UV-irradiated NER-deficient cells at much lower doses than in the isogenic wild type (25Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Google Scholar). However, this delay was not influenced by Rad9p, a protein necessary for both G1 and G2/M checkpoint arrest in the wild type. More detailed analysis indicated that UV-irradiated NER-deficient cells do not arrest upstream of START as the wild type, albeit at higher doses (25Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Google Scholar). At the molecular level, it was independently confirmed that this low dose arrest response observed in NER-deficient cells depends on S-phase entry and requires the checkpoint kinases Mec1p and Rad53p but not other checkpoint proteins including putative damage sensors (such as Rad9p, Rad17p, Rad24p, Mec3p, or Ddc1p) (26Neecke H. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4485-4497Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these proteins are needed for efficient UV-induced mutagenesis in NER-deficient cells, and a subset is also required for UV-induced sister chromatid exchange (27Paulovich A.G. Armour C.D. Hartwell L.H. Genetics. 1998; 150: 75-93Google Scholar). These observations neither prove nor disprove the view that damage processing by NER is indispensable for checkpoint responses to UV damage outside of S-phase. It needs to be taken into account that the effects analyzed so far have been triggered by much lower doses of UV than usually given to wild-type cells. If primary unprocessed UV damage is the relevant trigger of checkpoint signaling, the dose range required for wild-type responses will have to be applied. However, any interpretation will have to consider the high lethality of NER mutants in such dose range. This study addresses primarily the requirement of NER for events that precede cell cycle checkpoint arrest. While avoiding complications because of secondary lesions arising from the interference of photodimers with replication, we have concentrated on the analysis of NER-deficient cells that were synchronized and UV-treated in G1- and M-phase. We conclude that in these cell cycle stages NER is not required for Rad53p hyperphosphorylation, an indispensable step of arrest signal transmission. However, such an independence of NER is only uncovered when approximately the same UV dose range is applied that is required for Rad53p activation in the wild type. Although the resulting high lethality ultimately precludes a meaningful interpretation of the actual cell cycle effects, our data support models that assume recognition of UV-induced initial base damage and not of NER-dependent DNA repair intermediates by sensor proteins as the essential step. Alternatively, primary or secondary non-dimer DNA damage may be critical as recognized lesions. The haploid S. cerevisiae strain SX46A MATa ade2 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3–532 was used as wild type (source: E. C. Friedberg, originally from J. Rine). In this strain background, a pronounced G1arrest following treatment with UV or ionizing radiation is observed (28Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7985-7989Google Scholar). Construction of the NER-deficientrad14Δ::HIS3 andrad9Δ::URA3 derivatives have been described elsewhere (25Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Google Scholar, 28Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7985-7989Google Scholar). A cdc4 mutant (WS9110-3DMATa cdc4–1 ade ura3–52 trp1–289) was derived from the same background by crossing (25Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Google Scholar). In this strain, aRAD14 deletion was introduced through homology-mediated trans-placement with a rad14Δ::KanMX4PCR fragment that was originated from an existing null strain obtained from a yeast strain repository (Euroscarf). For cell culture and media recipes, we followed standard procedures of yeast genetics and cell biology (29Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Cells were synchronized in M-phase by resuspending a mid-logarithmic phase culture in fresh YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) at 1 × 107 cells/ml and by adding nocodazole (U. S. Biological) to 10 μg/ml. A second aliquot was added after 60 min of incubation at 30 °C, and the culture was used following another 75 min of incubation. Cells were synchronized in G1 with the yeast pheromone α-factor (U. S. Biological). A mid-logarithmic phase culture (∼1 × 107 cells/ml) was resuspended in fresh YPD, and α-factor was first added to 10 μg/ml. A second aliquot was added after 75 min of incubation at 30 °C or after 90 min at 25 °C in the case of cdc4strains. Synchronization in G1 was complete after another 75 or 90 min in the case of cdc4 strains. Synchronized cells were washed free of medium, resuspended in deionized water at a titer of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml, sonicated briefly, and kept on ice. 15- or 30-ml samples of the cell suspension were irradiated under constant stirring in 100- or 150-mm-diameter plastic Petri dishes, respectively. The used lamp delivered 254 nm of UV-C at a dose rate of 1 or 2 J/m2 × s− (Sanyo Denki Germicidal Lamp G15T8). Appropriate dilutions were plated on solid YPD to determine survival. Pelleted, irradiated, and mock-treated cells were resuspended in fresh YPD at a titer of 1 × 107cells/ml. Samples were taken during subsequent incubation at 30 °C with the exception of cdc4 mutant cells, which were kept in G1 by incubation at 37 °C. If required, α-factor-synchronized strains were kept arrested in G1following irradiation by resuspension in their old pheromone-containing medium and by the addition of further aliquots of α-factor immediately and after 1 h of incubation. For FACS analysis, ∼1 × 107 cells were withdrawn at each time point, spun down, washed, and fixed in 90% ethanol. Staining with propidium iodide has been described elsewhere (30Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan using the CellQuest program suite. A sample of 1 × 108cells was used for each time point. Trichloroacetic acid protein extracts were prepared using zirconium beads (Biospec Products) essentially as described (31Foiani M. Marini F. Gamba D. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 923-933Google Scholar). Approximately one-third of total protein extract was loaded per lane of an 8% PAGE gel (1:80 bisacrylamide:acrylamide ratio). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by semidry electroblotting, and immunoblot analysis was performed according to standard techniques (32Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Rad53p antibody (Sc6749, raised in goat, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:300 dilution, secondary anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:3000 dilution. SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce) was used for chemiluminescence signal detection. InS. cerevisiae, the influence of NER on UV-induced cell cycle arrest and associated responses has not been investigated in cell cycle stages other than G1/S. We regarded studying UV-treated M-phase cells as an attractive approach because a checkpoint response can be determined that is not influenced by the generation of secondary DNA damage in S-phase. To this end, cells synchronized in metaphase by treatment with the tubulin inhibitor nocodazole were UV-irradiated in suspension and released in fresh medium without inhibitor. The macrocolony survival resulting from this and all further treatment protocols is shown in Fig. 1. Cell cycle progression was analyzed by FACS analysis. In repair-competent wild-type cells, a dose of 20 J/m2resulted in only a brief M-phase arrest during the first cycle, whereas treatment with 120 J/m2 caused an arrest of at least 2 h (Fig. 2 A). In NER-deficientrad14Δ cells, a similar brief arrest was found at the lower dose (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to the wild type, this M-phase arrest was followed by a very pronounced arrest in a stage with an apparent G1 DNA content. For the higher dose, the NER-deficient cells remained arrested with a G2/M DNA content throughout the experiment (Fig. 2 B) and never resumed cell cycle progression (data not shown). In the checkpoint and NER-deficient rad9Δrad14Δ double mutant, essentially the same results were found apart from a somewhat prolonged M-phase arrest at the lower dose (Fig. 2 C). However, it is important to note that these experiments were performed with lethally damaged cells (Fig. 1). For the lower UV dose, the colony survival of both single mutant (rad14Δ) and double mutant (rad14Δrad9) was already <0.01% (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the observed cell cycle effects as actively regulated, physiological checkpoint responses.Figure 2Cell cycle distribution in cells synchronized in metaphase by nocodazole and released from arrest following UV-C treatment. Samples were withdrawn at the times indicated to theleft following irradiation with 0, 20, or 120 J/m2 UV, and DNA content was detected by FACS analysis. The strains used were SX46A RAD, rad14Δ, andrad14Δ rad9Δ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We reasoned that a rapid signaling response such as Rad53p hyperphosphorylation that is more proximal to the damage recognition process might be less affected by the lethally damaged state of the studied mutant cells. Thus, we analyzed in the samples shown in Fig. 2the extent of Rad53p hyperphosphorylation in the form of slower moving protein bands visualized by immunoblotting (Fig.3). Following treatment with the lower UV dose (20 J/m2), only a small fraction of Rad53p was found to be transiently phosphorylated, whereas the higher dose resulted in a very pronounced Rad53p modification. Most importantly, these results were essentially the same in both the wild type and NER-deficientrad14 mutant (Fig. 3). The only difference between the strains appeared to be the diminishing level of hyperphosphorylated Rad53p that is observed after 3 h of incubation in the wild type but not in the mutant. Thus, the phosphorylation level correlates with exit from M-phase arrest (Fig. 2) and may reflect successful DNA damage repair. As expected, UV-induced Rad53p hyperphosphorylation was found to be strictly dependent on RAD9 (Fig. 3). Because these data indicate that Rad53p phosphorylation is not significantly influenced by the status of NER in UV-irradiated M-phase cells, we decided to re-evaluate the influence of NER on checkpoint signaling in G1 cells over a range of UV doses. We synchronized the identical strains with the yeast pheromone α-factor in G1, treated with UV, and continued incubation in the presence of α-factor to exclude replication as a source of secondary DNA damage (Fig. 4). Microscopic examination indicated continued “shmoo” appearance of the cells, and FACS analysis confirmed G1 DNA content throughout the experiment (Fig. 4 B). As with M-phase cells, we determined that the extent and dose response of UV-induced Rad53p hyperphosphorylation were quite similar in wild type andrad14Δ mutant cells (Fig. 4 A). Especially at the lower dose, the mutant strain appeared to have a more pronounced response than the wild type. Again, Rad53p modification was dependent on functional Rad9p (Fig. 4 A). Additionally, we prevented S-phase entry in G1-synchronized UV-treated cells by the use of the thermoconditional cdc4–1mutation (Fig. 5). RAD cdc4–1and rad14Δ cdc4–1 cells were treated with α-factor at permissive temperature, irradiated with a range of UV doses, and incubated at 37 °C to block cell cycle progression and entry into S-phase. Continuous arrest in G1 was confirmed by FACS analysis (data not shown). With the low doses of 4 and 8 J/m2, we observed some degree of Rad53p hyperphosphorylation at the later time points in the NER-deficient strain but not in the NER-proficient wild type. With the higher doses, there was essentially no major difference in the extent and time course of the observed Rad53p hyperphosphorylation between the strains (Fig.5). Indicating successful repair, a reappearance of the original non-modified Rad53p band was noted after 3 h of incubation in the NER-proficient strain but not in the NER-deficient strain (20 and 40 J/m2). A considerable amount of information is available on the highly sensitive and specific initiation of cell cycle checkpoint arrests and associated responses following the occurrence of DNA double-stranded breaks (1Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.-B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar, 3Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev.

Surprisingly, little is known regarding the initiating molecular events that accompany such responses in cells exposed to base-damaging agents that by themselves do not introduce DNA double-stranded breaks or single-stranded gaps. Here, we have concentrated on the analysis of the effects of UV-C because the nature of the induced base damage (i.e. pyrimidine dimers) and its repair are well understood (23Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 24de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Google Scholar). Ultraviolet radiation is a potent trigger of checkpoint arrest and transcriptional responses in lower and higher eukaryotes (23Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 33Bachant J.B. Elledge S.J. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F.

Amundson S.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 92-97Google Scholar). At the outset, several mechanisms of damage recognition can be envisioned. First, a specific type of primary DNA lesion may be directly recognized by the binding of one or more sensor proteins. Second, the conversion of primary damage into a DNA repair intermediate or the formation of a DNA-repair protein complex may create a substrate for damage-sensing components of the checkpoint pathways. Third, the interference of damage with cellular processes such as DNA replication or transcription may elicit the response. This may include the formation of secondary structural DNA damage such as single-stranded gaps during DNA synthesis. Lastly, the possibility should not be dismissed that non-DNA targets of the applied agent play essential roles in checkpoint activation. The identification of protein kinase p38 as an important component of UV-induced G2 arrest in mammalian cells may provide such an example (37Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Google Scholar). Because no data on G2/M-phase regulation in NER-deficient budding yeast were available, we first characterized UV-induced M-phase arrest in cells synchronized at the metaphase/anaphase transition. In response to DNA double strand breaks, a bifurcated pathway regulates checkpoint arrest at or downstream of this stage with both branches being dependent on Mec1p kinase (38Gardner R. Putnam C.W. Weinert T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3173-3185Google Scholar, 39Liu Y. Vidanes G. Lin Y.-C. Mori S. Siede W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 1132-1146Google Scholar, 40Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Google Scholar, 41Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14361-14366Google Scholar). One subpathway regulates the securin Pds1p through the Chk1p kinase, whereas the other involves the kinases Rad53p and Dun1p. However, Chk1p appears be dispensable for cell cycle arrest after UV (39Liu Y. Vidanes G. Lin Y.-C. Mori S. Siede W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 1132-1146Google Scholar, 42Paciotti V. Clerici M. Scotti M. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3913-3925Google Scholar), and it remains to be demonstrated that the arrest pathways for UV damage are similarly organized. In this study, we found that a significant dose-dependent M-phase arrest can be induced by UV irradiation in cells released from nocodazole arrest. Rad53p hyperphosphorylation correlates well with the arrest response in the wild type. A similar analysis in arad14Δ mutant revealed that the extent, dose dependence, and time course of Rad53p modification remain essentially unaffected by a NER defect. The Rad14 protein is necessary for early steps of UV damage recognition, and deletion mutants are completely deficient in the incision step (43Bankmann M. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1992; 355: 555-558Google Scholar, 44Siede W. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair, DNA Repair in Prokaryotes and Lower Eukaryotes. 1. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 307-333Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that Rad9p is clearly required for UV-induced Rad53p phosphorylation, even in the NER− background. Deliberately, we have not attempted to modify the UV dose according to the much lower survival level of NER-deficient cells. However, we have to consider the implications of working with a population of lethally damaged cells that are most probably severely inhibited in all cellular functions (such as transcription) shortly after treatment. A recent study (45FitzGerald J.N. Benjamin J.M. Kron S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1749-1757Google Scholar) has suggested a defect in UV-induced G2/M arrest in NER-deficient cells solely based on budding analysis. However, we doubt that a morphological marker is meaningful in lethally irradiated cells. We argue that the observed early marker for checkpoint activation, Rad53p hyperphosphorylation, represents a physiological response to UV damage even in NER-deficient cells because the extent and time course do not appear to be different from wild type. We are less certain regarding the observed cell cycle effects. NER-deficient cells lethally irradiated with 20 J/m2 are still capable of M/G1 transition following a delay in M-phase. However, this delay is not affected by an additional rad9 defect and thus represents more likely a passive inhibitory effect of damage than an actively regulated checkpoint response. Alternatively, a differentRAD9-independent checkpoint may have been triggered. A high level of unrepaired DNA damage in mitosis may activate the spindle-assembly checkpoint as described recently for human cells (46Mikhailov A. Cole R.W. Rieder C.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1797-1806Google Scholar). In our experiments, NER-deficient M-phase cells lethally irradiated with 120 J/m2 remained and ultimately died in this stage. Our observations suggest that checkpoint signaling through the Rad53p pathway is independent of UV dimer incision and, thus, that a damage-recognition mechanism that targets primary DNA base damage and not repair-induced strand interruptions may be operating. However, although the FACS profiles argue against massive DNA degradation, we have not formally demonstrated the absence of DNA strand breakage. Certain double-stranded break repair-deficient mutants in S. cerevisiae exhibit a pronounced UV sensitivity, and double-stranded breaks are clearly detectable during post-irradiation growth of UV-treated yeast (47Kiefer J. Feige M. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 219-224Google Scholar). Throughout our experiments, S-phase is never entered and cannot be a source of secondary damage, but other mechanisms are not excluded. Double-stranded breaks may arise from recombinational repair of unrepaired UV damage in M-phase-synchronized cells. In yeast and other systems, UV-induced recombination events were indeed found to be independent of NER and replication (48Abrahams P.J. Huitema B.A. van der Eb A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2341-2346Google Scholar, 49Burke J.F. Mogg A.E. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 309-315Google Scholar, 50Fabre F. Nature. 1978; 272: 795-798Google Scholar). However, such an explanation can hardly account for our observations in haploid cells arrested in G1 where no homologous chromosome is available. The apparent lack of effect of NER on checkpoint pathway activation prompted us to re-evaluate previous observations in G1cells. An S-phase delay has been reported in NER-deficient strains at a much lower dose level than in the wild type, and this response turned out to be the result of RAD9-independent activation of aMEC1-dependent checkpoint response in early S-phase, most probably triggered by secondary damage or inhibition of replication fork progression (25Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Google Scholar, 26Neecke H. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4485-4497Google Scholar). However, G1-checkpoint arrest following treatment with DNA-damaging agents occurs at or upstream of START in repair-proficient cells (25Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Google Scholar,45FitzGerald J.N. Benjamin J.M. Kron S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1749-1757Google Scholar, 51Sidorova J.M. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3032-3045Google Scholar). The influence of NER remained to be analyzed at a dose level required for such a response in the wild type. Obviously, the entry into S-phase had to be prevented. Thus, we confined the analysis of Rad53p phosphorylation to UV-treated cells that were kept arrested by α-factor or by incubation of cdc4–1 strains at the restrictive temperature. In both cases, UV-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad53p was readily detectable. This is in contrast to studies indicating the inability of a single persistent double-stranded break to trigger Rad53 hyperphosphorylation in G1 cells (20Pellicoli A. Lee S.E. Lucca C. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 293-300Google Scholar). Most importantly, the independence of UV-induced Rad53p phosphorylation from NER was again observed. Our data on cdc4–1 are in conflict with a previous study (26Neecke H. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4485-4497Google Scholar) that demonstrated in a comparable approach a need for S-phase entry for Rad53p hyperphosphorylation in NER-deficient strains but not in the wild type. Technical details of UV application cannot be compared directly between the two studies. However, we were able to verify our results over a range of doses. Differences in the used antibody and the strain background could provide possible explanations for the contrasting findings. In summary, our results are compatible with models of UV damage recognition for checkpoint activation outside of S-phase that do not rely on the main pathway of dimer repair or on cell cycle progression. These observations are consistent with two types of hypotheses. First, the recognized DNA damage that triggers the checkpoint response is primary DNA damage such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers that are recognized by checkpoint sensor proteins independent of NER. The extent of the response will depend on the level and persistence of initial damage and thus initially on the dose but subsequently also on cellular repair capacity. The continued presence of unrepaired damage may sensitize the response, and indeed, Rad53p phosphorylation is found in G1 cells at lower doses than in the wild type. However, this latter response is delayed and would not have prevented S-phase entry if cells had not been kept artificially in G1. Such a concept of initial damage recognition is supported by recent data on human ATR protein, the homolog of yeast Mec1p (52Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Makhov A.M. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6673-6678Google Scholar). The observed increased affinity of ATR protein for UV-dimer containing DNA indicates a role as a sensor of primary UV damage. Alternative hypotheses will rely on UV-induced DNA damage that is not influenced by NER as the type of lesion relevant for checkpoint activation. Such damage could constitute non-dimer type primary damage or, alternatively, secondary lesions that originate from the interference of damage with cellular processes. These include transcription or non-NER repair, but our approach excludes an influence of replication. Such damage may in fact be identical to persistent double-stranded breaks, already known to be recognized by putative damage sensor proteins of the checkpoint pathways. However, one established double-stranded break sensor, the Rad50p·Xrs2p·Mre11p complex, plays no role in UV-induced cell cycle arrest (15Grenon M. Gilbert C. Lowndes N.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 844-847Google Scholar). Agents of environmental relevance but also many anti-cancer drugs introduce bulky base damage similar to UV. Checkpoint responses toward these agents prevent genetic instability, and an understanding of the molecular details involved in damage recognition will have many implications for important issues related to human health and, in particular to cancer, its prevention and its treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2095946632,"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor regulates neutrophil production by binding to a specific receptor, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, expressed on cells of the granulocytic lineage. Recombinant forms of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are used clinically to treat neutropenias. As part of an effort to develop granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mimics with the potential for oral bioavailability, we previously identified a nonpeptidyl small molecule (SB-247464) that selectively activates murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signal transduction pathways and promotes neutrophil formation in vivo. To elucidate the mechanism of action of SB-247464, a series of cell-based and biochemical assays were performed. The activity of SB-247464 is strictly dependent on the presence of zinc ions. Titration microcalorimetry experiments using a soluble murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor construct show that SB-247464 binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor in a zinc ion-dependent manner. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies demonstrate that SB-247464 induces self-association of the N-terminal three-domain fragment in a manner that is consistent with dimerization. SB-247464 induces internalization of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor on intact cells, consistent with a mechanism involving receptor oligomerization. These data show that small nonpeptidyl compounds are capable of selectively binding and inducing productive oligomerization of cytokine receptors. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor regulates neutrophil production by binding to a specific receptor, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, expressed on cells of the granulocytic lineage. Recombinant forms of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are used clinically to treat neutropenias. As part of an effort to develop granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mimics with the potential for oral bioavailability, we previously identified a nonpeptidyl small molecule (SB-247464) that selectively activates murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signal transduction pathways and promotes neutrophil formation in vivo. To elucidate the mechanism of action of SB-247464, a series of cell-based and biochemical assays were performed. The activity of SB-247464 is strictly dependent on the presence of zinc ions. Titration microcalorimetry experiments using a soluble murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor construct show that SB-247464 binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor in a zinc ion-dependent manner. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies demonstrate that SB-247464 induces self-association of the N-terminal three-domain fragment in a manner that is consistent with dimerization. SB-247464 induces internalization of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor on intact cells, consistent with a mechanism involving receptor oligomerization. These data show that small nonpeptidyl compounds are capable of selectively binding and inducing productive oligomerization of cytokine receptors.

Griffin J.D. Blood. 1991; 78: 2791-2808Google Scholar). Lack of G-CSF results in a profound neutropenia and increased susceptibility to infections (2Lieschke G.J. Grail D. Hodgson G. Metcalf D. Stanley E. Cheers C. Fowler K.J. Basu S. Zhan Y.F. Dunn A.R. Blood. 1994; 84: 1737-1746Google Scholar). Recombinant G-CSF is widely used to stimulate neutrophil production in patients suffering from neutropenia as a result of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation and is also used to mobilize hematopoietic precursor cells into the periphery prior to leukopheresis (3Welte K.

Cancer Invest. 1997; 15: 353-357Google Scholar).G-CSF is a member of the four-helix bundle family of cytokines and binds to a type I cytokine receptor expressed on the surface of neutrophils, granulocytic cells, and granulocytic precursors (5Shinjo K. Takeshita A. Ohnishi K. Ohno R. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1997; 25: 37-46Google Scholar). Binding of G-CSF to its receptor promotes oligomerization of receptor chains, triggering the activation of JAK kinases associated with the cytoplasmic region of the receptor (6Nicholson S.E.

Blood. 1996; 88: 761-777Google Scholar). Activated JAKs then phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on a number of signaling proteins including STAT3, STAT5, and SHC, which ultimately results in changes in cell phenotype (7Tian S.-S.

Blood. 1996; 88: 761-777Google Scholar).Type I cytokine receptors are defined by the presence of a CRH region, which contains four conserved cysteine residues and a WSXWS motif (8Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar, 10Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar, 11Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 1-11Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of some receptors, such as those for erythropoietin and growth hormone, consist solely of a CRH domain, which comprises the ligand binding site. Crystal structures showing cytokines bound to CRH domains indicate that the CRH region consists of two FN-III-like domains angled at ∼90o with respect to each other (12de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar, 13Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Oslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliot S. Sitney K.

Both structural and mutagenesis data show that the cytokine interacts primarily with amino acids in loop regions at the ends of the FN-III-like domains that project into the space formed at the domain junction (14Kossiakoff A.A. De Vos A.M. Adv Protein Chem. 1998; 52: 67-108Google Scholar).The extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor also contains a CRH region, which is separated from the membrane by three FN-III-like repeats (15Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1990; 61: 341-350Google Scholar, 16Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Google Scholar). These repeats are not involved in ligand binding but may play a role in stabilizing receptor dimers (16Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Google Scholar). A further Ig-like domain is attached to the N terminus of the CRH region, completing the six-domain structure of the G-CSF receptor extracellular region. Biophysical characterization of soluble proteins containing CRH domains alone or CRH- and Ig-like domains show that both CRH and Ig-like domains play a role in binding G-CSF (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Google Scholar, 18.Hiraoka, O., Anaguchi, H., Asakura, A., and Ota, Y. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25928–25934.Google Scholar). G-CSF causes dimerization or higher order oligomerization of the receptor subunits and of the intact G-CSF receptor extracellular domain (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S.

The mechanism by which G-CSF promotes receptor dimerization is not understood; however, a recent crystal structure of G-CSF bound to the CRH domain of the receptor shows two G-CSF molecules interacting with two CRH domains in a pseudosymmetric dimer (21Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Okamoto T. Kuroki R. Ota Y. Morikawa K. Nature. 1999; 401: 713-717Google Scholar). The major contacts between each G-CSF molecule and the CRH domain occur at the loop regions of a single CRH domain that project into the space between the two FN-III-like repeats. As described above, this is similar to the way in which other cytokines of this class bind to their receptors and is consistent with the predictions of mutagenesis experiments that had previously identified amino acids in the CRH loop segments as important for G-CSF binding (22Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Google Scholar). Each G-CSF monomer also participates in a minor interaction with the second CRH monomer, and these interactions may help stabilize the receptor dimer. Since the Ig-like domain is not present in this structure, the details of its role in G-CSF binding and receptor dimerization are not clear.We have previously described the discovery and initial characterization of a nonpeptidyl small molecule, SB-247464, that acts as a mimic of G-CSF (23Tian S.-S. Lamb P. King A.G. Miller S.G. Kessler L. Luengo J.I. Averill L. Johnson R.K. Gleason J.G. Pelus L.M. Dillon S.B. Rosen J. Science. 1998; 281: 257-259Google Scholar). This compound was discovered as part of a high throughput screen designed to detect compounds that activate G-CSF signal transduction pathways in a murine cell line. Like G-CSF, SB-247464 supports the formation of granulocytic colonies from primary murine bone marrow in vitro. When injected into mice, SB-247464 causes increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts and achieves an efficacy equivalent to a saturating dose of recombinant G-CSF. Using chimeric receptor constructs, we determined that expression of the extracellular domain of the murine G-CSF receptor is required for SB-247464 action, but the reason for this requirement was not established. In this study, we have examined in more detail the mode of action of the compound and its effect on the murine G-CSF receptor. Our data show that SB-247464 interacts with the N-terminal half of the extracellular domain of the receptor and promotes receptor dimerization. Also, in contrast to G-CSF, we have found that the binding and activity of SB-247464 is completely dependent on the presence of zinc ions.DISCUSSIONSB-247464 was originally discovered by virtue of its ability to activate G-CSF signal transduction pathways and was subsequently found to be a selective mimic of G-CSF both in vitro and in vivo (23Tian S.-S. Lamb P. King A.G. Miller S.G. Kessler L. Luengo J.I. Averill L. Johnson R.K. Gleason J.G. Pelus L.M. Dillon S.B. Rosen J. Science. 1998; 281: 257-259Google Scholar). These are novel activities for a low molecular weight, nonpeptidyl molecule, and it was therefore of considerable interest to determine both the molecular target for SB-247464 and its mechanism of action. The cell-based assay used to identify SB-247464 can in principle detect compounds acting at many points in the G-CSF signaling cascade (33Seidel H.M. Lamb P. Rosen J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2645-2656Google Scholar). Our initial characterization of SB-247464 indicated a requirement for murine G-CSF receptor expression for compound activity. However, it was not established whether the receptor was in fact the direct target for SB-247464 or whether it played an indirect role in compound activity.Here we show that SB-247464 interacts with soluble extracellular domain fragments derived from the murine G-CSF receptor using both isothermal calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation. This strongly suggests that the extracellular domain of the receptor is the molecular target for SB-247464. The primary binding site for SB-247464 maps to the N-terminal half of the extracellular domain, comprising the Ig-like domain and the two FN-III-like domains of the CRH region. This is the same fragment of the receptor that binds to G-CSF (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Google Scholar, 18.Hiraoka, O., Anaguchi, H., Asakura, A., and Ota, Y. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25928–25934.Google Scholar, 22Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Google Scholar). However, SB-247464 appears to be unable to compete with G-CSF for binding to the intact G-CSF receptor on NFS60 cells, suggesting that it binds to this region of the receptor at a site not involved in interactions with G-CSF. This is in contrast to the peptide mimics of erythropoietin and thrombopoietin and a recently described nonpeptidyl mimic of erythropoietin, which compete with the natural cytokine for receptor binding (34Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S. Johnson D.L. Barrett R.W. Jolliffe L.K. Dower W.J. Science. 1996; 273: 458-463Google Scholar, 35Cwirla S.E. Balasubramanian P. Duffin D.J. Wagstrom C.R. Gates C.M. Singer S.C. Davis A.M. Tansik R.L. Mattheakis L.C. Boytos C.M. Schatz P.J. Baccanari D.P. Wrighton N.C. Barret R.W. Dower W.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12156-12161Google Scholar).The in vitro binding studies show that SB-247464 does not bind to receptor in the absence of zinc ions. This explains the requirement for zinc ions for compound activity in the cell-based luciferase assay. Serum contained in the tissue culture media contains sufficient zinc ions to promote compound activity, but in biochemical assays it must be supplied exogenously. Isothermal calorimetry provides direct evidence that SB-247464 binds zinc ions, presumably via the two metal chelation sites present in the compound. The precise role of zinc ions in promoting compound binding is not known. In addition to their role in catalysis and stabilizing protein structure, zinc ions are known to mediate certain protein-protein interactions via coordination of amino acids in both proteins (37Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Google Scholar, 38Coleman J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 222-234Google Scholar, 39Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Google Scholar). In this case, the zinc ion may be coordinated to both SB-247464 and amino acids in the receptor, directly mediating compound binding. Alternately, zinc ions may indirectly promote compound binding by stabilizing the conformation or oligomerization state of SB-247464 that constitutes the receptor binding species.Analysis of mouse/human chimeric G-CSF receptor constructs shows that amino acids in the murine transmembrane domain are required (but not sufficient) for efficient activation of the receptor by SB-247464. SB-247464 does not efficiently activate chimeric G-CSF receptors in which the transmembrane domain is entirely human in origin, even if they contain the binding site for the compound. The murine transmembrane domain may transmit or permit a conformational change in response to compound that is impeded by the human receptor transmembrane domain. In contrast, the response of chimeric G-CSF receptors to G-CSF is not influenced by the species derivation of the transmembrane domain.The analytical ultracentrifuge experiments demonstrate that SB-247464 causes oligomerization of the G-CSF receptor extracellular domain. This observation provides an explanation for the ability of the compound to mimic the activities G-CSF in cellular and in vivo assays. Dimerization of the G-CSF receptor has been shown to be sufficient to trigger signal transduction, an observation that is generally true for homodimeric receptors of this family (40Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar, 41Elliot S. Lorenzini T. Yanagihara D. Chang D. Elliot G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24691-24697Google Scholar, 42Schneider H. Chaovapong W. Matthews D.J.

Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Google Scholar). Dimerization or higher order oligomerization of G-CSF receptor extracellular domain fragments in the presence of G-CSF has been reported in a number of biochemical studies and is evident in the crystal structure of the receptor CRH domain bound to G-CSF (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Google Scholar, 18.Hiraoka, O., Anaguchi, H., Asakura, A., and Ota, Y. J. Biol.

The symmetry of SB-247464 allows the molecule to simultaneously bind to two zinc ions in a C2-symmetrical fashion. This property of SB-247464 suggests a model where the resulting SB-247464(Zn)2 ternary complex interacts with two different receptor chains, promoting their dimerization on the surface of the cell. This model is consistent with the observation that the related compound SB-250017, which lacks the symmetry elements of SB-247464 and contains a single zinc-binding site, can bind to the receptor but cannot dimerize it. Instead, SB-250017 acts as an antagonist of SB-247464, although it has no effect on the activation of receptor by G-CSF. This latter observation also suggests that the details of receptor dimerization by SB-247464 and G-CSF differ, perhaps indicating that there are multiple pathways that lead to receptor activation.Internalization of G-CSF receptors by SB-247464 provides additional evidence that this compound induces receptor clustering. The shape of the dose-response curve in this assay warrants discussion. Increasing concentrations of SB-247464 initially induce greater levels of receptor down-regulation, up to 1 μm. Higher concentrations reduce receptor internalization, however. This inverted bell-shaped dose-response curve mirrors the bell-shaped dose-response curve seen with SB-247464 in the luciferase assay. Increasing concentrations of SB-247464 initially cause increased levels of luciferase expression, but higher concentrations elicit lower levels of luciferase expression. This effect is not due to compound toxicity. If SB-247464 induces receptor dimerization by binding to two receptor chains, these dose-response curves can be explained by self-antagonism of the compound at high concentrations due to occupation of all available receptor chains by a single molecule of SB-247464. A similar phenomenon has been described for growth hormone and erythropoietin (42Schneider H. Chaovapong W. Matthews D.J. Karkaria C. Cass R.T. Zhan H. Boyle M. Lorenzini T. Elliott S.G. Giebel L.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 473-482Google Scholar, 43Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Fukunaga R. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 123-127Google Scholar) but has not been observed for G-CSF (46Young D.C. Zhan H. Cheng Q.-L. Hou J. Matthews D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1228-1236Google Scholar), 3S.-S. Tian, unpublished result. again suggesting that SB-247464 activates the receptor in a novel manner. A detailed review of this effect and its implications has been presented by Whitty and Borysenko (47Whitty A. Borysenko C.W. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R107-R118Google Scholar).Our data do not exclude an alternate model for SB-247464-mediated receptor dimerization, in which the compound binds to a single receptor chain and induces a conformational change that favors dimerization. However, this model does not readily explain the dose-response curves described above. Structural data showing the details of SB-247464 interaction with the receptor will allow a more complete understanding of the mechanism of action of this compound and may provide insight into differences between G-CSF- and SB-247464-mediated receptor activation.These results show that low molecular weight compounds can selectively bind, dimerize, and activate relatively large receptors that are normally activated by protein ligands. Since compounds such as SB-247464 are readily amenable to optimization through standard medicinal chemistry techniques, it should be possible to develop small molecule, orally bioavailable drugs with the potential to replace injectable recombinant proteins such as cytokines.

Biophysical characterization of soluble proteins containing CRH domains alone or CRH- and Ig-like domains show that both CRH and Ig-like domains play a role in binding G-CSF (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Google Scholar, 18.Hiraoka, O., Anaguchi, H., Asakura, A., and Ota, Y. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25928–25934.Google Scholar). G-CSF causes dimerization or higher order oligomerization of the receptor subunits and of the intact G-CSF receptor extracellular domain (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Google Scholar, 18.Hiraoka, O., Anaguchi, H., Asakura, A., and Ota, Y. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25928–25934.Google Scholar, 19Horan T.P. Martin F. Simonet L. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 370-375Google Scholar, 20Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Google Scholar). The mechanism by which G-CSF promotes receptor dimerization is not understood; however, a recent crystal structure of G-CSF bound to the CRH domain of the receptor shows two G-CSF molecules interacting with two CRH domains in a pseudosymmetric dimer (21Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Okamoto T. Kuroki R. Ota Y. Morikawa K. Nature. 1999; 401: 713-717Google Scholar). The major contacts between each G-CSF molecule and the CRH domain occur at the loop regions of a single CRH domain that project into the space between the two FN-III-like repeats. As described above, this is similar to the way in which other cytokines of this class bind to their receptors and is consistent with the predictions of mutagenesis experiments that had previously identified amino acids in the CRH loop segments as important for G-CSF binding (22Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Google Scholar). Each G-CSF monomer also participates in a minor interaction with the second CRH monomer, and these interactions may help stabilize the receptor dimer. Since the Ig-like domain is not present in this structure, the details of its role in G-CSF binding and receptor dimerization are not clear. We have previously described the discovery and initial characterization of a nonpeptidyl small molecule, SB-247464, that acts as a mimic of G-CSF (23Tian S.-S. Lamb P. King A.G. Miller S.G. Kessler L. Luengo J.I. Averill L. Johnson R.K. Gleason J.G. Pelus L.M. Dillon S.B. Rosen J. Science. 1998; 281: 257-259Google Scholar). This compound was discovered as part of a high throughput screen designed to detect compounds that activate G-CSF signal transduction pathways in a murine cell line. Like G-CSF, SB-247464 supports the formation of granulocytic colonies from primary murine bone marrow in vitro. When injected into mice, SB-247464 causes increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts and achieves an efficacy equivalent to a saturating dose of recombinant G-CSF. Using chimeric receptor constructs, we determined that expression of the extracellular domain of the murine G-CSF receptor is required for SB-247464 action, but the reason for this requirement was not established. In this study, we have examined in more detail the mode of action of the compound and its effect on the murine G-CSF receptor. Our data show that SB-247464 interacts with the N-terminal half of the extracellular domain of the receptor and promotes receptor dimerization. Also, in contrast to G-CSF, we have found that the binding and activity of SB-247464 is completely dependent on the presence of zinc ions. DISCUSSIONSB-247464 was originally discovered by virtue of its ability to activate G-CSF signal transduction pathways and was subsequently found to be a selective mimic of G-CSF both in vitro and in vivo (23Tian S.-S. Lamb P. King A.G. Miller S.G. Kessler L. Luengo J.I. Averill L. Johnson R.K. Gleason J.G. Pelus L.M. Dillon S.B. Rosen J. Science. 1998; 281: 257-259Google Scholar). These are novel activities for a low molecular weight, nonpeptidyl molecule, and it was therefore of considerable interest to determine both the molecular target for SB-247464 and its mechanism of action. The cell-based assay used to identify SB-247464 can in principle detect compounds acting at many points in the G-CSF signaling cascade (33Seidel H.M. Lamb P. Rosen J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2645-2656Google Scholar). Our initial characterization of SB-247464 indicated a requirement for murine G-CSF receptor expression for compound activity. However, it was not established whether the receptor was in fact the direct target for SB-247464 or whether it played an indirect role in compound activity.Here we show that SB-247464 interacts with soluble extracellular domain fragments derived from the murine G-CSF receptor using both isothermal calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation. This strongly suggests that the extracellular domain of the receptor is the molecular target for SB-247464. The primary binding site for SB-247464 maps to the N-terminal half of the extracellular domain, comprising the Ig-like domain and the two FN-III-like domains of the CRH region. This is the same fragment of the receptor that binds to G-CSF (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Google Scholar, 18.Hiraoka, O., Anaguchi, H., Asakura, A., and Ota, Y. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25928–25934.Google Scholar, 22Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Google Scholar). However, SB-247464 appears to be unable to compete with G-CSF for binding to the intact G-CSF receptor on NFS60 cells, suggesting that it binds to this region of the receptor at a site not involved in interactions with G-CSF. This is in contrast to the peptide mimics of erythropoietin and thrombopoietin and a recently described nonpeptidyl mimic of erythropoietin, which compete with the natural cytokine for receptor binding (34Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S. Johnson D.L. Barrett R.W. Jolliffe L.K. Dower W.J. Science. 1996; 273: 458-463Google Scholar, 35Cwirla S.E. Balasubramanian P. Duffin D.J. Wagstrom C.R. Gates C.M. Singer S.C. Davis A.M. Tansik R.L. Mattheakis L.C. Boytos C.M. Schatz P.J. Baccanari D.P. Wrighton N.C. Barret R.W. Dower W.J. Science. 1997; 276: 1696-1699Google Scholar, 36Qureshi S.A. Kim R.M. Konteatis Z. Biazzo D.E. Motamedi H. Rodrigues R. Boice J.A. Calaycay J.R. Bednarek M.A. Griffin P. Gao Y.D. Chapman K. Mark D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12156-12161Google Scholar).The in vitro binding studies show that SB-247464 does not bind to receptor in the absence of zinc ions. This explains the requirement for zinc ions for compound activity in the cell-based luciferase assay. Serum contained in the tissue culture media contains sufficient zinc ions to promote compound activity, but in biochemical assays it must be supplied exogenously. Isothermal calorimetry provides direct evidence that SB-247464 binds zinc ions, presumably via the two metal chelation sites present in the compound. The precise role of zinc ions in promoting compound binding is not known. In addition to their role in catalysis and stabilizing protein structure, zinc ions are known to mediate certain protein-protein interactions via coordination of amino acids in both proteins (37Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Google Scholar, 38Coleman J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 222-234Google Scholar, 39Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Google Scholar). In this case, the zinc ion may be coordinated to both SB-247464 and amino acids in the receptor, directly mediating compound binding. Alternately, zinc ions may indirectly promote compound binding by stabilizing the conformation or oligomerization state of SB-247464 that constitutes the receptor binding species.Analysis of mouse/human chimeric G-CSF receptor constructs shows that amino acids in the murine transmembrane domain are required (but not sufficient) for efficient activation of the receptor by SB-247464. SB-247464 does not efficiently activate chimeric G-CSF receptors in which the transmembrane domain is entirely human in origin, even if they contain the binding site for the compound. The murine transmembrane domain may transmit or permit a conformational change in response to compound that is impeded by the human receptor transmembrane domain. In contrast, the response of chimeric G-CSF receptors to G-CSF is not influenced by the species derivation of the transmembrane domain.The analytical ultracentrifuge experiments demonstrate that SB-247464 causes oligomerization of the G-CSF receptor extracellular domain. This observation provides an explanation for the ability of the compound to mimic the activities G-CSF in cellular and in vivo assays. Dimerization of the G-CSF receptor has been shown to be sufficient to trigger signal transduction, an observation that is generally true for homodimeric receptors of this family (40Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar, 41Elliot S. Lorenzini T. Yanagihara D. Chang D. Elliot G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24691-24697Google Scholar, 42Schneider H. Chaovapong W. Matthews D.J.

Dimerization or higher order oligomerization of G-CSF receptor extracellular domain fragments in the presence of G-CSF has been reported in a number of biochemical studies and is evident in the crystal structure of the receptor CRH domain bound to G-CSF (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Google Scholar, 18.Hiraoka, O., Anaguchi, H., Asakura, A., and Ota, Y. J. Biol.

The symmetry of SB-247464 allows the molecule to simultaneously bind to two zinc ions in a C2-symmetrical fashion. This property of SB-247464 suggests a model where the resulting SB-247464(Zn)2 ternary complex interacts with two different receptor chains, promoting their dimerization on the surface of the cell. This model is consistent with the observation that the related compound SB-250017, which lacks the symmetry elements of SB-247464 and contains a single zinc-binding site, can bind to the receptor but cannot dimerize it. Instead, SB-250017 acts as an antagonist of SB-247464, although it has no effect on the activation of receptor by G-CSF. This latter observation also suggests that the details of receptor dimerization by SB-247464 and G-CSF differ, perhaps indicating that there are multiple pathways that lead to receptor activation.Internalization of G-CSF receptors by SB-247464 provides additional evidence that this compound induces receptor clustering. The shape of the dose-response curve in this assay warrants discussion. Increasing concentrations of SB-247464 initially induce greater levels of receptor down-regulation, up to 1 μm. Higher concentrations reduce receptor internalization, however. This inverted bell-shaped dose-response curve mirrors the bell-shaped dose-response curve seen with SB-247464 in the luciferase assay. Increasing concentrations of SB-247464 initially cause increased levels of luciferase expression, but higher concentrations elicit lower levels of luciferase expression. This effect is not due to compound toxicity. If SB-247464 induces receptor dimerization by binding to two receptor chains, these dose-response curves can be explained by self-antagonism of the compound at high concentrations due to occupation of all available receptor chains by a single molecule of SB-247464. A similar phenomenon has been described for growth hormone and erythropoietin (42Schneider H. Chaovapong W. Matthews D.J. Karkaria C. Cass R.T. Zhan H. Boyle M. Lorenzini T. Elliott S.G. Giebel L.B.

Tian, unpublished result. again suggesting that SB-247464 activates the receptor in a novel manner. A detailed review of this effect and its implications has been presented by Whitty and Borysenko (47Whitty A. Borysenko C.W. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R107-R118Google Scholar).Our data do not exclude an alternate model for SB-247464-mediated receptor dimerization, in which the compound binds to a single receptor chain and induces a conformational change that favors dimerization. However, this model does not readily explain the dose-response curves described above. Structural data showing the details of SB-247464 interaction with the receptor will allow a more complete understanding of the mechanism of action of this compound and may provide insight into differences between G-CSF- and SB-247464-mediated receptor activation.These results show that low molecular weight compounds can selectively bind, dimerize, and activate relatively large receptors that are normally activated by protein ligands. Since compounds such as SB-247464 are readily amenable to optimization through standard medicinal chemistry techniques, it should be possible to develop small molecule, orally bioavailable drugs with the potential to replace injectable recombinant proteins such as cytokines. SB-247464 was originally discovered by virtue of its ability to activate G-CSF signal transduction pathways and was subsequently found to be a selective mimic of G-CSF both in vitro and in vivo (23Tian S.-S.
