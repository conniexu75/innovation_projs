https://openalex.org/W4296806570,"The neurologic manifestations of acute COVID-19 are well characterized, but a comprehensive evaluation of postacute neurologic sequelae at 1 year has not been undertaken. Here we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of 154,068 individuals with COVID-19, 5,638,795 contemporary controls and 5,859,621 historical controls; we use inverse probability weighting to balance the cohorts, and estimate risks and burdens of incident neurologic disorders at 12 months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that in the postacute phase of COVID-19, there was increased risk of an array of incident neurologic sequelae including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cognition and memory disorders, peripheral nervous system disorders, episodic disorders (for example, migraine and seizures), extrapyramidal and movement disorders, mental health disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, sensory disorders, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and encephalitis or encephalopathy. We estimated that the hazard ratio of any neurologic sequela was 1.42 (95% confidence intervals 1.38, 1.47) and burden 70.69 (95% confidence intervals 63.54, 78.01) per 1,000 persons at 12 months. The risks and burdens were elevated even in people who did not require hospitalization during acute COVID-19. Limitations include a cohort comprising mostly White males. Taken together, our results provide evidence of increased risk of long-term neurologic disorders in people who had COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4296685812,"Abstract Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) have both demonstrated impressive clinical activity in relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In this study, we analyzed the outcome of 809 patients with R/R DLBCL after two or more previous lines of treatment who had a commercial chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells order for axi-cel or tisa-cel and were registered in the retrospective French DESCAR-T registry study ( NCT04328298 ). After 1:1 propensity score matching ( n = 418), the best overall response rate/complete response rate (ORR/CRR) was 80%/60% versus 66%/42% for patients treated with axi-cel compared to tisa-cel, respectively ( P &lt; 0.001 for both ORR and CRR comparisons). After a median follow-up of 11.7 months, the 1-year progression-free survival was 46.6% for axi-cel and 33.2% for tisa-cel (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.46–0.79; P = 0.0003). Overall survival (OS) was also significantly improved after axi-cel infusion compared to after tisa-cel infusion (1-year OS 63.5% versus 48.8%; HR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45–0.88; P = 0.0072). Similar findings were observed using the inverse probability of treatment weighting statistical approach. Grade 1–2 cytokine release syndrome was significantly more frequent with axi-cel than with tisa-cel, but no significant difference was observed for grade ≥3. Regarding immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), both grade 1–2 and grade ≥3 ICANS were significantly more frequent with axi-cel than with tisa-cel. In conclusion, our matched comparison study supports a higher efficacy and also a higher toxicity of axi-cel compared to tisa-cel in the third or more treatment line for R/R DLBCL."
https://openalex.org/W4296691261,"Risk stratification is critical for the early identification of high-risk individuals and disease prevention. Here we explored the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-derived metabolomic profiles to inform on multidisease risk beyond conventional clinical predictors for the onset of 24 common conditions, including metabolic, vascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal and neurological diseases and cancers. Specifically, we trained a neural network to learn disease-specific metabolomic states from 168 circulating metabolic markers measured in 117,981 participants with ~1.4 million person-years of follow-up from the UK Biobank and validated the model in four independent cohorts. We found metabolomic states to be associated with incident event rates in all the investigated conditions, except breast cancer. For 10-year outcome prediction for 15 endpoints, with and without established metabolic contribution, a combination of age and sex and the metabolomic state equaled or outperformed established predictors. Moreover, metabolomic state added predictive information over comprehensive clinical variables for eight common diseases, including type 2 diabetes, dementia and heart failure. Decision curve analyses showed that predictive improvements translated into clinical utility for a wide range of potential decision thresholds. Taken together, our study demonstrates both the potential and limitations of NMR-derived metabolomic profiles as a multidisease assay to inform on the risk of many common diseases simultaneously."

https://openalex.org/W4296683167,"Somatic mutations in cancer genes have been detected in clonal expansions across healthy human tissue, including in clonal hematopoiesis. However, because mutated and wild-type cells are admixed, we have limited ability to link genotypes with phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, we leveraged multi-modality single-cell sequencing, capturing genotype, transcriptomes and methylomes in progenitors from individuals with DNMT3A R882 mutated clonal hematopoiesis. DNMT3A mutations result in myeloid over lymphoid bias, and an expansion of immature myeloid progenitors primed toward megakaryocytic-erythroid fate, with dysregulated expression of lineage and leukemia stem cell markers. Mutated DNMT3A leads to preferential hypomethylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 targets and a specific CpG flanking motif. Notably, the hypomethylation motif is enriched in binding motifs of key hematopoietic transcription factors, serving as a potential mechanistic link between DNMT3A mutations and aberrant transcriptional phenotypes. Thus, single-cell multi-omics paves the road to defining the downstream consequences of mutations that drive clonal mosaicism."
https://openalex.org/W4296683311,"Complete and accurate reference genomes and annotations provide fundamental resources for functional genomics and crop breeding. Here we report a de novo assembly and annotation of a pea cultivar ZW6 with contig N50 of 8.98 Mb, which features a 243-fold increase in contig length and evident improvements in the continuity and quality of sequence in complex repeat regions compared with the existing one. Genome diversity of 118 cultivated and wild pea demonstrated that Pisum abyssinicum is a separate species different from P. fulvum and P. sativum within Pisum. Quantitative trait locus analyses uncovered two known Mendel's genes related to stem length (Le/le) and seed shape (R/r) as well as some candidate genes for pod form studied by Mendel. A pan-genome of 116 pea accessions was constructed, and pan-genes preferred in P. abyssinicum and P. fulvum showed distinct functional enrichment, indicating the potential value of them as pea breeding resources in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4296684511,"Abstract Methods to spatially profile the transcriptome are dominated by a trade-off between resolution and throughput. Here we develop a method named Enhanced ELectric Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (EEL FISH) that can rapidly process large tissue samples without compromising spatial resolution. By electrophoretically transferring RNA from a tissue section onto a capture surface, EEL speeds up data acquisition by reducing the amount of imaging needed, while ensuring that RNA molecules move straight down toward the surface, preserving single-cell resolution. We apply EEL on eight entire sagittal sections of the mouse brain and measure the expression patterns of up to 440 genes to reveal complex tissue organization. Moreover, EEL can be used to study challenging human samples by removing autofluorescent lipofuscin, enabling the spatial transcriptome of the human visual cortex to be visualized. We provide full hardware specifications, all protocols and complete software for instrument control, image processing, data analysis and visualization."
https://openalex.org/W4296691508,"Abstract Targeted degradation of cell surface and extracellular proteins via lysosomal delivery is an important means to modulate extracellular biology. However, these approaches have limitations due to lack of modularity, ease of development, restricted tissue targeting and applicability to both cell surface and extracellular proteins. We describe a lysosomal degradation strategy, termed cytokine receptor-targeting chimeras (KineTACs), that addresses these limitations. KineTACs are fully genetically encoded bispecific antibodies consisting of a cytokine arm, which binds its cognate cytokine receptor, and a target-binding arm for the protein of interest. We show that KineTACs containing the cytokine CXCL12 can use the decoy recycling receptor, CXCR7, to target a variety of target proteins to the lysosome for degradation. Additional KineTACs were designed to harness other CXCR7-targeting cytokines, CXCL11 and vMIPII, and the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-targeting cytokine IL-2. Thus, KineTACs represent a general, modular, selective and simple genetically encoded strategy for inducing lysosomal delivery of extracellular and cell surface targets with broad or tissue-specific distribution."
https://openalex.org/W4296690345,"Unlike familial Alzheimer's disease, we have been unable to accurately predict symptom onset in presymptomatic familial frontotemporal dementia (f-FTD) mutation carriers, which is a major hurdle to designing disease prevention trials. We developed multimodal models for f-FTD disease progression and estimated clinical trial sample sizes in C9orf72, GRN and MAPT mutation carriers. Models included longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological scores, regional brain volumes and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) in 796 carriers and 412 noncarrier controls. We found that the temporal ordering of clinical and biomarker progression differed by genotype. In prevention-trial simulations using model-based patient selection, atrophy and NfL were the best endpoints, whereas clinical measures were potential endpoints in early symptomatic trials. f-FTD prevention trials are feasible but will likely require global recruitment efforts. These disease progression models will facilitate the planning of f-FTD clinical trials, including the selection of optimal endpoints and enrollment criteria to maximize power to detect treatment effects."
https://openalex.org/W4296689706,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 13 (Cas13) has been rapidly developed for nucleic-acid-based diagnostics by using its characteristic collateral activity. Despite the recent progress in optimizing the Cas13 system for the detection of nucleic acids, engineering Cas13 protein with enhanced collateral activity has been challenging, mostly because of its complex structural dynamics. Here we successfully employed a novel strategy to engineer the Leptotrichia wadei (Lwa)Cas13a by inserting different RNA-binding domains into a unique active-site-proximal loop within its higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding domain. Two LwaCas13a variants showed enhanced collateral activity and improved sensitivity over the wild type in various buffer conditions. By combining with an electrochemical method, our variants detected the SARS-CoV-2 genome at attomolar concentrations from both inactive viral and unextracted clinical samples, without target preamplification. Our engineered LwaCas13a enzymes with enhanced collateral activity are ready to be integrated into other Cas13a-based platforms for ultrasensitive detection of nucleic acids."
https://openalex.org/W4296804581,"Visual input during natural behavior is highly dependent on movements of the eyes and head, but how information about eye and head position is integrated with visual processing during free movement is unknown, as visual physiology is generally performed under head fixation. To address this, we performed single-unit electrophysiology in V1 of freely moving mice while simultaneously measuring the mouse's eye position, head orientation, and the visual scene from the mouse's perspective. From these measures, we mapped spatiotemporal receptive fields during free movement based on the gaze-corrected visual input. Furthermore, we found a significant fraction of neurons tuned for eye and head position, and these signals were integrated with visual responses through a multiplicative mechanism in the majority of modulated neurons. These results provide new insight into coding in the mouse V1 and, more generally, provide a paradigm for investigating visual physiology under natural conditions, including active sensing and ethological behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4296691503,"Several biobanks, including UK Biobank (UKBB), are generating large-scale sequencing data. An existing method, SAIGE-GENE, performs well when testing variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤ 1%, but inflation is observed in variance component set-based tests when restricting to variants with MAF ≤ 0.1% or 0.01%. Here, we propose SAIGE-GENE+ with greatly improved type I error control and computational efficiency to facilitate rare variant tests in large-scale data. We further show that incorporating multiple MAF cutoffs and functional annotations can improve power and thus uncover new gene-phenotype associations. In the analysis of UKBB whole exome sequencing data for 30 quantitative and 141 binary traits, SAIGE-GENE+ identified 551 gene-phenotype associations."
https://openalex.org/W4296795082,"Background Depression is one of the most serious yet understudied issues among Bangladeshi nurses, bringing health dangers to this workforce. This study aimed to investigate how workplace violence (WPV), bullying, burnout, and job satisfaction are correlated with depression and identify the factors associated with depression among Bangladeshi nurses. Methods For this cross-sectional study, data were collected between February 26, 2021, and July 10, 2021 from the Bangladeshi registered nurses. The Workplace Violence Scale (WPVS), the Short Negative Acts Questionnaire [S-NAQ], the Burnout Measure-Short version (BMS), the Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS-5), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure WPV, bullying, burnout, job satisfaction, and depression, respectively. Inferential statistics include Pearson’s correlation test, t-test, one-way ANOVA test, multiple linear regression, and multiple hierarchal regression analyses were performed. Results The study investigated 1,264 nurses (70.02% female) with an average age of 28.41 years (SD = 5.54). Depression was positively correlated with WPV, bullying, and burnout and negatively correlated with job satisfaction (p &lt;0.001). According to the multiple linear regression model, depression was significantly lower among nurses with diploma degrees (β = -1.323, 95% CI = -2.149 to -0.497) and bachelor’s degrees (β = -1.327, 95% CI = -2.131 to– 0.523) compared to the nurses with master’s degree. The nurses who worked extended hours (&gt;48 hours) had a significantly higher depression score (β = 1.490, 95% CI = 0.511 to 2.470) than those who worked ≤ 36 hours. Depression was found to be significantly higher among those who did not receive a timely salary (β = 2.136, 95% CI = 1.138 to 3.134), rewards for good works (β = 1.862, 95% CI = 1.117 to 2.607), and who had no training on WPV (β = 0.895, 95% CI = 0.092 to 1.698). Conclusions Controlling burnout, bullying, and workplace violence, as well as improving the work environment for nurses and increasing job satisfaction, are the essential indicators of reducing depression. This can be accomplished with integrative support from hospital executives, policymakers, and government officials."
https://openalex.org/W4296797698,"The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to represent an ongoing global health issue given the potential for new variants, vaccine escape and the low likelihood of eliminating all reservoirs of the disease. Whilst diagnostic testing has progressed at a fast pace, the metabolic drivers of outcomes-and whether markers can be found in different biofluids-are not well understood. Recent research has shown that serum metabolomics has potential for prognosis of disease progression. In a hospital setting, collection of saliva samples is more convenient for both staff and patients, and therefore offers an alternative sampling matrix to serum.Saliva samples were collected from hospitalised patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, alongside clinical metadata. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed using RT-PCR testing, and COVID-19 severity was classified using clinical descriptors (respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation score and C-reactive protein levels). Metabolites were extracted and analysed using high resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the resulting peak area matrix was analysed using multivariate techniques.Positive percent agreement of 1.00 between a partial least squares-discriminant analysis metabolomics model employing a panel of 6 features (5 of which were amino acids, one that could be identified by formula only) and the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 severity was achieved. The negative percent agreement with the clinical severity diagnosis was also 1.00, leading to an area under receiver operating characteristics curve of 1.00 for the panel of features identified.In this exploratory work, we found that saliva metabolomics and in particular amino acids can be capable of separating high severity COVID-19 patients from low severity COVID-19 patients. This expands the atlas of COVID-19 metabolic dysregulation and could in future offer the basis of a quick and non-invasive means of sampling patients, intended to supplement existing clinical tests, with the goal of offering timely treatment to patients with potentially poor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4296608978,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in respiratory samples and was found to commonly cause cough and pneumonia. However, non-respiratory symptoms including gastrointestinal disorders are also present and a big proportion of patients test positive for the virus in stools for a prolonged period. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated viral load trends in stools and nasopharyngeal swabs and their correlation with multiple demographic and clinical factors. The study included 211 laboratory-confirmed cases suffering from a mild form of the disease and completing their isolation period at a non-hospital center in the United Arab Emirates. Demographic and clinical information was collected by standardized questionnaire and from the medical records of the patient. Of the 211 participants, 25% tested negative in both sample types at the time of this study and 53% of the remaining patients had detectable viral RNA in their stools. A positive fecal viral test was associated with male gender, diarrhea as a symptom, and hospitalization during infection. A positive correlation was also observed between a delayed onset of symptoms and a positive stool test. Viral load in stools positively correlated with, being overweight, exercising, taking antibiotics in the last 3 months and blood type O. The viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs, on the other hand, was higher for blood type A, and rhesus positive (Rh factor). Regression analysis showed no correlation between the viral loads measured in stool and nasopharyngeal samples in any given patient. The results of this work highlight the factors associated with a higher viral count in each sample. It also shows the importance of stool sample analysis for the follow-up and diagnosis of recovering COVID-19 patients."

https://openalex.org/W4296798619,"Edge effects, abiotic and biotic changes associated with habitat boundaries, are key drivers of community change in fragmented landscapes. Their influence is heavily modulated by matrix composition. With over half of the world's tropical forests predicted to become forest edge by the end of the century, it is paramount that conservationists gain a better understanding of how tropical biota is impacted by edge gradients. Bats comprise a large fraction of tropical mammalian fauna and are demonstrably sensitive to habitat modification. Yet, knowledge about how bat assemblages are affected by edge effects remains scarce. Capitalizing on a whole-ecosystem manipulation in the Central Amazon, the aims of this study were to i) assess the consequences of edge effects for twelve aerial insectivorous bat species across the interface of primary and secondary forest, and ii) investigate if the activity levels of these species differed between the understory and canopy and if they were modulated by distance from the edge. Acoustic surveys were conducted along four 2-km transects, each traversing equal parts of primary and ca. 30-year-old secondary forest. Five models were used to assess the changes in the relative activity of forest specialists (three species), flexible forest foragers (three species), and edge foragers (six species). Modelling results revealed limited evidence of edge effects, except for forest specialists in the understory. No significant differences in activity were found between the secondary or primary forest but almost all species exhibited pronounced vertical stratification. Previously defined bat guilds appear to hold here as our study highlights that forest bats are more edge-sensitive than edge foraging bats. The absence of pronounced edge effects and the comparable activity levels between primary and old secondary forests indicates that old secondary forest can help ameliorate the consequences of fragmentation on tropical aerial insectivorous bats."
https://openalex.org/W4296807798,"Purpose Despite poor sleep quality being recognised in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, reports from milder forms of Muscular Dystrophy (MD), and accompanied associations with quality of life (QoL), pain and fatigue, remain limited however. Methods Adult males (n = 15 Beckers MD (BMD), n = 12 Limb-Girdle MD (LGMD), n = 12 Fascioscapulohumeral (FSHD), n = 14 non-MD (CTRL)) completed assessments of body composition (Bio-electrical impedance), sleep (7-day 24-hour tri-axial accelerometer, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index, QoL (SF36-v2), pain (Visual analogue scale), fatigue (Modified Fatigue Index Scale) and functional assessments (Brookes and Vignos). Results FSHD and BMD reported worse sleep than CTRL on the PSQI. FSHD scored worse than CTRL on the Insomnia Severity Index (P&lt;0.05). 25–63% and 50–81% of adults with MD reported poor sleep quality using the Insomnia Severity Index and PSQI, respectively. Accelerometery identified no difference in sleep quality between groups. Associations were identified between sleep measures (PSQI global and insomnia severity) with mental or physical QoL in LGMD, BMD and FSHD. Multiple regression identified associations between sleep impairment and fatigue severity (all MDs), body composition (BMD &amp; LGMD), upper and lower limb function (LGMD, FSHD) and age (FSHD). Conclusions 25–81% of men with MD, depending on classification, experience sleep impairment, using self-report sleep measures. Whilst BMD and FSHD showed worse sleep outcomes than CTRL, no group difference was observed between LGMD and CTRL, however all groups showed associations with sleep impairment and higher levels of fatigue. These findings, and associations with measures of health and wellbeing, highlight an area for further research which could impact QoL in adults with MD."
https://openalex.org/W4296794317,"Sensory processing is influenced by cognitive and behavioral states, but how these states interact to modulate responses of individual neurons is unknown. We trained mice in a visual discrimination task wherein they attended to different locations within a hemifield while running or sitting still, enabling us to examine how visual responses are modulated by spatial attention and running behavior. We found that spatial attention improved discrimination performance and strengthened visual responses of excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex whose receptive fields overlapped with the attended location. Although individual neurons were modulated by both spatial attention and running, the magnitudes of these influences were not correlated. While running-dependent modulation was stable across days, attentional modulation was dynamic, influencing individual neurons to different degrees after repeated changes in attentional states. Thus, despite similar effects on neural responses, spatial attention and running act independently with different dynamics, implying separable mechanisms for their implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4296804967,"This paper takes the 2014 pilot project of accelerated depreciation of fixed assets as a quasi-natural experiment, and builds a Propensity Score Matching-Difference in Differences (PSM-DID) model based on the data of Chinese listed companies from 2000 to 2019 to test the impact of tax preference on enterprise investment efficiency and its mechanism. The results show that the policy inhibits supported enterprises investment efficiency significantly. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the policy causes greater investment efficiency losses for small and medium-sized enterprises, non-state-owned enterprises and asset-heavy enterprises. The mechanism test found the reason why the policy eased financing constraints but inhibited investment efficiency in short-term. After a variety of robustness tests, the above basic conclusions are still valid. Although the accelerated depreciation policy of fixed assets is conducive to expanding the scale of investment, the incentive effect on investment efficiency is not obvious, and even shows a restraining effect. Given the existence of heterogeneity, the design of the policy should not only distinguish industries, but also pay attention to the differences between different enterprises in the same industry. Strengthening research and development (R&D) innovation and improving the matching mechanism between human capital and fixed investment will help give full play to the incentive effect of this policy. The research in this paper helps to deepen the understanding of the microeconomic effects of tax policy and identify the internal mechanism, which not only enriches the relevant literature, but also provides a reference for the government to better use tax policy to promote the high-quality development of enterprises."
https://openalex.org/W4296608989,"Fungi in the genus Metarhizium (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) are insect-pathogens and endophytes that can benefit their host plant through growth promotion and protection against stresses. Cochliobolus heterostrophus (Drechsler) Drechsler (Pleosporales: Pleosporaceae) is an economically-significant phytopathogenic fungus that causes Southern Corn Leaf Blight (SCLB) in maize. We conducted greenhouse and lab-based experiments to determine the effects of endophytic M. robertsii J.F. Bisch., Rehner & Humber on growth and defense in maize (Zea mays L.) infected with C. heterostrophus. We inoculated maize seeds with spores of M. robertsii and, at the 3 to 4-leaf stage, the youngest true leaf of M. robertsii-treated and untreated control plants with spores of C. heterostrophus. After 96 h, we measured maize height, above-ground biomass, endophytic colonization by M. robertsii, severity of SCLB, and expression of plant defense genes and phytohormone content. We recovered M. robertsii from 74% of plants grown from treated seed. The severity of SCLB in M. robertsii-treated maize plants was lower than in plants inoculated only with C. heterostrophus. M. robertsii-treated maize inoculated or not inoculated with C. heterostrophus showed greater height and above-ground biomass compared with untreated control plants. Height and above-ground biomass of maize co-inoculated with M. robertsii and C. heterostrophus were not different from M. robertsii-treated maize. M. robertsii modulated the expression of defense genes and the phytohormone content in maize inoculated with C. heterostrophus compared with plants not inoculated with C. heterostrophus and control plants. These results suggest that endophytic M. robertsii can promote maize growth and reduce development of SCLB, possibly by induced systemic resistance mediated by modulation of phytohormones and expression of defense and growth-related genes in maize."
https://openalex.org/W4296793818,"Importance The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted mental health outcomes. While the frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms has increased in the whole population, the relationship between COVID-19 and new psychiatric diagnoses remains unclear. Objective To compare the population incidence rate of emergence of de novo psychiatric disorders in 2020 compared to the previous years, and to compare the incidence rate of new psychiatric disorder diagnoses between people with vs without COVID-19. Design, setting, and participants This study utilized administrative claims data from the Clinformatics® Data Mart database, licensed from Optum®. The study is a cross-sectional analysis that compared the incidence rate of new psychiatric disorders in 2020 vs. 2018 and 2019 in the entire insured population database. Subsequently, the incidence of new psychiatric disorders in people with vs. without COVID-19 during 2020 was analyzed. Exposure The exposures included diagnosis and severity of COVID-19 infection. Main outcomes measures The dependent variables of interest were the incidence rates of new psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Results The population studied included 10,463,672 US adults (mean age 52.83, 52% female) who were unique people for the year of 2020. Incidence of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders per 1,000 individuals in the 2020 whole population were 28.81 (CI: 28.71, 28.92) for anxiety disorders, 1.04 (CI: 1.02, 1.06) for schizophrenia disorders, 0.42 (CI: 0.41, 0.43) for OCD and 28.85 (CI: 28.75, 28.95) for mood disorders. These rates were not significantly higher than 2018 or 2019. When comparing incidence rates between COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19 populations in 2020, the rates were significantly higher in the COVID-19 population: 46.89 (CI: 46.24, 47.53) for anxiety, 49.31 (CI: 48.66, 49.97) for mood disorders, 0.57 (CI: 0.50, 0.65) for OCD, and 3.52 (CI: 3.34, 3.70) for schizophrenia. COVID-19 severity was significantly associated with new diagnoses of schizophrenia, anxiety and mood disorders in multivariate analyses. Conclusions Compared to 2018 and 2019, in 2020 there was no increased incidence of new psychiatric disorders in the general population based on insurance claims data. Importantly, people with COVID-19 were more likely to be diagnosed with a new psychiatric disorder, most notably disorders with psychosis, indicating a potential association between COVID-19 and mental/brain health."

To accomplish this participation in the External Quality Assessment Program (EQAS) is required. This evaluates the consistency of diagnostic testing procedures and offers guidance for improving quality. Outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic led to worldwide lockdown and disruption of healthcare services including participation in EQAS.The present study describes the extended scope of EQAS offered byMPQAP (Molecular Pathology Quality Assurance Program), the first proficiency test provider for solid tumor diagnostics in India. The study surveys the preparedness of molecular testing laboratories in routine diagnostics and participation for quality assessment scheme.A documented guideline for measures and precautions to be carried by testing laboratories in performing routine diagnostic tests during the lockdown period were charted and distributed to all MPQAP participant centres. A survey was conducted for MPQAP participants to check whether laboratories were involved in COVID-19 testing and to evaluate the impact of lockdown on the operations of diagnostics procedures. From the acquired response of the survey, 2 cycles out of initially proposed 11 cycles were executed with transformed approach using digital tools and image interpretation modules.Out of 25 solid tumour testing laboratories registered as participants, 15 consented to participate in survey. The summary of survey conveyed the impact of COVID-19onroutine operations of diagnostics tests such as shortcomings in inventory and human resource management. Thirteen participants showed active willingness and consented to participate in EQAS test scheme.The survey findings and assessment of EQAS cycles endorsed the quality testing procedures carried by participating laboratories throughout the lockdown. It highlighted the utility of EQAS participation during pandemic along with emphasis on safety measures for continual improvement in quality of diagnostic services."
https://openalex.org/W4296793597,"High-quality, respectful maternity care has been identified as an important birth process and outcome. However, there are very few studies about experiences of care during a pregnancy and birth after a prior cesarean in the U.S. We describe quantitative findings related to quality of maternity care from a mixed methods study examining the experience of considering or seeking a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) in the U.S.Individuals with a history of cesarean and recent (≤ 5 years) subsequent birth were recruited through social media groups to complete an online questionnaire that included sociodemographic information, birth history, and validated measures of respectful maternity care (Mothers on Respect Index; MORi) and autonomy in maternity care (Mother's Autonomy in Decision Making Scale; MADM).Participants (N = 1711) representing all 50 states completed the questionnaire; 87% planned a vaginal birth after cesarean. The most socially-disadvantaged participants (those less educated, living in a low-income household, with Medicaid insurance, and those participants who identified as a racial or ethnic minority) and participants who had an obstetrician as their primary provider, a male provider, and those who did not have a doula were significantly overrepresented in the group who reported lower quality maternity care. In regression analyses, individuals identified as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) were less likely to experience autonomy and respect compared to white participants. Participants with a midwife provider were more than 3.5 times more likely to experience high quality maternity care compared to those with an obstetrician.Findings highlight inequities in the quality of maternal and newborn care received by birthing people with marginalized identities in the U.S. They also indicate the importance of increasing access to midwifery care as a strategy for reducing inequalities in care and associated poor outcomes."

To explore the degree of integration between the digital economy and the logistics industry, this paper uses input-output models and social network analysis to empirically analyse the level of industrial integration between the core industries of China's digital economy and the logistics industry during the period 2007-2017. The level of integration between the core industries of China's digital economy and the logistics industry is measured, and its spatial and temporal characteristics are also measured and analysed. The analysis showed that (1) the degree of integration between the two industries is low, but with changes over time, the degree of integration will follow an upwards trend; the overall level of integration is increasing with the development of the core industries of the digital economy; the growth rate is significant, and developed regions have a clear advantage because of the intensity of integration. (2) The direction of industrial integration linkages is basically stable, with the pointing characteristics of adjacent provinces, and the spatial distribution shows a pattern of diffusion from the central region to the eastern and western regions. Overall, the integration shows an economic radiation effect, but there are large differences between the north and south. (3) It is easier for adjacent provinces to form the same cohesive subgroup in a network and develop together. At the same time, the integration network shows a clear pattern of marginal-semimmarginalization. The study enriches and improves the research status of China's digital economy industry convergence, and provides theoretical support for the formulation of policies related to the synergistic development of China's digital economy and logistics industry."
https://openalex.org/W4296794463,"Charities differ, among other things, alongside the likelihood that their interventions succeed and produce the desired outcomes and alongside the extent that such likelihood can even be articulated numerically. In this paper, we investigate what best explains charitable giving behaviour regarding charities that have interventions that will succeed with a quantifiable and high probability (sure-thing charities) and charities that have interventions that only have a small and hard to quantify probability of bringing about the desired end (probabilistic charities). We study individual differences in risk/ambiguity attitudes, empathy, numeracy, optimism, and donor type (warm glow vs. pure altruistic donor type) as potential predictors of this choice. We conduct a money incentivised, pre-registered experiment on Prolific on a representative UK sample (n = 1,506) to investigate participant choices (i) between these two types of charities and (ii) about one randomly selected charity. Overall, we find little to no evidence that individual differences predict choices regarding decisions about sure-thing and probabilistic charities, with the exception that a purely altruistic donor type predicts donations to probabilistic charities when participants were presented with a randomly selected charity in (ii). Conducting exploratory equivalence tests, we find that the data provide robust evidence in favour of the absence of an effect (or a negligibly small effect) where we fail to reject the null. This is corroborated by exploratory Bayesian analyses. We take this paper to be contributing to the literature on charitable giving via this comprehensive null-result in pursuit of contributing to a cumulative science."
https://openalex.org/W4296796628,"Background The number of oral anticancer medications has increased over the past few decades, opening new possibilities in cancer care and improving convenience for patients and caregivers. However, adherence levels continue to be suboptimal, potentially jeopardizing therapeutic benefits. Poor adherence levels may indicate gaps in current strategies and interventions aimed at enhancing medication adherence and the extent to which they address the complex and multi-faceted medication management needs of patients and their caregivers. Beyond commonly understood barriers (e.g., forgetting to take medications), adherence interventions must address systemic barriers that may not be fully appreciated by members of the healthcare system. This scoping review aims to apply a systems framework (human factors engineering framework) to examine system elements targeted by adherence enhancing interventions. Methods Studies published in English, reporting adherence interventions for oral anticancer medications with adherence and/or persistence as primary outcome measures will be included in this review. We will search the following electronic databases with no limits on dates: Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, CINAHL Complete, PsycInfo, and Scopus. Two reviewers will independently screen study titles and abstracts for inclusion with a third reviewer adjudicating conflicts. Full text of included articles will be used to extract information on systemic barriers targeted by adherence interventions as well as information about intervention type, outcomes, and study characteristics. Extracted information will be synthesized to generate a summary of work system factors targeted by adherence interventions. Discussion Through application of a systems-based approach, this scoping review is expected to shed light on the complex and multifaceted nature of factors influencing adherence to oral anticancer agents. The review may also identify areas that are ripe for further research."
https://openalex.org/W4296796649,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare positive cystography techniques at 5%, 10%, and 20%, as well as three different double-contrast protocols for detecting radiolucent uroliths with a diameter of less than 3.0 mm in dogs. Six cadavers were used, one was selected at random to represent the negative control, and the others were submitted to urolith implantation in the bladder by urethral catheter. Three radiology professionals blindly accessed ventrodorsal and -lateral projections of each test. Contrast at 20% showed greater diagnostic sensitivity, but with greater difficulty identifying the number and size of the uroliths. Consequently, double-contrast techniques are better and should be used for diagnostic and therapeutic planning. Sensitivity and specificity tests demonstrated that positive 5% cystography and different concentrations of double contrast obtained better results in terms of sensitivity and specificity. However, due to the presence of a greater amount of artifacts in the 5% cystography, it is suggested that double contrast is used for this purpose, especially with the removal of contrast excess (protocol 2)."

Infants and children with congenital heart disease exhibit a range of delays in weight gain and growth. In some instances, the delay can be relatively mild, whereas in other cases, cause the failure to thrive.To determine the nutritional status and associated factors of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease.A cross sectional analytical study conducted over a period of 6 months (Feb to Jul 2020). A total of 228 subjects with congenital heart disease who visited the cardiac center during the study period where included until the calculated sample size attained. Data is collected from patient's card and their care giver. Data was then analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for windows version 25.0. Odds Ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was used to determine the effect of the independent variables on the outcome variable and P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 228 children ranging from 3month to 17yrs of age with mean age of 4.7 years (SD = 3.8 years) were included in the study. Most of the subjects had acyanotic heart disease accounting for 87.7%. The overall prevalence of wasting, underweight and stunting were 41.3%, 49.1% and 43% respectively. Children with congenital heart disease and having pulmonary hypertension, were found more likely to develop wasting compared to those without pulmonary hypertension with an odds of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.0-3.4) and also have greater chance of stunting with an odds of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.0-3.4). Children 5 to 10 years of age were 2.3 times more likely to be underweight.Malnutrition is a major problem in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. Pulmonary hypertension and older age are associated with increased risk of undernutrition."
https://openalex.org/W4296801534,"Biologging tags are a key enabling tool for investigating cetacean behavior and locomotion in their natural habitat. Identifying and then parameterizing gait from movement sensor data is critical for these investigations, but how best to characterize gait from tag data remains an open question. Further, the location and orientation of a tag on an animal in the field are variable and can change multiple times during a deployment. As a result, the relative orientation of the tag with respect to (wrt) the animal must be determined for analysis. Currently, custom scripts that involve species-specific heuristics tend to be used in the literature. These methods require a level of knowledge and experience that can affect the reliability and repeatability of the analysis. Swimming gait is composed of a sequence of body poses that have a specific spatial pattern, and tag-based measurements of this pattern can be utilized to determine the relative orientation of the tag. This work presents an automated data processing pipeline (and software) that takes advantage of these patterns to 1) Identify relative motion between the tag and animal; 2) Estimate the relative orientation of the tag wrt the animal using a data-driven approach; and 3) Calculate gait parameters that are stable and invariant to animal pose. Validation results from bottlenose dolphin tag data show that the average relative orientation error (tag wrt the body) after processing was within 11 degrees in roll, pitch, and yaw directions. The average precision and recall for detecting instances of relative motion in the dolphin data were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. Tag data from humpback and beluga whales were then used to demonstrate how the gait analysis can be used to enhance tag-based investigations of movement and behavior. The MATLAB source code and data presented in the paper are publicly available ( https://github.com/ding-z/cetacean-pose-gait-analysis.git ), along with suggested best practices."
https://openalex.org/W4296807540,"The two studies presented in this paper concern the Italian epistemic marker mi sa [lit. to me it knows], which seems to have no equivalent in other European languages and has received very little attention in the literature. No analysis of the occurrences of mi sa in contemporary spoken corpora can be found (first gap) as well as no investigation on the epistemic relationship between mi sa and (1) the other modal expressions that use the verb sapere [to know] in the first person singular of the simple present, i.e., so [I know], non so [I do not know], non so se [I do not know whether] as well as (2) its supposed synonyms credo [I believe] and penso [I think] (second gap). The two studies are closely intertwined, the first being an exploratory, qualitative pilot study for the second. Study 1 aims to fill the first gap through the analysis of the contemporary Italian spoken corpus KIParla. The quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed five types of occurrences (theoretically reducible to two main ones), the most numerous of which are 'mi sa che + proposition'. Study 2 aims to fill the second gap through a questionnaire administered online. The quantitative and statistical results showed the epistemic relationships between the six markers: for the majority of the participants, in the epistemic continuum that goes from unknowledge to uncertainty and then to knowledge, (1) non so refers to unknowledge; non so se, mi sa, credo and penso refer to uncertainty; so refers to knowledge; (2) mi sa, credo, penso confirm to be synonyms; (3) non so se is evaluated as much more uncertain than mi sa, credo, penso. These four epistemic markers seem to occupy a different position along the uncertainty continuum ranging between two poles: doubt (high uncertainty) and belief (low uncertainty)."

We then conducted descriptive analyses of data from the nine BUILD institutions that had collected data and evaluated which activities were associated with research productivity. We used Poisson regression and rate ratios of the numbers of BUILD pilots funded, students included, abstracts, presentations, publications, and submitted and funded grant proposals.Teaching workshops were associated with more abstracts (RR 4.04, 95% CI 2.21-8.09). Workshops on grant writing were associated with more publications (RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.64-4.34) and marginally with marginally more presentations. Incentives to develop courses were associated with more abstracts published (RR 4.33, 95% CI 2.56-7.75).

Longitudinal modeling that considers time lags in career development in moving from project development to grants submissions can provide more direction for future diversity pilot interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4296608996,"Currently, cervical cancer prevention is undergoing comprehensive development regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening. In Sweden and many other countries, high coverage vaccinated cohorts are entering screening within the next few years. This entails demands for baseline HPV genotype data across the screening age range for surveillance and a basis for screening program adjustment. In 2016, Örebro County, Sweden, changed to primary HPV screening using HPV mRNA testing followed by cytology triage. An alternative triage method to cytology could allow for a fully molecular screening algorithm and be implemented in a screening program where self-sampling is included. Hypermethylation analysis of the human genes FAM19A4/miR124-2 has been suggested as a promising triage method. HPV mRNA-positive screening samples (n = 529) were included and subjected to genotyping targeting a broad range of both low-risk and high-risk genotypes in addition to hypermethylation analysis of the two human genes FAM19A4/miR124-2. Data were connected to cytological and histological status and age. The most commonly detected genotypes were HPV31, 16, and 52. In addition, HPV18 was one of the most common genotypes in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) samples. In relation to available vaccines, 26% of the women with histological HSIL or cancer (≥HSIL) tested positive for only hrHPV included in the quadrivalent vaccine and 77% of the genotypes in the nonavalent vaccine. According to these figures, a relatively large proportion of the HSILs will probably remain, even after age cohorts vaccinated with the quadrivalent vaccine enter the screening program. Hypermethylation positivity was associated with increasing age, but no HPV-related independently predictive factors were found. Accordingly, age needs to be considered in development of future screening algorithms including triage with hypermethylation methodology."
https://openalex.org/W4296793557,"Sustainability, as a trend of social development and the embodiment of corporate social responsibility, has begun to receive more attention. To achieve this goal, sustainable supplier selection (SSS) and order allocation (OA) are seen as the crucial activities in corporate management. In the process of SSS, the psychological behavior of decision-makers (DMs) could play a critical role in the evaluation results. Therefore, introducing it into the decision-making process may lead to decision in line with the actual situation. In the uncertain multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem described by probability linguistic term sets (PLTS), the DMs can evaluate the criteria of each supplier based on his own preference and hesitation, which is useful to avoid the loss of information. For this reason, this study develops a novel multi-criteria group decision-making combined with fuzzy multi-objective optimization (MCGDM-FMOO) model for SSS/OA problems by considering the triple bottom line (TBL) in which includes economic, environmental and social factors. The proposed method includes four stages. (1) the best-worst method (BWM) and entropy weight method are utilized to assign the weights of criteria to obtain the comprehensive weight. According to the output weights, the an acronym for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making in Portugese (TODIM) approach is applied to rank the suppliers under PLTS environment; (2) a FMOO model that can effectively deal with uncertainties and dynamic nature of parameter is formulated for allocating optimal order quantities; (3) two novel approaches are utilized to solve the FMOO model in order to obtain the richer Pareto frontier; and (4) the final OA solution is achieved by technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Finally, the validity and practicability of proposed MCGDM-FMOO model are verified by an example and comparative analysis with other classical MCGDM methods."

https://openalex.org/W4296794292,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture represents one of the most recurrent knee injuries in soccer players. To allow a safe return to sport after ACL reconstruction, standardised and reliable procedures/criteria are needed. In this context, wearable sensors are gaining momentum as they allow obtaining objective information during sport-specific and in-the-field tasks. This paper aims at proposing a sensor-based protocol for the assessment of knee stability and at quantifying its reliability. Seventeen soccer players performed a single leg squat and a cross over hop test. Each participant was equipped with two magnetic-inertial measurement units located on the tibia and foot. Parameters related to the knee stability were obtained from linear acceleration and angular velocity signals. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimum detectable change (MDC) were calculated to evaluate each parameter reliability. The ICC ranged from 0.29 to 0.84 according to the considered parameter. Specifically, angular velocity-based parameters proved to be more reliable than acceleration-based counterparts, particularly in the cross over hop test (average ICC values of 0.46 and 0.63 for acceleration- and angular velocity-based parameters, respectively). An exception was represented, in the single leg squat, by parameters extracted from the acceleration trajectory on the tibial transverse plane (0.60≤ICC≤0.76), which can be considered as promising candidates for ACL injury risk assessment. Overall, greater ICC values were found for the dominant limb, with respect to the non-dominant one (average ICC: 0.64 and 0.53, respectively). Interestingly, this between-limb difference in variability was not always mirrored by LSI results. MDC values provide useful information in the perspective of applying the proposed protocol on athletes with ACL reconstruction. Thus, The outcome of this study sets the basis for the definition of reliable and objective criteria for return to sport clearance after ACL injury."
https://openalex.org/W4296794536,"Glycolysis in Sertoli cells (SCs) can provide energy substrates for the development of spermatogenic cells. Triose phosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1) is one of the key catalytic enzymes involved in glycolysis. However, the biological function of TPI1 in SCs and its role in glycolytic metabolic pathways are poorly understood. On the basis of a previous research, we isolated primary SCs from Tibetan sheep, and overexpressed TPI1 gene to determine its effect on the proliferation, glycolysis, and apoptosis of SCs. Secondly, we investigated the relationship between TPI1 and miR-1285-3p, and whether miR-1285-3p regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of SCs, and participates in glycolysis by targeting TPI1. Results showed that overexpression of TPI1 increased the proliferation rate and decreased apoptosis of SCs. In addition, overexpression of TPI1 altered glycolysis and metabolism signaling pathways and significantly increased amount of the final product lactic acid. Further analysis showed that miR-1285-3p inhibited TPI1 by directly targeting its 3'untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-1285-3p suppressed the proliferation of SCs, and this effect was partially reversed by restoration of TPI1 expression. In summary, this study shows that the miR-1285-3p/TPI1 axis regulates glycolysis in SCs. These findings add to our understanding on the regulation of spermatogenesis in sheep and other mammals."
https://openalex.org/W4296796560,"Recurrence of proteinuria after kidney transplantation in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is unpredictable. Several putative circulating permeability factors (CPFs) have been suggested, but none have been validated. A clinically relevant experimental model is required that demonstrates the presence of CPF(s) in patient material, to study CPF(s) and possibly predict recurrence in patients. We aimed to develop a FSGS-prone Thy-1.1 transgenic mouse model with accelerated proteinuria after injection of samples from patients with FSGS. The Thy-1.1 transgene was backcrossed into 5 mouse strains. The age of onset and severity of spontaneous proteinuria varied between the different genetic backgrounds. 129X1/SvThy-1.1 and 129S2/SvPasThy-1.1 mice displayed proteinuria at 4 weeks, whereas Balb/cThy-1.1 and C57BL/6JThy-1.1 mice developed proteinuria from 6 weeks, and were used further. We determined the maximum protein dose that could be injected without causing protein overload in each background. Balb/cThy-1.1 and C57BL/6JThy-1.1 males and females were injected with presumably CPF-containing plasmapheresis effluent from 6 FSGS patients, which induced albuminuria particularly in Balb/cThy-1.1 males. Unfortunately, no response could be detected when using sera instead of plasmapheresis effluent, serum being more clinically relevant in the context of predicting FSGS recurrence. Considering the differences between responses elicited by serum and plasmapheresis effluent, simultaneously collected serum, plasma, and plasmapheresis effluent were tested. Whereas we could detect responses using a validated in vitro model, none of these presumably CPF-containing samples induced proteinuria in Balb/cThy-1.1 males. Thus, we have extensively tested the Thy-1.1 mouse model on different genetic backgrounds with proteinuria after injection of FSGS patient material as clinically relevant readout. The Balb/cThy-1.1 male mouse strain demonstrated the most promising results, but to detect CPF activity in FSGS serum e.g. prior to kidney transplantation, this strain clearly lacks sensitivity and is therefore not yet clinically applicable. It could, however, still be used as research tool to study CPFs in patient samples that did induce proteinuria."
https://openalex.org/W4296799649,"The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of TARGET-based teaching strategies on students' motivation in a Dutch secondary school PE context. We examined to what extent mastery climate teaching strategies perceived by students (independently or interactively) explain variability in students' motivation towards PE. In total 3,150 students (48.2% girls; 51.8% boys) with a mean age of 13.91 years (SD = 1.40) completed the Behavioural Regulations in Physical Education Questionnaire (BRPEQ), measuring students' autonomous motivation, controlled motivation and amotivation, and the Mastery Teaching Perception Questionnaire (MTP-Q), measuring student-perceived application of mastery TARGET teaching strategies. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that after controlling for gender, age, and educational type, the predictive effects of the perceived mastery climate teaching strategies differed by motivational outcome. Overall, students who reported higher levels of perceived application of mastery TARGET teaching strategies showed more autonomous motivation and less amotivation. Specifically, the teaching strategies within the task structure were the strongest predictors for students' autonomous motivation and amotivation. No meaningful statistically significant two-way interaction effects between any of the TARGET variables were found, supporting the proposition of an additive relationship between the TARGET teaching strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4296801114,"Patients with epilepsy, who later succumb to sudden unexpected death, show altered brain tissue volumes in selected regions. It is unclear whether the alterations in brain tissue volume represent changes in neurons or glial properties, since volumetric procedures have limited sensitivity to assess the source of volume changes (e.g., neuronal loss or glial cell swelling). We assessed a measure, entropy, which can determine tissue homogeneity by evaluating tissue randomness, and thus, shows tissue integrity; the measure is easily calculated from T1-weighted images. T1-weighted images were collected with a 3.0-Tesla MRI from 53 patients with tonic-clonic (TC) seizures and 53 healthy controls; images were bias-corrected, entropy maps calculated, normalized to a common space, smoothed, and compared between groups (TC patients and controls using ANCOVA; covariates, age and sex; SPM12, family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons, p<0.01). Decreased entropy, indicative of increased tissue homogeneity, appeared in major autonomic (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, dorsal and ventral medulla, deep cerebellar nuclei), motor (sensory and motor cortex), or both motor and autonomic regulatory sites (basal-ganglia, ventral-basal cerebellum), and external surfaces of the pons. The anterior and posterior thalamus and midbrain also showed entropy declines. Only a few isolated regions showed increased entropy. Among the spared autonomic regions was the anterior cingulate and anterior insula; the posterior insula and cingulate were, however, affected. The entropy alterations overlapped areas of tissue changes found earlier with volumetric measures, but were more extensive, and indicate widespread injury to tissue within critical autonomic and breathing regulatory areas, as well as prominent damage to more-rostral sites that exert influences on both breathing and cardiovascular regulation. The entropy measures provide easily-collected supplementary information using only T1-weighted images, showing aspects of tissue integrity other than volume change that are important for assessing function."

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) directly deliver chemotherapeutic agents into tumor cells based on unique cancer cell biomarkers. A pan-cancer tissue microarray (TMA) data set and gene panel were validated and gene signature analyses were conducted on normal and cancer tissues to refine selection of ADC targets. Correlation of mRNA and protein levels, and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) expression patterns were assessed. An EdgeSeq biomarker panel (2862 genes) was used across 8531 samples (23 solid cancer types/subtypes; 16 normal tissues) with an established TMA data set, and immune cell and cell cycle gene signatures were analyzed. Discriminating gene expression signatures were defined based on pathological classification of cancer subtypes. Correlative analyses of HER2 and HER3 mRNA (EdgeSeq) and protein expression (immunohistochemistry [IHC]) were performed and compared with publicly available data (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]; Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [CCLE]). Gene expression patterns among cancer types in the TMA (EdgeSeq) and TCGA (RNA-seq) were similar. EdgeSeq gene signature analyses aligned with the majority of pathological cancer types/subtypes and identified cancer-specific gene expression patterns. TMA IHC H-scores for HER3 varied across cancer types/subtypes. In a few cancer types, HER3 mRNA and protein expression did not align, including lower liver hepatocellular carcinoma IHC H-score, compared with mRNA. Although all TNBC and ovarian cancer subtypes expressed mRNA, some had lower protein expression. This was seen in TMA and TCGA data sets, but not in CCLE. The EdgeSeq TMA data set can expand upon current biomarker data by including cancers not currently in TCGA. The primary analysis of EdgeSeq and IHC comparison suggested a unique protein-level regulation of HER3 in some tumor subtypes and highlights the importance of investigating protein levels of ADC targets in both tumor and normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4296608957,"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of weightlifting derivatives (WL) and plyometric exercises (PLYO) on unloaded and loaded vertical jumps and sprint performance. Initially, 45 resistance-trained men underwent a 4-week WL learning period. Then, the participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (WL (n = 15), PLYO (n = 15), and control group (CG) (n = 15)) and followed a training period of 8 weeks. The WL group performed exercises to stimulate the entire force-velocity profile, while the PLYO group performed exercises with an emphasis in vertical- and horizontal-oriented. The CG did not perform any exercise. Pre- and post-training assessments included peak power output (PPO) and jump height (JH) in the squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), CMJ with 60% and 80% of the body mass (CMJ60% and CMJ80%, respectively), and mean sprinting speeds over 5, 10, 20, and 30 m distances. From pre- to post-training, PLYO significantly increased (p≤0.05) PPO and JH in the SJ, PPO during CMJ, and PPO and JH in the CMJ60%; however, no significant changes were observed in JH during CMJ, and PPO and JH in the CMJ80%. For WL and CG, no significant changes were observed in the unloaded and loaded vertical jumps variables. PLYO also resulted in significant improvements (p≤0.05) for 5, 10, and 20 m sprint speeds, but not for 30 m. For WL and CG, no significant changes were observed for all sprint speeds. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that PLYO was more effective than a technically-oriented WL program to improve unloaded and loaded vertical jumps and sprint performance."
https://openalex.org/W4296793733,"With the continued development of the new energy vehicle industry, two-stage isolated AC/DC converters are widely used because of their simple topology and easy control characteristics. In this study, we investigate the front-stage Buck power factor correction (PFC) converter and rear-stage full-bridge converter. The main circuit design and component selection were completed through a detailed analysis of the circuit characteristics. In terms of the control strategy, the front-stage adopting PI control and parameter adaptive terminal sliding mode control strategy were proposed for the rear-stage full-bridge converter. This new compound control strategy ensures an optimal regulation of the system under different operating conditions. Simulation analysis verified the correctness of the system topology and control strategy. Based on an analysis of the main parameters of the system, a low-power experimental prototype was trial-produced. The experimental results show that under the same load switching conditions, the parameter-adaptive terminal sliding mode control enhanced faster dynamic regulation and stronger robustness than the conventional PI control. The study is also a good reference in terms of engineering work."

Although several studies have proposed an association between venous thrombosis and von Willebrand factor (VWF), the association between RVO and VWF remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between RVO and VWF and the alteration of VWF levels under anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment. We enrolled 55 patients with RVO involved cystoid macular edema. They received intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs, either ranibizumab or aflibercept. We examined the clinical data and measured plasma VWF antigen and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) activity to identify variabilities during treatment. At baseline, there was no significant difference between the RVO group and age-matched controls in both VWF antigen and ADAMTS13 activity levels, but ADAMTS13 activity was significantly lower in central RVO than in branch RVO (P = 0.015). In branch RVO, VWF antigen was negatively correlated with central choroidal thickness (r = -0.51, P < 0.001). In branch RVO after anti-VEGF treatment, VWF antigen levels decreased significantly from 134% at baseline to 109% at 1 day (P = 0.002) and 107% at 1 month (P = 0.030) after treatment. In contrast, ADAMTS13 activity showed no significant difference during this period. In branch RVO at 1 month after treatment, VWF antigen was negatively correlated with central choroidal thickness (r = -0.47, P = 0.001). Our findings suggest an association between VWF and central choroidal thickness in patients with branch RVO, thus the measurement of VWF may be useful for evaluating disease activity and prognosis."

To better understand how utilization patterns of these welfare programs may change during the 12 months after a job loss, we used the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation to examine the patterns of participation in Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and unemployment insurance among 342 single mothers who transitioned from employment to unemployment during the Great Recession. Using sequence analysis and cluster analysis, this paper identified four distinct patterns of program participation: (a) constantly receiving in-kind benefits; (b) primarily but not solely receiving food stamps; (c) inconsistent unemployment insurance or Medicaid-based benefits; and (d) limited or no benefits. Almost two-fifths of our sample of single mothers received inconsistent, limited, or no benefits. Results of the multinomial regression revealed that race, work disability, poverty, homeownership, and region of residence were significant factors that influenced whether study subjects participated in or had access to social safety net programs. Our findings illustrate the heterogeneity in patterns of multiple program participation among single mothers transitioning from employment to unemployment. Better understanding these varied patterns may inform decisions that increase the accessibility of US social safety net programs for single mothers during periods of personal economic hardship."

Previous research has separately explored the impacts of aging and musicianship on the ability to separate and follow auditory streams. The current study evaluated the simultaneous effects of age and musicianship on auditory streaming induced by three physical features: intensity, spectral envelope and temporal envelope. In the first study, older and younger musicians and non-musicians with normal hearing identified deviants in a four-note melody interleaved with distractors that were more or less similar to the melody in terms of intensity, spectral envelope and temporal envelope. In the second study, older and younger musicians and non-musicians participated in a dissimilarity rating paradigm with pairs of melodies that differed along the same three features. Results suggested that auditory streaming skills are maintained in older adults but that older adults rely on intensity more than younger adults while musicianship is associated with increased sensitivity to spectral and temporal envelope, acoustic features that are typically less effective for stream segregation, particularly in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4296801324,"To assess the effect of continuous ketamine administration in patients admitted to medical and cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) and received mechanical ventilation support.We conducted a retrospective cohort study between March 2012 and June 2020 at an academy-affiliated tertiary hospital. Adult patients who received mechanical ventilation support for over 24 h and continuous ketamine infusion for at least 8 h were included. The primary outcome was immediate hemodynamic safety after continuous ketamine infusion. The secondary outcomes included immediate delirium, pain, and use of sedation.Of all 12,534 medical and cardiac ICU patients, 564 were eligible for the analysis. Ketamine was used for 33.3 (19.0-67.5) h and the median continuous infusion dose was 0.11 (0.06-0.23) mcg/kg/h. Of all patients, 469 (83.2%) received continuous ketamine infusion concomitant with analgosedation. Blood pressure and vasopressor inotropic scores did not change after continuous ketamine infusion. Heart rate decreased significantly from 106.9 (91.4-120.9) at 8 h before ketamine initiation to 99.8% (83.9-114.4) at 24 h after ketamine initiation. In addition, the respiratory rate decreased from 21.7 (18.6-25.4) at 8 h before ketamine initiation to 20.1 (17.0-23.0) at 24 h after ketamine initiation. Overall opioid usage was significantly reduced: 3.0 (0.0-6.0) mcg/kg/h as fentanyl equivalent dose at 8 h before ketamine initiation to 1.0 (0.0-4.1) mcg/kg/h as fentanyl equivalent dose at 24 h post-ketamine initiation. However, the use of sedatives and antipsychotic medications did not decrease. In addition, ketamine did not increase the incidence of delirium within 24 h after ketamine infusion.Ketamine may be a safe and feasible analgesic for medical and cardiac ICU patients who received mechanical ventilation support as an opioid-sparing agent without adverse hemodynamic effects."
https://openalex.org/W4296804104,"In recent years, new direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been approved, but hepatitis C continues to pose a threat to human health. It is important to develop neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies to prevent medical and accidental infection, such as might occur via liver transplantation of chronic HCV patients and needle-stick accidents in the clinic. In this study, we sought to obtain anti-HCV antibodies using phage display screening. Phages displaying human hepatocellular carcinoma patient-derived antibodies were screened by 4 rounds of biopanning with genotype-1b and -2a HCV envelope E2 protein adsorbed to magnetic beads. The three antibodies obtained from this screen had reactivity against E2 proteins derived from both genotype-1b and -2a strains. However, in epitope analysis, these antibodies did not recognize linear peptides from an overlapping E2 epitope peptide library, and did not bind to denatured E2 protein. In addition, these antibodies showed cross-genotypic neutralizing activity against genotype-1a, -1b, -2a, and -3a cell culture-generated infectious HCV particles (HCVcc). Moreover, emergence of viral escape mutants was not observed after repeated rounds of passaging of HCV-infected cells in the presence of one such antibody, e2d066. Furthermore, injection of the e2d066 antibody into human hepatocyte-transplanted immunodeficient mice inhibited infection by J6/JFH-1 HCVcc. In conclusion, we identified conformational epitope-recognizing, cross-genotypic neutralizing antibodies using phage display screening. Notably, e2d066 antibody did not select for escape mutant emergence in vitro and demonstrated neutralizing activity in vivo. Our results suggested that these antibodies may serve as prophylactic and therapeutic agents."
