Sustained elevation of basal body temperature is observed also during early pregnancy. These effects have been attributed to progesterone, but little is known about the mechanisms involved1. We have now found that the hormone affects the activity of the thermosensitive neurones in the preoptic area of the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1551478473,"Two in vivo assay procedures were used to study the inhibitory activity of cholesterol carried in three intestinal lymph and three serum lipoprotein fractions on the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. In the first preparation, different lipoproteins were injected intravenously as a bolus into rats at the mid-light phase of the diurnal light cycle, following which they were killed 12 hours later in the mid-dark phase of the cycle. Using this assay, three intestinal lymph lipoprotein fractions of varying Sf values all produced a similar degree of inhibition which averaged approximately 11%/mg of cholesterol injected. The serum lipoprotein fractions caused only about one-third this amount of inhibition. Detailed analysis of events occurring within the liver during this 12-hour assay period revealed that there were marked differences in the rate of net cholesterol uptake into the liver and in the rate of new removal of cholesterol esters from the liver following injection of each of these different lipoprotein fractions. The amount of inhibition of sterol synthesis produced by any fraction was proportional to the product of the incremental increase in hepatic cholesterol ester content and the time over which this increase in esters occurred. In the second type of assay where the lipoprotein fractions were administered to the animals as a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours the largest increase in hepatic cholesterol ester content and the greatest inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was found with intestinal lipoproteins having Sf values larger than 8000. Intestinal lipoprotein fractions with lower Sf values and all serum lipoprotein fractions were significantly less effective in bringing about an increase in hepatic cholesterol ester content and in producing inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by the liver. These studies emphasize the primary role of cholesterol carried in lipoproteins of intestinal origin in regulating hepatic sterol synthesis. The inhibitory activity of these fractions appears to correlate with the ability of these lipoproteins to bring about a maximal increase in hepatic cholesterol ester content which, in turn, appears to relate to the capacity of these fractions to transfer cholesterol rapidly into the hepatocyte while, at the same time, slowing the rate of cholesterol mobilization from the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1574327894,"Chloroplast DNAs (ctDNA) from pea and corn plants were examined in the electron microscope for the presence of replicative intermediates. Pea and corn ctDNAs were each found to contain two displacement loops (D-loops). The D-loops were 820 (+/- 90) base pairs long in pea ctDNA and 860 (+/- 125) base pairs long in corn ctDNA. In each ctDNA, the two D-loops were located at positions that were 7100 +/- 240) base pairs apart. The displacing strands of the two D-loops were located on opposite strands of the parental DNA molecule and they were seen to expand toward each other. The D-loops in the ctDNA from pea and corn exhibited branch migration and thus were easily distinguished from the denatured regions that were also present in these closed circular ctDNAs. In addition, the positions of the D-loops were found to be distinct from the positions of the denaturation loops (Den-loops). The Den-loops were also shown to be located at AT-rich regions in these ctDNA molecules. D-loops and Den-loops were also found in the circular and catenated ctDNA oligomers from pea and corn plants. Mapping the positions of the D-loops relative to the positions of the Den-loops showed that the structure of the D-loop-containing region in the pea and corn ctDNAs has been conserved to a greater extent than the structure of the rest of the two ctDNA molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1605425036,"Histone methylation in developing trout testis has been observed in the diploid stem cells and primary spermatocytes, which actively synthesize DNA and histones. In spermatids, histone methylation is minimal and so probably plays no role in the replacement of histones by protamine which is characteristic of this cell type. No turnover of histone methyl groups could be detected over several hours, so that unlike acetylation or phosphorylation of histones, methylation in this tissue appears to be a stable, irreversible modification. When histone H4, labeled with [14C]methyl groups, is separated on starch gels into acetylated and phosphorylated derivatives, [14C]methyl label does not appear in positions characteristic of newly synthesized histone H4, i.e. the highly acetylated (di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated), unphosphorylated species. [14C]Methyl label appears rather in the unphosphorylated, and unacetylated or monoacetylated species, shifting with time to the monophosphorylated form of histone H4. These data suggest a temporal sequence of events for histone H4: synthesis, then acetylation and deacetylation, followed by methylation and phosphorylation. Occurring late after histone synthesis and assembly into chromatin, histone methylation might then be necessary for histone interactions with other molecules (e.g. histone phosphokinase) prior to mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2158300746,"Previous studies have indicated that the ultraviolet endonuclease of bacteriophage T4 acts specifically at pyrimidine dimer sites in ultraviolet-irradiated DNA. At such sites the enzyme could conceivably catalyze endonucleolytic incision of the DNA either on the dimer-containing strand or on the strand directly opposite to the dimer. In the present work, a direct test of these alternatives was made. Substrate molecules containing one irradiated and one unirradiated strand were prepared from differentially isotopically labeled purified complementary strands of bacteriophage lambdaDNA. Following incubation with the enzyme, the sedimentation profiles of the DNA strands in alkaline sucrose density gradients were compared. The results show that the enzyme selectively nicks the irradiated strand."

The amount of mitochondria bound to the beads reaches a maximum where the length of the alkyl groups covalently linked to the beads exceeds eight carbons. Mitochondria immobilized on the beads and placed in a flow system exhibit normal: (a) respiratory control, (b) phosphate to oxygen ratio, (c) uncoupling by 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and (d) inhibition by cyanide, azide, rotenone, oligomycin, and antimycin. Reversibility of the effects of 2,4-dinitrophenol, cyanide, and azide was rapid and complete. Inhibition by rotenone, oligomycin was essentially irreversible. Mitochondria have been maintained in a viable state on the beads at 27 degrees for periods up to 4 hours. The use of immobilized organelles appears to offer a new technique for the study of membrane-bound particles whereby substances can be rapidly added and removed while monitoring the composition of solution flowing over the particles."

https://openalex.org/W1485681622,"The effect of various galactose derivatives, substituted at C-6, on the phosphoenolpyruvate:beta-galactoside phosphotransferase system of Staphylococcus aureus was studied. Cells were grown by an improved procedure, which resulted in a 5- to 10-fold increase in cell yield. The four protein components of the system were separated. A membrane fraction containing negligible levels of the soluble components was prepared by alternate cycles of sonic treatment and differential centrifugation. The in vitro system reconstituted from these fractions was used to test the ability of the galactose derivatives to inhibit the phosphorylation of lactose analogs, under conditions where the membrane-bound component, Enzyme IIlac, was rate limiting. Derivaites in which the hydroxyl group of C-6 was missing, or replaced by a fluoro, O-methyl, or carboxyl group had no affinity for Enzyme IIlac, as judged by their inability to inhibit phosphorylation. Surprisingly, derivatives containing arylsulfonyl groups at C-6 were potent inhibitors; the O-tosyl compound has an apparent affinity five times that of galactose. The arylsulfonyl substitution in an absolute requirement; neither O-benzyl or O-methanesulfonyl derivatives were inhibitory. The specificity of the inhibition by tosyl derivatives parallels that of unsubstituted substrates; tosyl galactosides of the beta configuration were inhibitory, but those of the alpha configuration were not. The tosyl derivatives also strongly inhibited the uptake of lactose analogs into whole cells; the requirement for the arylsulfonyl moiety was again observed. The chemical analogy between the tosyl galactosides and possible intermediates in the transport-phosphorylation step catalyzed by Enzyme IIlac provides a possible explanation for the unexpected properties of these derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W1582759924,"A high molecular weight heteropolysaccharide, composed of glucose, glucuronic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose in an approximate molar ratio of 1:2:2:5, respectively, was isolated from phage K-2 and from the soluble fraction of phage-infected Aerobacter aerogenes lysates. Treatment of pure phage with 8 M urea at 4 degrees quantitatively solubilizes the bound polysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide (Yurewicz, E.C., Ghalambor, M.A., Duckworth, D.H., and Heath, E.C. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5607-5616) with the release of only traces of other phage constituents; on this basis, it was concluded that the polysaccharide, like the the glycanohydrolase, is externally localized in the phage structure. Phage polysaccharide and glycanohydrolase fractionate similarly on ion exchange resins and gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, but each may be purified to homogeneity by the procedures employed. The biosynthesis of the polysaccharide was shown to be uniquely dependent upon phage K-2 infection by: (a) absence of the polysaccharide in cells, the culture filtrate, or sonicated extracts of uninfected cells; (b) kinetics of polysaccharide synthesis following phage infection; and (c) isotopic double-labeling experiments that demonstrated the synthesis of polysaccharide only after initiation of phage replication in infected cells."
