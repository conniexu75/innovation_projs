It is relatively simple to obtain and can be measured concurrently with behavior of interest to the experimenter. The technique described requires a grid floor, but the assessment procedure does not affect the organism's state because of the subthreshold measuring current that is used. This method in no way restrains the rat and can therefore be used in an unlimited number of experimental situations."

This is attributed to a feeling of village solidarity, which is even maintained in the greater Istanbul area. It is questionable whether this phenomenon in underdeveloped countries is detrimental to socioeconomic development, as is generally believed to be the case."

Three of the components show quantitative differences markedly correlated with the synchronized division of the microspores contained within the anthers. One of the components increases in amount before mitosis and disappears at mitosis; two of the components have peak values at the time of mitosis and decrease thereafter; a fourth component remains relatively constant in amount throughout.

https://openalex.org/W2046682537,"Over the past three centuries, the application of mathematics to physics has produced some of the deepest insights into the nature of the universe and into the limitations of human knowledge. Recent indications are that similar insights may come of the application of mathematics to engineering. This article is an account of the field in which this seems to be happening. It surveys the main results of information theory, and of related theories, from the point of view which is likely to become useful in this connection. This article was written originally for the audience of Science, a publication chiefly for persons of nonengineering background. It is reprinted here at the suggestion of the Editor of these TRANSACTIONS, in the hope that it will be diverting, and perhaps also instructive, to an audience of engineers."
